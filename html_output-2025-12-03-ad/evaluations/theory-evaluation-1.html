            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Reflexion agent uses verbal reinforcement learning combined with episodic memory storing self-reflective feedback, leading to improved decision-making and task performance in text-based games, outperforming traditional fine-tuning methods by 20%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-13.html#e13.0" class="evidence-link">[e13.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-18.html#e18.0" class="evidence-link">[e18.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MUSE framework integrates verbal reinforcement learning with episodic memory buffers storing self-reflections, achieving 90% success on novel ALFWorld tasks and outperforming baseline agents, demonstrating rapid adaptation without traditional gradient updates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-17.html#e17.0" class="evidence-link">[e17.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ARMAP framework uses verbal reinforcement learning with episodic memory storing verbal feedback, improving task performance across multiple environments and outperforming traditional gradient-based fine-tuning methods. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Sweet&Sour reflection method uses verbal reinforcement learning with episodic memory of positive and negative experiences, improving decision-making and adaptability in complex text environments, outperforming Reflexion and traditional methods. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MetaReflection employs verbal reinforcement learning with episodic and semantic memory storing self-reflective feedback, achieving high accuracy in vulnerability detection tasks and outperforming traditional prompt optimization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-12.html#e12.0" class="evidence-link">[e12.0]</a> </li>
    <li>REMEMBERER integrates persistent experience memory with reinforcement learning, improving adaptability and robustness in sequential decision-making tasks, consistent with verbal reinforcement learning benefits. <a href="../results/extraction-result-18.html#e18.1" class="evidence-link">[e18.1]</a> </li>
    <li>SA-RL combines reinforcement learning with LLM suggestions and episodic memory storing reflections, improving diagnostic accuracy and adaptability in text-based environments. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.0" class="evidence-link">[e19.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM-MARL framework uses episodic memory for recall and adaptation in multi-agent reinforcement learning, improving coordination and long-term planning, with strong zero-shot generalization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.0" class="evidence-link">[e16.0]</a> </li>
    <li>AEC architecture integrates episodic memory and working memory with LLMs, improving sample efficiency and generalization in complex multi-step text tasks, supporting the role of episodic memory in enhancing LLM agent adaptation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-14.html#e14.0" class="evidence-link">[e14.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Interaction Manager uses working memory and knowledge graph (episodic and semantic memory) with LLMs to improve personalized interactions and task performance, supporting memory's role but extending beyond episodic memory alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.0" class="evidence-link">[e11.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DA-RL agent uses episodic memory with LLM assistance to improve decision-making in diagnostic text tasks, but lacks explicit comparison of verbal reinforcement learning versus fine-tuning, partially supporting the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AEC notes increased computational overhead and reduced time efficiency compared to traditional RL methods, suggesting a trade-off not fully addressed in the original theory regarding efficiency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-14.html#e14.0" class="evidence-link">[e14.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Sweet&Sour reflection method highlights that LLMs do not guarantee reasoning capabilities and that evaluation is limited to a single environment, indicating potential limitations in generalization and reasoning not fully accounted for in the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Several agents (e.g., AEC, Interaction Manager) use larger episodic memory capacities (up to hundreds or thousands of experiences) and incorporate additional memory types like working memory and semantic knowledge, suggesting the theory could be expanded beyond strict 1-3 experience limits and include hybrid memory systems. <a href="../results/extraction-result-14.html#e14.0" class="evidence-link">[e14.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.0" class="evidence-link">[e11.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.0" class="evidence-link">[e16.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Evidence from MetaReflection and Sweet&Sour suggests that incorporating structured or summarized self-reflections and positive reinforcement improves memory efficiency and agent adaptation, supporting the theory's prediction but suggesting more emphasis on memory management strategies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-12.html#e12.0" class="evidence-link">[e12.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple studies show strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities with episodic memory and verbal reinforcement learning, supporting but also extending the theory's scope regarding generalization to novel domains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.0" class="evidence-link">[e16.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-17.html#e17.0" class="evidence-link">[e17.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Expand the theory's statement on memory capacity to reflect that episodic memory buffers can be larger than 1-3 experiences, especially when combined with working or semantic memory modules, enabled by advances in memory management and LLM context window extensions.</li>
                <li>Incorporate the role of structured and summarized self-reflections, including positive reinforcement, as key factors enhancing memory efficiency and agent adaptation.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge computational overhead and efficiency trade-offs as limitations of verbal reinforcement learning with episodic memory compared to traditional RL methods.</li>
                <li>Broaden the theory to include hybrid memory architectures (episodic, working, semantic) that improve agent adaptability and generalization beyond purely episodic memory buffers.</li>
                <li>Highlight the demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot learning capabilities enabled by verbal reinforcement learning combined with episodic memory in diverse and complex tasks.</li>
