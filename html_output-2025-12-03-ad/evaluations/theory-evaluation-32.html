                <p><strong>Overall Support or Contradict Explanation:</strong> The evidence strongly supports the Task-Aligned Abstraction Principle across diverse domains, with consistent performance improvements (5-18 percentage points in many cases) and efficiency gains (20-80% resource reductions) when task-aligned mechanisms are properly implemented. However, the evidence also reveals important boundary conditions (benefits diminish at very high capacity, uniform baselines competitive in some settings) and implementation requirements (token-space/attention-based mechanisms outperform naive parameter duplication, static allocation can match dynamic when task structure is known) that should refine rather than contradict the core principle.</p>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Dynamic task-aligned mechanisms consistently outperform uniform baselines across multiple domains with substantial margins: CEAF improves F1 by 4-5 points over BERT-BiLSTM-CRF on Chinese NER (e.g., Toutiao 90.4% vs 85.2%), MTAGCN achieves near-perfect accuracy (100% on CRB/HUSTbearing, 99.5% on MCC5-THU) vs baselines at 96-99%, IMTL-LP converges faster with lower error than SINGLE baseline, SCDEM achieves 97.16% vs 94.77% average in continual learning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2234.html#e2234.0" class="evidence-link">[e2234.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.0" class="evidence-link">[e2239.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Adaptive attention mechanisms demonstrate measurable benefits across diverse tasks: ASAC improves Triangles accuracy from 78.66% to 96.71% (18 point gain), MIA-Mind shows consistent improvements across classification, segmentation, and anomaly detection, DCAM and AFFN modules each contribute 1-2 point F1 improvements in CEAF ablations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2231.html#e2231.0" class="evidence-link">[e2231.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2229.html#e2229.0" class="evidence-link">[e2229.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.2" class="evidence-link">[e2240.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.3" class="evidence-link">[e2240.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Dynamic computation allocation achieves strong efficiency-performance trade-offs: SkipGPT-RT retains >90% performance at 25% parameter reduction and >80% at 40% reduction, AS-NeRF improves PSNR by +1.4 to +5.4 dB over baselines while claiming efficiency gains, ScaleZero's MoE backbone prevents plasticity collapse (maintains low dormant neuron ratio) while matching/exceeding single-task performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2241.html#e2241.0" class="evidence-link">[e2241.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2241.html#e2241.1" class="evidence-link">[e2241.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2236.html#e2236.0" class="evidence-link">[e2236.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2236.html#e2236.2" class="evidence-link">[e2236.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.2" class="evidence-link">[e2232.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-specific modular decomposition improves multi-task learning substantially: TSAC achieves ~3× sample efficiency vs uniform MT-SAC (reaching at 300k steps what MT-SAC needs 1M steps for), NMT-Net reduces mean RMSE and dramatically reduces variance (e.g., DF: 16.10±0.21 vs TAG 19.12±3.33), DTME-MTL improves multi-task metrics by 4.67% on Taskonomy with only 0.2-0.3% parameter increase. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.0" class="evidence-link">[e2243.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2244.html#e2244.0" class="evidence-link">[e2244.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-aligned approaches show particularly strong advantages under resource constraints: IMTL-LP shows largest gains at low capacity (800 params) with advantages shrinking at high capacity (5200 params), TA-LoRA uses only 0.1857% of full fine-tuning parameters while matching/exceeding performance, DPS achieves comparable performance with ~20% fewer environment interactions (80% of baseline steps). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.0" class="evidence-link">[e2239.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2238.html#e2238.0" class="evidence-link">[e2238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Adaptive task vectors and prompts improve generalization to unseen tasks: ATV achieves 63.4% on unseen tasks vs 52.0% for static LoRA (11.4 point gain), TA-LoRA outperforms vanilla prompt tuning by ~13.6% on unseen data and ~11.4% on unseen tasks, demonstrating that input-conditioned task-aligned representations generalize better than fixed adaptations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2237.html#e2237.0" class="evidence-link">[e2237.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2238.html#e2238.0" class="evidence-link">[e2238.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Hierarchical combinations of task-aligned mechanisms show synergistic benefits: CEAF's combination of capsules (optimal at 32), DCAM, and AFFN outperforms individual components with each contributing measurable gains in ablations, ScaleZero's MoE + DPS combination prevents collapse while enabling efficient capacity expansion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.1" class="evidence-link">[e2240.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.2" class="evidence-link">[e2240.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.3" class="evidence-link">[e2240.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Token-space and attention-based task-alignment outperforms naive parameter duplication: DTME-MTL's token modulation/expansion achieves better multi-task performance with 0.2-0.3% parameter increase vs Recon's 3.34% increase with worse performance, demonstrating that the mechanism of task-alignment is critical. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.1" class="evidence-link">[e2235.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Static task-aligned allocation can match or exceed dynamic allocation when task structure is well-understood: MTL-DoHTA's precomputed feature-importance attention (F1=0.9905) outperformed learned dynamic attention, suggesting task-alignment benefits don't always require dynamic mechanisms and that static allocation may be preferable for computational efficiency in stable task settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.0" class="evidence-link">[e2245.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.2" class="evidence-link">[e2245.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.6" class="evidence-link">[e2245.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-aligned mechanisms show non-monotonic capacity relationships requiring careful tuning: Capsule networks achieve optimal performance at 32 capsules with degradation at 64 and 128, IMTL-LP advantages diminish at very high capacity, indicating task-aligned abstraction requires appropriate capacity matching rather than simply 'more is better'. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.1" class="evidence-link">[e2240.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.0" class="evidence-link">[e2239.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Basic adaptive sharing mechanisms (cross-stitch, soft modularization) demonstrate benefits but are outperformed by more sophisticated task-aligned methods, suggesting adaptive allocation is beneficial but implementation sophistication matters significantly. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2233.html#e2233.0" class="evidence-link">[e2233.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.3" class="evidence-link">[e2243.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.6" class="evidence-link">[e2239.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Large uniform foundation models show strong performance that may reflect implicit task-alignment: GPT-3, CLIP, and other large models demonstrate strong zero-shot transfer with nominally uniform architectures, though the theory notes these may implement task-aligned abstraction implicitly through learned attention patterns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2237.html#e2237.5" class="evidence-link">[e2237.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Naive task-specific parameter branching can severely harm performance: Recon's conversion of shared parameters to task-specific branches led to worse multi-task performance (e.g., NYUD-v2 Semseg 31.92 vs DTME-MTL 38.27) and overfitting despite 3.34% parameter increase, demonstrating that task-specific allocation without proper regularization is counterproductive. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.1" class="evidence-link">[e2235.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Dynamic expert allocation failed catastrophically in multi-domain continual learning: MoE-2E/1R achieved only 26.7-31.22% average accuracy despite high last-task performance (76-92%), showing that dynamic expert routing can fail to maintain knowledge across heterogeneous domain sequences, contradicting the theory's prediction of improved multi-task retention. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Uniform baselines remain highly competitive in many settings: 2D-CNN baseline achieves F1≈0.987-0.988 (only ~0.002 below best MTL-DoHTA), BERT-based baselines remain strong in cleaner NER domains, and some single-task methods match multi-task approaches, suggesting uniform representations are sufficient for certain task distributions and that task-aligned benefits may be smaller than theory suggests in some domains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.3" class="evidence-link">[e2245.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.4" class="evidence-link">[e2240.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational overhead can be substantial and limit practical deployment: CEAF requires ~24GB memory with higher inference latency than lightweight alternatives, MoE methods use 21GB GPU memory with slower iteration (1.93 it/s vs 4.71 it/s for SCDEM), and dynamic mechanisms add training complexity, challenging the theory's emphasis on efficiency gains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Benefits of task-aligned abstraction diminish or disappear at very high capacity: IMTL-LP capacity ablation shows advantages shrink from large at 800 params to small at 5200 params, suggesting the theory's predictions are most relevant under resource constraints rather than being universal principles. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.0" class="evidence-link">[e2239.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some task-aligned mechanisms underperform simpler baselines: learned dynamic attention in MTL-DoHTA performed worse than both static attention and baseline, MoE continual learning showed poor average retention, indicating that not all implementations of task-aligned abstraction improve performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.6" class="evidence-link">[e2245.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Static vs dynamic allocation distinction is critical: MTL-DoHTA's static attention outperforming learned dynamic attention, combined with computational overhead concerns across multiple papers, suggests the theory should explicitly distinguish between static task-aligned allocation (precomputed, fixed) and dynamic (input-conditioned), with clear guidance on when each is appropriate based on task stability, computational constraints, and whether task structure is well-understood. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.0" class="evidence-link">[e2245.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.2" class="evidence-link">[e2245.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.6" class="evidence-link">[e2245.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Implementation mechanism is as important as the principle: Token-space adaptation (DTME-MTL) dramatically outperforms parameter-space branching (Recon) despite both being 'task-aligned', discrete abstractions (ASAC) show different trade-offs than continuous attention, and hierarchical combinations show synergies, indicating the theory should specify that HOW task-alignment is implemented is as critical as WHETHER it is implemented. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.1" class="evidence-link">[e2235.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2231.html#e2231.0" class="evidence-link">[e2231.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Boundary conditions need precise quantification: Evidence shows benefits are most pronounced with heterogeneous tasks (TSAC, ScaleZero), constrained resources (IMTL-LP, TA-LoRA), and limited capacity, but diminish with homogeneous tasks (uniform baselines competitive), abundant resources, and very high capacity, suggesting the theory should explicitly state when task-aligned abstraction provides substantial benefits (>10% improvement) vs marginal benefits (<5%) vs no benefits. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.0" class="evidence-link">[e2239.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.3" class="evidence-link">[e2245.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.0" class="evidence-link">[e2243.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Implicit vs explicit task-alignment blurs the distinction: Large uniform models may implement task-aligned abstraction through learned attention (transformers), internal routing (foundation models), or emergent specialization, making the 'uniform' vs 'task-aligned' dichotomy less clear-cut than the theory presents and suggesting a spectrum rather than binary classification. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2237.html#e2237.5" class="evidence-link">[e2237.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2241.html#e2241.0" class="evidence-link">[e2241.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2231.html#e2231.0" class="evidence-link">[e2231.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Failure modes and risks need explicit treatment: Naive parameter duplication causes overfitting (Recon), excessive capacity in adaptive mechanisms harms generalization (capsule ablation), poorly designed dynamic allocation underperforms static allocation (MTL-DoHTA), and some dynamic methods fail catastrophically (MoE continual learning), indicating the theory should include explicit failure modes and design principles to avoid them. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.1" class="evidence-link">[e2235.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.1" class="evidence-link">[e2240.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.6" class="evidence-link">[e2245.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Task heterogeneity and similarity are critical moderating factors: Benefits are largest with conflicting gradients (TSAC, ScaleZero), heterogeneous domains (SCDEM), and diverse task families, but smaller with related tasks or clean domains, suggesting the theory should include task heterogeneity as a key variable determining benefit magnitude. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.0" class="evidence-link">[e2243.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.3" class="evidence-link">[e2245.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational trade-offs require explicit cost-benefit analysis: Multiple papers report substantial overhead (memory, latency, training complexity) that may not be justified for marginal gains, suggesting the theory should provide decision criteria for when overhead is justified (e.g., >10% performance gain, critical resource constraints, continual learning requirements) vs when simpler approaches suffice. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.2" class="evidence-link">[e2245.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add explicit distinction between static task-aligned allocation (precomputed weights, fixed routing based on task analysis) and dynamic task-aligned allocation (input-conditioned, adaptive). Specify that static allocation is preferable when: (a) task structure is well-understood, (b) computational efficiency is critical, (c) tasks are stable over time. Dynamic allocation is preferable when: (a) tasks are non-stationary, (b) input heterogeneity is high, (c) sufficient computational resources are available.</li>
                <li>Strengthen statements about implementation mechanisms: specify that token-space adaptation, attention-based reweighting, and modular composition with proper regularization show superior efficiency/performance profiles compared to naive parameter duplication. Add that the mechanism of task-alignment is as critical as the principle itself, with poor implementations potentially harming performance.</li>
                <li>Quantify boundary conditions precisely with performance thresholds: benefits are substantial (>10% improvement) when (a) tasks have conflicting gradients or heterogeneous domains, (b) computational resources or model capacity are constrained (<5000 params in IMTL-LP experiments), (c) task distributions are non-stationary, (d) sample efficiency is critical. Benefits are marginal (<5% improvement) when tasks are homogeneous, capacity is very high, or task structure is simple. Benefits may be negative if implementation is naive (parameter duplication without regularization).</li>
                <li>Acknowledge implicit task-alignment in nominally uniform models: large foundation models and transformers may implement task-aligned abstraction implicitly through learned attention patterns, internal routing, and emergent specialization. Revise theory to present a spectrum from 'fully uniform' to 'explicitly task-aligned' rather than a binary distinction, with most practical systems falling somewhere in between.</li>
                <li>Add explicit failure modes and design principles: (1) Naive parameter duplication without regularization causes overfitting, (2) Excessive capacity in adaptive mechanisms can harm generalization, (3) Poorly designed dynamic allocation can underperform well-tuned static allocation, (4) Dynamic expert routing can fail in multi-domain continual learning with large domain shifts. Include design principles: use token-space or attention-based mechanisms over parameter branching, match capacity to task complexity, validate that dynamic mechanisms outperform static baselines before deployment.</li>
                <li>Expand computational trade-off analysis with decision criteria: Dynamic mechanisms incur overhead in parameters (0.2-3.34% increases observed), memory (up to 21GB GPU for MoE), inference time (13.4% overhead for DTME-MTL), and training complexity. Specify when overhead is justified: (a) performance gains >10%, (b) critical resource constraints where efficiency matters, (c) continual learning or non-stationary tasks, (d) heterogeneous task distributions. When gains are <5% or tasks are stable and homogeneous, simpler uniform or static approaches may be preferable.</li>
                <li>Add task heterogeneity as a key moderating variable: Include explicit statements that benefit magnitude scales with task heterogeneity, measured by gradient conflict, domain diversity, or task similarity. Provide guidance: high heterogeneity (e.g., pixel games + text games + continuous control) → large benefits; moderate heterogeneity (e.g., related NLP tasks) → moderate benefits; low heterogeneity (e.g., similar classification tasks) → small benefits where uniform approaches may suffice.</li>
                <li>Emphasize compositional and hierarchical approaches as best practices: Evidence shows synergistic benefits from combining multiple task-aligned mechanisms at different levels (attention + modular experts + adaptive computation in ScaleZero, capsules + DCAM + AFFN in CEAF). Recommend layered task-alignment strategies rather than single-mechanism approaches, with proper ablation studies to validate each component's contribution.</li>
