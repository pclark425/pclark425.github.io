            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LGP experiments (e1957.0) demonstrate that bloat occurs even with perfectly unbiased add/remove operators (50%/50% rates), with program size consistently growing during evolution. This directly supports the theory's statement that 'bloat serves a functional role' and that 'the rate of movement along each edge of the triangle is asymmetric' - specifically that it is 'faster to gain bloat (quadratic growth) than to lose it.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.0" class="evidence-link">[e1957.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO (e1961.0) demonstrates an explicit diversity-fitness trade-off where semantic-aware LLM operators achieve higher fitness and faster convergence but population diversity decreases over generations, while conventional GATree maintains constant diversity but converges more slowly. This directly supports the theory's core triangle constraint that 'optimizing any two vertices of this triangle necessarily constrains the third.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.1" class="evidence-link">[e1961.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LGP theoretical analysis (e1957.0) provides a formal mechanistic explanation for bloat: adding instructions is more likely to reduce editing distance to optimal solutions than removing instructions, creating an asymmetry that favors program growth. This supports the theory's statement that 'bloat serves a functional role in maintaining diversity by providing neutral genetic material that buffers against destructive crossover operations.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.0" class="evidence-link">[e1957.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO hyperparameter experiments (e1961.0) quantify explicit trade-offs: increasing α (fitness target) improves offspring fitness up to α≈0.1 but further increases reduce both fitness and diversity; lower τ (mutation temperature) increases diversity at the cost of sampling lower-fitness offspring; higher arity (ν=4) improves fitness but reduces diversity. These quantified trade-offs directly support the triangle's prediction of constrained optimization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SoT-GP (e1944.0) uses activation-flag 'introns' that preserve inactive tasks in the genotype while keeping phenotype simple, explicitly trading genotypic 'bloat' for robustness and diversity. The paper states this mechanism 'reduces premature convergence' by protecting potentially useful genetic material, directly supporting the theory's claim that 'bloat serves a functional role' and creates 'a positive feedback loop where bloat enables diversity which justifies bloat.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1944.html#e1944.0" class="evidence-link">[e1944.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DeQompile (e1959.0) demonstrates an executability-bloat trade-off: the system disables deletion mutations to preserve syntactic validity/executability, but the authors explicitly note this 'may exacerbate bloat.' This supports the theory's statement that 'high executability with low bloat forces low diversity' and that maintaining executability can require accepting bloat. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1959.html#e1959.0" class="evidence-link">[e1959.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO (e1961.0) shows temporal dynamics consistent with the theory: diversity decreases over 25 generations while fitness increases, and the paper reports that 'it is faster to lose diversity (1-10 generations) than to gain them (10-100+ generations)' as populations converge, supporting the theory's asymmetric temporal dynamics predictions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>RGP (e1937.0) uses parsimony pressure (c2*|ψ|) and maximum tree depth to control bloat while maintaining planner performance, qualitatively discussing trade-offs between complexity, diversity, and functional performance. However, the paper does not provide quantified measurements of the three-way trade-off dynamics over time, only design-level acknowledgment of the tensions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1937.html#e1937.0" class="evidence-link">[e1937.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DEAP-codegen-GA (e1940.0) uses fitness penalties on program size (10-150 line constraints) and strong compilation penalties (-5 for non-compilation) to constrain size and favor executability, implying design-level trade-offs. However, no quantified empirical measurements of bloat growth, diversity metrics, or executability rates over generations are provided. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1940.html#e1940.0" class="evidence-link">[e1940.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Freemut step-size experiments (e1957.1) show that larger mutation step sizes (mutating u instructions) increase convergence speed up to u≈9 but show diminishing returns for larger u, suggesting a trade-off between exploration efficiency and stability. This partially supports the theory's claims about mutation affecting the bloat-diversity edge, though the experiments don't directly measure all three triangle dimensions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.1" class="evidence-link">[e1957.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLEGO (e1961.0) reports approximately 86% crossover offspring validity and 88% mutation offspring validity using LLM-based semantic operators. These correspond to only 14% and 12% failure rates respectively, which strongly contradicts the theory's prediction of '50-90% failure rates' for crossover in producing executable offspring. The theory states 'crossover primarily affects the diversity-executability edge (with 50-90% failure rates in producing executable offspring)' but LLEGO's semantic-aware crossover achieves 86% validity, far exceeding this prediction. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLEGO (e1961.0) demonstrates that semantic-aware operators can simultaneously maintain high executability (86-88% valid offspring) and achieve good fitness convergence, though diversity still decreases as predicted. This partially contradicts the theory's strong triangle constraint by showing that two vertices (executability and fitness/quality) can be simultaneously optimized more effectively than the theory predicts for 'standard genetic operators,' though the diversity trade-off remains. The theory may underestimate the degree of relaxation achievable with advanced semantic operators. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLEGO (e1961.0) achieves 86-88% offspring validity with LLM-based semantic operators, far exceeding the theory's predicted 50-90% crossover failure rates. The theory should be modified to distinguish more clearly between conventional structural operators (which may indeed have 50-90% failure rates) and semantic-aware operators, providing specific predictions for different operator types: conventional crossover (10-50% validity), grammar-based (60-75% validity), type-based (70-85% validity), and LLM-based semantic operators (80-90% validity). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The LGP theoretical framework (e1957.0) provides a formal mathematical foundation based on editing distance and fitness supremums, showing that fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance and that adding instructions is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing. The theory should incorporate this formal framework to provide mathematical grounding for when and why bloat accumulates, strengthening the mechanistic explanations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.0" class="evidence-link">[e1957.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO (e1961.0) introduces controllable hyperparameters (α for fitness targeting, τ for diversity control, ν for arity) that enable explicit, dynamic navigation of the triangle with quantified effects. The theory should be expanded to include predictions about how such hyperparameters enable controlled traversal of the triangle and whether they fundamentally relax constraints or merely enable faster/controlled movement between vertices. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1961.html#e1961.0" class="evidence-link">[e1961.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple systems use different parsimony mechanisms: DeQompile (e1959.0) uses AST node-count penalties with deletion disabled, DEAP-codegen-GA (e1940.0) uses line-count fitness penalties, and RGP (e1937.0) uses additive size penalties with max-depth limits. The theory should provide more specific predictions about how different parsimony mechanisms (penalties vs. hard limits, with/without deletion, node-count vs. depth-based) interact differently with the triangle constraint. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1959.html#e1959.0" class="evidence-link">[e1959.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1940.html#e1940.0" class="evidence-link">[e1940.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1937.html#e1937.0" class="evidence-link">[e1937.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SoT-GP (e1944.0) uses a structured/array-like representation with activation flags rather than traditional tree-based GP, showing that intron-like mechanisms can work in non-tree representations. The theory's representation-dependence claims should be expanded to explicitly include structured/array representations and provide predictions about how activation flags, Boolean switches, and modular structures create different triangle geometries than tree or linear representations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1944.html#e1944.0" class="evidence-link">[e1944.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Freemut step-size experiments (e1957.1) show that mutating multiple instructions simultaneously (u=3,5,7,9) accelerates convergence compared to single-instruction mutations (u=1), with optimal performance around u=9 before diminishing returns. The theory should incorporate predictions about how mutation granularity (single-site vs. multi-site mutations) affects triangle navigation speed and whether multi-site mutations enable qualitatively different trade-off patterns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1957.html#e1957.1" class="evidence-link">[e1957.1]</a> </li>
    <li>DeQompile (e1959.0) demonstrates an explainability-efficiency trade-off in quantum circuit decompilation: undecomposed (human-readable) circuits are easier to decompile (higher fitness) while decomposed (hardware-efficient) circuits are harder to decompile. This suggests the triangle may have domain-specific manifestations where 'executability' has multiple facets (syntactic validity, hardware efficiency, human readability) that themselves trade off, potentially creating a higher-dimensional constraint space. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1959.html#e1959.0" class="evidence-link">[e1959.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Revise the crossover failure rate prediction from '50-90% failure rates' to explicitly distinguish operator types: 'Conventional structural crossover exhibits 50-90% failure rates (10-50% validity), while semantic-aware operators achieve substantially higher validity: grammar-based operators 60-75%, type-based operators 70-85%, and LLM-based semantic operators 80-90%. The triangle constraint applies to all operator types but with different geometries and feasible regions.'</li>
                <li>Add a new theory statement: 'Controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets, diversity temperatures, selection pressures) enable dynamic navigation of the triangle, allowing populations to traverse between vertices more rapidly or oscillate in controlled patterns. However, these parameters do not eliminate the fundamental constraint - they enable controlled movement within the constraint space rather than stable occupation of the triangle's center.'</li>
                <li>Incorporate the formal editing-distance framework: 'The bloat accumulation mechanism can be formalized through editing distance to optimal solutions: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance, and adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing components (due to asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ), creating a fundamental asymmetry that favors program growth even with unbiased operators.'</li>
                <li>Expand representation-dependence to include structured representations: 'The triangle geometry is representation-dependent: tree-based representations exhibit strong bloat through subtree growth, linear representations show different growth patterns (potentially linear vs. quadratic), and structured/array-like representations with activation flags can separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity, creating a two-layer triangle dynamic.'</li>
                <li>Refine parsimony pressure predictions: 'Different parsimony mechanisms interact differently with the triangle: additive size penalties shift populations toward low-bloat vertices but can be overcome by fitness pressure; hard size limits (max depth, max length) create bounded feasible regions; disabling deletion to preserve executability creates a conflict that prevents reaching low-bloat vertices; node-count penalties are more effective than depth penalties for controlling actual bloat.'</li>
                <li>Add semantic-operator classification: 'Semantic-aware operators partially relax the triangle constraint with varying degrees of effectiveness: grammar-based operators (weak relaxation, ~60-75% executability), type-based operators (moderate relaxation, ~70-85% executability), and LLM-based/learned semantic priors (strong relaxation, ~80-90% executability). However, all semantic operators still exhibit diversity-fitness trade-offs, confirming the triangle constraint persists in modified form.'</li>
                <li>Add mutation granularity statement: 'Mutation granularity affects triangle navigation: single-site mutations maintain local search characteristics with slower convergence; multi-site mutations (mutating k>1 components simultaneously) increase constructive move probability and accelerate convergence up to an optimal k (problem-dependent, typically k≈5-10 for linear GP), beyond which truncation effects and instability reduce effectiveness.'</li>

This suggests the triangle may have domain-specific manifestations where 'executability' has multiple facets (syntactic validity, hardware efficiency, human readability) that themselves trade off, potentially creating a higher-dimensional constraint space.",

        "Revise the crossover failure rate prediction from '50-90% failure rates' to explicitly distinguish operator types: 'Conventional structural crossover exhibits 50-90% failure rates (10-50% validity), while semantic-aware operators achieve substantially higher validity: grammar-based operators 60-75%, type-based operators 70-85%, and LLM-based semantic operators 80-90%. The triangle constraint applies to all operator types but with different geometries and feasible regions.'",
        "Add a new theory statement: 'Controllable hyperparameters (fitness targets, diversity temperatures, selection pressures) enable dynamic navigation of the triangle, allowing populations to traverse between vertices more rapidly or oscillate in controlled patterns. However, these parameters do not eliminate the fundamental constraint - they enable controlled movement within the constraint space rather than stable occupation of the triangle's center.'",
        "Incorporate the formal editing-distance framework: 'The bloat accumulation mechanism can be formalized through editing distance to optimal solutions: fitness supremum grows linearly with editing distance, and adding components is combinatorially more likely to reduce distance than removing components (due to asymmetric neutral bloating factors Ω and Λ), creating a fundamental asymmetry that favors program growth even with unbiased operators.'",
        "Expand representation-dependence to include structured representations: 'The triangle geometry is representation-dependent: tree-based representations exhibit strong bloat through subtree growth, linear representations show different growth patterns (potentially linear vs. quadratic), and structured/array-like representations with activation flags can separate genotypic bloat from phenotypic complexity, creating a two-layer triangle dynamic.'",
        "Refine parsimony pressure predictions: 'Different parsimony mechanisms interact differently with the triangle: additive size penalties shift populations toward low-bloat vertices but can be overcome by fitness pressure; hard size limits (max depth, max length) create bounded feasible regions; disabling deletion to preserve executability creates a conflict that prevents reaching low-bloat vertices; node-count penalties are more effective than depth penalties for controlling actual bloat.'",
        "Add semantic-operator classification: 'Semantic-aware operators partially relax the triangle constraint with varying degrees of effectiveness: grammar-based operators (weak relaxation, ~60-75% executability), type-based operators (moderate relaxation, ~70-85% executability), and LLM-based/learned semantic priors (strong relaxation, ~80-90% executability). However, all semantic operators still exhibit diversity-fitness trade-offs, confirming the triangle constraint persists in modified form.'",
        "Add mutation granularity statement: 'Mutation granularity affects triangle navigation: single-site mutations maintain local search characteristics with slower convergence; multi-site mutations (mutating k&gt;1 components simultaneously) increase constructive move probability and accelerate convergence up to an optimal k (problem-dependent, typically k≈5-10 for linear GP), beyond which truncation effects and instability reduce effectiveness.'"

While semantic-aware operators (especially LLM-based) achieve substantially better executability than the theory's predicted ranges for conventional operators, they still exhibit fundamental trade-offs (diversity decreases as fitness increases), confirming the triangle constraint exists but can be partially relaxed by advanced operators.",
