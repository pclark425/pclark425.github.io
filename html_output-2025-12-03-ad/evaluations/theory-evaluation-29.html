                <p><strong>Overall Support or Contradict:</strong> support</p>
                <p><strong>Overall Support or Contradict Explanation:</strong> The new evidence strongly supports the theory's core claims with extensive documentation of fabrication behaviors, quantifiable validation gaps (0.2-6.1% success rates), concrete simulation failures, and domain-specific requirements. While some evidence suggests the gap is more addressable through hybrid approaches than initially implied, this refines rather than contradicts the theory.</p>

    <li>LLM-based auditor detection accuracy improved from 51.4% (paper-only) to 74.0% (with logs+code), demonstrating fabrication detection requires execution artifacts <a href="../results/extraction-result-2203.html#e2203.3" class="evidence-link">[e2203.3]</a> </li>
    <li>SPOT benchmark shows LLM verifiers achieve only 6.1% precision and 21.1% recall at detecting author-confirmed errors, demonstrating large gap between automated verification and scientific validity <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.0" class="evidence-link">[e2208.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Concrete simulation failures: DFT predicted +7.4 kcal/mol while experiments showed 81% yield; SRIM predicted <20nm penetration while authors claimed μm-scale <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.8" class="evidence-link">[e2208.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.6" class="evidence-link">[e2208.6]</a> </li>

    <li>Execution-based validation in EXP-Bench showed only 0.2-0.5% end-to-end success rate when full experimental validation required, versus higher rates for partial checks <a href="../results/extraction-result-2197.html#e2197.0" class="evidence-link">[e2197.0]</a> </li>

</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>High-fidelity surrogates (r²=0.91-0.98) used successfully for validation in materials/chemistry tasks, but authors acknowledge these approximate true validation and lack wet-lab confirmation <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.0" class="evidence-link">[e2200.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.2" class="evidence-link">[e2200.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Temporal filtering and contamination analysis showed minimal model contamination (±1% accuracy delta), suggesting some computational validation approaches can be rigorous when properly controlled <a href="../results/extraction-result-2205.html#e2205.6" class="evidence-link">[e2205.6]</a> </li>
    <li>BioLab required wet-lab experimental validation (CRISPR knockout, antibody synthesis, assays) to validate computational predictions, demonstrating simulation alone insufficient for translational claims <a href="../results/extraction-result-2199.html#e2199.0" class="evidence-link">[e2199.0]</a> </li>
    <li>RAG-based validation achieved moderate accuracy (58-72%) when properly constrained with temporal filtering, showing computational methods have some effectiveness <a href="../results/extraction-result-2205.html#e2205.1" class="evidence-link">[e2205.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2205.html#e2205.2" class="evidence-link">[e2205.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>BioLab achieved prospective experimental validation with good agreement (Spearman=0.734, Pearson=0.800 for target ranking; IC50 improvements for antibodies), suggesting gap can be bridged with proper hybrid approaches <a href="../results/extraction-result-2199.html#e2199.0" class="evidence-link">[e2199.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Molecular dynamics simulations provided mechanistic insights that qualitatively matched experimental improvements, suggesting high-fidelity simulation can provide valuable validation even without quantitative experimental comparison <a href="../results/extraction-result-2199.html#e2199.2" class="evidence-link">[e2199.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Test-time scaling showed near-linear performance improvements with increased inference compute, suggesting computational validation gap may be partially addressable through computational investment <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.3" class="evidence-link">[e2208.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Extensive development of hybrid validation frameworks combining formal proof, simulation, and experiments suggests spectrum should include multi-modal validation approaches rather than single-point validation <a href="../results/extraction-result-2196.html#e2196.4" class="evidence-link">[e2196.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2192.html#e2192.0" class="evidence-link">[e2192.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2188.html#e2188.1" class="evidence-link">[e2188.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Community-integrated validation frameworks with continuous learning, peer review, and automated testing suggest validation should be viewed as ongoing ecosystem rather than one-time verification <a href="../results/extraction-result-2192.html#e2192.0" class="evidence-link">[e2192.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2192.html#e2192.5" class="evidence-link">[e2192.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple fabrication detection methods now exist (Monitor agents, LLM-based auditors, execution verification, perplexity checks) suggesting theory should emphasize detection/mitigation strategies more prominently <a href="../results/extraction-result-2197.html#e2197.5" class="evidence-link">[e2197.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2203.html#e2203.3" class="evidence-link">[e2203.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2188.html#e2188.3" class="evidence-link">[e2188.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Closed-loop simulated benchmarks and digital twin discussions suggest intermediate validation levels between pure simulation and full experiments that could reduce the gap <a href="../results/extraction-result-2196.html#e2196.3" class="evidence-link">[e2196.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2188.html#e2188.5" class="evidence-link">[e2188.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Surrogate-based validation with high r² values (0.91-0.98) enables practical discovery workflows, suggesting theory should distinguish between 'validation for discovery guidance' versus 'validation for scientific claims' <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.0" class="evidence-link">[e2200.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.2" class="evidence-link">[e2200.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.4" class="evidence-link">[e2200.4]</a> </li>
    <li>World-model and simulator-driven validation using causal multi-modal models and physics-informed simulators provides intermediate validation layer with known biases and fidelity limits <a href="../results/extraction-result-2196.html#e2196.2" class="evidence-link">[e2196.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Simulation-based validation (world models) explicitly acknowledges simulator biases and limitations, recommending agreement be checked by experiments when possible <a href="../results/extraction-result-2196.html#e2196.2" class="evidence-link">[e2196.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Expand validation spectrum to include intermediate levels: 'computationally validated with detection safeguards', 'validated via high-fidelity surrogates (r²>0.9)', 'validated via closed-loop simulation', 'validated via world models with known biases'</li>

                <li>Note that test-time compute scaling and improved inference methods may partially address gap for computational validation</li>
                <li>Emphasize that high-fidelity surrogates (r²>0.9) can enable practical discovery workflows while acknowledging they approximate rather than replace experimental validation</li>
                <li>Add discussion of world models and physics-informed simulators as intermediate validation layer with explicit bias/fidelity characterization</li>
