            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>RLDE-AFL demonstrates that learned operator selection and parameter control via reinforcement learning with attention-based feature extraction (NeurELA) outperforms hand-designed DE variants and RL baselines with hand-crafted features. The system learns to select among 14 mutation and 3 crossover operators per-individual and per-generation, achieving accumulated rewards of ~0.96 on 10D problems and demonstrating successful zero-shot transfer to 20D problems and realistic protein-docking tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.2" class="evidence-link">[e1984.2]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM-Meta-SR successfully evolves novel selection operators (Omni and Holo) through meta-evolution using LLM-based crossover and mutation. The discovered operators statistically outperform multiple expert-designed baselines on symbolic regression benchmarks (median test R² ~0.86), demonstrating that meta-learning can discover operator configurations that outperform hand-designed operators. Transfer is demonstrated with Omni successfully improving RAG-SR performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.2" class="evidence-link">[e1987.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.3" class="evidence-link">[e1987.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.4" class="evidence-link">[e1987.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Context-dependent operator selection is validated across multiple systems: RLDE-AFL's per-individual operator selection based on learned landscape features, LLEGO's parameterized operators (α for fitness-guided crossover, τ for diversity-guided mutation) that adapt based on population state, and DGEP's fitness-trend-based dynamic parameter adjustment all demonstrate that optimal operators depend on current search state. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.0" class="evidence-link">[e1986.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.1" class="evidence-link">[e1986.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.0" class="evidence-link">[e1985.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.1" class="evidence-link">[e1985.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Compositional operator structures emerge and prove effective: DGEP combines regeneration (DGEP-R) and mutation (DGEP-M) operators sharing a common fitness coefficient, and LLEGO combines fitness-guided crossover with diversity-guided mutation with complementary hyperparameters, supporting the theory's prediction that compositional operators can discover transformation strategies not accessible to single-step operators. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.2" class="evidence-link">[e1985.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Semantics-aware selection using complementarity-based parent pairing and per-dataset performance vectors substantially improved meta-evolution outcomes compared to random or aggregate-score-based selection, demonstrating that operators encoding implicit theories about productive variation (complementarity, specificity) are discoverable and beneficial. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.6" class="evidence-link">[e1987.6]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Operator specialization is demonstrated along multiple dimensions: RLDE-AFL shows per-individual specialization via learned operator selection, Omni demonstrates per-dataset specialization through complementarity measures, and LLEGO shows stage-aware specialization through α and τ parameters. However, the theory's specific prediction about 30-50% improvement from literature vs. code specialization is not directly tested, as most evidence comes from numerical optimization or symbolic regression domains rather than hybrid literature-code systems. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.0" class="evidence-link">[e1986.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.1" class="evidence-link">[e1986.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The integrated operator pool in RLDE-AFL (14 mutation + 3 crossover operators) shows that diversity in operator choices increases robustness, with even random selection from this diverse pool significantly outperforming vanilla DE. This supports the existence of a structured hypothesis space but also suggests that operator diversity may be as important as learning optimal selection policies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.1" class="evidence-link">[e1984.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.3" class="evidence-link">[e1984.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Transfer learning is demonstrated but with limited scope: RLDE-AFL shows zero-shot generalization from 10D to 20D problems and to protein-docking tasks, and Omni transfers successfully to RAG-SR. However, systematic cross-domain transfer and the existence of 'universal operators' that perform well across all problem domains remains largely unexplored. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple operator representations prove viable (neural networks in RLDE-AFL, programs in LLM-Meta-SR, parameterized rules in DGEP, prompt-conditioned distributions in LLEGO), supporting the theory's flexibility. However, this also indicates that no single unified hypothesis space representation has emerged, and the theory does not specify which representation is optimal for which contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.2" class="evidence-link">[e1984.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.0" class="evidence-link">[e1985.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Prior adaptive operator work (AB-GEP, Adagep, adaptive mutation methods) demonstrates that the general concept of adaptive operators has precedent, though these earlier methods used simpler adaptation mechanisms (bandit-based selection, rule-based parameter adjustment) rather than the full meta-learning approach proposed by the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.5" class="evidence-link">[e1985.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.6" class="evidence-link">[e1985.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.7" class="evidence-link">[e1985.7]</a> </li>
    <li>LLEGO demonstrates a form of cold-start handling through in-context learning, where the LLM's pre-trained knowledge provides initial operator capabilities without requiring prior domain-specific training data. However, this relies on the LLM's general knowledge and may not work for truly novel domains outside the LLM's training distribution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.0" class="evidence-link">[e1986.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.1" class="evidence-link">[e1986.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory predicts that learned operators will discover 40-70% more points on the novelty-executability Pareto frontier compared to fixed operators. However, actual improvements are more modest and variable: DGEP shows 15.7% average R² improvement, LLEGO shows up to 7.5 percentage point improvements in balanced accuracy, and while RLDE-AFL shows strong performance, specific percentage improvements over baselines are not consistently in the 40-70% range predicted. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.2" class="evidence-link">[e1985.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GATree (conventional GP with fixed structural operators) maintains higher population diversity than LLEGO in experiments, and heavily-budgeted GATree (N=100, G=200) remains competitive with LLEGO. This contradicts the theory's strong claim that learned operators will always outperform hand-designed operators, suggesting that with sufficient resources and appropriate design, fixed operators can match learned operators in certain scenarios. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.3" class="evidence-link">[e1986.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational costs of learned operators can be substantial: LLEGO incurs higher LLM inference costs, LLM-Meta-SR requires explicit bloat control to manage token consumption, and RLDE-AFL training requires non-trivial compute resources. The theory acknowledges computational cost as an 'unaccounted for' factor but does not adequately specify when the overhead outweighs benefits, and evidence suggests this is a significant practical limitation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.5" class="evidence-link">[e1987.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory predicts that operators learned with multi-objective optimization will outperform single-objective operators by 25-40%. However, the evidence shows mixed results: bloat control (a form of multi-objective optimization balancing fitness and code length) improves performance, but the specific 25-40% improvement margin is not consistently validated across the evidence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.5" class="evidence-link">[e1987.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The cold-start problem remains largely unaddressed in most systems: RLDE-AFL, DGEP, and the meta-evolution aspects of LLM-Meta-SR do not provide explicit mechanisms for bootstrapping operator learning on entirely new problem domains without prior data or related-domain transfer. While LLEGO's in-context learning provides partial mitigation, the theory's claim that meta-learning can discover optimal configurations from scratch is not fully validated. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.0" class="evidence-link">[e1985.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bloat control emerges as a critical requirement for LLM-based operator evolution, requiring explicit prompt-based length constraints and multi-objective survival selection using code similarity (CodeBLEU). The theory should incorporate regularization and complexity control as first-class components of the operator hypothesis space, not just as afterthoughts or 'unaccounted for' factors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.5" class="evidence-link">[e1987.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Operator representations span a wide spectrum from neural networks (NeurELA attention mechanisms) to symbolic programs (LLM-generated code) to parameterized rules (DGEP formulas) to prompt-conditioned distributions (LLEGO). The theory should acknowledge this representational pluralism and provide guidance on when different representations are appropriate, rather than treating the hypothesis space as having a single unified structure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.2" class="evidence-link">[e1984.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.0" class="evidence-link">[e1985.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Semantic feedback mechanisms (per-dataset score vectors, complementarity measures, functional signatures, residual-based novelty) prove essential for effective operator learning and meta-evolution. The theory should explicitly incorporate semantic/behavioral representations alongside syntactic operator parameterizations as core components of the hypothesis space structure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.6" class="evidence-link">[e1987.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.1" class="evidence-link">[e1986.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction between operator learning timescales and population evolution is more complex than theorized: DGEP operators adapt per-generation based on fitness trends (online), LLEGO operators are fixed but parameterized per-operation (hybrid), and RLDE-AFL learns a meta-policy offline then applies it online. The theory should distinguish between online adaptation, offline meta-learning, and hybrid approaches, specifying when each is appropriate. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.2" class="evidence-link">[e1985.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain knowledge and prompt engineering significantly impact learned operator quality: Omni-Zero (evolved without domain knowledge) achieves substantially lower performance than Omni (with domain knowledge), with domain knowledge removal causing the largest performance drop in ablations (from ~0.86 to ~0.79 R²). The theory should account for the role of prior knowledge in structuring the operator hypothesis space and specify how to incorporate domain knowledge effectively. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.1" class="evidence-link">[e1987.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Operator specialization occurs along multiple dimensions beyond the theory's focus on literature vs. code: per-individual specialization (RLDE-AFL), per-dataset specialization (Omni's complementarity), stage-aware specialization (LLEGO's α and τ, Omni's stage-dependent weighting), and problem-instance specialization (NeurELA features). The theory should expand its characterization of specialization axes and provide a more comprehensive taxonomy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.0" class="evidence-link">[e1986.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The evidence comes primarily from numerical optimization and symbolic regression domains, with limited direct testing of the theory's core focus on hybrid literature-code systems for genetic ideation. The theory's specific predictions about literature vs. code operator specialization and the novelty-executability frontier in hybrid systems remain largely untested by the current evidence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.0" class="evidence-link">[e1984.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1985.html#e1985.2" class="evidence-link">[e1985.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1986.html#e1986.2" class="evidence-link">[e1986.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1987.html#e1987.0" class="evidence-link">[e1987.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Random operator selection from a diverse pool can significantly outperform vanilla algorithms (RLDE-AFL's random baseline outperforms vanilla DE), suggesting that the structure of the operator hypothesis space—specifically its diversity and coverage—may be as important as the learning mechanism for navigating it. The theory should give more weight to hypothesis space design alongside learning algorithms. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1984.html#e1984.3" class="evidence-link">[e1984.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Revise quantitative predictions to reflect observed improvements: instead of predicting 40-70% more Pareto frontier points, specify more modest ranges (15-30% typical, up to 50% in favorable cases) and clarify conditions under which larger improvements occur.</li>
                <li>Expand the theory to explicitly include regularization and complexity control (bloat control, code length penalties) as essential components of the operator hypothesis space, not optional add-ons.</li>
                <li>Acknowledge representational pluralism: specify that the operator hypothesis space can be realized through multiple representations (neural, programmatic, rule-based, prompt-conditioned) with different trade-offs, and provide guidance on representation selection based on domain characteristics.</li>
                <li>Incorporate semantic/behavioral feedback mechanisms as first-class components alongside syntactic operator parameterizations, including complementarity measures, functional signatures, and residual-based novelty metrics.</li>
                <li>Distinguish between online operator adaptation, offline meta-learning, and hybrid approaches, specifying when each is appropriate based on computational budget, problem dynamics, and available prior knowledge.</li>
                <li>Add explicit treatment of the role of domain knowledge and prior information in structuring the operator hypothesis space, including mechanisms for incorporating domain knowledge (prompts, initialization, constraints) and quantifying its impact.</li>
                <li>Expand the characterization of operator specialization beyond modality (literature vs. code) to include per-individual, per-dataset, stage-aware, and problem-instance dimensions, providing a comprehensive taxonomy of specialization axes.</li>
                <li>Refine computational cost trade-offs: specify conditions under which learned operators are cost-effective (large-scale problems, repeated similar problems, high-value optimization) versus when simpler fixed operators suffice (small problems, one-off optimization, limited compute).</li>
                <li>Address the cold-start problem more explicitly by proposing concrete mechanisms: transfer learning from related domains, curriculum learning, in-context learning for LLM-based operators, or hybrid approaches combining learned and hand-designed components.</li>
                <li>Clarify the scope of the theory: acknowledge that current evidence primarily validates the approach for numerical optimization and symbolic regression, and that the specific predictions about hybrid literature-code systems for genetic ideation require additional empirical validation.</li>
                <li>Emphasize hypothesis space design: elevate the importance of operator pool diversity and coverage alongside learning mechanisms, specifying principles for designing operator pools that enable effective learning.</li>
