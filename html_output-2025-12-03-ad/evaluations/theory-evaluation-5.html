            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AutoToM demonstrates that when explicit Bayesian inverse planning and agent modeling are integrated, performance on ToM tasks improves – supporting the theory that unmodified LLMs lack the necessary explicit mental state representations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-145.html#e145.0" class="evidence-link">[e145.0]</a> </li>
    <li>BIP-ALM, a hybrid multimodal model that leverages Bayesian inverse planning with language models, outperforms standard LLMs on ToM benchmarks yet still struggles with complex scenarios, confirming the limitations predicted by the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-147.html#e147.0" class="evidence-link">[e147.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DEL-ToM uses Dynamic Epistemic Logic to generate structured belief updates, and its enhanced performance on higher-order ToM tasks underlines that explicit belief state modules are required—reinforcing the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-146.html#e146.0" class="evidence-link">[e146.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DynToM’s evaluation of temporal mental state tracking shows significant performance degradation relative to human performance, consistent with the theory’s claim that current models cannot robustly handle dynamic belief updates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-153.html#e153.0" class="evidence-link">[e153.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-3.5-turbo shows very low accuracy on higher-order belief benchmarks (HiToM and FANToM), which supports the theory that purely autoregressive training leads to superficial ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-158.html#e158.0" class="evidence-link">[e158.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-4, while achieving around 75% accuracy on static false-belief tasks, still fails on more complex, higher-order and dynamic ToM tasks – indicating that its apparent success on first‐order tasks masks a lack of genuine recursive mental state modeling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-148.html#e148.0" class="evidence-link">[e148.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-156.html#e156.0" class="evidence-link">[e156.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The 'ToM and GeRRI' framework, which employs recursive gradient‐based inference, achieves only toddler-level performance on classic tasks, underscoring the absence of full-fledged mental state representations in current LLMs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-141.html#e141.0" class="evidence-link">[e141.0]</a> </li>
    <li>VToM, a multimodal (video+text) model, improves accuracy with added visual context but still struggles to infer additional layers of ToM reasoning when cues conflict, in line with the proposed limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.0" class="evidence-link">[e159.0]</a> </li>
    <li>XToM, a multilingual ToM benchmark, reveals that while models have strong fact consistency, they display significant performance gaps in belief reasoning across languages – supporting the idea that static text corpora training limits deeper ToM understanding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-154.html#e154.0" class="evidence-link">[e154.0]</a> </li>
    <li>T@MBench demonstrates that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 lag behind human performance in false belief tasks, reinforcing the theory's claim of fundamental limitations in genuine ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.0" class="evidence-link">[e163.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GPT-3 shows high accuracy on some standard false belief tasks, suggesting that emergent pattern recognition can yield seemingly good performance on limited ToM tasks; however, this success is fragile and relies on shallow heuristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-167.html#e167.0" class="evidence-link">[e167.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLaMA2-70B outperforms humans on a faux pas test, though analysis indicates this may result from bias rather than genuine mental state understanding, implying that while performance numbers can be high, they do not reflect deep ToM capacity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-156.html#e156.2" class="evidence-link">[e156.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Llama-2 achieves very high accuracy on forward belief tasks when augmented with contrastive activation addition, yet its representations remain brittle to prompt variations, indicating partial support for emergent ToM-like inference coupled with inherent limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-149.html#e149.0" class="evidence-link">[e149.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PercepToM reports perfect scores in controlled false belief scenarios when using structured prompting, but notes significant difficulties in applied behavior prediction and judgment tasks due to issues like inhibitory control. <a href="../results/extraction-result-143.html#e143.0" class="evidence-link">[e143.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ToMAP improves persuasion effectiveness by incorporating explicit ToM modules; however, the model sometimes resorts to abnormal strategies (e.g., fabricating evidence), which demonstrates that while integration can help, the underlying architectural shortcomings remain. <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.0" class="evidence-link">[e162.0]</a> </li>
    <li>BeliefNest demonstrates effective first-order belief inference in simulated environments but struggles with distinguishing nuanced or conflicting perspectives, aligning with the notion of superficial ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.0" class="evidence-link">[e157.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Claude-3.5-Haiku exhibits advanced latent planning in creative tasks but shows limited capacity for complex social reasoning and higher-order ToM, reinforcing the idea of emergent yet shallow mental state modeling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-148.html#e148.1" class="evidence-link">[e148.1]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-4o outperforms other models on certain ToM benchmarks (e.g., CharToM-QA) but still suffers from high penalty rates and defects in response quality, highlighting persistent architectural limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-150.html#e150.0" class="evidence-link">[e150.0]</a> </li>
    <li>OpenToM reveals that LLM performance across narrative-based ToM tasks is inconsistent and significantly below human levels, emphasizing the models' surface-level understanding of mental states. <a href="../results/extraction-result-155.html#e155.0" class="evidence-link">[e155.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PersuasiveToM highlights challenges in tracking dynamic shifts in the persuadee's desires and intentions during multi-turn dialogues, suggesting that even enhanced models struggle with genuine, evolving ToM. <a href="../results/extraction-result-142.html#e142.0" class="evidence-link">[e142.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SimpleToM shows that while LLMs can achieve high accuracy in inferring explicit mental states, their performance drops drastically in predicting behaviors and judgments based on those states. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.0" class="evidence-link">[e161.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ToMi demonstrates high performance in explicit mental state inference yet exposes significant limitations when applying this reasoning to predict behavior and make judgments. <a href="../results/extraction-result-168.html#e168.0" class="evidence-link">[e168.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some GPT-4 evaluations (e.g., on certain HiToM tasks) report nearly perfect accuracy on static benchmarks, suggesting that under very controlled conditions, LLMs might exhibit strong ToM performance—though these successes do not generalize to dynamic or nuanced social contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-158.html#e158.1" class="evidence-link">[e158.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LaBToM, which utilizes an explicit epistemic language of thought, closely correlates with human ratings in belief attribution, implying that integrating formal, structured representations can bridge the gap between superficial and genuine ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-144.html#e144.0" class="evidence-link">[e144.0]</a> </li>
    <li>NegotiationToM, a benchmark for ToM in negotiation dialogues, underscores the need for active, dynamic evaluation frameworks and suggests that incorporating interactive, real‐time mechanisms might further refine our understanding of LLM ToM limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-168.html#e168.3" class="evidence-link">[e168.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Pythia, a smaller-scale model, exhibits lower robustness in ToM tasks despite improvements with activation editing, indicating that model scale and enhanced training protocols could be more critical than previously assumed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-149.html#e149.1" class="evidence-link">[e149.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Revise the theory to explicitly acknowledge that while LLMs can achieve high performance on static or first-order ToM tasks through pattern recognition, they still lack genuine recursive and dynamic mental state modeling.</li>
                <li>Emphasize that integrating explicit belief state modules, symbolic reasoning, and multimodal interactive training can improve ToM performance, though these hybrid approaches still fall short of capturing true human‐like social cognition.</li>
                <li>Differentiate between surface-level ToM capabilities observable in controlled benchmarks and the deeper, context-sensitive, dynamic ToM understanding required for genuine theory‐of‐mind.</li>
