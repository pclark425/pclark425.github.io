<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, demonstrating impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks [92, 219, 217, 102]. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the performance of OpenAI's o1 model, widely perceived as the model with the highest reasoning capabilities in history so far, on complex reasoning tasks spanning multiple disciplines. O1 represents a significant leap forward in AI reasoning capabilities. According to OpenAI's blog post [130], o1 demonstrates remarkable proficiency across various domains, including competitive programming, advanced mathematics, and PhD-level scientific problem-solving. It ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions, places among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad, and surpasses human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems. These achievements underscore o1's potential to revolutionize AI applications in science, coding, mathematics, and related fields.</p>
<p>While standard benchmarks have shown promising results [130], they can be manipulated and are often not comprehensive enough to fully assess the model's capabilities [117, 122]. By rigorously testing the model's abilities across a wide range of domains with real world tasks, we seek to provide a more holistic evaluation of its progress towards artificial general intelligence and identify areas for further development.</p>
<h3>1.1 Background: What is New with o1</h3>
<p>LLMs, built on the Transformer [177] architecture, have evolved from early work such as BERT [26] and GPT [144] to more advanced models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 [14, 2]. These models, trained on vast corpora of text data, have shown significant proficiency in understanding context, generating human-like text, and performing complex reasoning tasks [92, 219, 217, 102, 112, 94, 51, 215, 70, $108,184,168,107,170]$.</p>
<h3>1.1.1 OpenAI o1 \&amp; Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</h3>
<p>Chain-of-thought reasoning [193] is a recent advancement in LLMs that enables models to break down complex problems into intermediate steps, mirroring human-like problem-solving processes. This approach has shown particular promise in enhancing performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning or mathematical problem-solving. By explicitly generating a series of coherent thoughts leading to a conclusion, models can tackle more sophisticated problems and provide more interpretable outputs.</p>
<p>Compared to its predecessor GPT-4, o1 explicitly incorporates chain-of-thought into its inference process [130]. While GPT-4 could utilize chain-of-thought reasoning when prompted, o1 integrates this approach as a fundamental part of its architecture. This allows o1 to "think before it answers," producing a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user. This integration enables o1 to handle more complex reasoning tasks and provide more transparent explanations of its problemsolving process, potentially surpassing GPT-4's capabilities in areas requiring deep, multi-step reasoning.</p>
<h3>1.1.2 OpenAI o1 \&amp; Reinforcement Learning</h3>
<p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a powerful technique that has significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models. It combines reinforcement learning principles with human preferences to fine-tune models, aligning their outputs more closely with human expectations.</p>
<p>RLHF typically involves supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling based on human preferences, and policy optimization through reinforcement learning. For a more detailed discussion of RLHF, see Section 3.8.</p>
<p>O1 employs advanced reinforcement learning techniques that significantly evolve beyond traditional RLHF methods. According to OpenAI, o1's performance consistently improves with more reinforcement learning (train-time compute) and with more time spent thinking (test-time compute) [130]. This novel approach likely incorporates Chain-of-Thought reasoning into its reinforcement learning framework, which allows it to generate and evaluate multiple reasoning paths before producing a final output.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional models that primarily spend compute during training, o1 scales its performance with increased compute during inference. This suggests a form of online learning or search that occurs at test time, which could involve real-time exploration and refinement of reasoning strategies. The model potentially rewards not just the final answer, but also the quality and effectiveness of its reasoning steps. O1 appears to have mechanisms for self-reflection and improvement, which implement a form of self-supervised learning where the model's thoughts become training data for further enhancement $[130,119,66]$.</p>
<p>It might generate multiple candidate reasoning paths in parallel, which use reinforcement learning to score and select the most promising paths, similar to the Quiet-STaR method [207, 119]. The model's ability to improve with more thinking time" suggests a continuous learning loop, which possibly implements a form of meta-learning that adapts its reasoning strategies based on the specific task.</p>
<p>These advanced techniques represent a paradigm shift which focuses on enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities during inference, rather than solely aligning its outputs with human preferences during training.</p>
<h1>1.2 Motivation</h1>

<p>In our study, we aim to explore and evaluate o1-preview's capabilities and limitations across various domains and complex tasks. Below is a comprehensive list of the domains and tasks we have included in our research.</p>
<h3>2.1 Code Generation</h3>
<p>Following the initial evaluation of o1-preview's coding capabilities, we extended our assessment by testing its performance in a competitive programming environment, specifically within Leetcode contests.</p>
<p>Leetcode is a widely recognized platform for coding challenges, designed to test and improve problemsolving skills in a variety of programming languages. It offers a range of problems covering topics</p>
<p>such as algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, and system design. Leetcode's contests are time-bound competitive events that challenge participants to solve multiple algorithmic problems of varying difficulty within a limited timeframe. These contests provide an ideal benchmark for evaluating the real-world coding abilities of language models, as they require not only syntactic correctness but also efficient problem-solving and optimization skills. Leetcode has hosted 415 weekly contests and 139 biweekly contests, each consisting of four problems designed to comprehensively cover the domain of data structures and algorithms. These contests serve as a thorough test of coding knowledge, spanning topics such as sorting, dynamic programming, graph theory, and more.</p>
<p>For the purpose of evaluating o1-preview, we specifically test its performance on Leetcode Weekly Contests 414 and 413, as well as Biweekly Contest 138. In each contest, o1-preview is given three submission attempts per problem. A problem was considered successfully solved if any of the submissions passed Leetcode's automated system judgement, which evaluates the correctness and efficiency of the code against predefined test cases. This evaluation framework allows for a detailed assessment of o1-preview's ability to reason through complex algorithmic challenges and produce accurate solutions under typical coding contest conditions.</p>
<h1>2.2 Radiology Report Generation</h1>
<p>OpenAI's next-generation large language model, o1-preview, has exhibited considerable potential in medical report generation. To evaluate its capabilities in this domain, we performed an assessment using the Chinese radiology report dataset SXY [218, 213] to test o1-preview's effectiveness in generating medical reports.</p>
<p>The SXY dataset, sourced from The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, is a private Chinese radiology report dataset designed for training and evaluating models in radiology report generation. It includes 317,339 radiological reports from five categories ( 94,097 chest reports, 64,550 abdominal reports, 46,092 musculoskeletal reports, 69,902 head reports, and 42,698 maxillofacial \&amp; neck reports). These reports offer comprehensive documentation of patients' radiological imaging analyses, encompassing a wide spectrum of pathological findings and providing diverse opportunities for model training and evaluation. Leveraging the SXY dataset, researchers can assess a model's performance in producing accurate, clinically relevant radiology reports, particularly its proficiency in understanding and generating complex medical terminology. This dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for radiology report generation tasks, spanning various medical imaging domains, and provides an ideal resource for validating model performance across different clinical scenarios.</p>
<p>To assess the performance of o1-preview, we randomly selected 10 radiology reports from the SXY dataset for evaluation. During the testing process, we conducted several experiments to determine the optimal prompt phrasing, ensuring that the prompts remained consistent across all trials. For the model-generated outputs, we employed the ROUGE metric to measure the degree of correspondence between the radiology reports produced by the large language models and the reference reports authored by medical professionals. Specifically, this study utilized three evaluation metrics: ROUGE-1 (R-1), ROUGE-2 (R-2), and ROUGE-L (R-L), as defined in Eq. (1).</p>

<p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of o1-preview on the ROS official code repository dataset, ROS [32], which contains the official ROS code's usage. The task involves analyzing code snippets and determining their functionality and correctness, structured as a classification task where the given code either performs as expected, contains logical errors, or has undefined behavior. Code understanding tasks require advanced technical comprehension and reasoning to identify functional correctness and are widely used to evaluate AI models in software engineering contexts [85]. Some domain-specific code datasets not only demand sophisticated reasoning but also assess the model's understanding of domain-specific programming principles, providing a more robust evaluation of its potential for real-world development scenarios. For detailed analysis and results, please see Section 4.4 .</p>
<h3>2.4 Nature Language Inference</h3>
<p>In this section, we evaluate o1-preview on the natural language inference (NLI) task. The NLI task involves determining the logical relationship between two sentences, structured as a classification task where the second sentence either logically follows from the first, contradicts the first, or is neutral (possibly true). NLI tasks require advanced language understanding and reasoning to analyze logical coherence and are widely used to evaluate LLMs. Some domain-specific NLI datasets not only demand advanced reasoning but also assess the domain-specific knowledge of LLMs, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of their potential for real-world applications.</p>
<p>Here, we evaluate o1-preview using data samples from five NLI datasets: MNLI, ANLI, QNLI, MedNLI, and RadQNLI [196, 126, 180, 153, 197]. Table 1 presents a summary of these datasets with detailed descriptions, covering different formats and domains, ensuring a thorough assessment of o1-preview's reasoning capabilities.</p>

Additionally, the F1-score is utilized to provide a balanced measure of a model's precision and recall capabilities.</p>
<p>Beyond quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments are conducted to evaluate the models' reasoning processes. This involves analyzing the logical flow of their solutions, the correctness of numerical computations, and the appropriateness of the financial methodologies applied. Models are also benchmarked against established financial theories and real-world market data to ensure their outputs are not only theoretically sound but also practically relevant. Human expert evaluations further validate the models' performance by comparing their answers to those provided by experienced professionals in the field of quantitative finance.</p>
<p>This multifaceted evaluation approach ensures that the models are not merely performing superficial computations but are genuinely understanding and engaging with complex financial concepts. It allows researchers and practitioners to identify specific areas where models excel or need improvement, thereby facilitating the development of more advanced and reliable quantitative trading systems.</p>
<p>In summary, the stock-trading-QA dataset excels in offering insights into critical areas of quantitative finance and trading models.

Additionally, its capacity for multi-dimensional analysis ensures that it can identify nuanced correlations and patterns that simpler, rule-based systems might overlook, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of its quantitative trading strategies.</p>
<h1>2.6 Low-Resource Language Translation</h1>
<p>Low-resource translation is particularly challenging for Transformer-based models, like the previous GPT-4o, due to their reliance on large amounts of high-quality training data to learn language patterns effectively. Our study will evaluate o1-preview model's ability to handle low-resource language translation by using data from the Cherokee Corpus Main Section of the Cherokee-English Dictionary (CED) project [127]. The Cherokee Corpus is a collection of 1776 Cherokee sentences paired with corresponding English translations as ground truth. This resource will serve as a valuable benchmark to evaluate how effectively the model can handle translation tasks between Cherokee and English, particularly in the context of limited parallel data availability for the Cherokee language.</p>
<p>Throughout the experimental phase, o1-preview generated translations and grammatical breakdowns for Cherokee sentences, focusing on both word meanings and sentence structure. The model was instructed to translate five Cherokee sentences and provide detailed analyses of key components, such as noun phrases and verb conjugations. Each analysis covered the subject, action, and contextual meaning of the sentence, demonstrating the model's ability to handle translations for a low-resource language.</p>
<p>The experimental results show that o1-preview can successfully translate common phrases and identify grammatical structures such as plural nouns and verb tenses in Cherokee. However, due to Cherokee being a low-resource language, the model sometimes fails to recognize certain words, leading to incomplete or inaccurate translations. Despite this, the model is able to provide reasonable guesses for unknown words, ensuring a degree of consistency in the overall translation. This ability to infer meaning allows the model to generate plausible translations, even when faced with unfamiliar vocabulary. However, expert intervention is still often required to refine these guesses and ensure full accuracy. This indicates the need for more detailed linguistic data and expert guidance to improve the model's performance in low-resource language translation tasks.</p>
