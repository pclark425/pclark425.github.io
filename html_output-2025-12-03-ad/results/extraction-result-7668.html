                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a variety of natural language tasks based on just a few examples of natural language instructions, reducing the need for extensive feature engineering. However, most powerful LLMs are closed-source or limited in their capability for languages other than English. In this technical report, we present Baichuan 2, a series of large-scale multilingual language models containing 7 billion and 13 billion parameters, trained from scratch, on 2.6 trillion tokens. Baichuan 2 matches or outperforms other open-source models of similar size on public benchmarks like MMLU, CMMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval. Furthermore, Baichuan 2 excels in vertical domains such as medicine and law. We will release all pre-training model checkpoints to benefit the research community in better understanding the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The field of large language models has witnessed promising and remarkable progress in recent years.The size of language models has grown from millions of parameters, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), GPT-1 (Radford et al., 2018), to billions or even trillions of parameters such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022;Anil et al., 2023) and Switch Transformers (Fedus et al., 2022).This increase in scale has led to significant improvements in the capabilities of language models, enabling more human-like fluency and the ability to perform a diverse range of natural language tasks.With the introduction of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022) from OpenAI, the power of these models to generate human-like text has captured widespread public attention.ChatGPT demonstrates strong language proficiency across a variety of domains, from conversing casually to explaining complex concepts.This breakthrough highlights the potential for large language models to automate tasks involving natural language generation and comprehension.</p>
<p>While there have been exciting breakthroughs and applications of LLMs, most leading LLMs like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), PaLM-2 (Anil et al., 2023), and Claude (Claude, 2023) remain closed-sourced.Developers and researchers have limited access to the full model parameters, making it difficult for the community to deeply study or fine-tune these systems.More openness and transparency around LLMs could accelerate research and responsible development within this rapidly advancing field.LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), a series of large language models developed by Meta containing up to 65 billion parameters, has significantly benefited the LLM research community by being fully opensourced.The open nature of LLaMA, along with other open-source LLMs such as OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), Bloom (Scao et al., 2022), MPT (MosaicML, 2023) and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), enables researchers to freely access the models for examination, experimentation, and further development.This transparency and access distinguishes LLaMA from other proprietary LLMs.By providing full access, the open-source LLMs have accelerated research and advances in the field, leading to new models like Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023), and others (Wang et al., 2022;Zhu et al., 2023;Anand et al., 2023).</p>
<p>However, most open-source large language models have focused primarily on English.For instance, the main data source for LLaMA is Common Crawl 1 , which comprises 67% of LLaMA's pre-training data but is filtered to English content only.Other open source LLMs such as MPT (MosaicML, 2023) and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023) are also focused on English and have limited capabilities in other languages.This hinders the development and application of LLMs in specific languages, such as Chinese.</p>
<p>In this technical report, we introduce Baichuan 2, a series of large-scale multilingual language models.Baichuan 2 has two separate models, Baichuan 2-7B with 7 billion parameters and Baichuan 2-13B with 13 billion parameters.Both models were trained on 2.6 trillion tokens, which to our knowledge is the largest to date, more than double that of Baichuan 1 (Baichuan, 2023b,a).With such a massive amount of training data, Baichuan 2 achieves significant improvements over Baichuan 1.On general benchmarks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), CMMLU (Li et al., 2023), and C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), Baichuan 2-7B achieves nearly 30% higher performance compared to Baichuan 1-7B.Specifically, Baichuan 2 is optimized to improve performance on math and code problems.On the GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) evaluations, Baichuan 2 nearly doubles the results of the Baichuan 1.In addition, Baichuan 2 also demonstrates strong performance on medical and legal domain tasks.On benchmarks such as MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) and JEC-QA (Zhong et al., 2020), Baichuan 2 outperforms other opensource models, making it a suitable foundation model for domain-specific optimization.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also released two chat models, Baichuan 2-7B-Chat and Baichuan 2-13B-Chat, optimized to follow human instructions.These models excel at dialogue and context understanding.</p>
<p>We will elaborate on our approaches to improve the safety of Baichuan 2. By open-sourcing these models, we hope to enable the community to further improve the safety of large language models, facilitating more research on responsible LLMs development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in spirit of research collaboration 1 https://commoncrawl.org/ and continuous improvement, we are also releasing the checkpoints of Baichuan 2 at various stages of training from 200 billion tokens up to the full 2.6 trillion tokens.We found that even for the 7 billion parameter model, performance continued to improve after training on more than 2.6 trillion tokens.By sharing these intermediary results, we hope to provide the community with greater insight into the training dynamics of Baichuan 2. Understanding these dynamics is key to unraveling the inner working mechanism of large language models (Biderman et al., 2023a;Tirumala et al., 2022).We believe the release of these checkpoints will pave the way for further advances in this rapidly developing field.</p>
<p>In this technical report, we will also share some of the trials, errors, and lessons learned through training Baichuan 2. In the following sections, we will present detailed modifications made to the vanilla Transformer architecture and our training methodology.We will then describe our fine-tuning methods to align the foundation model with human preferences.Finally, we will benchmark the performance of our models against other LLMs on a set of standard tests.Throughout the report, we aim to provide transparency into our process, including unsuccessful experiments, to advance collective knowledge in developing LLMs.Baichuan 2's foundation models and chat models are available for both research and commercial use at https://github.com/baichuan-inc/Baichuan2  1.We then describe our pre-training data and data processing methods.Next, we elaborate on the Baichuan 2 architecture and scaling results.Finally, we describe the distributed training system.</p>
<p>Pre-training Data</p>
<p>Data sourcing: During data acquisition, our objective is to pursue comprehensive data scalability and representativeness.We gather data from diverse sources including general internet webpages, books, research papers, codebases, and more to build an extensive world knowledge  system.The composition of the training corpus is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Architecture</p>
<p>The model architecture of Baichuan 2 is based on the prevailing Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017).Nevertheless, we made several modifications which we detailed below.</p>
<p>Tokenizer</p>
<p>A tokenizer needs to balance two critical factors: a high compression rate for efficient inference, and an appropriately sized vocabulary to ensure adequate training of each word embedding.We have taken both these aspects into account.We have expanded the vocabulary size from 64,000 in Baichuan 1 to 125,696, aiming to strike a balance between computational efficiency and model performance.We use byte-pair encoding (BPE) (Shibata et al., 1999) from SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson,</p>
<p>Activations and Normalizations</p>
<p>We use SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) activation function, a switch-activated variant of GLU (Dauphin et al., 2017) which shows improved results.However, SwiGLU has a "bilinear" layer and contains three parameter matrices, differing from the vanilla Transformer's feed-forward layer that has two matrices, so we reduce the hidden size from 4 times the hidden size to 8 3 hidden size and rounded to the multiply of 128.</p>
<p>For the attention layer of Baichuan 2, we adopt the memory efficient attention (Rabe and Staats, 2021) implemented by xFormers 2 .By leveraging xFormers' optimized attention with biasing capabilities, we can efficiently incorporate ALiBi's bias-based positional encoding while reducing memory overhead.</p>
<p>This provides performance and efficiency benefits for Baichuan 2's large-scale training.</p>
<p>We apply Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) to the input of the Transformer block which is more robust to the warm-up schedule (Xiong et al., 2020).In addition, we use the RMSNorm implementation introduced by (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019), which only calculates the variance of input features to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Optimizations</p>
<p>We use AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) optimizer for training.β 1 and β 2 are set to 0.9 and 0.95, respectively.We use weight decay with 0.1 and clip the grad norm to 0.5.The models are warmed up with 2,000 linear scaling steps reaching to the max learning rate and then applying the cosine decay to the minimum learning rate.The parameter details and learning rate are shown in Table 3.</p>
<p>The whole models are trained using BFloat16 mixed precision.Compared to Float16, BFloat16 has a better dynamic range, making it more robust to large values that are critical in training large language models.However, BFloat16's low precision causes issues in some settings.For instance, in some public RoPE and ALibi implementations, the torch.arangeoperation fails due to collisions when the integer exceeds 256, preventing differentiation of nearby positions.Therefore, we use full precision for some valuesensitive operations such as positional embeddings.</p>
<p>NormHead: To stabilize training and improve the model performance, we normalize the output embeddings (which are also referred as 'head').There are two advantages of NormHead in our experiment.First, in our preliminary experiments we found that the norm of the head are prone to be unstable.The norm of the rare token's embedding becomes smaller during training which disturb the training dynamics.NormHead can stabilize the dynamics significantly.Second, we found that the semantic information is mainly encoded by the cosine similarity of Embedding rather than L2 distance.Since the current linear classifier computes logits by dot product, which is a mixture of L2 distance and cosine similarity.NormHead alleviates the distraction of L2 distance in computing logits.For more details, please refer appendix B.</p>
<p>Max-z loss: During training, we found that the logits of LLMs could become very large.While the softmax function is agnostic to the absolute logit values, as it depends only on their relative values.Large logits caused issues during inference because common implementations of repetition penalty (such as the Hugging Face implementation3 in model.generate)apply a scalar (e.g.1.1 or 1.2) directly to the logits.Contracting very large logits in this way can significantly alter the probabilities after softmax, making the model sensitive to the choice of repetition penalty hyperparameter.Inspired by NormSoftmax (Jiang et al., 2023b) and the auxiliary z-loss from PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), we added a max-z loss to normalize the logits:
L max-z = 2e −4 * z 2 (1)
where z is the maximum logit value.This helped stabilize training and made the inference more robust to hyper-parameters.The final training loss of Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B are shown in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Scaling Laws</p>
<p>Neural scaling laws, where the error decreases as a power function of training set size, model size, or both, have enabled an assuring performance when training became more and more expensive in deep learning and large language models.Before training the large language models of billions of parameters, we first train some small-sized models and fit a scaling law for training larger models.</p>
<p>We launched a range of model sizes going from 10M to 3B, ranging from 1 1000 to 1 10 the size of the final model, and each of the model is trained for up to 1 trillion tokens, using consistent hyperparameters and the same data set sourced from Baichuan 2. Based on the final loss of different models, we can obtain a mapping from the training flops to the target loss.To fit the scaling law of the model, we employed the formula given by Henighan et al. (2020):
L C = a × C b + L ∞ (2)
where L ∞ is the irreducible loss and the first term is the reducible loss which is formulated as a power-law scaling term.C are training flops and the L C are final loss of the model in that flops.We used the curve_fit function from the SciPy4 library to fit the parameters.The final fitted scaling curve and the predicted 7 billion and 13 billion parameters model's final loss are shown in Figure 4. We can see that the fitted scaling law predicted Baichuan 2's final loss with high accuracy.</p>
<p>Infrastructure</p>
<p>Efficiently leveraging existing GPU resources plays a critically important role in training and developing large language models today.To accomplish this, we develop a co-design approach for an elastic training framework and a smart cluster scheduling policy.</p>
<p>Since our GPUs are shared among multiple users and tasks, the specific behavior of each task is unpredictable, often leading to idle GPU nodes within the cluster.Considering that a single machine equipped with eight A800 GPUs could adequately meet the memory requirements for our Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B models, the primary design criterion for our training framework is the machine-level elasticity, which supports that resources for tasks can be dynamically modified according to the cluster status and thereby serves as the foundation for our smart scheduling algorithm.</p>
<p>To meet the requirement of the machine-level elasticity, our training framework integrates tensor parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021) and ZeROpowered data parallelism (Rajbhandari et al., 2020), where we set tensor parallelism inside each machine and employ ZeRO shared data parallelism for elastic scaling across machines.</p>
<p>In addition, we employ a tensor-splitting technique (Nie et al., 2022) where we split certain calculations to reduce peak memory consumption, such as the cross-entropy calculations with large vocabularies.This approach enables us to meet memory needs without extra computing and communication, making the system more efficient.</p>
<p>To further accelerate training without compromising model accuracy, we implement mixed-precision training, where we perform forward and backward computations in BFloat16, while performing optimizer updating in Float32.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to efficiently scale our training cluster to thousands of GPUs, we integrate the following techniques to avoid the degradation of communication efficiency: • Topology-aware distributed training.In largescale clusters, network connections frequently span multiple layers of switches.We strategically arrange the ranks for distributed training to minimize frequent access across different switches, which reduces latency and thereby enhances overall training efficiency.• Hybrid and hierarchical partition for ZeRO.</p>
<p>By partitioning parameters across GPUs, ZeRO3 reduces memory consumption at the expense of additional all-gather communications.This approach would lead to a significant communication bottleneck when scaling to thousands of GPUs (Jiang et al., 2023a).To address this issue, we propose a hybrid and hierarchical partitioning scheme.Specifically, our framework first partitions the optimizer states across all GPUs, and then adaptively decides which layers need to activate ZeRO3, and whether partitioning parameters hierarchically.By integrating these strategies, our system is capable of training Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B models efficiently on 1,024 NVIDIA A800 GPUs, achieving a computational efficiency that exceeds 180 TFLOPS.</p>
<p>Alignment</p>
<p>Baichuan 2 also introduces the alignment procedure resulting in two chat models: Baichuan 2-7B-Chat and Baichuan 2-13B-Chat.</p>
<p>The alignment process of the Baichuan 2 encompasses two main components: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).</p>
<p>Supervised Fine-Tuning</p>
<p>During the supervised fine-tuning phase, we use human labelers to annotate prompts gathered from various data sources.Each prompt is labeled as being helpful or harmless based on key principles similar to Claude (2023).To validate data quality, we use cross-validation-an authoritative annotator checks the quality of a sample batch annotated by a specific crowd worker group, rejecting any batches that do not meet our quality standards.</p>
<p>We collected over 100k supervised fine-tuning samples and trained our base model on them.Next, we delineated the reinforcement learning process via the RLHF method to further improve results.The whole process of RLHF, including RM and RL training, is shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p>We devised a three-tiered classification system for all prompts, consisting of 6 primary categories, 30 secondary categories, and over 200 tertiary categories.From the user's perspective, we aim for the classification system to comprehensively cover all types of user needs.From the standpoint   The reward model derived from training exhibits a performance consistent with that of LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), indicating that the greater the score difference between two responses, the higher the discriminative accuracy of the reward model, as shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>PPO</p>
<p>After obtaining the reward model, we employ the PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) algorithm to train our language model.We employ four models: the actor model (responsible for generating responses), the reference model (used to compute the KL penalty with fixed parameters), the reward model (providing an overarching reward for the entire response with fixed parameters), and the critic model (designed to learn per-token values).</p>
<p>Training Details</p>
<p>During the RLHF training process, the critic model is warmed up with an initial 20 training steps ahead.Subsequently, both the critic and actor models are updated via the standard PPO algorithm.For all models, we use gradient clipping of 0.5, a constant learning rate of 5e-6, and a PPO clip threshold ϵ = 0.1.We set the KL penalty coefficient β = 0.2, decaying to 0.005 over steps.We train for 350 iterations for all our chat models, resulting in Baichuan 2-7B-Chat and Baichuan 2-13B-Chat.</p>
<p>Safety</p>
<p>We believe that model safety improvements stem not only from constraints during data cleansing or alignment stages but also from harnessing positive knowledge and identifying negative knowledge during all training stages.Guided by this concept, we have enhanced model safety throughout the Baichuan 2 training process.</p>
<p>Pre-training Stage</p>
<p>In the pre-training stage, we pay close attention to data safety.The entire pre-training dataset underwent a rigorous data filtering process aimed at enhancing safety.We devised a system of rules and models to eliminate harmful content such as violence, pornography, racial discrimination, hate speech, and more.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we curated a Chinese-English bilingual dataset comprising several million webpages from hundreds of reputable websites that represent various positive value domains, encompassing areas such as policy, law, vulnerable groups, general values, traditional virtues, and more.We also heightened the sampling probability for this dataset.</p>
<p>Alignment Stage</p>
<p>We build a red-teaming procedure consisting of 6 types of attacks and 100+ granular safety value categories, an expert annotation team of 10 with traditional internet security experience initialized safe alignment prompts.The relevant snippets from the pre-training dataset were retrieved to create responses, resulting in approximately 1K annotated data for initialization.</p>
<p>Evaluations</p>
<p>In this section, we report the zero-shot or few-shot results of the pre-trained base models on standard benchmarks.We evaluate Baichuan 2 on free-form generation tasks and multiple-choice tasks.</p>
<p>• Free-form generation: Models are given some sample inputs (shots) and then generate continuations to obtain results, like for question answering, translation, and other tasks.• Multiple-choice: Models are given a question and multiple choices, and the task is to select the most appropriate candidates.</p>
<p>Given the variety of tasks and examples, we incorporated open-source evaluation frameworks like lm-evaluation-harness (Gao et al., 2021) and OpenCompass (OpenCompass, 2023) into our in-house implementations for fair benchmarking against other models.</p>
<p>The models we choose to compare have similar sizes to Baichuan 2  For CMMLU and MMLU, we adopt the official implementations and adopt 5-shot for evaluation.For BBH we adopt 3-shot evaluations.For C-Eval, Gaokao, and AGIEval we only select the multiplechoice with four candidates for better evaluations.For GSM8K, we adopt 4-shot testing derived from OpenCompass (OpenCompass, 2023).We also incorporate the result of GPT-4 6 and GPT-3.5-6gpt-4-0613 Turbo7 .Unless stated otherwise, the results in this paper were obtained using our internal evaluation tools.</p>
<p>The overall result is shown in Table 1.Compared with other similar-sized open-sourced models, our model has a clear performance advantage.Especially in math and code problems, our model achieves significant improvement over Baichuan 1.</p>
<p>Vertical Domain Evaluations</p>
<p>We also evaluate Baichuan 2 in vertical domains, where we choose the law and medical field as they has been widely studied in recent years.</p>
<p>In the law field, we report scores of JEC-QA (Zhong et al., 2020), which is collected from the National Judicial Examination of China.It contains multiple-choice and multiple-answer questions.For compatibility with our evaluation suite, we only test the multiple-choice questions.</p>
<p>In the medical field, we report scores from two medical benchmarks, MedQA (Jin et al., 2021) and MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), as well as average scores from medical-related disciplines in C-Eval (val), MMLU, and CMMLU (abbreviated as CMC).Specifically, MedMCQA is collected from the professional medical board exams in the USA and China, including three subsets, i.e., USMLE, MCMLE and TWMLE, and we report the results of USMLE and MCMLE with five candidates; MedMCQA is collected from from Indian medical entrance exams, and we evaluate multiple-choice questions and report the scores in the dev set.The detail of MedMCQA includes (1) clinical medicine, basic medicine of C-Eval (val), ( 2) clinical knowledge, anatomy, college medicine, college biology, nutrition, virology, medical genetics, professional medicine of MMLU, (3) anatomy, clinical knowledge, college medicine, genetics, nutrition, traditional chinese medicine, virology of CMMLU.Moreover, all these datasets are evaluated in 5-shot.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 5 Baichuan 2-7B-Base surpasses models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, ChatGLM 2-6B, and LLaMA 2-7B in the field of Chinese law, second only to GPT-4.Compared to Baichuan 1-7B, Baichuan 2-7B-Base shows an improvement of nearly 10 points.In the medical field, Baichuan 2-7B-Base outperforms models like ChatGLM 2-6B and LLaMA 2-7B, showing significant improvement over Baichuan 1-7B as well.</p>
<p>Similarly, Baichuan 2-13B-Base surpasses models other than GPT-4 in the field of Chinese law.In the medical domain, Baichuan 2-13B-Base outperforms models such as XVERSE-13B and LLaMA 2-13B.Compared to Baichuan 1-13B-Base, Baichuan 2-13B-Base also exhibits remarkable improvement.</p>
<p>Math and Code</p>
<p>This section introduces the performance in mathematics and coding.</p>
<p>We We use OpenCompass to evaluate the ability of models in math and code.As shown in Table 6, in the field of mathematics, Baichuan 2-7B-Base surpasses models like LLaMA 2-7B.In the code domain, it outperforms models of the same size such as ChatGLM 2-6B.Baichuan 2-7B-Base exhibits significant improvement compared to the Baichuan 1-7B model.</p>
<p>In mathematics, Baichuan 2-13B-Base surpasses all models of the same size, approaching the level of GPT-3.5 Turbo.In the code domain, Baichuan 2-13B-Base outperforms models like LLaMA 2-13B and XVERSE-13B.Baichuan 2-13B-Base demonstrates significant improvement compared to Baichuan 1-13B-Base.</p>
<p>Multilingual</p>
<p>We use Flores-101 (Costa-Jussà et al., 2022;Goyal et al., 2021;Guzmán et al., 2019) to evaluate multilingual ability.Flores-101 covers 101 languages from around the world.Its data is sourced from various domains such as news, travel guides, and books.We selected the official Figure 6: Helpfulness and harmlessness before and after safety alignment of Baichuan 2. The x-axis shows the metric before safety alignment and the y-axis shows the result after.We see that helpfulness remains largely unchanged after this procedure, while harmlessness improved substantially (more mass in upper triangle) with safety efforts.languages of the United Nations (Arabic (ar), Chinese (zh), English (en), French (fr), Russian (ru), and Spanish (es)), as well as German (de) and Japanese (ja), as the test languages.We conducted 8-shot tests on seven subtasks in Flores-101 , including zh-en, zh-fr, zh-es, zh-ar, zh-ru, zh-ja and zh-de.The evaluation is conducted with OpenCompass.</p>
<p>In the multilingual domain, as shown in Table 7, Baichuan 2-7B-Base surpasses all models of the same size in all seven tasks and shows significant improvement compared to Baichuan 1-7B.</p>
<p>Baichuan 2-13B-Base outperforms models of the same size in four out of the seven tasks.In the zh-en and zh-ja tasks, it surpasses GPT3.5 Turbo and reaches the level of GPT-4.Compared to Baichuan 1-13B-Base, Baichuan 2-13B-Base exhibits significant improvement in the zh-ar, zhru, and zh-ja tasks.</p>
<p>Although GPT-4 still dominates in the field of multilingualism, open-source models are catching up closely.In zh-en tasks, Baichuan 2-13B-Base has slightly surpassed GPT-4.</p>
<p>Safety Evaluations</p>
<p>In Sec. 4, we describe the efforts made to improve the safety of Baichuan 2. However, some prior work indicates that helpfulness and harmlessness are two sides of a seesaw -when harmlessness increases, helpfulness could lead to a bit decrease (Bai et al., 2022a).So we evaluate these two factors before and after safety alignments.</p>
<p>Figure 6 shows the helpfulness and harmlessness before and after the safety alignment of Baichuan 2. We can see that our safety alignment process    did not hurt the helpfulness while significantly improving the harmlessness.</p>
<p>Then we evaluate the safety of our pre-trained models using the Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) dataset.Same as LLaMA 2, we use the cleaned version from the SafeNLP project8 , distinguishing neutral and hate types for the 13 minority groups, forming a 6-shot dataset consistent with the original Toxigen prompt format.Our decoding parameters use temperature 0.1 and top-p 0.9 nucleus sampling.</p>
<p>We use the fine-tuned HateBert version optimized in the Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022) for model evaluation.Inspired by BeaverTails Ji et al. ( 2023)9 , we constructed the Baichuan Harmless Evaluation Dataset (BHED), covering 7 major safety categories of bias/discrimination, insults/profanity, illegal/unethical content, physical health, mental health, financial privacy, and sensitive topics to evaluate the safety of our chat models.</p>
<p>To ensure comprehensive coverage within each category, We ask human annotators to generate 1,400 data samples.This was further expanded through self-instruction and cleaned by humans for fluency, resulting in 70,000 total samples with 10,000 per category.Examples of those safety prompts and principles are shown in the Appendix D.</p>
<p>We use those samples to evaluate different models and the result is shown in Table 9.We can see that Baichuan 2 is on par or outperforms other chat models in our safety evaluations.</p>
<p>Intermediate Checkpoints</p>
<p>We will also release the intermediate checkpoints of 7B models, from 220 billion tokens checkpoint to 2,640 billion tokens checkpoint, which is the final output of Baichuan 2-7B-Base.We examine their performance on several benchmarks and the result is shown in Figure 7.</p>
<p>As shown in the figure, Baichuan 2 demonstrates consistent improvement as training proceeds.Even after 2.6 trillion tokens, there appears to be ample room for further gains.This aligns with previous work on scaling LLMs indicating that data size is a critical factor (Hoffmann et al., 2022).In the Appendix C, we provide more detailed training dynamics for both the 7B and 13B models.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>The field of language models has undergone a renaissance in recent years, sparked largely by the development of deep neural networks and Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017).Kaplan et al. (2020) proposed the scaling laws for large model pre-training.By systematically analyzing model performance as parameters and data size increased, they provided a blueprint for the current era of massive models with hundreds of or even billions of parameters.</p>
<p>Seizing upon these scaling laws, organizations like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic have engaged in a computing arms race to create everlarger LLMs.Spurred by the OpenAI's 175 billion parameters proprietary language model GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).The few-shot or even zero-shot ability of LLMs has revolved most natural language understanding tasks.From code generation to math-solving problems or even openworld scenarios.Specialized scientific LLMs like Galactica (Taylor et al., 2022) have also emerged to showcase the potential for large models to assimilate technical knowledge.However, raw parameter count alone does not determine model capability -Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) demonstrated that scaling model capacity according to the number of tokens, rather than just parameters, can yield better sample efficiency.</p>
<p>Concurrent with the development of private LLMs, academic and non-profit efforts have worked to develop open-source alternatives like Bloom (Scao et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022) and Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023b).Although some open-source large language models contain up to 175 billion parameters, most are trained on only 500 billion tokens or less.This is relatively small considering that 7 billion parameter models can still significantly improve after being trained on trillions of tokens.Among those open-sourced models, LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023b) and its successor LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023c) stands out for its performance and transparency.Which was quickly optimized by the community for better inference speed and various applications.</p>
<p>In addition to those foundation models, a lot of chat models have also been proposed to follow human instructions.Most of them fine-tune the foundation models to align with human (OpenAI, 2022;Wang et al., 2023).Those chat models have demonstrated a marked improvement in understanding human instructions and solving complex tasks (Chiang et al., 2023;Xu et al., 2023;Sun et al., 2023).To further improve alignment, (Ouyang et al., 2022) incorporates the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) approach.This involves learning from human preferences by training a reward model on human-rated outputs.Other methods such as direct preference optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b) have also been proposed to improve the RLHF both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Limitations and Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>Like other large language models, Baichuan 2 also faces ethical challenges.It's prone to biases and toxicity, especially given that much of its training data originates from the internet.Despite our best efforts to mitigate these issues using benchmarks like Toxigen (Hartvigsen et al., 2022), the risks cannot be eliminated, and toxicity tends to increase with model size.Moreover, the knowledge of Baichuan 2 models is static and can be outdated or incorrect, posing challenges in fields that require up-to-date information like medicine or law.While optimized for Chinese and English for safety, the model has limitations in other languages and may not fully capture biases relevant to non-Chinese cultures.</p>
<p>There's also the potential for misuse, as the model could be used to generate harmful or misleading content.Although we try our best efforts to balance safety and utility, some safety measures may appear as over-cautions, affecting the model's usability for certain tasks.We encourage users to make responsible and ethical use of Baichuan 2 models.Meanwhile, we will continue to optimize these issues and release updated versions in the future.</p>
<p>A Scaling laws</p>
<p>We use 7 models to fit the scaling laws of Baichuan 2. The parameter details are shown in Table 10.The losses of the 7 different models are shown in Figure 8.</p>
<p>B NormHead</p>
<p>By conducting a word embedding KNN retrieval task, where given a query word the nearest K words are retrieved.We found that the semantic information is mainly encoded by the cosine similarity of embedding rather than L 2 distance.i.e., The KNN results of cosine similarity are words with semantic similarity while the KNN results of L 2 distance are meaningless in some way.Since the current linear classifier computes logits by dot product, which is a mixture of L 2 distance and cosine similarity.To alleviate the distraction of L 2 distance, We propose to compute the logits by the angle only.We normalized the output Embedding so that the dot product is not affected by the norm of embedding.</p>
<p>To validate this operation, we conduct an ablation experiment where we add or remove the normalization before softmax and train a 7B model for 12k steps.All the hyper-parameters and data are the same with Baichuan 2-7B.The training loss is shown in Figure 9.We can see that when removing the NormHead the training became very unstable at the beginning, on the contrary, after we normalized the head the training became very stable, which resulted in better performance.</p>
<p>C Training Dynamics</p>
<p>In this section, we analyze the training dynamics of our model.We save the checkpoints of Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B every 1000 steps.And evaluate those intermediate results on C-Eval development set (Huang et al., 2023), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) , CMMLU (Li et al., 2023) , JEC-QA (Zhong et al., 2020), GSM8K (Shi et al., 2022) and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021).The result is shown in Figure 10.</p>
<p>As shown, both the 7B and 13B models demonstrate substantial gains as training progresses.However, on general benchmarks such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) and C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), improvements appear to plateau after 2 trillion tokens.In contrast, consistent gains are achieved on the GSM8K math tasks even beyond 2 trillion tokens.This suggests training FLOPs may strongly correlate with improvements in math problem solving, which may be further studied.</p>
<p>D Baichuan Harmless Evaluation Dataset</p>
<p>WARNING: this section contains unsafe, offensive, or upsetting examples of text.</p>
<p>We proposed the Baichuan Harmless Evaluation Dataset (BHED) to evaluate the chat models, as described in Section 5.5.Here we introduce the principles and cases of BHED.</p>
<p>The seven major safety categories consist of bias and discrimination, insults and profanity, illegal/unethical content, physical health, mental health, financial privacy, and sensitive topics.</p>
<p>To ensure diversity within each category, multiple sub-dimensions were considered: • Bias/discrimination covers various forms such as nationality, ethnicity, race/skin color, groups, occupation, gender, region, industry, etc. to ensure data diversity.• Insults/profanity includes both explicit and implicit insults as well as internet verbal abuse.• Illegal/unethical content encompasses criminal law, civil law, economic law, international law, traffic regulations, local administrative regulations, etc. • Physical health covers health knowledge, medical advice, and discrimination related to physical health.• Mental health encompasses emotional health, cognitive and social health, self-esteem and self-worth, coping with stress and adaptability, psychological suggestions, and discrimination against groups with mental health issues.• Financial privacy includes real estate, personal debt, banking information, income, stock recommendations, etc. Privacy includes personal information, family information, occupational information, contact details, private life, etc. • Sensitive topics include racial hatred, international political issues, legal loopholes, human-AI relationships, etc.We collect 10k prompts for each of the categories, some examples are shown in Table 11.</p>
<p>E Details of MMLU and C-Eval</p>
<p>We provide the score of Baichuan 2 on each subject of C-Eval in Table 12 and MMLU in Table 13.</p>

Figure 4: The scaling law of Baichuan 2. We trained various models ranging from 10 million to 3 billion parameters with 1 trillion tokens.By fitting a power law term to the losses given training flops, we predicted losses for training Baichuan 2-7B and Baichuan 2-13B on 2.6 trillion tokens.This fitting process precisely predicted the final models' losses (marked with two stars).</p>
<p>Figure 5 :

Figure 5: An illustration of Baichuan 2's RLHF process.</p>
<p>of reward model training, prompts within each category should have sufficient diversity to ensure the reward model can generalize well.Given a prompt, responses are generated by Baichuan 2 models of different sizes and stages (SFT, PPO) to enhance response diversity.Only responses generated by the Baichuan 2 model family are used in the RM training.Responses from other open-source datasets and proprietary models do not improve the reward model's accuracy.This also underscores the intrinsic consistency of the Baichuan 2 model series from another perspective.The loss function used for training the reward model is consistent with that in InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022).</p>
<p>use GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) (4-shot) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) (4-shot) to evaluate the mathematical ability.MATH contains 12,500 mathematical questions that are harder to be solved.To evaluate the model's code ability, we report the scores in HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021) (0-shot) and MBPP (Austin et al., 2021) (3-shot).• HumanEval is a series of programming tasks including model language comprehension, reasoning, algorithms, and simple mathematics to evaluate the correctness of the model and measure the model's problem-solving ability.• MBPP.It consists of a dataset of 974 Python short functions and program textual descriptions, along with test cases used to verify the correctness of their functionality.</p>

Specifically, we do notexperiments, the choice of positional embeddingapply any normalization to the input text and wedid not significantly impact model performance.do not add a dummy prefix as in Baichuan 1. WeTo enable further research on bias-based andsplit numbers into individual digits to better encodemultiplication-based attention, we apply RoPE onnumeric data. To handle code data containing extraBaichuan 2-7B and ALiBi on Baichuan 2-13B,whitespaces, we add whitespace-only tokens to theconsistent with Baichuan 1.tokenizer. The character coverage is set to 0.9999,with rare characters falling back to UTF-8 bytes.We set the maximum token length to 32 to accountfor long Chinese phrases. The training data for theBaichuan 2 tokenizer comes from the Baichuan2 pre-training corpus, with more sampled codeexamples and academic papers to improve coverage(Taylor et al., 2022). Table 2 shows a detailedcomparison of Baichuan 2's tokenizer with others.2.3.1 Positional EmbeddingsBuilding on Baichuan 1, we adopt RotaryPositional Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2021)for Baichuan 2-7B and ALiBi (Press et al.,2021) for Baichuan 2-13B. ALiBi is a morerecent positional encoding technique that hasshown improved extrapolation performance.However, most open-sourced models use RoPE forpositional embeddings, and optimized attentionimplementations like Flash Attention (Dao et al.,2022; Dao, 2023) are currently better suited toRoPE since it is multiplication-based, bypassingthe need for passing attention_mask to theattention operation.
