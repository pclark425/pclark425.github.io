                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Plasma phosphorylated tau 217 in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract An accurate blood test for Alzheimer’s disease that is sensitive to preclinical proteinopathy and cognitive decline has clear implications for early detection and secondary prevention. We assessed the performance of plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (pTau217) against brain PET markers of amyloid [[11C]-labelled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)] and tau ([18F]MK-6240) and its utility for predicting longitudinal cognition. Samples were analysed from a subset of participants with up to 8 years follow-up in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP; 2001–present; plasma 2011–present), a longitudinal cohort study of adults from midlife, enriched for parental history of Alzheimer’s disease. Participants were a convenience sample who volunteered for at least one PiB scan, had usable banked plasma and were cognitively unimpaired at first plasma collection. Study personnel who interacted with participants or samples were blind to amyloid status. We used mixed effects models and receiver–operator characteristic curves to assess concordance between plasma pTau217 and PET biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and mixed effects models to understand the ability of plasma pTau217 to predict longitudinal performance on WRAP’s preclinical Alzheimer’s cognitive composite (PACC-3). The primary analysis included 165 people (108 women; mean age = 62.9 ± 6.06; 160 still enrolled; 2 deceased; 3 discontinued). Plasma pTau217 was strongly related to PET-based estimates of concurrent brain amyloid (β^ = 0.83 (0.75, 0.90), P < 0.001). Concordance was high between plasma pTau217 and both amyloid PET (area under the curve = 0.91, specificity = 0.80, sensitivity = 0.85, positive predictive value = 0.58, negative predictive value = 0.94) and tau PET (area under the curve = 0.95, specificity = 1, sensitivity = 0.85, positive predictive value = 1, negative predictive value = 0.98). Higher baseline pTau217 levels were associated with worse cognitive trajectories (β^pTau×age = −0.07 (−0.09, −0.06), P < 0.001). In a convenience sample of unimpaired adults, plasma pTau217 levels correlate well with concurrent brain Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology and with prospective cognitive performance. These data indicate that this marker can detect disease before clinical signs and thus may disambiguate presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease from normal cognitive ageing.</p>

<p>Results of linear mixed effect models of PACC-3 as a function of covariates plus baseline plasma pTau 217 and its interaction with age, in two sensitivity sets. The first sensitivity set includes the primary analysis set plus eight additional participants who were cognitively impaired at first plasma draw (N=6), who did not have a consensus diagnosis at this visit (N=1) or who had extreme values of pTau 217 (N=1). The second sensitivity set includes the primary analysis set, minus 6 observations on 5 participants for which the observed pTau 217 values were below the lower limit of detection. In both models, age was modeled as a second-degree polynomial. Models included a per-participant random intercept.

1Longitudinal plasma pTau , sensitivity set 1 (including 6 participants who were cognitively impaired at baseline; one with no baseline diagnosis; and one influential pTau 217 observation). Observations from a single participant are shown with connected edges. (A) Plasma pTau 217 as a function of age at blood draw. Color indicates the extent of tau burden as indicated on tau PET. (B) Plasma pTau 217 as a function of estimated PiB DVR at the time of plasma acquisition. Color indicates the extent of tau burden as indicated on tau PET. (C) Plasma pTau 217 as a function of age at blood draw. Color indicates amyloid PET positivity. Lines with shaded confidence bands represent slope estimates from a linear mixed effects model of pTau 217 as a function of the interaction of age and amyloid positivity. (D) Distribution of pTau 217 among PiB-and PiB+ participants. (E) Distribution of pTau 217 among MK-and MK+ participants. (F) Receiveroperator characteristic (ROC) curve relating pTau 217 to binary PiB status. Two positivity thresholds were considered for PiB: global DVR &gt; 1.19 (red) and global DVR &gt; 1.16 (blue). (G) ROC curve relating pTau 217 to binary MK status. Scans were marked as MK+ if tracer binding was evident in both medial temporal lobe and neocortex, and MK-otherwise. DVR = distribution volume ratio; GBTM-DVR = group-based trajectory modeled DVR from amyloid PET; MK = [ 18 F]-MK-6240 tau tracer; PiB = Pittsburgh compound B; pTau 217 = phosphorylated tau 217; ROC = receiver-operator characteristic.
