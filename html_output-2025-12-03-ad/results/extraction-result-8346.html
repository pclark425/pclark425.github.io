                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) continue to demonstrate increasingly competitive performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, more intricate and comprehensive benchmarks have been developed to assess these cutting-edge models. These benchmarks introduce new challenges to core capabilities such as perception, reasoning, and planning. However, existing multimodal benchmarks fall short in providing a focused evaluation of multi-step planning based on spatial relationships in images. To bridge this gap, we present ING-VP, the first INteractive Game-based Vision Planning benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate the spatial imagination and multi-step reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ING-VP features 6 distinct games, encompassing 300 levels, each with 6 unique configurations. A single model engages in over 60,000 rounds of interaction. The benchmark framework allows for multiple comparison settings, including image-text vs. text-only inputs, single-step vs. multi-step reasoning, and with-history vs. without-history conditions, offering valuable insights into the model's capabilities. We evaluated numerous state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the highest-performing model, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, achieving an average accuracy of only 3.37%, far below the anticipated standard. This work aims to provide a specialized evaluation framework to drive advancements in MLLMs' capacity for complex spatial reasoning and planning. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Thisisus7/ING-VP.git.</p>

<p>ING-VP: MLLMS CANNOT PLAY EASY VISION-BASED GAMES YET

As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) continue to demonstrate increasingly competitive performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, more intricate and comprehensive benchmarks have been developed to assess these cutting-edge models.These benchmarks introduce new challenges to core capabilities such as perception, reasoning, and planning.However, existing multimodal benchmarks fall short in providing a focused evaluation of multi-step planning based on spatial relationships in images.To bridge this gap, we present ING-VP, the first INteractive Game-based Vision Planning benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate the spatial imagination and multi-step reasoning abilities of MLLMs.ING-VP features 6 distinct games, encompassing 300 levels, each with 6 unique configurations.A single model engages in over 60,000 rounds of interaction.The benchmark framework allows for multiple comparison settings, including image-text vs. text-only inputs, single-step vs. multi-step reasoning, and with-history vs. without-history conditions, offering valuable insights into the model's capabilities.We evaluated numerous state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the highest-performing model, Claude-3.5Sonnet, achieving an average accuracy of only 3.37%, far below the anticipated standard.This work aims to provide a specialized evaluation framework to drive advancements in MLLMs' capacity for complex spatial reasoning and planning.The code is publicly available at</p>
<p>Additionally, it offers a highly efficient interactive environment for both inference and analysis.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, generation, and even textual complex reasoning and planning (Zhao et al., 2023).Building upon this powerful foundation of LLMs, integrating visual inputs has led to the development of even Preprint more powerful models (OpenAI, 2024;Anil et al., 2023a), a.k.a multimodal large language models (MLLMs).</p>
<p>Despite demonstrating impressive performance in handling most general multimodal tasks, the effectiveness of MLLM in multimodal reasoning and planning still remains unclear.Moreover, recent studies (Lu et al., 2024;Dai et al., 2024) indicate that vision-language training might degrade the textual capabilities of MLLMs, suggesting that MLLMs built upon LLMs could be impaired when adapted to multimodal reasoning and planning tasks.Consequently, there is an urgent need for a test that incorporates multimodal complex reasoning and planning cases to guide the subsequent enhancements of MLLMs.</p>
<p>To address this issue, existing studies generally utilize visual question answering (VQA) (Antol et al., 2015;Kafle &amp; Kanan, 2017) and game-based evaluations (Wu et al., 2023;Bellemare et al., 2013) to assess the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.In general, VQA necessitates a verified ground-truth answer that relies on human annotations.But acquiring these annotations is both costly and time-consuming.Moreover, the absence of interaction and planning in typical VQA tasks poses difficulties in evaluating the reasoning and planning capabilities of advanced MLLMs.The tasks presented in these benchmarks are overly simplistic (Yue et al., 2023) or only test reasoning within domain-specific knowledge (Yue et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2024a), which mainly evaluates the LLM knowledge of MLLMs rather than the perception, reasoning, and planning of MLLMs.Therefore, recent studies (Xu et al., 2024;Chia et al., 2024) prompt MLLMs to interact with digital game environments, which are measured by game outcomes and scores, leading to the game-based evaluation.Unlike VQA tasks, these methods can evaluate the multi-step reasoning capabilities and even spatial imagination of MLLMs, which is crucial function of human cognition, allowing us to interact with realistic environments (Wu et al., 2024).Despite the effectiveness, these works are typically restricted to individual games with complex rules, involve time-consuming evaluation episodes, and fail to effectively assess the models' generalization capabilities in multimodal planning.Considering these challenges, our goal is to develop a generalizable and efficient benchmark to evaluate the multi-step planning abilities of MLLMs, providing insights for subsequent improvements of MLLMs with complex multi-step reasoning.</p>
<p>To fill this gap, in this paper, we introduce the INteractive Game-based Vision Planning benchmark (ING-VP), meticulously focusing on evaluating the spatial imagination and multi-step reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Figure 1 shows games, evaluation settings, and the interactive process in our ING-VP.To construct our ING-VP, we initially collect six games featuring easily understandable rules.In each game, we collect 50 levels, each comprising both an image and a text representation of the current state, providing vision and textual inputs for MLLMs, as illustrated in Figure 2. To assess the spatial imagination and planning capabilities of MLLMs, we establish six experimental settings, which prompt the models to perform single-step and multi-step reasoning, with or without historical interaction.During the evaluation, we employ MLLMs to interact within the environment until the game is completed.To evaluate model performance comprehensively, beyond merely determining whether a model can finish a game, we also use the model's action efficiency and the remaining steps to complete the game as evaluation metrics.</p>
<p>With our ING-VP, we test 15 open-and closed-source MLLMs and analyze their performance on our test cases.We first support the benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step reasoning and spatial imagination capabilities of MLLMs -ING-VP bench.Then we analyze these capabilities of current open-and closed-source MLLMs, despite a performance gap, the leading open-source model, InternVL2-Llama3-76B, achieves an accuracy of 2.50%, ranking just behind Claude-3.5Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5Pro.Notably, its performance significantly surpasses that of GPT-4o mini, which stands at 1.05%, and GPT-4v, which records a mere 0.32%.We also conduct a detailed analysis of these models' performance, the evidence shows that:</p>
<p>• The inability to process the relative positions of elements is one of the primary issues with MLLM perception.</p>
<p>• Even the most advanced MLLMs have very limited planning capabilities, far below the performance of ordinary humans on these simple tasks.</p>
<p>• Current models tend to generate instructions that are much longer than necessary to complete the levels.While this can improve accuracy on simple levels, it also indirectly reveals that MLLMs are "uncertain" about the correct solution.</p>
<p>RELATED WORK</p>
<p>Multimodal Large Language Models.LLMs (Achiam et al., 2023;Anil et al., 2023b) have demonstrated their ability of generating human-like texts to understand and respond to complex instructional queries.The successes of LLMs has elicited the burgeoning proliferation of multi-modal LLMs (Alayrac et al., 2022;Li et al., 2023b;Liu et al., 2024;Sun et al., 2024;Jin et al., 2023b), which is designed to process and integrate multiple types of data.The primary attempt Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) endows visual-language models with in-context few-shot learning capabilities by trained on large-scale interleaved text-image data.BLIP2 (Li et al., 2023b) designs a Q-Former architecture to align the visual-textual knowledge during the pre-training phase.LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024) collect GPT-4 generated multimodal language-image instruction-following data and train a general-purpose visual-language assistant.Beyond multimodal understanding, EMU-2 (Sun et al., 2024) and LaVIT (Jin et al., 2023b) take one step further and act as generative multimodal model to support visual prompting and object-grounded generation.</p>
<p>MLLM Benchmarks.The development of MLLMs has highlighted the critical need of benchmarks for thorough evaluations.Although traditional visual-language tasks (e.g., visual question answering (Antol et al., 2015;Kafle &amp; Kanan, 2017) and image captioning (Lin et al., 2014;Plummer et al., 2015)) can be used as evaluation benchmarks, they are too strict and require the exact match with the ground-truth answers.To this end, LVLM-eHub (Xu et al., 2023) andLAMM (Yin et al., 2024) reformulate exiting public datasets as evaluation samples and employ human annotators or GPT to assess the quality.MME (Li et al., 2024), MMBench (Liu et al., 2023b) and SEED-Bench (Li et al., 2024) construct multiple-choice questions to mitigate the subjectivity and instability of GPT evaluation.MMMU (Yue et al., 2024) evaluate the advanced perception and reasoning of MLLMs on specific domains (e.g., science, business).</p>
<p>Game-based Evaluations.Digital games are acknowledged as essential in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence since they present complex challenges requiring advanced reasoning and cognitive skills.These challenges make digital games an ideal benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of MLLMs (Wu et al., 2023;Bellemare et al., 2013;Hu et al., 2024;Sweetser, 2024;Xu et al., 2024) including the environment perception (Hong et al., 2023;Akoury et al., 2023), memory construction (Zhu et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2024b;Ding et al., 2023;Park et al., 2022;Liu et al., 2023a), reasoning (Liu et al., 2023a;Wang et al., 2023a;Qian et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2022) and decision-making (Chen et al., 2023;Zhou et al., 2023;Jin et al., 2023a;Qian et al., 2023).Several methods focus on semantic-level perception of environmental elements including locations, objects or actions in games.They either use basic text input of user ideas (Li et al., 2023a) or game state variables and dialogues (Akoury et al., 2023;Park et al., 2022;2023).Role-based inputs, e.g., the inclusion of character, story, role-related information (Hong et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023b) and skills (Gong et al., 2023) are often included.TorchCraft (Synnaeve et al., 2016) is presented to use real-time strategy games such as StarCraft: Brood War to serve as a benchmark for AI research.The Chess game has long been employed as an AI testing ground (Noever et al., 2020;Stöckl, 2021;Toshniwal et al., 2022).Chess Transformer (Noever et al., 2020) 2.</p>
<p>ING-VP features 6 games that are conceptually simple yet cognitively challenging: Sokoban, Maze, Sudoku, 8-queens, Tower of Hanoi, and 15-puzzle.The simplicity lies in the easily comprehensible rules and the ability to encapsulate complete level information within a single image, facilitating comprehensive reasoning.The challenge stems from the requirement for models to precisely capture core visual elements and their spatial relationships, necessitating multi-step reasoning to successfully complete each level.We meticulously craft 6 reasoning settings, enabling researchers to systematically identify the strengths and limitations of target models through comparative analysis of performance across these settings.</p>
<p>SIX INFERENCE SETTINGS</p>
<p>One-step: Image and Text-only Settings In the One-step with Image setting, we provide the model solely with an image depicting the initial game state and prompt it to generate comprehensive instructions for level completion.The One-step Text-only setting follows an identical approach, with the key distinction being the replacement of the image input with its corresponding textual representation.</p>
<p>Multi</p>
<p>GAME SELECTION</p>
<p>We chose six games that are widely recognized, have straightforward rules, and operate in a deterministic environment, making them ideal representatives for our study.In a deterministic environment, the outcome of every action taken by an agent is predictable and certain.Such an environment can be formally defined using a Markov Decision Process (MDP).The model employs a strategy π to determine the next action a t based on the current state s t and all previous actions a 0:t−1 , represented as:
a t = π(s t , a 0:t−1 )(1)
The planning process of MLLMs can be expressed as:
S ′ = π(S, A, G, n)(2)
Where S ′ is the future sequence of states, which terminates upon achieving the goal G or exhausting the available moves n; S is the current sequence of states; A represents the current sequence of actions.</p>
<p>DATA COLLECTION</p>
<p>Sokoban.It involves pushing crates onto designated storage locations within a warehouse maze.We select 50 levels from the Sasquatch dataset1 .To mitigate difficulty and prevent data leakage, we employ the A-star algorithm to constrain each level to a maximum of 8 steps for completion.</p>
<p>Maze.The Maze game challenges players to navigate from a starting point to a target through a network of paths.We employ a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to automatically generate 50 solvable levels, each with an 11x11 grid size.We also constrain the solution length to a maximum of 8 steps.</p>
<p>8-Queens.The 8-Queens puzzle challenges people to place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.N-Queens is a special game due to its standard formulation: models could potentially solve it without visual input, relying solely on memorized patterns from training data.To ensure that visual reasoning is essential, we modify the puzzle by manually placing the first queen in a different position for each level.The image presented to the MLLMs shows this initial configuration, requiring them to reason from this starting point to complete the puzzle.</p>
<p>Sudoku.Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle that requires filling a 9x9 grid such that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all digits from 1 to 9 without repetition.A well-formed Sudoku puzzle with a unique solution requires a minimum of 17 initial clues.For our benchmark, we curate a set of 50 puzzles with each puzzle contain 71 clues from a Kaggle dataset 2 , ensuring each puzzle meets this criterion.We then manually generate corresponding images for each level to maintain consistency with our benchmark's visual reasoning focus.</p>
<p>Hanoi The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves transferring a stack of disks of varying diameters from one rod to another, adhering to the constraint that a larger disk must never be placed atop a smaller one.In our implementation, each problem instance consists of four rods and five disks, with an optimal solution requiring a minimum of 8 moves.</p>
<p>15-Puzzle It's a classical sliding tile puzzle comprising a 4x4 grid with 15 numbered tiles and one vacant space.The objective is to rearrange the tiles into numerical order through a series of sliding movements.In our implementation, we employ the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore solution paths, constraining the search depth to 8 moves as previous games.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p>We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employ a zero-shot setting to faithfully emulate the human puzzle-solving process, given the unique nature of our tasks.A uniform set of prompts was applied across all models.The complete set of 36 prompts is presented in the Appendix B.</p>
<p>BASELINES</p>
<p>MLLMs.We consider a comprehensive suite of mainstream large multimodal models.Closed-source models include GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4v, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude-3.5Sonnet, Claude-3 Opus, and Gemini-1.5Pro.Open-source models consist of CogVLM2-19B, DeepSeek-VL, Internvl-Chat-v1.5, Internvl2-8B, Internvl2-26B, Internvl2-40B, InternVL2-Llama3-76B, and MiniCPM-V2.6.We utilize each model's official API for closed-source systems or the publicly available checkpoint for open-source implementations, More information of these models can be found in the Appendix A.</p>
<p>Evaluation.We present a systematic interactive environment for evaluating all MLLMs, where models interact with the game environment until either completing the task or exhausting the allotted steps.We constrain the model's output action instructions to JSON format through prompts and extract them using regular expressions.The correctly extracted instructions are then used as input for the game environment.After the game state changes, the new state is fed back to the model for the next round of inference.We employ three metrics: accuracy, completion degree, and action efficiency.( 1) Accuracy is our main metric, it measures whether the model can complete the task within the specified number of steps.( 2) Completion degree is determined by the final state of the game environment after interaction with the model.The ING-VP benchmark poses a substantial challenge to current MLLMs: Even the most advanced model, Claude-3.5Sonnet, achieves an accuracy of only 3.37%.In contrast, an average human can easily complete all of these tasks (8-queens is an exception), highlighting a significant gap between model performance and human capabilities on the ING-VP benchmark.</p>
<p>Performance disparity between open-source and closed-source models persists: While the performance of closed-source models on ING-VP is far from satisfactory, they still outperform the open-source models.The best-performing open-source model, InternVL2-Llama3-76B, achieves an accuracy of 2.50%, which remains lower than Claude-3.5Sonnet, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5Pro.</p>
<p>For MLLMs, the greatest challenge in perception is understanding location information.According to our observations of the inference results, the most advanced models, such as Claude-3.5Sonnet and GPT-4o, can generally identify the elements present and even count the quantity of each in the Sokoban game.However, they struggle to accurately determine precise location information, leading to very low inference accuracy and degree of task completion.</p>
<p>Merely breaking down the steps is unhelpful and may even be counterproductive.In text-only tasks, Claude-3.5Sonnet and GPT-4o achieve accuracy rates of 2.30% and 3.30%, respectively, in the multi-step setting, which are lower than their 8.00% and 4.30% accuracy in the one-step setting.For the ING-VP benchmark, thinking step by step does not work and even has a negative effect.We Preprint believe that MLLMs rely heavily on pattern matching based on prior training data, generating outputs from similar inputs rather than engaging in actual planning.In this section, We conduct a comprehensive range of analyses to explore the generative capabilities of MLLMs in a broader context, while also dissecting the nuanced output tendencies of current models.We hope our results can provides valuable insights that can inform future model design and training strategies.</p>
<p>Error Analysis.We collate and analyze 555 errors (image-text: 279, text-only: 276) made by Claude-3.5Sonnet in one-step setting, as illustrated in Figure 3.It is important to note that while we categorize each case under distinct error types, in many instances the model exhibited errors in both comprehension and reasoning.Our classification follows contextual cues: when the model provided invalid instructions from the outset, we labele it as an understanding error.Conversely, if the model deviated from the correct solution at an intermediate step, we classify it as a reasoning error.Below, we summarize key observations based on these error types:</p>
<p>• Perceptual Errors (55.2%/-%):These errors occur exclusively in the image-text setting.</p>
<p>While current models are generally able to recognize overall attributes of an image-such as identifying the game genre and its components, their ability to accurately interpret fine details, including the specific size and precise location of each element, remains limited (e.g., see Figure 7.This perceptual limitation represents a major contributor to the elevated error rates in this setting.• Textual Understanding Errors (2.9%/58.0%):Textual understanding errors manifest in two main forms: a misinterpretation of specific prompts or an inability to correctly parse data structures or character matrices used to represent game levels in the text-only setting (as shown in Figure 8).These errors indicate that the model struggles to generalize its understanding when presented with text structures not commonly encountered in its training data.• Planning Errors (41.9%/42.0%):Planning errors constitute another major issue for Claude-3.5Sonnet.In these cases, the model initially provides plausible steps but eventually fails due to its inability to correctly track or judge the game state after several steps (see Figure 9).This suggests a breakdown in maintaining consistent reasoning over multi-step processes.• Other Errors: During error analysis, we observe that Claude-3.5Sonnet and GPT-4o never refused to answer queries, and all responses were accurately extracted.However, models such as GPT-4V displayed issues like refusal to respond or failure to adhere to the required response format, which hindered our ability to retrieve the outputs.</p>
<p>Planning Capacity Analysis.We select the game where models performed best-Maze-and introduced three additional difficulty levels: 4 steps, 12 steps, and 16 steps, by adjusting only the number of moves required to complete the level, while maintaining the same level structure.This allowed us to closely examine the planning capabilities of the most advanced MLLMs, Claude-3.5Sonnet and GPT-4o, as shown in FIgure 4. Our findings showed a significant decline in both accuracy and completion degree as the number of required steps increased.However, action efficiency, which emphasizes perception and judgment of the current state, was not notably affected, since modifying the step count without altering the overall layout had little impact on this metric.</p>
<p>Comparative Analysis.We compare the results across different metrics, settings, and models, aiming to highlight the characteristics of current MLLMs.• Results differ across metrics.Of the three metrics provided by ING-VP, accuracy-being the most stringent-typically yields the lowest scores.The primary reason action efficiency is often significantly higher than both completion rate and accuracy is that models frequently generate instructions that alter the game state, but these changes have minimal impact on successfully completing the level.A notable example is Gemini-1.5Pro, which achieves an average action efficiency of 76.52% on the 15-puzzle, yet only 0.67% and 3.42% in accuracy and completion rate, respectively.</p>
<p>• Image-text vs. Text-only.Comparing the performance of each model in the image-text and text-only settings, we found that most test subjects performed better in the text-only setting.This highlights that limitations in image comprehension remain a key factor constraining the performance of MLLMs.</p>
<p>• Multi-step vs. One-step.According to the results in Table 3, for most models, multi-step setting improves accuracy compared to one-step.However, there are exceptions, such as Claude-3.5Sonnet.We compare the output of Claude-3.5Sonnet and GPT-4o and find that, despite we set the same parameters for closed-source models, Claude-3.5Sonnet's sampling strategy is more fixed than GPT-4o's.As a result, when the model produces an invalid action in a certain state, it tends to repeatedly generate the same action until all attempts are exhausted.GPT-4o, being more flexible, is better at generating diverse responses.Therefore, although Claude-3.5Sonnet performs better than GPT-4o in one-step tasks, the opposite is true for multi-step tasks.One example is shown in Figure 5.</p>
<p>• With-history vs. Without-history.In our tasks, incorporating the model's historical output as the input for subsequent rounds did not lead to improved performance.Additionally, we introduce an undo option for Sokoban, Sudoku, and N-Queens in the with-history setting.Interestingly, despite the models frequently reaching a state where undoing moves was necessary to complete the level, almost none utilized this feature.This suggests that the models struggle with processing precise positional information and are unable to accurately assess whether the current state is solvable.</p>
<p>TWO THINKING ABOUT PLANNING</p>
<p>A holistic approach may outperform a divide-and-conquer strategy.When humans are tasked with completing a planning problem, whether in a single or multi-step process, it typically involves three key phases: understanding the goal, devising a plan, and breaking down the steps.Large models should operate similarly, yet when presented with the same game level, their outputs differ significantly between one-step and multi-step settings, as highlighted in Table 1.Notably, even the initial steps diverge between the two approaches.To explore the planning capabilities of the model further, we employ two methods to adjust the multi-step output:</p>
<p>• Step-wise Best of N (BoN): The model generates ten candidate responses at each step, with the most frequent answer selected as the final output.• Forced Planning: The model is required to complete its entire plan before producing a final answer, akin to the one-step setting.FIgure 6 illustrates an example of these methods in action, despite these adjustments, the multi-step approach failed to match the performance of the one-step setting.This suggests that, for the large models, even when given identical image, one-step and multi-step tasks are fundamentally different, with the former better eliciting the model's planning capabilities.</p>
<p>Small changes in the prompt phrasing can substantially influence the model's planning effectiveness.A thorough comparison of single-step and multi-step outputs reveals not only differences but also distinct tendencies.For instance, in Maze and Sokoban games, Claude-3.5Sonnet favors "U (Up)" and "D (Down)" in the one-step mode, whereas it prefers "L (Left)" and "R (Right)" in the multi-step mode.Given that most of the prompt wording remains consistent between the two settings, our results indicate that subtle variations can profoundly affect the model's response distribution.We leave more detailed experiments as future work.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce ING-VP, an interactive game-based vision planning benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial imagination and planning capabilities of MLLMs.Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced MLLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance on game tasks that humans find trivial.This underperformance stems from multiple factors: existing models often fail to generate accurate perceptions of images, and they face even greater challenges in making inferences and plans based on their understanding.We believe that ING-VP is of noteworthy to the community's deeper understanding of MLLMs, and can also advance MLLMs' capabilities in comprehension and planning within visual contexts.</p>
<p>LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>Despite its strengths, ING-VP has certain limitations.We deliberately omit difficulty grading settings.</p>
<p>Including simpler levels would significantly increase the likelihood of models completing tasks by chance after sufficient steps, potentially compromising the reliability of our results.Conversely, incorporating more challenging levels would yield little insight, given that MLLMs already struggle with current difficulty levels, and could negatively impact inference efficiency.Furthermore, ING-VP does not exhaustively cover all possible game types.Instead, we focus on selecting well-known and representative games to ensure relevance and broad applicability.Finally, to address efficiency concerns, we do not use images of previous states as input in the multi-step with history setting.These considerations provide clear directions for future enhancements to our benchmark.</p>
