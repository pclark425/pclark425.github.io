                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual understanding and reasoning. However, evaluating their performance across diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity of scientific data. To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding capability of LLMs. It comprises ten domain-specific sub-datasets spanning biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and unstructured texts. SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies: Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection, Multi-source information integration, and Context-aware inference, through a variety of question formats. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.</p>

<p>SciCUEval: A Comprehensive Dataset for Evaluating Scientific Context Understanding in Large Language Models
E7F5316F605BCB375DABF05C51E84C43arXiv:2503.04013.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in contextual understanding and reasoning.However, evaluating their performance across diverse scientific domains remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domains and fail to capture the intricate complexity of scientific data.To bridge this gap, we construct SciCUEval, a comprehensive benchmark dataset tailored to assess the scientific context understanding capability of LLMs.It comprises ten domain-specific subdatasets spanning biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science, integrating diverse data modalities including structured tables, knowledge graphs, and unstructured texts.SciCUEval systematically evaluates four core competencies: Relevant information identification, Information-absence detection, Multisource information integration, and Contextaware inference, through a variety of question formats.We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, providing a fine-grained analysis of their strengths and limitations in scientific context understanding, and offering valuable insights for the future development of scientific-domain LLMs.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation across a wide range of general-domain tasks (Bai et al., 2023a;OpenAI et al., 2024;Dubey et al., 2024;Qwen et al., 2025).However, their application to scientific domains remains challenging due to the unique characteristics of scientific language and knowledge.Scientific texts are often dense with technical terminology, implicit assumptions, multimodal data representations, and tightly interlinked concepts that require deeper contextual comprehension (Beltagy et al., 2019;Mann et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Existing LLM benchmarks in scientific domains (Chen et al., 2025;Sun et al., 2024;Feng et al., 2024;Saikh et al., 2022;Pedersen et al., 2020;Rubungo et al., 2024;Jiang et al., 2025) primarily focus on direct question-answering tasks, offering limited insight into how well LLMs perform in scientific context understanding, particularly for noisy and lengthy contexts.Additionally, they often neglect the heterogeneous and structured nature of scientific data, which can span textual descriptions, relational graphs (Talmor and Berant, 2018;He et al., 2024), and tabular datasets (Fang et al., 2024).In contrast, robust scientific context understanding demands precise information extraction, the ability to identify gaps or missing elements in context, and the integration of multiple evidence sources to support accurate conclusions.</p>
<p>To address this gap, we introduce SciCUEval, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to rigorously evaluate the scientific context understanding capabilities of LLMs.As shown in Figure 1, SciCUEval spans ten domain-specific subdatasets covering diverse disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, biomedicine, and materials science.Each subset incorporates rich external knowledge in multiple forms (structured tables, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and unstructured scientific texts) to represent the data modalities commonly encountered in scientific research.</p>
<p>SciCUEval targets four core competencies essential for scientific understanding: (1) Relevant Information Identification that locate and extract relevant information from complex and lengthy inputs;</p>
<p>(2) Information-Absence Detection that recognize missing, ambiguous, or incomplete contextual elements; (3) Multi-source Information Integration that aggregate and compare information from diverse sources; and (4) Context-Aware Inference that deduce accurate conclusions grounded in sci- For the material with CID 13182, what is its inchikey?entific contexts.These competencies are evaluated using diverse question types, including open-ended Q&amp;A, multiple-choice, content completion, and true/false validation.The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
CID-13182, •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• √ CID XXXXX, ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• × CID XXXXX, ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• ×
• Establishing a scientific context understanding benchmark: We establish a benchmark to evaluate context understanding capabilities of LLMs in scientific domains, serving as a standardized evaluation suite for assessing LLMs' capabilities in identifying, detecting, integrating, and reasoning over scientific contexts.</p>
<p>• Constructing a diverse set of domain-specific context understanding datasets: We construct ten sub-datasets across multiple disciplines, encompassing various data modalities and a wide range of question types to ensure comprehensive evaluation.</p>
<p>• Extensive evaluation and analysis of LLMs:</p>
<p>We systematically evaluate and analyze the performance of various state-of-the-art LLMs on SciCUEval, highlighting their strengths and limitations, and offering insights for improvement.</p>
<p>Backgrounds and Related Works</p>
<p>Context Understanding Tasks Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in context understanding (Huang et al., 2023;Dong et al., 2022).This paradigm allows LLMs to adapt flexibly to new external knowledge without requiring additional fine-tuning or retraining (Lewis et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2024).Importantly, LLMs have shown strong performance across a wide range of domains when equipped with additional context.Furthermore, in-context learning strengthens LLMs' transparency by firmly establishing their arguments in the documents that were obtained (Mialon et al., 2023;Xiong et al., 2024).However, despite its potential, context understanding remains sensitive to prompt design and the quality of the provided context.It also demands that the model possess a robust ability to process and comprehend long texts.In this study, we systematically investigate the robustness and effectiveness of LLMs for context understanding in diverse scientific domains.</p>
<p>Context Understanding Benchmarks The development of robust and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating long context understanding has gained increasing attention in recent research (Li et al., 2024;Liu et al., 2024;Bai et al., 2023b;Zhang et al., 2024c;Wu et al., 2025;Chen et al., 2020Chen et al., , 2021))</p>
<p>Datasets</p>
<p>This section presents the dataset construction process in SciCUEval, which involves formulating evaluation competencies, collecting scientific data, generating questions and answers, and conducting rigorous verification.</p>
<p>Evaluation Competencies</p>
<p>Inspired by the ability definition in (Chen et al., 2024), we formulate four capabilities essential for evaluating LLMs in scientific contexts:</p>
<p>• Relevant Information Identification: LLMs must effectively distinguish between relevant information and extraneous noise within complex scientific contexts.In real-world scenarios, scientific data often contains contextually related but non-essential information.Robust models should be able to filter out such noise to ensure accurate understanding and responses.</p>
<p>• Information-absence Detection: The ability to abstain from responding when all contextual data is irrelevant or unreliable.Scientific queries often require precise evidence, and when no valid information is present in the context, LLMs should refrain from generating speculative or hallucinated responses.</p>
<p>• Multi-source Information Integration: Scientific queries often require synthesizing data from multiple sources.LLMs must aggregate and compare information across different contextual segments to generate precise and contextually grounded answers.These four competencies form the foundation of SciCUEval and provide a systematic evaluation framework for context understanding in scientific domains.</p>
<p>Source Data Collection</p>
<p>Scientific Domains To evaluate LLMs in scientific contexts comprehensively, we curate data from diverse scientific domains, including Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Biomedicine, and Materials Science.These disciplines are fundamental to modern science, encompassing a wide range of knowledge from theoretical principles to experimental data, ensuring a broad and representative assessment of long-context understanding capabilities in scientific applications.</p>
<p>Data Modalities</p>
<p>To support a broad evaluation of scientific context understanding capabilities, we consider three distinct data modalities: (1) Unstructured Text, (2) Structured Tables , and (3) Semistructured Knowledge Graphs (KGs).Each modality presents unique challenges, enabling a holistic assessment of LLMs' retrieval, synthesis, reasoning, and integration capabilities in scientific domains.Specifically, unstructured text corpora consist of scientific literature, allowing LLMs to retrieve, synthesize, and infer domain knowledge from textual sources.We collect thousands of recent research papers and experimental protocols from open-access repositories such as arXiv.Structured tables contain numerical and categorical data, testing LLMs' capacity to interpret structured knowledge, recognize contextual dependencies, and perform quantitative reasoning.We collect nuclear data from IAEA 1 , material properties from Material Project 2 , and molecular and protein properties from PubChem 3 .Knowledge graphs encode scientific knowledge as interconnected entities and relational networks, enabling the assessment of LLMs' abilities in relational inference, hierarchical knowledge traversal, and crossdomain knowledge synthesis.We collect wellestablished scientific KGs, including Gene Ontology 4 for gene-function relationships, HIPPIE (Alanis-Lobato et al., 2016) for protein-protein interactions, PharmKG (Zheng et al., 2021) for drugtarget interactions, and PrimeKG (Chandak et al., 2023) for clinical entity relationships.</p>
<p>Data Generation</p>
<p>Building on the collected source data, we construct corresponding datasets tailored to assess the proposed four competencies outlined in Sec.3.1.The data generation pipeline is illustrated in Figure 2, which involves (1) question generation, (2) noise injection, and (3) quality control.</p>
<p>Question Generation</p>
<p>We first sample a subset of texts, table rows, or KG triples from the full databases,
D = {d i | d i = ϕ(S), i = 1, 2, . . . , N }, (1)
where S denote the large-scale scientific data source, and ϕ is the sampling operation.d i is a 1 https://www-nds.iaea.org 2 https://next-gen.materialsproject.org 3 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov 4 https://geneontology.org  single data record or a small set of related entries.</p>
<p>Given each selected data unit d i , the question generation process is defined as:
(q i , a i ) = f LLM (p ⊕ d i ),(2)
where p is a manually designed prompt, and ⊕ denotes string concatenation.f LLM represents the LLM that generates semantically diverse and contextually relevant questions q i and corresponding answers a i based on d i .For each evaluation competency, we craft the prompt to ensure the questions are reasonable and aligned with the required competencies.The detailed prompts are provided in Appendix B. These generated questions span various formats, including Q&amp;A, multiple-choice, content completion, and true/false validation, offering a robust assessment of context understanding abilities.</p>
<p>Noise Injection Following question generation, we extract noisy information from the source data and inject them into the context.Specifically, we inject semantically similar yet unrelated entries into the context using an embedding-based similarity search.Formally, each sample before noise injection is denoted as x i = (q i , a i , d i ).To select distractor entries, we first compute embeddings for all candidate entries in the dataset D using Sentence-BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019).
h d j = f S-BERT (d j ), ∀d j ∈ D,(3)
where f S-BERT denotes the embedding function.</p>
<p>We then employ the cosine similarity to efficiently retrieve the Top-k entries most similar to the se- lected entry d i :
N i = Top -k d j ∈D{d i } sim h d i , h d j ,(4)
where sim(•, •) denotes the cosine similarity between embedding vectors.The final sample after noise injection is represented as xi = (q i , a i , d i ⊕ N i ), where N i contains the k selected distractor entries used to augment the context.We sample k ∈ [200,300] for structured tables and KGs, and set k = 5 for unstructured text.Through this approach, the injected noise closely mimics the type of confusing or misleading information that LLMs may encounter in practice, ensuring the benchmark dataset remains both challenging and realistic.</p>
<p>Quality Control To maintain the rigor of the constructed dataset, we implement a two-stage verification process to ensure data quality:</p>
<p>• LLM as a Judge.we used advanced LLMs (e.g.,  as automated evaluators to check if each answer is directly extractable or logically deducible from the provided context, using a clear prompt.Only instances marked "Yes" were kept.</p>
<p>• Human Expert Validation.Domain experts then manually reviewed the filtered data based on three aspects: (1) whether the question tests the intended competency, (2) whether the question is expressed clearly and logically, and (3) weather the answer is fully supported by contexts and factually correct.Only instances that received a "Yes" for all three criteria were accepted.</p>
<p>As a result, 90.83% of instances in our dataset met the high-quality criteria.Detailed information about data quality control can be found in Appendix C.</p>
<p>The Final Dataset</p>
<p>Based on the data collection, generation, and quality control processes described above, we construct the final SciCUEval</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>In this section, we evaluate the performance of various LLMs on SciCUEval, and provide a thorough analysis of their capabilities in understanding scientific contexts.2024), ChemLLM-7B-Chat (Zhang et al., 2024b), ChemDFM-v1.5-8B (Zhao et al., 2024)).For detailed information about these models, please refer to Appendix F.</p>
<p>Settings To ensure a fair evaluation across all models, we adopt a unified prompting template that standardizes input formatting.Specifically, each input consists of a system prompt that specifies the question type and defines answer format requirements, contexts, and a question designed to assess one of the four core competencies in SciCUEval.</p>
<p>Given that each question in SciCUEval has a deterministic answer, we adopt accuracy as the evaluation metric for all question types across the tasks of relevant information identification, multi-source information integration, and context-aware inference.</p>
<p>For the task of information-absence detection, we use the rejection rate as the evaluation metric.</p>
<p>Overall Results</p>
<p>Table 3  Second, proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnetmaintain competitive performance, especially in unstructured text-based domains (e.g., BioText, MatText), benefiting from their superior language understanding and generalization capabilities.Third, scientific-domain LLMs such as ChemDFM-v1.5-8B and SciGLM-6B exhibit substantially lower performance across all datasets.Although designed for scientific domains, these models tend to lack general reasoning capacity and robustness across modalities.Fourth, there is a strong positive correlation between model size and effectiveness.Large-scale models (e.g., GPT-4o, Llama4-Maverick, and Llama3.1-70B)consistently outperform their smaller counterparts (e.g., GPT-4o-mini, Llama4-Scout, and Llama3.1-8B)across most domains.</p>
<p>Evaluation Results of Four Competencies</p>
<p>Relevant Information Identification This competency measures a model's ability to locate and select the correct pieces of information from the provided context.As shown in Figure 4, DeepSeek-R1 leads all of the evaluated models, suggesting that explicit reasoning mechanisms effectively enhance factual grounding.DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o, and Qwen-8B also exhibit strong performance, showing the advantages of in-context retrieval capabilities.In contrast, scientific-domain LLMs exhibit notably weaker performance in identifying relevant contexts across diverse scenarios.Information-absence Detection This metric evaluates whether a model appropriately withholds an answer when the required information is absent.Claude-3.5-Sonnetand Qwen-8B demonstrate relatively high accuracy, suggesting their conservative answering strategy and stronger understanding of uncertainty.Most models struggle in this competency, with scores below 20%, indicating a tendency to hallucinate answers when uncertain.This highlights the risk of "overconfidence" in current models, which may pose potential safety risks in the scientific domain.

<p>Multi-source Information Integration</p>
<p>This task assesses a model's ability to synthesize information from multiple entries to construct a complete answer.DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest performance, followed by GPT-4o and Llama4-Maverick, suggesting that these models are better equipped to combine multiple data points into coherent and accurate answers.Among smaller opensource models, GLM4-9B shows a competitive score, even surpassing DeepSeek-V3 in this competency.However, scientific LLMs significantly lag behind, indicating that while these domain-specific models are adept at handling scientific text, they face challenges in effectively synthesizing information from diverse sources.</p>
<p>Context-aware Inference This capability reflects a model's ability to reason over contextually relevant information.DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest performance, and GPT-4o and Qwen3-8B also perform well, indicating that large-scale models and those enhanced with explicit thinking benefit significantly in contextual reasoning tasks.In contrast, models like Claude-3.5-Sonnetand DeepSeek-V3 show moderate capabilities but fall behind on deeper inference.Scientific-domain models such as ChemLLM-7B-Chat and SciGLM perform poorly, indicating limited general reasoning capabilities despite domain specialization.</p>
<p>Evaluation Results of Three Modalities</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the performance of LLMs across three modalities: Text, Table , and KG, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in handling diverse scientific data formats.Overall, LLMs tend to perform best on the text modality, reflecting their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities.Notably, some smaller models even exceed their average overall performance on text, indicating a relative maturity in handling unstructured text data.In the table modality, reasoning-augmented models demonstrate a clear advantage, suggesting that explicit reasoning mechanisms and the ability to process structured data significantly benefit table understanding.</p>
<p>In contrast, general LLMs show weaker performance on tables, implying challenges in leveraging tabular structure with traditional language modeling approaches.Similarly, for KG data, models with reasoning enhancements again lead, reflecting their ability to leverage relational and graphstructured information effectively.Additionally, domain-specific scientific models consistently underperform across all three modalities compared to general-purpose or reasoning-augmented models.</p>
<p>Further Discussions</p>
<p>Our experimental results highlight three key discrepancies in the performance of LLMs on scientific context understanding tasks, underscoring fundamental challenges that require further advancements.</p>
<p>Competency Discrepancy</p>
<p>The evaluation results reveal notable disparities across the four core competencies.While top-performing models exhibit relatively strong capabilities in iden-  tifying relevant information, they struggle with information-absence detection-the ability to abstain from answering when faced with unreliable or insufficient evidence.This suggests that models prioritize generating responses over ensuring accuracy, increasing the risk of hallucinations in scientific applications where factual correctness is critical.To address this, models should incorporate uncertainty quantification techniques, such as confidence-based rejection mechanisms and calibrated probability outputs, to enhance their ability to detect and reject misleading retrievals.Furthermore, reinforcement learning with human feedback and verification-based prompting strategies could help improve the model's reliability in rejecting incorrect information.

Modality Discrepancy LLMs exhibit relatively better performance on unstructured text compared to structured tables and KGs.This suggests that existing models rely heavily on linguistic patterns and semantic context rather than structured inference and multi-modal data integration.The weaker performance on tables and KGs indicates a bottleneck in structured data comprehension, where models struggle to extract, synthesize, and infer information effectively from unstructured data.To bridge this gap, models need improved cross-modal alignment, integrating structured data reasoning into their training paradigm.Techniques such as joint pretraining on text, tables, and graphs could enhance structured data understanding.</p>
<p>Specialized vs. General Model Discrepancy</p>
<p>Although scientific LLMs are explicitly designed for knowledge-intensive tasks, our evaluation shows that they often fail to outperform generalpurpose models on our dataset.This suggests that current specialized models lack sufficient reasoning depth, robustness, and flexibility to fully lever-age domain knowledge in complex scientific contexts.Their narrower training scope may limit generalization across diverse data modalities and reasoning challenges.To improve their contextual understanding, scientific models should incorporate targeted fine-tuning using curated scientific evidence and adopt domain-aware prompt engineering strategies.These approaches can help balance deep specialization with the adaptability required to tackle a broad range of scientific tasks, enhancing their effectiveness across diverse scenarios.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this work, we introduced SciCUEval, a comprehensive dataset for evaluating context understanding capabilities in large language models within scientific domains.SciCUEval encompasses multiple data modalities (structured tables, knowledge graphs, and unstructured text), spanning diverse scientific disciplines.By systematically assessing four key competencies (Relevant Information Identification, Information-absence Detection, Multisource Information Integration, and Context-aware Inference), we provide a unified framework to quantify how effectively LLMs perform on scienceintensive tasks.Our experimental findings reveal that, despite notable progress, existing models encounter substantial challenges in accurately interpreting scientific data.The primary challenge lies in the inherent complexity of scientific data, particularly structured formats such as tables and knowledge graphs, which demand high specialization, precise contextual understanding, and the ability to synthesize fragmented and implicitly related information.Even state-of-the-art LLMs show limitations in fully mastering these skills, underscoring the need for significant advancements to enhance their scientific context understanding.</p>

<p>Table 4 and 5 present the quantitative evaluation results of LLMs across four competencies and three modalities on SciCUEval, respectively.Table 6 presents the more detailed results of SciCUEval.</p>
<p>Table 7 shows the performance comparison between direct answering and answering with context.The results demonstrate that the integration of context consistently enhances performance.</p>
<p>B Prompts for Data Generation</p>
<p>We present distinct prompt templates for each of the four capabilities below.</p>
<p>• A prompt for generating questions about relevant information identification System Message: You're a brilliant in scientific domain.</p>
<p>User Message:</p>
<p>You will be provided with several triples from PriKG that form a path connecting a starting point to an endpoint.Based on this path, you need to generate a scientific question designed to test the respondent's ability to find the correct answer in the noise, with information from the knowledge C Data Quality Verification LLM as a Judge: We use advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) as automated evaluators to verify that each generated answer is both extractable and logically deducible from the relevant context, ensuring factual consistency and relevance.The prompt is presented below.</p>
<p>System Message:</p>
<p>You're a highly capable evaluator in the scientific domain.</p>
<p>User Message:</p>
<p>Below is a question, its relevant context, and an answer.Your task is to verify whether the answer meets the following standard:</p>
<p>1.The answer must be explicitly extractable or logically deducible from the provided context.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The answer must adhere strictly to the relevant information in the context and be factually correct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the answer meets the standard, output "Yes".If it does not meet the standard, output "No".
[Relevant Context start] {Context} [Relevant Context end] [Question start] {Question} [Question end] [Answer start] {Answer} [Answer end]
Please evaluate and output either "Yes" or "No" based on the above criteria.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Human Expert Evaluation: To further ensure the quality and accuracy of the generated data, we subjected the data that passed the initial LLM validation to manual review by five PhD-level researchers with strong STEM backgrounds.These experts were tasked with thoroughly evaluating each instance based on the following three criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Whether the question effectively tests the intended competency, ensuring that it is aligned with the targeted skill or knowledge domain and accurately reflects the underlying construct it aims to assess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the question is expressed clearly and logically, such that its wording is unambiguous, coherent, and easily understood by both human evaluators and automated systems, thereby minimizing potential misinterpretations 3. Whether the given contexts fully support the given answer and is factually correct, which requires that the answer not only directly derives from or can be logically inferred based on the supporting materials, but also adheres to facts and scientific evidence.Together, these criteria are designed to ensure the evaluation process's validity, clarity, and reliability.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Only instances that received "Yes" for all three criteria were accepted.After the experts reviewed all instances, the results revealed that 90.83% of the instances met the required high-quality standards.</p>
<p>We invited five PhD-level researchers with STEM backgrounds, including two domain experts in bioinformatics.We compensated them based on the number of questions reviewed.We paid $30 for every 100 questions reviewed, totaling $3,300 for 11k questions.The entire review process took one week.</p>
<p>D Dataset Examples</p>
<p>In this part, we demonstrate several examples of questions aligned with four core competencies.</p>
<p>For each competency, we present three examples corresponding to three distinct data modalities.User Message: How are the genes "nbc 1" and "nbc 3" related?</p>
<p>User Message:</p>
<p>Based on the methods and results described in the first part of the study on epitaxial growth of GaAs on Si(001), which of the following is the most plausible reasoning for the effectiveness of the GaSb buffer layer in reducing defect densities such as threading dislocations and antiphase boundaries in the GaAs layer?(A) The antimonides, such as GaSb, have a significant lattice mismatch with silicon, leading to the generation of interfacial misfit dislocation arrays that efficiently alleviate strain without forming threading dislocations.(B) The presence of the GaSb buffer layer increases the thickness of the overall film, which inherently reduces the formation of threading dislocations and antiphase boundaries in the GaAs layer.(C) The GaSb buffer layer chemically reacts with silicon to form a new compound at the interface, which serves as an ideal seed layer for epitaxial GaAs growth, minimizing defect densities.(D) The GaSb buffer layer promotes planar defects, such as stacking faults, that counterbalance and neutralize threading dislocations and antiphase boundaries in the GaAs layer.</p>

<p>G Case Studies</p>
<p>In this section, we provide several typical bad cases by LLMs.</p>
<p>Ability: Relevant Information Identification</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Could you determine the chemical formula for the compound identified as mp-775760?</p>
<p>Correct Answer: "LiFeF3"</p>
<p>Prediction of GPT-4o-mini: "C17H20ClN3O2S" × Prediction of GPT-4o: "LiFeF3" ✓ Remarks: GPT-4o-mini accurately identified the target column and provided a chemical formula as the response; however, it incorrectly identified the context data row, leading to a mismatch between the generated formula and the corresponding Material ID.</p>
<p>Ability: Relevant Information Identification</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Ability: Information-absence Detection</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>Can you enumerate all the PMIDs related to the interaction between id: 25840 and id: 1528?</p>
<p>Correct Answer:</p>
<p>"I cannot answer the question due to insufficient information in the retrieved data."</p>
<p>Prediction of Claude-3.5-Sonnet:"16239215, 15604093" × Remarks: Claude-3.5-Sonnetfailed to detect the absence of question-relevant context in context.Instead, it identified an incorrect Context Row in KG as the relevant context, and thus did not refuse to answer the question, but rather provided an incorrect answer.</p>
<p>Ability: Multi-source Information Integration</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>What are all the pairs of entity names that have a Gene-Gene relationship type?</p>
<p>Correct Answer: "cyp4f2,ggcx", "hras,kdr", "cyb5r3,cyb5a" Prediction of SciGLM-6B: "Gene", "Gene" × Remarks: SciGLM-6B failed to provide the correct answer and merely repeated the vocabulary from the question.It also failed to output the response in the required format.mp-1205400,mp-1219471,mp-1219958,mp-1221742,mp-1222109,mp-1233960,mp-1245579,mp-1272454,mp-1372845,mp-1406912,mp-14107,mp-1411625,mp-1517069,mp-1518293,mp-1518633,mp-15644,mp-1638589,mp-17955,mp-18026,mp-18027,mp-18028,mp-18029,mp-18030,mp-18031,mp-18032,mp-18033,mp-18034,mp-18035,mp-18036,... × Prediction of Qwen2.5-7B-it:mp-1219958 × Remarks: The Qwen3-8B model with thinking activation achieved 100% precision and recall by accurately identifying all three correct material IDs.In contrast, the non-thinking variant generated numerous false positives, indicating a substantial decline in performance.The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism effectively directed the model's attention to relevant fields-specifically, by constraining the search explicitly to the "Space Group Symbol" column-thereby preventing the inclusion of erroneous data from unrelated columns or positional artifacts.Moreover, CoT activation suppressed redundant and irrelevant output patterns.</p>
