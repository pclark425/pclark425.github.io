                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, have demonstrated exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks and have shown the ability to solve certain reasoning problems. However, their reasoning capabilities are limited and relatively shallow, despite the application of various prompting techniques. In contrast, formal logic is adept at handling complex reasoning, but translating natural language descriptions into formal logic is a challenging task that non-experts struggle with. This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic method that combines the strengths of large language models and answer set programming. Specifically, we employ an LLM to transform natural language descriptions of logic puzzles into answer set programs. We carefully design prompts for an LLM to convert natural language descriptions into answer set programs in a step by step manner. Surprisingly, with just a few in-context learning examples, LLMs can generate reasonably complex answer set programs. The majority of errors made are relatively simple and can be easily corrected by humans, thus enabling LLMs to effectively assist in the creation of answer set programs.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, have demonstrated exceptional performance in various natural language processing tasks and have shown the ability to solve certain reasoning problems. However, their reasoning capabilities are limited and relatively shallow, despite the application of various prompting techniques. In contrast, formal logic is adept at handling complex reasoning, but translating natural language descriptions into formal logic is a challenging task that non-experts struggle with. This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic method that combines the strengths of large language models and answer set programming. Specifically, we employ an LLM to transform natural language descriptions of logic puzzles into answer set programs. We carefully design prompts for an LLM to convert natural language descriptions into answer set programs in a step by step manner. Surprisingly, with just a few in-context learning examples, LLMs can generate reasonably complex answer set programs. The majority of errors made are relatively simple and can be easily corrected by humans, thus enabling LLMs to effectively assist in the creation of answer set programs.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable success in many downstream tasks, demonstrating their general reasoning capability across diverse problems. However, while LLMs excel in generating System 1 thinking, they struggle with System 2 thinking, resulting in output that is often inconsistent and incoherent (Nye et al. 2021). This is because LLMs are basically trained to predict subsequent words in a sequence and do not appear to have a deep understanding of concepts such as cause and effect, logic, and probability, which are essential for reasoning.</p>
<p>To address the issue, Nye et al. (2021) propose a dualsystem model that combines the strengths of LLMs and symbolic logic to achieve improved performance on reasoning tasks. They leverage an LLM to generate a System 1 proposal and employ symbolic computation to filter these proposals for consistency and soundness.</p>
<p>We are interested in situations where problems are described in natural language and solving them requires deep reasoning. A system needs to take into account linguistic variability and be able to perform symbolic reasoning. We
take logic puzzles as the testbed as they are well-suited for this purpose.</p>
<p>We first note that GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020) and GPT$4^{1}$ by themselves struggle with solving logic puzzles, despite various prompts we tried. On the other hand, we find that they can convert the natural language descriptions of the puzzles into declarative answer set programming languages (Lifschitz 2008; Brewka, Niemelä, and Truszczynski 2011) surprisingly well. Even the errors these LLMs make are mostly simple for humans to correct. We hope that our finding will ease the efforts of writing answer set programs and expand the application of answer set programming to a broader audience.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a brief overview of related work on automated solving of logic puzzles. Sections 3 and 4 delve into the proposed approach in detail. Section 5 presents experimental results and performance evaluations of the approach. Section 6 shows more examples demonstrating the generalizability of our method.</p>

<h2>2 Preliminaries</h2>
<h3>2.1 Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>
<p>LLMs have significantly improved natural language processing, achieving strong performance on a variety of tasks using few-shot learning (Brown et al. 2020). However, LLMs remain weak at tasks that involve complex reasoning (Creswell, Shanahan, and Higgins 2022; Valmeekam et al. 2022), and scaling model size alone is not enough to achieve good performance (Rae et al. 2021). It has been shown that various prompting methods improve accuracy on reasoning tasks (Wei et al. 2022; Zhou et al. 2022; Creswell, Shanahan, and Higgins 2022). Nye et al. (2021) present a dual-system model which uses an LLM as a semantic parser and couples it with a custom symbolic module to achieve performance gains on reasoning tasks. This framework combines the strengths of LLMs for parsing complex natural language and symbolic logic for handling</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>complex reasoning. However, the authors had to use hand-engineered set of constraints for the latter part. To our knowledge, our work is the first to use LLMs to generate logic rules to solve complex reasoning tasks.</p>
<h3>2.2 Automated Logic Puzzle Solving</h3>
<p>Works focused on solving logic puzzles typically involve a mapping from natural language to logic formalism. This process often includes problem simplification techniques, such as tailoring the puzzle to a specific domain, restricting natural language input to a certain form, or assuming additional inputs like enumerated types. Lev et al. Lev:2004:LLC employ a specialized automated multi-stage parsing process to convert natural language text into an intermediate form called Semantic Logic, which is then converted into First Order Logic to finally evaluate on law school admissions tests (LSAT) and the Graduate Records Examination (GRE). Shapiro Shapiro:2011:LLC manually encodes the “Jobs Puzzle” in a few different logical formalisms and compare them. Puzzler (Milicevic, Near, and Singh 2012) uses a general link parser to translate puzzles into to the Alloy language for solving, primarily through an automated process, albeit with assumed types. LogicSolver (Nordstrom 2017) follows a similar approach to Puzzler but replaces Alloy with a custom solver and conducts a more comprehensive evaluation.</p>
<p>Several works utilize translations into the language of answer set programming (ASP) (Lifschitz 2008; Brewka, Niemelä, and Truszczynski 2011). Schwitter Schwitter:2013:LLC addresses the “Jobs Puzzle” by representing the problem using controlled natural language (Schwitter 2010), which can be further turned into ASP. Baral and Dzifcak Baral:2012:LLC employ a $\lambda$-calculus-based approach and trains a model that converts a manually simplified version of natural language clues into ASP rules for solving Zebra puzzle-type logic puzzles. Mitra and Baral (2015) train a maximum entropy-based model to extract relations for each clue, which are then converted into a common ASP rule format, where a stable model corresponds to the puzzle solution. LGPSolver (Jabrayilzade and Tekir 2020) uses DistilBERT, a transformer-based model, as a classifier that can distinguish between representative rule types. With the clue classification, the authors use a handcrafted clue to Prolog translation (as opposed to ASP) and compute the solution. The works mentioned involve some combination of manual processing and/or brittle problemspecific translations. Our work distinguishes itself by being both fully automated and featuring a general pipeline, leveraging the extensive translation capacity available from LLMs.</p>
<h3>2.3 Generate-Define-Test with ASP</h3>
<p>ASP programs are typically written following the Generate-Define-Test structure, which generates potential solutions (Generate) and eliminates invalid ones based on certain constraints (Test). The Generate portion usually includes choice rules, while the Test portion consists of a set of constraints that prune out invalid solutions. An additional part of the program, the Define portion, includes necessary auxiliary predicates that are used in the Test portion.</p>
<h2>3 Method</h2>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" />Figure 1: Flow of Generating Answer Set Programs from Logic Puzzle in English</p>
<p>In order to find a solution to a logic puzzle, we utilize GPT-3 to convert the puzzle into an answer set program so that the stable model (a.k.a answer set) encodes the solution. Although GPT-3 exhibits strong capabilities, we discovered that it cannot generate a correct answer set program without being guided by carefully engineered prompts. These prompts instructs GPT-3 to reliably extract constants and generate accurate predicates and rules. In this paper, we detail our prompt engineering efforts.</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the structure of our pipeline, which utilizes GPT-3 step by step to generate an ASP program. Similar to how a human would approach the task, our pipeline first extracts the relevant objects and their categories. Then, it generates a predicate that describes the relations among the objects from different categories. Using the generated information, the pipeline further constructs an ASP program in the style of Generate-Define-Test.</p>
<p>Let $\mathcal{F}<em p="p">{c}$ and $\mathcal{F}</em>}$ denote the Constant Extraction and Predicate Generation steps in Figure 1. Let $\mathcal{F<em r2="r2">{r1}$ and $\mathcal{F}</em>$.}$ represent the two parts of the Rule Generation step, i.e., the Generate part and the Define&amp;Test part, respectively. Our pipeline can be modeled by the following equations that map a puzzle story $q$ to an ASP program $\Pi=\Pi_{\text {generate }} \cup \Pi_{\text {define_test }</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
c &amp; =\mathcal{F}<em p="p">{c}(q) &amp; p &amp; =\mathcal{F}</em>(q, c) \
\Pi_{\text {generate }} &amp; =\mathcal{F}<em _define_test="{define_test" _text="\text">{r 1}(c, p) &amp; \Pi</em>(q, c, p)
\end{aligned}
$$}} &amp; =\mathcal{F}_{r 2</p>
<p>Here, $c$ and $p$ denote extracted objects and generated predicates. Each step $\mathcal{F}_{s}$ is realized by GPT-3 with 2-shot prompting, i.e., only 2 examples in each prompt.</p>
<h3>3.1 Constant Extraction</h3>
<p>The first step in the pipeline is to extract constants or entities from the given story along with their corresponding categories. To accomplish this, we invoke GPT-3 using Prompt C, which consists of three parts: instruction, examples, and a query.</p>

<p>Line 1 provides a general instruction for the task of extracting objects and directing GPT-3 to generate them in the form of "category: constant ${ }<em n="n">{1} ; \ldots$; constant ${ }</em>$." Then, two examples follow: Lines 6-8 for Problem 1 specified in Lines 3-4, and Lines 17-20 for Problem 2 specified in Lines 1015. By replacing Line 23 (story) with a new example story and invoking GPT-3 with the above prompt, a new list of categories and constants for that story is generated, as with the previous two examples.</p>
<p>The above two examples are chosen to cover two cases of object extraction. For the N-Queens problem, the constants $1, \ldots, 8$ are not described in the Problem 1 statement (Line 4) but can be inferred. For the second puzzle, however, all constants in Lines 18-20 are mentioned in the example story provided in Lines 11-15.</p>
<p>The second puzzle is also intentionally selected to give an example for GPT-3 so that certain constants (e.g., \$225) can be turned into valid integers (e.g., 225) so that arithmetic
can be applied correctly later when generating rules later on, while others should be surrounded by double quotes. We experimented with various prompts to instruct GPT-3 to generate all non-numeric constants in lowercase and replace special characters with underscores. However, GPT-3 was unable to strictly adhere to these instructions and consequently made more errors.</p>
<h3>3.2 Predicate Generation</h3>
<p>The next step in the pipeline is to generate predicates $p$ that describe the relations among the extracted constants. We use GPT-3 on the Prompt $\mathbf{P}$ below.</p>

<p>Line 1 is a general instruction describing the task of predicate generation, and that the generated predicates should follow the form of "predicate $\left(\mathrm{X}<em n="n">{1}, \ldots, \mathrm{X}</em>$ is a distinct variable that represents a category of constants.}\right)$ " where each $\mathrm{X}_{i</p>
<p>Again, the two examples follow. Lines 3-4 are a copy of the first example in Lines 3-8 of Prompt C (where we omit Lines 4-8 from Prompt C to reduce the space). Lines $6-9$ continue the first example, where it now generates the predicates with variables as arguments following the instruction. It also contains two comments (starting with symbol $\%$ ). The first comment in Line 7 recalls the categories of constants and assigns a different variable to each category. The second comment in Line 8 gives the English reading of the predicate and variables, and emphasizes the link between each variable and a category of constants. Similarly, Lines $11-17$ present the second example.</p>
<p>Next, the story and constants are given for the third problem and GPT-3 is prompted to generate the predicate for that example, given the general instruction and the preceding two examples.</p>
<p>Given the extracted constants $c$ and generated predicates $p$, the next step in the pipeline is to generate ASP rules $\Pi$, consisting of the Generate part and the Define\&amp;Test part.</p>
<h3>3.3 Rule Generation: Generate</h3>
<p>The Generate part of an ASP program defines all possible mappings of constants from different categories. This is done by choice rules. In this step, an ASP program $\Pi_{\text {generate }}$ is obtained by calling GPT-3 with Prompt R1.</p>

<p>In the above prompt, 〈constants〉 and 〈predicates〉 are to be replaced for a new example. GPT-3 generates facts and choice rules following the last line of the prompt.</p>
<p>The task in this step is to write facts and choice rules based on the generated constants and predicates. Since this step doesn't require the details of the story, we omit the story from the prompt to avoid unnecessary noisy information being included in the prompt. Each example only consists of constants, predicates, and ASP rules to be generated, i.e., facts and choice rules.</p>
<p>Similar to the previous prompts, Line 1 is a general instruction, Lines 3-20 provide an example, and Lines 22-28 are for the queried example. The example ASP rules in Lines 14-20 contain comments (Lines 14 and 19), which will also be generated for the queried example and help to gather semantic information before generating a rule.</p>
<h3>3.4 Rule Generation: Define and Test</h3>
<p>The Define\&amp;Test part of an ASP program contains constraints that "weed out" the stable models that do not correspond to valid answers. This step takes as input the puzzle story $q$, constants $c$, and predicates $p$ : semantically, the ASP rules represent the content in story $q$ while, syntactically, the ASP rules must be formed by the extracted constants $c$ and generated predicates $p$. The ASP program $\Pi_{\text {define_test }}$ is obtained by calling GPT-3 with Prompt R2.</p>

<p>In the above prompt, 〈story〉 is a new puzzle, and〈constants〉, 〈predicates〉 are generated by GPT-3 for that story using Prompt C and Prompt P in Section 3.1 and 3.2.</p>
<p>Lines 1-8 are a general instruction describing the task of $\Pi_{\text {define_test }}$ generation and provides two rule forms for the
target ASP rules. The first rule form</p>
<p>$$
C_{1} ; C_{2} ; \ldots ; C_{m} \leftarrow L_{1}, L_{2}, \ldots, L_{n}
$$</p>
<p>says that " $C_{1}$ or ... or $C_{m}$ is true if $L_{1}$ and ... and $L_{n}$ are true." Here, each $L_{i}$ is a literal and each $C_{i}$ is a comparison in the input language of ClingO, e.g., $A&gt;B, A=B+3$, etc. The second rule form</p>
<p>$$
\left{C_{1} ; C_{2} ; \ldots ; C_{m}\right}=k \leftarrow L_{1}, L_{2}, \ldots, L_{n}
$$</p>
<p>additionally restricts that "exactly $k$ of $\left{C_{1}, \ldots, C_{m}\right}$ must be true." In principle, the first rule form is enough to represent various constraints. However, since the second rule form is syntactically closer to certain complex sentences related to cardinality, e.g., "either ... or ..."', "neither ... nor ...", or "no ... is ...", etc, we found that GPT-3 works much better when we also include the second rule form.</p>
<h2>4 Optional Enhancements to the Pipeline</h2>
<p>Section 3 presented a general pipeline that automatically writes an ASP program for a puzzle in natural language using LLM. This section explains two optional enhancements that strengthen its robustness.</p>
<h3>4.1 Constant Formatting</h3>
<p>In the Constant Extraction step (Section 3.1), GPT-3 may extract the names of the objects as they appear in the puzzle story, such as $\$ 225$, Sue Simpson, and 8:30 AM, which do not conform to the syntax of the input language of answer set solver ClingO. Also, GPT-3 applies arithmetic computations (e.g., $\mathrm{L} 1=\mathrm{L} 2+3$ ) to constants surrounded by double quotes (e.g., L2 is constant " 9 inches") instead of constants that are integers (e.g., L2 is constant 9).</p>
<p>A rule-based post-processing could be applied to turn them into the right syntax, but alternatively, we employ GPT-3 to generate syntactically correct forms. We found that this method requires significantly less efforts and is more general because GPT-3 applies the constant formatting correctly even for unforeseen formats using some "common sense," which is lacking in the rule-based approach. We use the following prompt for this.</p>
<p>The Constant Formatting step is done by calling GPT-3 with the following prompt, where 〈constants〉 at the end of the prompt is replaced by the original (extracted) constants $c$ obtained by the Constant Extraction step (Section 3.1). The GPT-3 response in this step is the updated constants $c$, serving as an input to other steps in the pipeline.</p>

<h3>4.2 Sentence Paraphrasing</h3>
<p>Sometimes sentences may need to be paraphrased before an LLM can correctly generate rules from them. The Sentence Paraphrasing step provides the opportunity to not only simplify or formalize the sentences from the original question but also add the hidden information assumed to underlie the question. For example, the following sentence</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Of</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">person</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">who</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">won</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">the</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">prize</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">in</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="n">bioengineering</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ow">and</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Sue</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">Simpson</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">on</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">won</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">in</span>

<p>is one clue in the example question in Section 3. The correct translation requires an LLM to turn the above sentence into at least 3 ASP rules, which would be hard for the current LLMs (e.g., GPT-3). Instead, we can ask GPT-3 to first paraphrase such kind of sentence into simpler ones below.</p>

<p>The Sentence Paraphrasing step is done by calling GPT3 with the following prompt, where 〈sentences〉 at the end of the prompt is replaced by the numbered sentences in the queried puzzle story $q$, and the GPT-3 response in text is used to replace the original sentences in $q$. This prompt is dedicated to the logic puzzles from Puzzle Baron and only paraphrases one kind of sentence in the form "of A and B, one is C and the other is D."</p>
