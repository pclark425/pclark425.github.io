                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has attracted significant interest due to its wide-ranging real-world applications, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Traditional GNN methods focus on encoding the structural information of graphs, often using shallow text embeddings for node or edge attributes. This limits the model to understand the rich semantic information in the data and its reasoning ability for complex downstream tasks, while also lacking interpretability. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies are combining them with GNNs for graph representation learning and downstream tasks. While these approaches effectively leverage the rich semantic information in TAGs datasets, their main drawback is that they are only partially interpretable, which limits their application in critical fields. In this paper, we propose a verbalized graph representation learning (VGRL) method which is fully interpretable. In contrast to traditional graph machine learning models, which are usually optimized within a continuous parameter space, VGRL constrains this parameter space to be text description which ensures complete interpretability throughout the entire process, making it easier for users to understand and trust the decisions of the model. We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VGRL and we believe these method can serve as a stepping stone in graph representation learning.</p>

<p>VERBALIZED GRAPH REPRESENTATION LEARNING: A FULLY INTERPRETABLE GRAPH MODEL BASED ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS
4 Oct 2024D68125EFD7FEBC8FC98FE72AE52B6335arXiv:2410.01457v2[cs.LG]Now analyze the given paper<strong> Step-by-Step Analysis</strong><strong> Updated judgment basis</strong>[…] […]
Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) has attracted significant interest due to its wide-ranging real-world applications, particularly through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).Traditional GNN methods focus on encoding the structural information of graphs, often using shallow text embeddings for node or edge attributes.This limits the model to understand the rich semantic information in the data and its reasoning ability for complex downstream tasks, while also lacking interpretability.With the rise of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies are combining them with GNNs for graph representation learning and downstream tasks.While these approaches effectively leverage the rich semantic information in TAGs datasets, their main drawback is that they are only partially interpretable, which limits their application in critical fields.In this paper, we propose a verbalized graph representation learning (VGRL) method which is fully interpretable.In contrast to traditional graph machine learning models, which are usually optimized within a continuous parameter space, VGRL constrains this parameter space to be text description which ensures complete interpretability throughout the entire process, making it easier for users to understand and trust the decisions of the model.We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VGRL and we believe this method can serve as a stepping stone in graph representation learning.The source code of our model is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/VGRL-7E1E* Corresponding author.‡ Xingyu Ji and Jiale Liu contributed equally to this work.</p>

<p>Many real-world graphs incorporate textual data, forming what are known as Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) (Yang et al., 2021).In TAGs, nodes represent textual entitities such as papers, while edges denote relationships between them, such as citations or co-authorships.For instance, the Cora dataset can be modeled as a TAG, where each node represents a research paper, and the node attributes include features such as the paper's title, abstract, and keywords.By integrating textual attributes with graph topology, TAGs facilitate more effective representation learning, making them valuable for tasks like document classification, clustering (Wang et al., 2023), citation analysis, and recommendation systems (Zhu et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2023a).This combination of textual and relational data offers deeper insights, especially when both content and connections are essential to the analysis.</p>
<p>Although traditional Graph Neural Network (GNN) models, such as Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) (Kipf &amp; Welling, 2016) and Graph Attention Network (GAT) (Veličković et al., 2017), have achieved significant performance improvements across multiple tasks, they generally suffer from a lack of interpretability.As these models largely rely on complex network architectures and implicit feature learning processes, understanding their internal decision mechanisms and how specific features influence task outcomes becomes challenging, thereby limiting their transparency and trustworthiness in practical applications.To address this issue, researchers have proposed several interpretable GNN models.These interpretable methods can generally be divided into input interpretability, training process interpretability, and decision-making process interpretability.For example, GNNExplainer (Ying et al., 2019) is a method for input interpretability, which selects a small subgraph of the input graph together with a small subset of node features that are most influential for the prediction as an explanation, XGNN (Yuan et al., 2020) is a method for training process interpretability which reveals the basis of the model's predictions by generating interpretable graph structures, and SE-SGformer (Li et al., 2024a) is a method for decision-making process interpretability which constructs a novel explainable decision process by discovering the K-nearest (farthest) positive (negative) neighbors of a node for predicting edge signs.Clearly, while these methods all have a certain degree of interpretability, they can only explain one part of the entire process of model input, training, and output.Therefore, our goal is to implement comprehensive interpretability by simultaneously achieving input interpretability, training process interpretability, and decision-making process interpretability.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the breakthroughs of large language models (LLMs) in the field of natural language processing, researchers have gradually begun to integrate them with GNNs to enhance model performance and capabilities.For instance, LLMs can act as predictors (Tang et al., 2024), generating more accurate predictions by analyzing node features and structural information for the TAGs.Also, TAPE (He et al., 2023) prompts a powerful LLM to explain its predictions and serve explanations as supplementary text attributes for the downstream LMs and GNN models.Due to the powerful text inference capabilities of LLMs, they are capable of processing TAGs, reasoning about the node classification prediction process of TAGs, and generating explanations in text that is comprehensible to humans.Therefore, we consider the use of LLMs to achieve comprehensive interpretability.However, using LLMs to handle graph tasks and provide interpretability is not easy.Specifically, there are currently two main approaches to applying LLMs in the field of graph: one is to pre-train or fine-tune LLMs to adapt to various graph downstream tasks.But due to the vast number of parameters typically found in LLMs, the cost of fine-tuning LLMs is quite high and the training time is long.The second is to directly freeze the LLMs for inference but this method does not yield good results.For example, we directly froze the predictor LLMs for node classification prediction in subsequent experiments, and the prediction accuracy was generally not high, as shown in Table 3.</p>
<p>In summary, we face two major challenges to achieve comprehensive interpretability with LLMs:</p>
<p>Challenge 1: How can we ensure that a model is interpretable in terms of input, training process, and decision-making simultaneously?</p>
<p>GRAPH AND LLMS</p>
<p>Traditional approaches to trusted GNNs.There are currently two main approaches: post-hoc explanation methods and self-interpretable models .The former tries to interpret the output of the model by adding a model-independent interpreter, for example (Ying et al., 2019;Vu &amp; Thai, 2020;Zhang et al., 2023b).However, this can lead to incomplete explanatory information in the output, or even generate explanatory information that is incorrect in the opinion of humans.The latter tries to solve this problem by constructing models that themselves have interpretable principles, for example (Dai &amp; Wang, 2021;Zhang et al., 2022a).However, these interpretable principles are based on their inductive bias, and only experts in the relevant fields can accurately judge whether such inductive bias is reasonable or not.</p>
<p>LLM in Graph.Existing methods are mainly categorized into three types: (1) LLM as Enhancer which mainly enhances the performance of GNNs by adding LLM-generated information, for example (He et al., 2023;Chen et al., 2024;Ni et al., 2024); (2) LLM as Predictor which mainly performs a downstream task by directly inputting the graph structure into the LLM, for example (Tang et al., 2024;Qin et al., 2023); (3) LLM as Alignment which mainly enhances the performance by aligning embedding spaces of GNNs and LLMs, for example (Yang et al., 2021;Mavromatis et al., 2023).Among them, there is explanation-based LLM-as-Enhancer approach (He et al., 2023), which achieves better performance by letting LLM generate natural language explanation information of graph structures and then embedding it into GNNs for downstream tasks.However, after the embedding from natural language to graph structure is not directly visible as a black box to humans, and can only be proven effective indirectly through the performance of downstream tasks.</p>
<p>LLMS OPTIMIZATION</p>
<p>LLMs for planning and optimization.Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to planning tasks for embodied agents (Song et al., 2023;Xie et al., 2023;Li et al., 2022;Liang et al., 2023), enabling them to follow natural language instructions and complete complex tasks.More recently, LLMs have also been utilized to tackle optimization problems by generating new solutions from prompts that incorporate previously generated solutions and their associated loss values.While these LLM-based optimization (Xiao et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024) methods bear some resemblance to our approach, as we also use LLMs to address optimization challenges, a key limitation of existing work is that it has not yet been explored in the graph domain.To address this gap, we propose an extension of this framework to the graph domain, introducing Verbalized Graph Representation Learning (VGRL), which applies LLMs to graph neural networks (GNNs) and opens new possibilities for solving graph-based optimization problems through natural language interactions.</p>
<p>Prompt engineering and optimization.Numerous prompting techniques (Wei et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2022b;Zhou et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2022;Yao et al., 2024;2023;Weston &amp; Sukhbaatar, 2023) have been developed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.To minimize the manual effort required in designing effective prompts, various automatic prompt optimization approaches (Zhang et al., 2022b;Zhou et al., 2022;Yang et al., 2024;Pryzant et al., 2023;Wen et al., 2024;Deng et al., 2022;Li et al., 2024b;Ma et al., 2024;Sordoni et al., 2023) have been introduced.However, traditional prompt optimization methods primarily focus on refining the text prompt without changing its underlying semantic meaning.In contrast, our VGRL framework goes beyond mere prompt adjustments by directly updating the parameters of the language-based model through the integration or modification of prior information.This not only improves optimization but also ensures that the learner model remains fully interpretable in its predictions, offering a more robust and transparent solution for graph-based learning tasks.</p>
<p>LLMs for multi-agent systems.Given their strong instruction-following capabilities, LLMs can assume various roles within multi-agent systems (Qian et al., 2023;Wu et al., 2023;Hong et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023).For instance, explore multi-agent collaboration systems designed to solve complex tasks such as software development.In the VGRL framework, this concept is extended to a two-agent system, where one LLM functions as the learner and the other as the optimizer.</p>
<p>Our approach sidesteps the problem of modeling black boxes by having the LLM generate humanreadable information as promt of another LLM making it perform the downstream task.This can be Enhancer LLM</p>
<p>Input Paper{𝒙}</p>
<p>Figure 2: An overview of iterative optimization and text prompt templates for the predictor, optimizer, and summary LLM in the node classification example viewed as a "guidance-feedback-redirection" process between models, which, after many iterations, returns the optimal guidance solution for a given task, which is directly human-readable.</p>
<p>PROPOSED METHOD</p>
<p>In this paper, we present the Verbalized Graph Representation Learning (VGRL) framework, a pioneering approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) with graph-based tasks while ensuring full interpretability throughout the process.Our methodology encompasses four innovative components, each designed to enhance both the performance and the transparency of LLMs in handling graph data.</p>
<p>INCORPORATING GRAPH STRUCTURE INTO LLM PREDICTIONS</p>
<p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve competitive zero-shot performance on specific datasets without considering graph structures, their performance often lags behind Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on benchmark datasets such as CORA, CITESEER, and OGBN-ARXIV.This gap underscores the importance of graph structural information in tasks like node classification, indicating the need to explore how incorporating graph structures into prompts could enhance LLM performance.</p>
<p>Given that LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) are not natively designed to process adjacency matrices or perform graph-based computations, it is impractical to directly integrate graph operations into LLMs.Thus, an alternative approach is to verbalize graph information as text that LLMs can process effectively.This transformation allows LLMs to interpret node relationships and structural dependencies in natural language format.In (Chen et al., 2024), various methods are evaluated to represent node connections textually, aiming to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for graph-based tasks.</p>
<p>One effective method is the 'ego-graph' approach, which focuses on the local subgraph surrounding a target node.By constraining the LLM's focus to a limited number of nodes, this method reduces complexity while preserving key local graph structure.To simulate the neighborhood aggregation process typical in GNNs, the input prompt incorporates a summary of attributes from neighboring nodes.Thus, important information from the graph is conveyed to the LLM without altering its reasoning mechanisms.This process can be formalized as:
Z 1 vi = f e X vi , X vj | v j ∈ N (v i )(1)
where Z 1 vi is the enhanced representation of node v i with one-hop neighbor information, X vi represents the features of node v i , and N (v i ) denotes the set of one-hop neighbors of v i .The function f e encapsulates the process of verbalizing neighborhood information and processing it by the LLM.</p>
<p>Inspired by this ego-graph approach, we have also introduced a method for incorporating structural information into our model.By embedding the attributes and relationships of neighboring nodes into the prompt, we aim to enable the LLM to better capture the interactions between nodes.Below is an example of a neighbor summary in Table 1:</p>
<p>Table 1: Prompts used to generate neighbor summary.</p>
<p>Prompts used to summarize the neighboring information I will now give you basic information about all the papers cited in a paper; this information includes: the abstracts and categories of the cited papers.The following list records some papers related to the current one.</p>
<p>[{ "content": "This paper firstly provides ...", "category": "Rule Learning"... }, ...] # Instruction Please summarize the information above with a short paragraph, find some common points which can reflect the category of this paper.Note: ONLY your summary information and NOTHING ELSE! Please start with "The papers cited in this essay".</p>
<p>VERBALIZING MODEL PARAMETERS FOR INTERPRETABILITY</p>
<p>Traditional machine learning models, such as neural networks, rely on numerical parameters, θ = {θ 1 , θ 2 , . . ., θ t }, which are often difficult to interpret.These parameters are typically represented as abstract numerical values, making it complex and non-intuitive to understand or explain the internal workings of the model.In contrast, the Verbalized Graph Representation Learning (VGRL) framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to express model parameters through natural language, providing full interpretability.</p>
<p>In VGRL, the model parameters θ t are defined by a text prompt, which consists of human-readable natural language tokens, θ t ∈ Θ language , where Θ language is the set of all interpretable text sequences.This approach contrasts with traditional models where parameters are abstract numbers, which are hard to interpret directly.The VGRL framework unifies both data and model parameters into a natural language-based format that is inherently understandable.</p>
<p>The key features of this framework include:</p>
<p>• Discrete Parameters: The natural language used to express parameters θ is inherently discrete.This is in contrast to the continuous parameter representations in traditional models, enhancing the intuitiveness of parameter interpretation.</p>
<p>• Sequential Structure: The parameters exhibit a sequential structure, as θ = {θ 1 , θ 2 , . . ., θ t }, reflecting the temporal or contextual relationships between parameters.This sequential nature aids in capturing and understanding the dynamics between parameters.</p>
<p>• Human Interpretability: Since the parameters θ t are verbalized in natural language, they are inherently comprehensible to humans.This allows the model's reasoning process and learning mechanisms to be more transparent, facilitating interpretability and easier analysis.</p>
<p>An advantage of using natural language for model parameters is that it enables the integration of prior knowledge and inductive biases directly into the model.As the model updates its parameters θ t , the changes are fully interpretable, providing clear insights into what the model is learning.For example, changes in θ t can be directly mapped to natural language descriptions, offering an intuitive understanding of the model's learning process.</p>
<p>Our empirical evidence demonstrates that text-based parameters often correspond to recognizable patterns in the data, further reinforcing the interpretability and transparency of the VGRL approach.This natural language parameterization not only enhances the intuitiveness of model but also improves its application, offering clearer insights into model tuning and interpretation in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>LEVERAGING LLMS FOR NODE CLASSIFICATION</p>
<p>Our approach centers on utilizing LLMs as interpretable predictors by querying them in an 'openended' manner.Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on message passing mechanisms, our method employs a label feature matching mechanism.We match based on the inherent characteristics of the nodes themselves and the information from their neighbors.This label feature matching mechanism places a stronger emphasis on the intrinsic attributes of node, as it aligns with the insights provided in the prompt.</p>
<p>The core of this method is represented by the following equation:
ŷvi = f p (Z k vi , θ t−1 )(2)
Here, ŷvi denotes the predicted label for node v i , and Z k vi represents the enhanced node representation incorporating v i 's k-hop neighbors.θ t−1 refers to the LLM's parameters at the previous step, enabling the model to leverage its prior knowledge and reasoning capabilities to generate the prediction.The function f p serves as the predictor that utilizes the enhanced representation and model parameters to produce the label output.This formulation emphasizes the LLM's role as a predictor, focusing on generating interpretable outputs.</p>
<p>For each node v i ∈ V, a prompt is crafted that includes not only the node's features, such as the paper title and abstract, but also relevant graph structure information.Specifically, the attributes of neighboring nodes up to the k-hop neighborhood are embedded in the prompt, as encapsulated in Z k vi .This enables the LLM to better understand the node's context and surroundings within the graph, leading to more informed and accurate predictions.</p>
<p>LLM AS AN OPTIMIZER WITH INTERPRETABLE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS</p>
<p>For the predictor LLM, we provide textual descriptions of node categories, which serve as model parameter θ, and the model determines which category the input node v i belongs to based on the given descriptions.The quality of node category descriptions θ directly affects the performance of LLM predictions; hence, obtaining suitable node category descriptions is very important.Additionally, for better explainability, VGRL imposes a strong constraint on θ, ensuring that the updated θ still belong to natural language sequences that humans can understand.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, it is not advisable to use classical machine learning optimization methods such as gradient descent to optimize θ.Inspired by Xiao et al. (2024), the optimizer LLM can output natural language that satisfies the constraints, so we only need to ask the LLM to play the role of an optimizer, then optimized category descriptions are also in natural language understandable by humans.Therefore, we directly use another LLM to optimize θ.Given a mini-batch B, the optimization process is as follows:
θ t vi = g opt (Z k vi , y vi , ŷvi , θ t−1 , Ψ), v i ∈ B (3)
where y vi is the true label of v i , θ t vi represents the intermediate parameter values for node v i during the t-th iteration, and Ψ denotes the parameter of the optimizer LLM, which is a text prompt.Specifically, we optimize the intermediate parameter value θ t vi of each node v i in B, and then summarize the intermediate parameter values of these nodes through a summary LLM (Section 4.5) to obtain a new round of parameter θ t .The overall framework for optimizer optimization and the text prompt template are given in Figure 2. The parameter Ψ of the optimizer LLM is actually a text prompt provided by humans and is not updated.The text prompt linguistically specifies the optimization loss function, guiding the optimizer LLM to optimize θ.The LLM-parameterized optimizer allows users to interact with it directly, which not only helps to trace model failures but also permits the incorporation of prior knowledge to enhance optimization.In addition, we also guide the LLM to output explanations of the optimization process, demonstrating the explainability of the VGRL optimization process.</p>
<p>SUMMARY LLM</p>
<p>The role of the Summary LLM is to aggregate and summarize the updated intermediate parameters from the optimizer LLM, generated during the previous minibatch, to obtain updated θ.Specifically, given a set of updated parameters from the last minibatch B, the Summary LLM consolidates these updates into a new set of parameters, θ t .This process can be formalized as:
θ t = f s { θ t vi | v i ∈ B} (4)
Here, θ t vi represents the intermediate parameter values for node v i during the t-th iteration, and B denotes the set of nodes in the current minibatch.The function f s operates by combining these parameter updates to produce a cohesive set of parameters, θ t , which reflects the overall learning progress across the minibatch.This aggregation ensures that key information from each node's updated parameters is captured while maintaining coherence in the overall optimization process.</p>
<p>CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROMPTING</p>
<p>Inspired by (Wei et al., 2022), we introduce the zero-shot and one-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods in prompt.For the zero-shot method, we encourage the LLM to perform step-by-step text generation by restricting and guiding the LLM to make the generated explanatory information as structured and precise as possible, in order to achieve a better final result generation based on the self-generated information.Although zero-shot VGRL is already fully interpretable, we still want to customize the interpretation in specific domains to ensure that the interpretation information is more in line with the norms of the human mind and thus enhance the model's performance.Therefore, we introduce the one-shot method by manually constructing a sample of the CoT, so that the model can generate the interpretation information and the final output based on the sample.The motivation for the one-shot approach is that we believe that the content generated by the LLM based on a sample that conforms to the logic of the human mind will better contribute to the completion of the final task.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p>In this section, We will compare the performance of the VGRL framework with diverse backbone models for the TAG node classification task.We will answer the following questions:</p>
<p>• Q1: Can VGRL framework increase the performance of backbone models?</p>
<p>• Q2: Do each part of the VGRL framework play a positive role?</p>
<p>BASELINE AND EXPERIMENT SETTING</p>
<p>We use two LLM-as-predictor models as backbones (Chen et al., 2024), and add our framework on top of them for comparisons.Information on our equipment can be found at Table 2. • Node only: 'node only' refers to the features considering only the node itself, excluding any neighbor information.</p>
<p>• Summary: 'Summary' indicates that we used an independent LLM to summarize the node's k-hop information, which can be viewed as the introduction of an enhancer LLM for encoding the graph structure.The prompt for the enhancer LLM is shown in Table 1.During the experiments, we used one-hop neighbor information for summarization and set model temperature τ = 0.1 as default.Additionally, we introduced prior knowledge in our comparison by manually constructing prior knowledge as the initial optimize θ for iterative processing.And we setting a mini-batch training process with a batch size of 8, i.e. |B| = 8.</p>
<p>MAIN RESULTS (Q1)</p>
<p>We conducted evaluations on the Cora TAG (McCallum et al., 2000) dataset (See AppendixB) by comparing our optimization iterative process with the baseline that excludes the VGRL framework (Chen et al., 2024).The results are presented in Table 3.We extracted a subset of nodes from the Cora dataset as our experimental data.For further steps, we blurred the concept of epochs and treated each batch as a single step.Our comparison reveals that our framework, through the iterative process, achieves better performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the VGRL framework in representation learning.VGRL gradually refines the label features through repeated iterations, as shown in Figure 3, which illustrates the change in test accuracy during the mini-batch iterations.Additionally, we used the opensource Llama3.1 8B model for all experiments, which not only significantly reduced costs but also proved the optimization capability of the framework itself.</p>
<p>ABLATION EXPERIMENTS (Q2)</p>
<p>We conducted ablation experiments on the Summary + VGRL architecture to assess the importance and relevance of each module.The results of the ablation experiments are shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>• w/o optimizer LLM: This variant removes the optimizer LLM, i.e., there is no iterative optimization process, which is equivalent to using the predictor LLM to make the final decision.</p>
<p>• w/o summary LLM: This variant removes the summary LLM, i.e., after each optimization update, instead of summarizing the information through the summary LLM, the results of a batch update are directly used in the next iteration.</p>
<p>CASE STUDY</p>
<p>To explore the impact of the VGRL framework on the TAG node classification task, we conducted an analysis of a particular training sample from the Cora dataset, as shown in Figure 4.In the paper 'Evolving Sensors in Environments of Controlled Complexity' the one-hop neighboring nodes all have the label 'Genetic Algorithms' while the actual label of the node is 'Reinforcement Learning' This heterogeneity can significantly disrupt the node's feature information during neighborhood aggregation, resulting in biased classification results.However, VGRL is able to effectively capture unique characteristics of each category, using them as a basis for matching the node's own features.This addresses the issue of information corruption caused by the propagation mechanism in heterogeneous graphs.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the Cora dataset, paper categories cannot be strictly divided into binary classes.It is not uncommon for some nodes to belong to two categories simultaneously.In such cases, the labelfeature matching mechanism proves to be more reasonable than the message-passing mechanism, as it focuses more on the node's own information (as can be inferred from the formulation of θ).-The abstract discusses the use of a genetic algorithm to model an evolutionary process shaping neural networks, which is a key aspect of <em>Genetic_Algorithms</em>.However, it also mentions reinforcement learning as a method used by the neural networks, which is a key aspect of <em>Reinforcement_Learning</em>.-The focus on sensors and their evolution in controlled environments, as well as the use of neural networks and genetic algorithms, might have led the model to incorrectly categorize the paper under <em>Genetic_Algorithms</em>. -<strong>Neighbour Summary</strong>: -The neighboring papers discuss artificial evolution, the interaction between learning and evolution, and the relationship between environment structure and organism behavior.While these topics are related to both <em>Genetic_Algorithms</em> and <em>Reinforcement_Learning</em>, the emphasis on learning and adaptation in the context of evolving sensors and neural networks points more towards <em>Reinforcement_Learning</em>. 3. <strong>Evaluation of the Existing Judgment Basis for <Genetic_Algorithms> and <Reinforcement_Learning></strong> -<strong><Genetic_Algorithms></strong>: -The current judgment basis for <em>Genetic_Algorithms</em> is as follows: -<em>If the paper discusses the use of evolutionary principles, genetic algorithms, mutation, crossover, selection, and their applications, implementations, or comparisons with other optimization methods, excluding papers that discuss learning from positive data, Bayesian frameworks, or ILP systems, classify it as <Genetic_Algorithms>.</em> -This paper does discuss the use of a genetic algorithm, which fits within the <em>Genetic_Algorithms</em> category.However, the model's incorrect classification suggests that the basis might be too narrow or that there's a need to adjust it to account for papers that discuss reinforcement learning in the context of evolutionary processes.-<strong><Reinforcement_Learning></strong>: -The current judgment basis for <em>Reinforcement_Learning</em> is as follows: -<em>If the paper discusses the use of trial and error, rewards, penalties, or other feedback mechanisms to learn from interactions with an environment, classify it as <Reinforcement_Learning>.</em> -The paper's focus on reinforcement learning, especially in the context of evolving sensors and neural networks, aligns well with this category.The model's incorrect classification suggests that the basis might be too broad or that there's a need to adjust it to account for papers that discuss evolutionary processes in the context of reinforcement learning.###4. <strong>Determining the Need for Modifications</strong> -<strong>Adjusting the <Genetic_Algorithms> Basis</strong>: The current basis might be too narrow, as it excludes papers that discuss reinforcement learning in the context of evolutionary processes.A possible adjustment could be to include papers that discuss the use of evolutionary principles in conjunction with reinforcement learning mechanisms.-<strong>Adjusting the <Reinforcement_Learning> Basis</strong>: The current basis might be too broad, as it includes papers that discuss trial and error without necessarily involving evolutionary processes.A possible adjustment could be to specify that the reinforcement learning discussed must be in the context of evolving systems or environments.</p>
<p>Updated judgment basis:</p>
<p><NewPattern>Genetic_Algorithms: If the paper discusses the use of evolutionary principles, genetic algorithms, mutation, crossover, selection, and their applications, implementations, or comparisons with other optimization methods, including papers that discuss reinforcement learning in the context of evolutionary processes, classify it as <Genetic_Algorithms>.</NewPattern><NewPattern>Reinforcement_Learning: If the paper discusses the use of trial and error, rewards, penalties, or other feedback mechanisms to learn from interactions with an environment, especially in the context of evolving systems or environments, classify it as <Reinforcement_Learning>.</NewPattern>Making judgments and decisions based on one's existing knowledge (θ) is the most fundamental decision-making process for humans.</p>
<p>Predictor model output</p>
<p>'Judgment' and 'Step-by-Step Analysis' represent the model's label matching process, which is also human-readable and interpretable.Whether its the Predictor LLM's process of analyzing the node's own features and supplementing it with neighborhood information, or the Optimizer LLM's analysis and adjustment of the two categories involved in classification errors, both demonstrate a complete and interpretable optimization process.The model explains each update iteration in detail, presenting it in human-readable language.With the help of the Summary LLM, the Predictor LLM and Optimizer LLM communicate and feedback effectively, ultimately constructing the best decision-making basis from scratch for the node classification task on the current dataset.</p>
<p>For a detailed training process see Appendix C to Appendix G.</p>
<p>THEORETICAL ANALYSIS</p>
<p>In this section, our goal is to demonstrate that the category descriptions generated by LLM can provide useful information for predicting label categories.Specifically, if the obtained category descriptions can faithfully represent the information of each category, then they are useful.At the same time, the LLM is non-redundant, as it can provide information that X cannot provide.Let θ be the textual category descriptions generated by LLM; H l are the embeddings of category from the LLM; X are the input of graph structure embeddings, y is the target and H(•|•) is the conditional entropy.The specific proof process can be found in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Theorem.Given the following conditions: 1) Fidelity: θ can faithfully represent the information of
H l such that H(H l |θ) = ϵ, with ϵ &gt; 0; 2)Non-redundancy: H l contains information not present in X, that is, H(y|X, H l ) = H(y|X) − ϵ ′ , with ϵ ′ &gt; ϵ.
Then it follows that H(y|X, θ) &lt; H(y|X).</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This paper introduces Verbalized Graph Representation Learning (VGRL), a novel approach to text-attributed graph learning that ensures full interpretability by representing learned parameters as textual descriptions instead of continuous vectors.This method enhances transparency and user understanding of the decision-making process, fostering greater trust in the model's outputs.While the current application is limited to foundational graph learning paradigms, VGRL shows promise for broader use in more complex models, offering potential advancements in explainable AI and graph-based learning systems.</p>
<p>APPENDIX A THEORETICAL ANALYSIS</p>
<p>In this section, our goal is to demonstrate that the category descriptions generated by LLM can provide useful information for predicting label categories.We formulate our theorem as follows:</p>
<p>Theorem.Given the following conditions: 1) Fidelity: θ can faithfully represent the information of H l such that
H(H l |θ) = ϵ, ϵ &gt; 0;
(5)</p>
<p>2)Non-redundancy: H l contains information not present in X, that is
H(y|X, H l ) = H(y|X) − ϵ ′ , ϵ ′ &gt; ϵ;(6)
Then we can obtain:
H(y|X, θ) &lt; H(y|X). (7)
where θ be the textual category descriptions generated by LLM ; H l are the embeddings of category from the LLM ; X are the input of graph structure embeddings, y is the target and H(•|•) is the conditional entropy.</p>
<p>Proof.We aim to demonstrate that H(y|X, θ) &lt; H(y|X), the process is following: Start with:
H(y|X, θ)(8)
We decompose the original expression Equation 8 into two parts based on the properties of entropy:
H(y|X, θ) = H(y|X, H l , θ) + I(y; H l |X, θ)(9)
Based on the definition of mutual information, we can obtain:
I(y; H l |X, θ) = H(H l |X, θ) − H(H l |X, θ, y)(10)
Due to the non-negativity of conditional entropy, we have:
I(y; H l |X, θ) ≤ H(H l |X, θ)(11)
By substituting Equation 11 into Equation 9, we further obtain:
H(y|X, θ) ≤ H(y|X, H l , θ) + H(H l |X, θ)(12)
When conditional variables decrease, the conditional entropy increases; so we have:
H(y|X, θ) ≤ H(y|X, H l ) + H(H l |θ)(13)
Applying the two aforementioned conditions and substituting Equations 5 and 6 into Equation 12, we can obtain:
H(y|X, θ) ≤ H(y|X) + ϵ − ϵ ′ &lt; H(y|X)(14)

(Neighbour Summary: The papers cited in this essay discuss the limitations of current inductive logic programming systems in handling noise and learning recursive predicates.A new framework for learning from noisy data and fixed example size is presented, which incorporates a Bayesian heuristic for finding the most probable hypothesis.This approach is implemented in an ILP system called Lime, which is shown to handle noise better than other systems like FOIL and PROGOL, and is capable of learning from only positive or negative data.Common points that reflect the category of this paper include: -Handling noise in inductive logic programming systems -Learning recursive predicates -Improving the performance of ILP systems -Developing new frameworks for learning from noisy data.)Model judgment category: Genetic_Algorithms Paper true category: Theory</p>

Title: Learning from positive data ) (Abstract: Gold showed in 1967 that not even regular grammars can be exactly identified from positive examples alone.Since it is known that children learn natural grammars almost exclusively from positives examples, Gold's result has been used as a theoretical support for Chomsky's theory of innate human linguistic abilities.In this paper new results are presented which show that within a Bayesian framework not only grammars, but also logic programs are learnable with arbitrarily low expected error from positive examples only.In addition, we show that the upper bound for expected error of a learner which maximises the Bayes' posterior probability when learning from positive examples is within a small additive term of one which does the same from a mixture of positive and negative examples.An Inductive Logic Programming implementation is described which avoids the pitfalls of greedy search by global optimisation of this function during the local

Non-Determinate Background Knowledge ) (Abstract: It is a well-known fact that propositional learning algorithms require "good" features to perform well in practice.So a major step in data engineering for inductive learning is the construction of good features by domain experts.These features often represent properties of structured objects, where a property typically is the occurrence of a certain substructure having certain properties.To partly automate the process of "feature engineering", we devised an algorithm that searches for features which are defined by such substructures.The algorithm stochastically conducts a top-down search for first-order clauses, where each clause represents a binary feature.It differs from existing algorithms in that its search is not class-blind, and that it is capable of considering clauses ("context") of almost arbitrary length (size).Preliminary experiments are favorable, and support the view that this approach is promising.)(Neighbour Summary: The

techniques for inverting deduction and introduces Mode-Directed Inverse Entailment (MDIE) as a generalisation and enhancement of previous approaches.The second paper proposes an extension of the feature-vector representation to allow the value of a feature to be a set of strings, which can be efficiently and naturally represented in real-world learning problems.The third paper describes a
