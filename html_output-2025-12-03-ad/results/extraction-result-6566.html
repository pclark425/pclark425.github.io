                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces the novel task of multi-modal puzzle solving, framed within the context of visual question-answering. We present a new dataset, A LGO P UZZLE VQA designed to challenge and evaluate the capabilities of multimodal language models in solving algorithmic puzzles that necessitate both visual understanding, language understanding, and complex algorithmic reasoning. We create the puzzles to encompass a diverse array of mathematical and algorithmic topics such as boolean logic, combinatorics, graph theory, optimization, search, etc., aiming to evaluate the gap between visual data interpretation and algorithmic problem-solving skills. The dataset is generated automatically from code authored by humans. All our puzzles have exact solutions that can be found from the algorithm without tedious human calculations. It ensures that our dataset can be scaled up arbitrarily in terms of reasoning complexity and dataset size. Our investigation reveals that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4V and Gemini exhibit limited performance in puzzle-solving tasks. We find that their performance is near random in a multi-choice question-answering setup for a significant number of puzzles. The findings emphasize the challenges of integrating visual, language, and algorithmic knowledge for solving complex reasoning problems.</p>

This paper introduces the novel task of multimodal puzzle solving, framed within the context of visual question-answering.We present a new dataset, ALGOPUZZLEVQA designed to challenge and evaluate the capabilities of multimodal language models in solving algorithmic puzzles that necessitate both visual understanding, language understanding, and complex algorithmic reasoning.We create the puzzles to encompass a diverse array of mathematical and algorithmic topics such as boolean logic, combinatorics, graph theory, optimization, search, etc., aiming to evaluate the gap between visual data interpretation and algorithmic problem-solving skills.The dataset is generated automatically from code authored by humans.All our puzzles have exact solutions that can be found from the algorithm without tedious human calculations.It ensures that our dataset can be scaled up arbitrarily in terms of reasoning complexity and dataset size.Our investigation reveals that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT4V and Gemini exhibit limited performance in puzzlesolving tasks.We find that their performance is near random in a multi-choice questionanswering setup for a significant number of puzzles.The findings emphasize the challenges of integrating visual, language, and algorithmic knowledge for solving complex reasoning problems.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Puzzles have long been a source of fascination and intellectual challenge, serving both as entertaining pastimes and as means to advance mathematical and logical understanding.Historically, puzzles have often emerged from complex problems, with their solutions contributing valuable insights to mathematical research (Euler, 1741;Wiles, 1995;Knuth, 2000).In this paper, we explore the novel task of algorithmic visual puzzle solving.Traditional visual question-answering (VQA) (Antol et al., 2015;Goyal et al., 2017) and visual reasoning (Hudson and Manning, 2019) datasets have mainly focused on combining language and vision through the lens of object detection, scene recognition, and spatial relationship, where the answer can be directly found in the image.Another line of work has explored the application of external factual knowledge (Sanket Shah and Talukdar, 2019) or commonsense world knowledge (Schwenk et al., 2022) for VQA.Recently, multimodal reasoning benchmarks such as ScienceQA (Lu et al., 2022), and MMMU (Yue et al., 2023) have been proposed that aim to evaluate the expert knowledge of LLMs through subject-specific questions spanning science, medicine, business, arts, etc.</p>
<p>Unlike previous research, our work integrates a new critical component -algorithmic reasoning, which demands the ability to apply logical rules to novel situations, rather than relying on pre-stored information or direct recall of facts.This distinction is vital as it shifts the focus from merely memorizing vast databases of knowledge to applying concrete reasoning steps for novel problem-solving.We thus propose to benchmark the problem-solving ability of AI models through visual puzzles.Our puzzles are created to be selfcontained where minimal additional knowledge (beyond basic mathematics) is required to solve them.This helps us to disentangle the knowing part from the solving part, as the knowledge required to solve the problem is already provided as context.</p>
<p>Consider Figure 1 as an example of some of our puzzles.We show the setting or the configuration of the puzzle/problem as an image, which we consider as the visual context.Depending on the problem, the visual context may show different kinds of information such as the initial and final configurations of the puzzle, the position of enti-  of the four visual categories.Note that the header categories are not exhaustive as some puzzles may belong to more visual categories than the ones shown in the header.The complete ontological categorization can be found in Table 1.The questions shown above have been shortened to fit in the figure.The full questions can be found later in §3 and in Appendix A.</p>
<p>ties on a grid, the colours of a map, etc. Visual features such as colours, positions, shapes, and sizes of the puzzle components are generally present in the visual context.The language context, which is shown as Question in the figure then describes the specific features of the puzzle and the associated rules.It also presents the query problem that we are trying to solve.Correctly answering this question requires applying a fundamental mathematical or algorithmic concept.We design the puzzles such that solving them requires a wide array of mathematical and algorithmic topics, ranging from basic arithmetic, set theory, and boolean logic to more sophisticated areas like graph theory, and optimized search.Our proposed dataset thus offers a challenge that requires a synergistic application of language, visual, and algorithmic skills to solve complex reasoning problems.</p>
<p>A key advantage of our approach is the automated generation of puzzles from human-written code, which allows for the scalable creation of challenges with adjustable reasoning complexity.For a particular puzzle, we first write the general algorithmic solution based on well known proofs and results from the literature.By varying the inputs and configurations of the problem, we can create instances of desired difficulties.As multimodal language models become more capable (OpenAI, 2023;Gemini Team, 2023), it is crucial that we design clean and more challenging benchmarks to make fair assessments of their capabilities.Our automatic generation framework offers a simple way of creating and then continuously updating the benchmark with increasingly complex problems to evaluate progressively stronger multimodal models in the future.</p>
<p>We also highlight another feature of our dataset -the algorithmic foundation of our puzzle generation process ensures that each instance in our dataset has a definitive solution, eliminating the possibility of annotation error (Northcutt et al., 2021), subjectivity, ambiguities and biases that may arise from human annotated content (Geva et al., 2019).</p>
<p>We summarize our contributions as follows:</p>
<p>• We introduce an ontology of multimodal reasoning features tailored for visual algorithmic puzzle solving, aimed at delineating the capabilities and limitations of LLMs.Since each puzzle is annotated with distinct visual e.g., colour, position and algorithmic characteristics e.g., arithmetic, and search derived from our ontology, we have gained valuable insights into the specific skills that LLMs lack in addressing individual problems.</p>
<p>• Relying on this ontology, we created a novel puzzle dataset designed to test multimodal reasoning across vision, language, and algorithms.All puzzles in our dataset possess unambiguous algorithmic solutions.The distinguishing feature of our proposed dataset, ALGOPUZZLEVQA, resides in the prerequisites of the solutions to the problems.They demand proficiency in algorithmic and mathematical reasoning by applying logic adeptly in novel contexts without necessitating specialized domain knowledge.</p>
<p>• Our dataset is automatically generated using a scalable puzzle generation framework, allowing for dynamic adjustment of problem complexity.We show at least one instance of a puzzle from each of the seven algorithmic categories.Note that the header categories are not exhaustive as some puzzles may belong to more algorithmic categories than the ones shown in the header.</p>
<p>hindering effective complex reasoning.</p>
<p>The Proposed Ontology</p>
<p>Our puzzles encompass a diverse range of visual, mathematical and algorithmic topics.We categorize the visual and algorithmic features present in each puzzle in Table 1.</p>
<p>Visual Features</p>
<p>The configuration of the puzzle/problem is shown as an image, which constitutes its visual context.We identify some fundamental aspects of the visual context that influence the nature of the puzzles.Text: This category includes puzzles for which some features are shown as optical characters or embedded texts in the image.In some of our puzzles, the embedded text contains important information that must be used to correctly solve the question.The Calendar, Clock, and Water Jugs puzzles fall under this category.An interesting case is the Map Colour puzzle which has some embedded text in the image, but they are just given as additional reference and are not necessary for solving the core question.</p>
<p>Algorithmic Features</p>
<p>We now detail the algorithmic features present in our puzzles.The ontological categorization presented below is strictly limited to obtaining the solutions for the puzzles i.e. for answering the questions for the puzzle instances.Sets: Many problems in computer science deal with sets of objects where you have to consider the identical nature of some objects and the equivalence of some positions or configurations.We include some puzzles in our dataset where such properties can be or have to be used to solve the problem.This category includes the Checker Move, Number Slide, and Think A Dot puzzles.

3 From the Ontology to Creating ALGOPUZZLEVQA</p>
<p>We create a total of 18 different puzzles for our dataset following various feature combinations from our ontology (Table 1).Many of these puzzles are popular in various recreational or academic settings.</p>
<p>Generating puzzle images and curating solutions.Instances for each puzzle are created automatically from the human-written code of the particular puzzle which includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Code to generate the image file that we use as visual context.We use the matplotlib library in Python to generate the images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Code for applying the correct algorithm for finding the solution.The algorithmic solutions to these puzzles are well-known and are easy to verify against literature and other popular coding resources such as LeetCode 1 .</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Creating language context.Finally, we also carefully curate the language context (in English) for each puzzle using puzzle-specific templates.</p>
<p>We make sure that the template describes all the necessary information and rules required for solving the puzzle.The templates were written by two authors of the paper and were verified by the other authors.</p>
<p>Extensibility.As mentioned earlier, the number of instances and the difficulty level of the puzzles can be scaled arbitrarily to create a large and challenging dataset.For now, we have created 100 instances for each puzzle.These instances are analogous to different test cases of the puzzle, i.e. they have different input combinations, initial and goal states, etc. Reliably solving all the instances would require finding the exact algorithm to use and then applying it accurately.This is akin to how we verify the accuracy of a computer program aiming to solve a particular task through a broad range of test cases.</p>
<p>Difficulty. Our current version of ALGOPUZ-</p>
<p>ZLEVQA contains problems with easy to moderate difficulty, many of which can be solved by humans in hand without applying the underlying algorithm.However, if the problems are made harder then the algorithmic solution would be easier to find.</p>
<p>Dataset Size.In total, we have 1800 instances from the 18 different puzzles.We consider the full dataset as an evaluation-only benchmark.We describe the details and the creation process of some of the puzzles next.A detailed description of all the puzzles and their creation process can be found in the Appendix A.</p>
<p>Some Example Puzzles in Our Dataset</p>
<p>Board Tiling.The puzzle is inspired by the Mutilated chessboard problem, originally posed by Max Black (Black, 1948).The puzzle belongs to the class of domino tiling problems.A general result from Mendelsohn ( 2004) states that: a 1 https://leetcode.com/We choose the number of rows and columns in our checkerboard randomly between 4 to 9. We randomly remove 1 or 2 squares if the board has an odd or even number of squares, respectively.We determine the yes or no tilebality answer based on the general result.</p>
<p>We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Colour Hue.A rectangular board contains of m * n coloured tiles arranged in a rectangular grid.</p>
<p>The board has an ideal state.A non-ideal state of the board is created by shuffling some tiles.We ask how many minimum tile swaps are required to reach the ideal state from the non-ideal state.The answer can be determined using the selection sort algorithm, which minimizes the number of swaps required to sort an unsorted array.We considered the non-ideal state as the unsorted state and the ideal state as the sorted state to find the answer.</p>
<p>We show an example in Figure 4.</p>
<p>Map Colouring.The four colour theorem is a famous result in mathematics that states that four colours are sufficient to colour the regions of any planar map such that no two adjacent regions have the same colour.We create a Voronoi diagram (Voronoi, 1908) followed by polygon clipping (Sutherland and Hodgman, 1974) to create the regions of the map.We use a graph colouring strategy based on Algorithm X (Knuth, 2000) with four colours to find the exhaustive solutions for colouring the map.We fix the colours of some of the regions of the map and find out the number of ways the remaining regions can be coloured from the exhaustive list of solutions.We show an example of this puzzle in Figure 5.</p>
<p>4 Experiments on ALGOPUZZLEVQA</p>
<p>Setup and Baselines</p>
<p>We perform all our experiments on a multi-choice question-answering setup.We create three negative answer choices for each instance by using heuristics such as randomly sampling numbers within the same magnitude as the gold answer.More details can be found in Appendix B. In total, we thus have four answer choices -one gold positive and three random negatives, for all puzzles except one.The exception is the Board Tiling puzzle, where we have Yes and No as the possible choices.We evaluate various closed and open-source multimodal language models on our dataset.We consider the following models: GPT-4V (OpenAI, 2023), Gemini Pro (Gemini Team, 2023), Claude 3 Opus2 as the closed models; In-structBLIP Vicuna 7B and 13B (Dai et al., 2023), and LLaVA-1.5 13B (Liu et al., 2023) as the opensourced models.We use the accuracy of predicting the final answer as the evaluation metric.We create the prompt for eCoT in a similar fashion with its respective prompting instruction.We generate the output using a temperature of 0 which is equivalent to greedy decoding (Kojima et al., 2022;Wei et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Instruct-BLIP: We follow the multi-choice question-answering setup recommended in the original Instruct-BLIP work (Dai et al., 2023)  restriction method.The answer choice with the highest log-likelihood is chosen as the prediction.</p>
<p>Main Results</p>
<p>We report the main results for all the models across all the puzzles in Table 2.The Board Tiling puzzle has a random baseline performance of 50%.All other puzzles have a random baseline performance of 25%.The overall random baseline stands at 26.4%.We notice that the performance in a significant number of these puzzles across all the models is close to the random baseline of 50% and 25%.In CoT setup, Claude 3 Opus acheives the best average score of 30.9%.The GPT-4V model in the eCoT setup achieves the best score overall with an average accuracy of 31.7%, which is only around 5% better than random.The other models perform slightly poorer, with Gemini Pro obtaining a best of 30.2%,Claude 3 obtaining a best of 31.2%,Instruct-BLIP obtaining a best of 29.1% with the 7B model, and LLaVA obtaining 29.1%.We report the average score of the models for each puzzle in the right-most column of Table 2.This helps us find which puzzles are easier and which are difficult for models.We found that Rubik's Cube and Think A Dot have the highest average score over random, implying that these two puzzles are found by models to be comparatively the easiest.Conversely, the average performance in N-Queens and Colour Hue are the lowest, signifying that models found them to be the hardest.</p>
<p>In terms of absolute score, we find the highest performing experiment to be GPT-4V CoT in the Calendar puzzle, where it achieves an accuracy of 57%.We do not find any puzzle where the accuracy is higher than 60%.We conclude that large multimodal language models find the task of visual algorithmic problem-solving to be very challenging.Even though they have achieved remarkable performance in many tasks, they still have some way to go in performing complex reasoning tasks defined over vision, language, mathematics, and algorithms.</p>
<p>Ontological Analysis</p>
<p>We present the results across ontological categories in Table 3.The obtained results suggest some interesting patterns across the ontological structure.Closed models mostly perform better across the visual features of colour, position, and text but perform poorer on shape/size.</p>
<p>The best-performing model GPT-4V eCoT performs much higher in algorithmic topics such as combinatorgraphs and sets compared to topics such as optimization and search.Results suggest that the optimization and search topics are the most difficult topics in general across all the models.</p>
<p>Reasoning with Guided Vision</p>
<p>Our current experimental setup doesn't disentangle the visual perception stage and algorithmic reasoning stage.In the original setup, models must identify the various aspects and characteristics of the visual context before the appropriate algorithm can be applied.To minimize the effect of the bot- tleneck in the visual perception stage, we conduct a guided vision experiment, where we additionally provide detailed descriptions of the image as part of the language context.In this setup, errors from the visual perception stage are minimized, so models can only focus on the algorithmic stage for solving the question.We report the results in Table 4.The upper part of the table constitutes the puzzles where the algorithmic reasoning is difficult, as even with language-guided visual context, the model cannot improve its scores.For GPT-4V models, the lower part of the table indicates puzzles where the guided vision setup helps in a large improvement of performance, suggesting there is a significant bottleneck in the visual perception stage.However, even then the numbers don't go anywhere close to 100, suggesting that the algorithmic reasoning stage presents substantial challenges even in the presence of gold context.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this study, we introduce ALGOPUZZLEVQA, a novel dataset comprising puzzles that demand multimodal reasoning over vision, language and algorithms.Unlike existing multimodal reason-ing datasets such as ScienceQA or MMMU, the challenges in ALGOPUZZLEVQA do not hinge on possessing domain-specific knowledge for reasoning.Instead, solving the problems in this dataset necessitates applying logical algorithmic steps to novel problem scenarios.To construct this dataset, we devised an ontology encompassing i) visual reasoning features such as colours, positions, shapes and sizes of puzzle components; and ii) algorithmic reasoning features such as arithmetic, combinatorics, optimization, etc.Each puzzle in our dataset comprises multiple categories from the visual and algorithmic ontology.Through rigorous experiments with LLMs such as GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro, Claude 3, InstructBlip, and LLaVA, we observed a consistent struggle in achieving satisfactory performance on ALGOP-UZZLEVQA, emphasizing the formidable hurdles in multimodal reasoning for algorithmic puzzlesolving.Given that each puzzle is annotated with specific visual and algorithmic features based on our ontology, we draw insights into the precise skills lacking in LLMs to address particular problems.We also analyzed whether the models falter on this dataset due to deficiencies in the visual recognition setup or the algorithmic reasoning setup.While furnishing the models with accurate visual guidance of the puzzles enhances performance in some cases, achieving high-level performance in our proposed complex reasoning tasks remains an elusive goal.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>We have currently considered many puzzles that are popular in various recreational or academic settings.There are also other interesting puzzles beyond our compiled list which can be used to assess the complex reasoning abilities of LLMs.We aim to explore them and enlarge our suite of puzzles as future work.Additionally, the construction of the algorithmic ontology could be expanded to consider more fine-grained categories.</p>
<p>We have also prompted the language models to generate the reasoning steps and the answer through natural language.The class of models that can also generate code could also be explored in the future for solving our proposed visual algorithmic reasoning tasks.Such models might be able to generate the algorithmic steps required for solving the problem through code.We aim to explore such models as part of future work.</p>
<p>A Puzzles</p>
<p>We consider the following 18 puzzles:</p>
<p>A.1 Board Tiling</p>
<p>The puzzle is inspired by the Mutilated chessboard problem, originally posed by Max Black (Black, 1948): Suppose a standard 8 * 8 chessboard has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares.Is it possible to place 31 dominoes of size 2 * 1 to cover all of these squares?</p>
<p>The diagonally opposite corners in a standard 8 * 8 chessboard are always of the same colour.Hence, the mutilated chessboard with 62 squares has 30 squares of one colour and 32 squares of the other colour.Now, the checkered pattern of the chessboard ensures that each 2 * 1 domino must cover 1 dark-coloured square and 1 light-coloured square.</p>
<p>It is thus impossible to place the dominoes to cover all the squares since the mutilated chessboard has an unequal number of dark and lightcoloured squares.</p>
<p>A general result from Mendelsohn ( 2004) states that: a checkerboard originally had an even (odd)</p>
<p>Figure 7: Question: The image shows the calendar of a month of a particular non-leap year.Which day of the week was on March 1 of that year?Gold Answer: Friday number of squares.Two (one) randomly chosen squares are now removed from the board.If the mutilated board has 2 * m squares then it is tileable with m dominoes of size 2 * 1 if and only if it has an equal number of dark and light squares.We use this result to construct our puzzles.We choose the number of rows and columns in our checkerboard randomly between 4 to 9. We randomly remove 1 or 2 squares if the board has an odd or even number of squares, respectively.We question whether the resulting board is tileable with m dominoes of size 2 * 1.We determine the yes or no tilebality answer based on the general result.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 6.</p>
<p>A.2 Calendar</p>
<p>We design this puzzle to evaluate the visualtemporal reasoning abilities of foundation models.We provide the calendar snapshot of a particular month as the visual context.We then ask what day of the week was a particular date in either the previous, same or the next year.We also provide information about whether the years of consideration were leap years or not to make sure that the answer is exact.We use the python calendar module to construct the instances of the puzzle.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 7.</p>
<p>A.3 Checker Move</p>
<p>The puzzle generally known as Toads and Frogs3 was invented by the mathematician Richard Guy.We start with a grid of length n, with n − 1 checkers of either red or green colour occupying n − 1 positions.The goal is to rearrange the checkers into a given desired position.The rearrange is constrained to some rules: i) green checkers only move rightward; ii) red checkers only move leftward; iii) every move is either 1) a slide to the adjacent empty square, or 2) a jump over one position to an empty square, provided the checker being jumped over is of a different colour; iv) each grid position can accommodate a maximum of one checker at any time.</p>
<p>We only consider final arrangements that can be reached from the starting arrangements.We use breadth-first search constrained upon the movement rules to derive the solution.</p>
<p>A.4 Chain Link</p>
<p>This puzzle is a modified version of a problem that appeared in Kordemsky (1992).It states that you are given chain segments of different lengths.Closed pieces can be cut open and open pieces can be welded together in a certain amount of time.You need to find out the least time required to create the longest possible circular necklace.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 9.The 3. Calculate the time considering the total number of cuts and welds.We performed 4 cut operations and then we will need 7 welding operations to close all the open links.The time required is 4 * 5 + 7 * 2 = 34 minutes.This is the minimum possible time to create the necklace.</p>
<p>A.5 Clock</p>
<p>We design an instance of a visual-temporal reasoning puzzle using clock times.We consider an analog clock with the hours, minutes hand and show a randomly chosen time as the current time.We describe an event which happened (will happen) h hours and m minutes ago (later).We then ask when did the event happen or when is it going to happen.We determine the answer using modular arithmetic.We show an example in Figure 10.</p>
<p>A.6 Colour Hue</p>
<p>We show an example in Figure 11.The puzzle is inspired by the game I Love Hue 4 .A rectangular board contains of m * n coloured tiles arranged in a rectangular grid.The board has an ideal state where the colours are arranged in a way such that each row and column shows a monotonic change in the colour shade.To create this colour arrangement, we fix the RGB colour codes of the four corner tiles and perform linear interpolation between them to determine the colour codes of the intermediate tiles.We then randomly shuffle some of the tiles to create a non-ideal arrangement of the board.We ask how many minimum tile swaps are required to reach the ideal state from the non-ideal state.The answer can be determined using the selection sort algorithm, which minimizes the number of swaps required to sort an unsorted array.We consider the flattened version of the ideal state of 4 https://i-love-hue.com/the board to be the sorted state.The flattened version of the non-ideal state of the board is considered as the unsorted state.We then determine the answer using selection sort.The four colour theorem is a famous result in mathematics which states that four colours are sufficient to colour the regions of any planar map such that no two adjacent regions have the same colour.The conjecture was first proposed in the 1850s but a formal proof (Appel and Haken, 1977) was first developed almost 120 years later.</p>
<p>A.7 Map Colouring</p>
<p>We create a Voronoi diagram from a finite set of points (Voronoi, 1908) followed by polygon clipping (Sutherland and Hodgman, 1974) to clip the Voronoi diagram between the finite regions of (x, y), where 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 1.This region constitutes our input map.We represent the map as a graph with regions as nodes and their adjacent regions as the adjacency list.We use a graph colouring strategy based on Algorithm X (Knuth, 2000) with four colours to find the exhaustive solutions for colouring the map.We fix the colours of some of the regions of the map and find out Suppose you have found the most optimal path in the maze between the entrance and exit, where you need to go through the least number of empty cells and you need to make the least number of left and right turns.What is the combined number of left and right turns do you need to make in this optimal path?Gold Answer: 12 the number of ways the remaining regions can be coloured from the exhaustive list of solutions.We show an example of this puzzle in Figure 12.We construct the puzzles in our dataset such that the number of masked regions is between 2 and 6 and the number of ways of colouring them is between 1 and 8.</p>
<p>A.8 Maze Solving</p>
<p>This puzzle is a typical maze path-finding problem.We start from a square/rectangular grid consisting of all black cells (walls).We define the first cell of the second row as the entrance to the maze.We then perform a directionally randomized depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking from the entrance cell to create the white cells (paths) through the maze.We also make sure that at any point of the maze, either the maximum length or the maximum width of the path is 1 cell.This method ensures that there are no grids of white cells in the maze with both length and width greater than 2. We finally assign the last column of the second last row or the last row of the second last column as the exit cell.</p>
<p>After constructing the maze, we use breadthfirst search (BFS) between the entrance cell and the exit cell to find the shortest / optimal path.We then randomly select one question for this instance Figure 14: Question: A storekeeper is a puzzle in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.The game is represented by a 6 x 6 grid of characters grid where each element is a wall, floor, or box.Your task is to move the box to the end flag under the following rules: 1.The box can be moved to an adjacent free cell by standing next to the box and then moving in the direction of the box by 1 grid.This is a push.2. The player cannot walk through the box.What is the minimum number of pushes to move the box to the end flag?Gold Answer: 5 among the two choices: i) What is the number of left/right/total turns do you need to make in this optimal path? or ii) How many cells do you need to visit in this optimal path including the entrance and exit cells?We find out the answer to the question from the optimal path obtained from BFS.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 13.</p>
<p>A.9 Move Box</p>
<p>The puzzle is inspired by a LeetCode problem5 .The problem setting is a game in which a person pushes boxes around in a warehouse trying to get them to target locations.The objective is to move the box to the target position in the minimum number of moves.The solution can be found using breadth-first search.</p>
<p>A.10 N-Queens</p>
<p>The N-Queens problem is a famous chess problem often used as an example in various computer programming techniques.The objective is to place N chess queens on an N * N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.In other words, no two queens should share the same row, column, or diagonal.We consider N = 8, 9, and 10 for which there are 92, 352, and 724 solutions, respectively.We use the well-known backtracking algo- The objective is to place 8 chess queens on this board so that no two queens threaten each other; i.e. no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.6 queens have already been placed in some of the squares of the board, as shown in the image.Suppose you pick two squares to place the two remaining queen pieces in a way that fulfills the objective.What is the Manhattan distance between these two squares?Gold Answer: 5 rithm to create the solutions to the problem.For a solution, we show the exact position of randomly chosen N − 2 queens in the image.We ask what should be the Manhattan distance (in terms of the unit squares of the board) between the remaining 2 queens when they are placed correctly to satisfy the objective.</p>
<p>The other 2 queens can be arranged in only a single way for most cases, for which we can easily compute the Manhattan distance.In some minimal number of cases, the other 2 queens can be placed in two different ways to satisfy the nonthreatening condition in all rows, columns, and diagonals.However, in both of these ways, the Manhattan distance between the last 2 queens is equal.So, we can have an exact answer to the question even though the arrangement could be distinct.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 15.</p>
<p>A.11 Number Slide</p>
<p>This puzzle is inspired by the mathematical toy known as the 15 Puzzle6 .It is a sliding puzzle board of grid size 4 * 4, having 15 tiles numbered 1 to 15, with one unoccupied position.Tiles can be moved by sliding them horizontally or vertically through the open position.A typical goal in the puzzle is to arrange the tiles in numerical order from left to right and top to bottom.We use grid sizes of 3 * 3, 4 * 4, or 5 * 5 and create a random arrangement of the tiles on the board and provide it as the visual context.We then create the question in one of the following styles:</p>
<p>• How many unique board positions can be reached after performing exactly n moves?</p>
<p>• What is the maximum / minimum sum that can be achieved in a particular row / column after performing exactly n moves?</p>
<p>• You perform n moves where the open position is seen to be moved in the following way: up, left, . . . .What is the maximum / minimum / sum of numbers in the row / column that now has the open position?</p>
<p>We compute the answer using breadth-first search in all the cases.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 16.</p>
<p>A.12 Rotting Fruit</p>
<p>The puzzle is inspired by a LeetCode problem 7 .The problem states that there is a rectangular grid with some fruits.Initially, there is a single rotten fruit.As time passes, it influences surrounding fruits to become rotten.The objective is to find out the earliest time at which all fruits become rotten.A breadth-first search algorithm can be used to find the solution.</p>
<p>Figure 17: Question: You are given a 3 x 3 grid in which each cell can contain either no kiwi, one fresh kiwi, or one rotten kiwi.Every minute, any fresh kiwi that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten kiwi also becomes rotten.What is the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh kiwi?Gold Answer: 3</p>
<p>A.13 Rubik's Cube</p>
<p>Rubik's Cube is a mathematical combination toy invented by Ernő Rubik in 1974.We consider an initial state of the cube and show it as the visual context.The movements of the cube are generally denoted using the alphabets BDFLRU denoting clockwise movements of the back, down, front, left, right, and up faces, respectively.We first provide information about these notations in the textual context.We ask what is the number of small squares of any one of the six colours in any one of the six faces after completing a cube move sequence.The colour and the face in the question are chosen randomly for each instance.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 18.</p>
<p>A.14 Think A Dot</p>
<p>Think-a-Dot is a mathematical toy invented by Joseph Weisbecker 8 .It has three holes on its top through which a ball bearing could be dropped.It also has and eight coloured disks each displaying a blue or yellow face.When a ball is dropped through the toy, it would flip the disk mechanisms that it passed, and it would determine whether the ball would be deflected to the left or the right.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 19.We start with an initial configuration of the toy with a specific combination of the disk colours.We choose between 1 to 4 balls and a sequence of 8 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think-a-Dotdropping them between the left, center and right holes.We ask how many blue / yellow disk faces can be seen in the top row / middle row / bottom rows / all rows after dropping the balls in that sequence.We write an algorithm to determine the answer from the initial configuration and the sequence of drops considering the state of the rows, the flipped disks and the position of the walls.</p>
<p>A.15 Tower of Hanoi</p>
<p>The Tower of Hanoi is a well-known mathematical game often used in teaching the fundamentals of computer programming.The game consists of 3 rods and n disks of various diameters, that can slide into any rod.In the original version of the puzzle, we start with all the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size.The goal is to move the full stack of disks to another.Moving the discs between the rods is constrained by the following rules: (i) We can only move one disc at a time, (ii) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod, (iii) No disk can be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.With no other constraints, the original version of the puzzle can be solved in a minimum of 2 n − 1 moves.</p>
<p>We consider the number of discs to be between 3 to 6 and generate the optimal solution considering the original problem definition.We then select two random configurations of the game from the optimal solution, which are at most k = 6 moves away from each other.We consider them to be the starting and the ending configuration.As the original solution is optimal, the sequence of moves required to reach the ending configuration from the starting configuration is also optimal.We ask what is the minimum number of moves required to reach the ending configuration from the starting configuration.We mark the answer to be k.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 20.Initially, the amount of water that is contained in each jar is shown in the image.A single step of water pouring from one jug to another is constrained by the following rules: i) take a non-empty jug and pour water from it to another non-full jug until the first one becomes empty or the second one becomes full, and ii) no water can be spilt while pouring.The objective is to reach the amounts of 4, 3, 0 litres of water in the jugs from left to right, respectively.What is the minimum number of water pouring steps required to achieve the objective?Gold Answer: 1</p>
<p>A.16 Water Jugs</p>
<p>This puzzle belongs to a class of measuring puzzles involving a finite collection of water jugs with integer capacities.We provide the initial amount of water present in each jug as the visual context.We then ask how many steps of water pouring are required to reach a goal state defined in terms of specific quantities of water present in each jug.The water pouring steps are constrained by a couple of rules: i) water can be poured from a nonempty jug to another non-full jug until the first one becomes empty or the second one becomes full, and ii) no water can be split during pouring.</p>
<p>We consider the number of jugs to be between 3 and 5, with each initially having an amount between 1 and 14 litres of water.We create a pool of random goal states having the same quantity of total water with each jug having water that is less or equal to its respective capacity.We only consider goal states that are reachable from the initial state using breadth-first search.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 21.</p>
<p>A.17 Wheel of Fortune</p>
<p>We design this spinning wheel puzzle to assess the spatial reasoning ability of foundation models.We sketch a wheel with 6, 8 or 10 segments with different colours and associate each of them with a prize.The angular span of the segments is chosen to be either uniform or random.We show the initial position of the wheel and the position of a fixed arrow as the visual context.We ask what the prize would be (from the segment in front of the arrow) after the wheel has been rotated by a certain amount of degrees or full rotations in clockwise / anti-clockwise direction.We determine the answer using simple rotational mechanics.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 22.</p>
<p>A.18 Wood Slide</p>
<p>This puzzle is inspired by the Klotski9 sliding puzzle.We consider a puzzle grid of size 5 * 4 units that has 9 wooden blocks of various sizes: one 2 * 2, four 1 * 2, two 2 * 1, and two 1 * 1.The other two spaces are empty.There is a version of the Klotski puzzle known as the Pennant Puzzle where we start with the largest 2 * 2 block residing at the top left.The objective is to bring this piece to the bottom left by sliding the available pieces.The shortest solution of this puzzle consists of 83 moves.We first use breadth-first search to find this optimal solution.For each instance in our dataset, we choose two board positions encountered in this solution such that they are at most 5 moves away from each other.We consider these positions as the starting and ending configuration of the board.We then create the question that asks the minimum number of moves required to reach the ending configuration from the starting configuration.We show an example of the puzzle in Figure 23.</p>
<p>B Negative Choice Generation for MCQA</p>
<p>The negative choices are constrained to Yes and No for Board Tiling.The negative choices are constrained to the prizes that appear in the wheel for Wheel of Fortune.All other puzzles in ALGOP-UZZLEVQA have numerical answers.We use the heuristics of randomly sampling numbers within the same magnitude as the gold answer to create the negative choices for all the other puzzles.For example, if the gold answer is less or equal to 6 then we choose negatives between 1 -6; otherwise, if the gold answer is less or equal to 10 then we choose negatives between 1 -10.We step up the ranges to 50 and 100 next.</p>

Prompting Strategy GPT4V, Gemini, Claude, and LLaVA: We use the zero-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) technique for these models.The objective is to generate the reasoning steps and then the final answer from the image, question and multiple answer choices.We perform experiments with two types of CoT settings using the following prompting instructions: (i) Let's think step by step (Kojima et al., 2022), and (ii) Let's describe the image first and think step by step.We use the notation CoT to describe the first setting and Elaborate CoT or eCoT to describe the second setting.For LLaVA, we only use the CoT setting.We concatenate the question, answer choices and the prompting instruction to create the final prompt.An example prompt from the CoT setup is as follows: Question: You are playing a Tower of Hanoi game . . .Options: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 6 (D) 3. Answer: Let's think step by step.</li>
