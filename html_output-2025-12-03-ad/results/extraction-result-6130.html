                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> MEDITRON builds on Llama-2, and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines, to improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can potentially democratize access to medical knowledge. While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs' medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either closed-source (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale (<= 13B parameters), which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITRON builds on Llama-2 (through our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines. Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific finetuning. Overall, MEDITRON achieves a 6% absolute performance gain over the best public baseline in its parameter class and 3% over the strongest baseline we finetuned from Llama-2. Compared to closed-source LLMs, MEDITRON-70B outperforms GPT-3.5 and Med-PaLM and is within 5% of GPT-4 and 10% of Med-PaLM-2. We release our code for curating the medical pretraining corpus and the MEDITRON model weights to drive open-source development of more capable medical LLMs.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) can potentially democratize access to medical knowledge. While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs' medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either closedsource (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale ( $\leq 13$ B parameters), which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITron: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITron builds on Llama-2 (through our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines. Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific finetuning. Overall, MEDITron achieves a $6 \%$ absolute performance gain over the best public baseline in its parameter class and $3 \%$ over the strongest baseline we finetuned from Llama-2. Compared to closed-source LLMs, MEDITron-70B outperforms GPT-3.5 and Med-PaLM and is within $5 \%$ of GPT-4 and $10 \%$ of Med-PaLM-2. We release our code for curating the medical pretraining corpus and the MEDITron model weights to drive open-source development of more capable medical LLMs.</p>

<h1>Safety Advisory</h1>
<p>While MEDITRON is designed to encode medical knowledge from sources of high-quality evidence, it is not yet adapted to deliver this knowledge appropriately, safely, or within professional actionable constraints. We recommend against deploying MEDITRON in medical applications without extensive use-case alignment, as well as additional testing, specifically including randomized controlled trials in real-world practice settings.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Medicine is deeply rooted in knowledge, and recalling evidence is key to guiding standards in clinical decision-making. However, while 'Evidence-based medicine' (EBM) is now synonymous with quality care, it requires expertise that is not universally available. Thus, ensuring equitable access to standardized medical knowledge is an ongoing priority across all domains of medicine. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b; OpenAI, 2023b; Chowdhery et al., 2022) have the potential to revolutionize access to medical evidence. Today, the largest LLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters (Bommasani et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020) and are trained on enormous pretraining corpora (Raffel et al., 2019; Gao et al., 2020; Together AI, 2023; Soldaini et al., 2023). This unprecedented scale has enabled emergent properties in LLMs that are core traits of human decision-making: step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning, coherent communication, and contextual interpretation (Bubeck et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023).
Until recently, LLMs have been developed and evaluated for generalist tasks, principally using data collected from diverse internet sources with varying levels of quality in terms of domain-specific evidence (Rozière et al., 2023). This approach, while generally very powerful, hampers task-specific performance, including in the medical domain. Several newer task-specific models, trained on more carefully curated datasets, have repeatedly out-performed generalist models (Wu et al., 2023b; Yue et al., 2023; Rozière et al., 2023; Azerbayev et al., 2023), revealing the potential of balancing quality with quantity with regards to pretraining data. A promising method for achieving this equilibrium is to use general-purpose LLMs and then continue training on more selective domain-specific data. These systems acquire a combination of both natural and domain-specific language understanding and generation skills (Gururangan et al., 2020). In the medical domain, this approach has only been reported for models below 13B parameters (Lee et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023a). At larger scales (i.e., $\geq 70 \mathrm{~B}$-parameters), prior studies have only explored the scope of instruction-tuning (M42-Health) or parameter-efficient finetuning (Toma et al., 2023).
In this work, we present MEDITRON-7B and 70B, a pair of generative LLMs for medical reasoning, adapted from Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) through continued pretraining on carefully curated high-quality medical data sources: PubMed Central (PMC) and PubMed open-access research papers (collected through the S2ORC corpus, Lo et al., 2020), PubMed abstracts (from non-open-access papers) in S2ORC, and a unique set of diverse medical guidelines from the internet, covering multiple countries, regions, hospitals, and international organizations. To enable training, we extend Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed training library to support the Llama-2 architecture.
We evaluate MEDITRON on four medical reasoning benchmarks using both in-context learning (providing examples during prompting, i.e., within the context window) and task-specific finetuning. The benchmarks comprise two medical examination question banks, MedQA (from the United States Medical Licensing Examination, Jin et al., 2020), and MedMCQA (a Multi-Subject Multi-Choice Dataset for the Medical domain, Pal et al., 2022), PubMedQA (biomedical question answering based on PubMed abstracts, Jin et al., 2019), and MMLU-Medical (a medically themed evaluation set from Massive Multitask Language understanding, Hendrycks et al., 2021a). Using in-context learning without fine-tuning, MEDITRON-7B outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, showing a 10\% average performance gain over PMC-Llama-7B (a similar LLM adapted from Llama, Touvron et al., 2023a, through continued pretraining on PubMed Central papers), and a 5\% average performance gain over the Llama-2-7B model. After finetuning on task-specific training data, MEDITRON's performance also improves over other finetuned baselines at the same scale, achieving a $5 \%$ (7B) and a $2 \%$ (70B) average performance gain. Finally, finetuning MEDITRON-70B to support advanced prompting</p>
<p>strategies such as chain-of-thought and self-consistency further improves over the best baseline by $3 \%$ and the best public baseline by $12 \%$. Overall, MEDITRON achieves strong performance on medical reasoning benchmarks, matching or outperforming state-of-the-art baselines at the same scale.
In summary, we propose an optimized workflow to scale domain-specific pretraining for medical LLMs, incorporating knowledge-based data curation, continued pretraining via a distributed training pipeline, finetuning, few-shot in-context learning, and advanced inference methods such as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency. We release the curated training corpus, the distributed training library ${ }^{2}$, and the MEDITRON models ( 7 B and 70B) ${ }^{3}$ with and without fine-tuning to the public to ensure access for real-world evaluation and to facilitate similar efforts in other domains.</p>
<h1>2 Medical Training Data</h1>
<p>MEDITRON 's domain-adaptive pre-training corpus GAP-REPLAY combines 48.1B tokens from four datasets; Clinical Guidelines: a new dataset of 46 K clinical practice guidelines from various healthcare-related sources, Paper Abstracts: openly available abstracts from 16.1M closed-access PubMed and PubMed Central papers, Medical Papers: full-text articles extracted from 5M publicly available PubMed and PubMed Central papers, and a Replay dataset: general domain data distilled to compose $1 \%$ of the entire corpus.</p>
<h3>2.1 Clinical Guidelines</h3>
<p>Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are rigorously researched frameworks designed to guide healthcare practitioners and patients in making evidence-based decisions regarding diagnosis, treatment, and management (Berg et al., 1997). They are compiled through a systematic process of collaborative consensus between experts to establish recommendations from the latest evidence on best practices that would maximize benefit in light of practical concerns such as available resources and context. As a super-synthesis of meta-analyses, they sit atop the 'evidence pyramid' and form the basis of actionable evidence-based practice (Burns et al., 2011). CPGs are produced at various geographic and organizational granularities, ranging from global to hospital-level initiatives directed by international professional medical associations to informal consortia, regional or national governmental bodies to individual NGOs and hospitals.
Our GUIDELINES pre-training corpus comprises 46,469 guideline articles from 16 globally recognized sources for clinician and patient-directed guidance across high and low-resource settings, multiple medical domains (internal medicine, pediatrics, oncology, infectious disease, etc.), and various geographic granularities. The full list of sources used, along with the descriptive statistics of each source, can be found in Table 9. We publicly release ${ }^{4}$ a subset of 35,733 articles from the GUIDELINES corpus, extracted from 8 of 16 sources allowing content redistribution, namely CCO, CDC, CMA, ICRC, NICE, SPOR, WHO and WikiDoc. For all 16 sources, we release our web scrapers and pre-processing code.</p>
<p>Collection and processing We employed pragmatic selection criteria, seeking CPGs that were: (1) open-access, (2) systematically formatted with homogenous textual structure (i.e., in a format in which automated processes could be deployed without excessive risk of misaligning textual sequences), (3) in the language predominantly represented by the pre-training corpus of Llama (i.e., English), and (4) covering a breadth of medical sub-domains, audiences (clinician, nurse, patient), and resource settings (high, low, and humanitarian response settings).
After extracting the raw text from each source, we cleaned data to exclude irrelevant or repetitive content that did not contribute to the textual content, such as URLs, references, figures, table delimiters, and ill-formatted characters. Additionally, the text was standardized to a unified format with indicated section headers, homogenous space separating paragraphs, and normalized lists. Finally, all samples were deduplicated using title matching, and articles that were too short or not English were filtered out.</p>

<p>Content The GUIDELINES corpus comprises a broad range of contexts. For instance, the geographic scope ranges from global (WHO) to national (CDC, NICE) and regional (Ontario, Melbourne) to institutional (ICRC, Mayo Clinic). The corpus also represents health care concerns from high(Ontario, Melbourne), low- (WHO), and volatile- (ICRC) resource settings. GUIDELINES also contains a range of technical and conversational vocabulary with target audiences of clinicians or patients (or both), and is sometimes highly specialized within a theme (cancer, pediatrics, infectious disease). The peer review processes also ranged from UN bodies (WHO), institutional review boards (ICRC), professional associations (AAFP) to publicly crowdsourced knowledge bases (WikiDoc).</p>
<h1>2.2 PubMed Papers \&amp; Abstracts</h1>
<p>Adapting a large language model to the health domain requires vast amounts of biomedical textual data. As the largest public corpus of medical research papers, PubMed was chosen to form the backbone of MediTron's pre-training mix. From the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC) (Lo et al., 2020), which aggregates papers from hundreds of academic publishers and digital archives into a unified source, we collected 4.47M full-text papers from the PubMed Central Open Access Subset (National Library of Medicine, 2003-2023). We added 444,521 open-access full-text PubMed papers that are not found in the PubMed Central archive. Finally, we collected 16,209,047 PubMed and PubMed Central abstracts for which full-text versions are unavailable in S2ORC. The knowledge cutoff for all papers and abstracts in the corpus is August 2023.</p>
<p>Pre-processing PubMed For all full-text articles, we removed the metadata information and references, namely the authors, bibliography, acknowledgments, tables, and figures, and kept only the main text of each paper. Using automatic annotations from S2ORC, we identified inline citations, section headers, figures, and tables within the text using special tokens to allow for higher flexibility in downstream tasks. To promote the use of accurate citations by the model, we formatted all in-text references with a similar methodology to the Galactica model (Taylor et al., 2022). We replaced the paper citations with the special token [BIB_REF] and formatted them with the referenced paper's title, truncated to a maximum of 12 words, and the main author's last name. Similarly, we wrapped in-text figure and table references with the special token [FIG_REF] and formatted them with the figure number and the truncated figure caption. Finally, we wrapped all mathematical formulas using the special tokens [FORMULA]. We additionally removed URLs and references and normalized whitespace between paragraphs. To promote hierarchical structure learning, we indicate section headers with ' $#$ ' for main sections and ' $#$ '' for subsections. We also prepend the paper title to the main body. We performed the same formatting procedure described above for both abstracts and full-text articles. We deduplicated articles and abstracts based on PubMed and PubMed Central IDs and filtered out non-English content. Additional details on our pre-processing procedure are given in Appendix B.2.</p>
<h3>2.3 Experience Replay</h3>
<p>Experience replay refers to the process of including data from old, previously seen tasks when training on new tasks. Distilling replay data into the training mixture has been shown to overcome catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where a model incorporating out-of-distribution data forgets</p>
<p>its previous training (Sun et al., 2020b). To promote the retention of knowledge acquired by the pre-trained Llama-2 model, we included general domain data into GAP-REPLAY that consists of the $1 \%$ of the mixture. We used a randomly selected subset of 420 million tokens from the RedPajama dataset, an open-access equivalent to the original Llama-2 pre-training corpus (Together AI, 2023). This dataset contains a mixture of the Falcon refined web corpus (Penedo et al., 2023), the StarCoder dataset (Li et al., 2023), and Wikipedia, ArXiv, books, and StackExchange.</p>
<h1>3 Engineering</h1>
<p>Training LLMs at scale presents an important engineering challenge. The large model parameter size and pretraining token count require a framework for large-scale distributed training that can harness the power of multiple GPUs across many computation nodes. To distribute the training within a cluster, we developed the Megatron-LLM distributed training library (Cano et al., 2023), which extends Nvidia's Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019; Narayanan et al., 2021) to support the training of three popular open-source LLMs that have recently been released: Llama, Falcon, and Llama-2. We use it to pretrain and finetune all MEdiTRON models. The library supports several forms of complementary parallelism for distributed training, including Data Parallelism (DP - different GPUs process different subsets of the batches), Pipeline Parallelism (PP - different GPUs process different layers), Tensor Parallelism (TP - different GPUs process different subtensors for matrix multiplication). The library also includes activation recomputation to reduce memory usage at the expense of increased computation times, sequence parallelism to exploit further the coordinate-wise independence of batch norm and dropout operations (see (Korthikanti et al., 2022)), fused operations, and other modern primitives to help increase training throughput.
Natively, Megatron-LM's language modeling is oriented around a GPT-like architecture. We extended its functionalities to support the Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a), Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), and Falcon (Almazrouei et al., 2023) models. We integrate necessary new architecture features such as the rotary position embedding (Chen et al., 2023), grouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023), the parallel attention/MLP in the transformer layer of Falcon-40B, and the unbinding of the word embedding and the next-token prediction classifier weights used in Llama. We also added support for FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) for more efficient inference and long-context decoding.</p>
<p>Hardware The MEdiTRON models are trained on an in-house cluster with 16 nodes, each with 8 Nvidia A100 80GB GPUs. The nodes are equipped with $2 \times$ AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core Processors and 512 GB of RAM. The large parameter size of models requires distributed training across many GPUs and computation nodes, making network efficiency paramount. The 16 nodes used for training are connected via RDMA over Converged Ethernet. The 8 Nvidia A100 80GB GPUs in each node are connected by NVLink and NVSwitch with a single Nvidia ConnectX-6 DX network card. ${ }^{5}$ We expect relatively low inter-node bandwidth to relatively disadvantageous forms of parallelism, such as pipeline parallelism, which relies upon communicating activation values across nodes.</p>
<p>Model Parallelism Narayanan et al. (2021) prescribe that tensor parallelism equal to the number of GPUs per node should be used, which is 8 in our cluster. We empirically found this to be correct across every parallelization configuration considered and do not analyze it further. For our largest training run using a 70 billion parameter model, we use a pipeline parallelism (PP) factor of 8 . With a total of 128 GPUs in our cluster, we get a data parallelism (DP) of $2(=128 / \mathrm{TP} / \mathrm{PP})$. We use a micro-batch size of 2 and a global-batch size of 512 . Although one would prefer larger batch sizes in general for greater pipeline parallelism, we observe negative impacts from a discretization problem: raising the micro-batch size from 2 to 4 simply requires too much memory that must be compensated by less pipeline parallelism. We note that Narayanan et al. (2021, Figure 13) also shows that on a similar-sized problem with a similar number of GPUs, with (TP, PP) $\in{(2,32),(4,16),(8,8),(16,4),(32,2)}$, $\mathrm{TP}=\mathrm{PP}=8$ is also observed to deliver the highest per-GPU flops. Fundamentally, we do find that 3D model parallelism is necessary for the efficient training of models of this scale in the sense that TP, PP, and DP are all greater than one.</p>

<h1>4 Modeling</h1>
<h3>4.1 Pretraining</h3>
<p>To adapt the Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) language model to the medical domain, we start with the process of continued pretraining on the GAP-REPLAY data mixture we build in Section 2. This mixture contains papers from PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC), abstracts from PubMed, medical guidelines published and used by different regions, hospitals, and health organizations, as well as experience replay data (see Table 1).</p>
<p>Training Details We adopt most pretraining settings and model architecture from the Llama-2 paper (Touvron et al., 2023b). For optimization, we use the AdamW optimizer with a cosine learning rate scheduler. For the model architecture, we inherit the standard transformer architecture, the use of RMSNorm, the SwiGLU activation function, and rotary positional embeddings directly from the implementation of Llama. We use group-query attention (GQA) introduced by Llama-2, and a context length of 2048 for the 7B model and 4096 for the 70B model.
For the pretraining run with Llama-2-70B, we achieve a throughput of 40,200 tokens/second. This amounts to $1.6884 \times 10^{16}$ bfloat16 flop/second and represents roughly $42.3 \%$ of the theoretical peak flops of 128 A100 GPUs, which is $128 \times\left(312 \times 10^{12}\right)=3.9936 \times 10^{16}$ flops. This is in line with existing runs of comparable size. For instance, Narayanan et al. (2021, Table 1) shows a model flops utilization (MFU) of $45 \%$ for a 76B parameter GPT-3, and Mangrulkar et al. (2023) gives an MFU of $45.5 \%$ on a Llama-2 finetuning task similar to ours.</p>
<p>Hyperparameters and Tokenization The parameters for the AdamW optimizer are as follows: $\beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.95$, eps $=10^{-5}$. The cosine learning rate schedule uses 2000 steps for warmup and decays the final learning rate to $10 \%$ of the maximum learning rate. We use $1.5 \times 10^{-4}$ as the learning rate for the 70 B model and $3 \times 10^{-4}$ for the 7 B and 13 B models. The weight decay is set to 0.1 , and the gradient clipping is set to 1.0 . We inherit the tokenizer from Llama and use the bytepair encoding algorithm (BPE) implemented with SentencePiece. The total vocabulary size is $32 k$ tokens. Extra tokens are added to incorporate the new tokens we introduced for the pretraining data preprocessing. See Section 2.2 and Appendix B. 2 for more details.</p>
<h3>4.2 Supervised Finetuning</h3>
<p>To evaluate the downstream performance of our MEDITRON models on common medical reasoning benchmarks, we individually finetune the pretrained model on each benchmark's training set. For example, we finetune the model on the MedMCQA training set and evaluate it on the MedMCQA test set. Since MMLU does not have a training set, we evaluate the model finetuned on MedMCQA</p>

Because MMLU-Medical does not provide training data, we evaluate MEDITron models finetuned on MedMCQA on MMLU-Medical. Thus, the instruction for MMLU-Medical is identical to the one used for MedMCQA.
for out-of-distribution inference. For instruction finetuning, we manually write expressive and clear instructions for each training set. We list these instructions in Table 2.</p>
<p>Implementation We follow OpenAI's ChatML format (OpenAI, 2023a) to format the instruction data. ChatML documents consist of a series of messages, starting with a special token &lt;|im_start|&gt;, followed by the role of messenger (i.e., the "user" or the "assistant"), a new line, and then the message itself. The message is then suffixed with a second special token: &lt;|im_end|&gt;. We adopt ChatML's format for constructing the input prompt for the model. During training, we only compute the loss with respect to the response tokens (including &lt;|im_start|&gt; and &lt;|im_end|&gt;).
When preprocessing the input data, we keep each document separate and insert pad tokens <PAD> at the end of each text and mask out the loss on padding tokens. An example prompt format for task-specific-finetuning on MedQA is as follows:</p>

<p>A finetuned Meditron model needs to predict (C) Cystic hygroma as the answer for this prompt.</p>
<p>Hyperparameters The finetuning process uses the AdamW optimizer, with $\beta_{1}=0.9, \beta_{2}=0.95$, and eps $=1 \times 10^{-5}$. We use a cosine learning rate schedule with a $10 \%$ warmup ratio and decay the final learning rate down to $10 \%$ of the peak learning rate. Following Llama2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023b), we use a learning rate of $2 \times 10^{-5}$, a weight decay of 0.1 , and a batch size of 64 . We finetune the model for 3 epochs for all the finetuning runs.</p>

<p>Table 3: Medical benchmark datasets. In this table, we summarize the major details of each benchmark we use to evaluate MediTron. We report the number of train and test questions, the format of the questions, and the number of choices for each benchmark. Note that all benchmarks are multiple-choice question-answering tasks. ${ }^{1}$ For MedQA-4-option, we train on the 5 -option variant and evaluate on the 4 -option setting.</p>
<h1>4.3 Inference</h1>
<p>We apply several different inference methods to elicit answers from the resulting model from continued pretraining or instruction tuning.</p>
<p>Top Token Selection (Top-Token): For tasks with a single-label answer, such as Multiple-choice or Boolean QA, we follow the HELM implementation (Liang et al., 2023) of the Open LLM benchmark (Beeching et al., 2023). In particular, we rely on a text generation engine to generate the next token output and gather the probability from the model for each word in the vocabulary. We select the token with the maximum log probability as the model's generated answer and then compare the model answer to the text of the expected answer to determine the accuracy. For models finetuned on the downstream task, we pass the question directly to the model as input. For the pretrained model, we perform in-context learning (Xie et al., 2022) and provide the model with few-shot demonstrations as part of the input. For both in-context learning and direct generation from a finetuned model, we append the instruction of each benchmark in front of the question for answer generation.</p>
<p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT): CoT, introduced by Wei et al. (2023), enables an LLM to condition its generation on its intermediate reasoning steps when answering multi-step problems, thereby augmenting the LLM's reasoning ability on complex problems such as math word problems. We apply zero-shot CoT prompting to the models finetuned on medical data since we only finetune on zero-shot CoT training samples. In the case of zero-shot CoT, we add the phrase "Let's think step-by-step" at the end of the question following Kojima et al. (2023).</p>
<p>Self-consistency CoT (SC-CoT): Wang et al. (2023) found that sampling multiple reasoning traces and answers from the model and selecting the final answer through majority voting can significantly improve large language model performance on multiple-choice question-answering benchmarks. We apply SC-CoT prompting using a decoding temperature of 0.8 , sample 5 generations, extract the answer options from each generation, and use majority voting to select the final prediction.</p>
<h2>5 Medical Benchmarks</h2>
<p>Following previous works on developing medical LLMs and evaluation methods (Wu et al., 2023a; Singhal et al., 2023a,b), we selected four commonly used medical benchmarks, which are MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU-Medical.</p>
<p>MedQA: The MedQA (Jin et al., 2020) dataset consists of questions in the style of the US Medical License Exam (USMLE). MedQA is a challenging benchmark due to its combination of different medical knowledge (patient profile, disease symptoms, drug dosage requirements, etc.) that needs to be contextualized for the questions to be answered correctly. The training set consists of 10178 samples, and the test set has 1273 questions. MedQA was compiled with a choice of four (MedQA-4-option) or five possible answers, so we finetuned the models on the original 5 -option dataset and tested it on both the 5 and 4 -option questions (MedQA-4-option) to have comparable results with existing evaluations of medical LLMs. This dataset does not include any long explanatory answers, so to finetune a model for chain-of-thought reasoning, we used a training set of questions in the distribution of MedQA that provides human-written explanations.</p>

<p>Table 4: Few-shot Learning results of raw MEdITRON models against open-source pretrained baselines. This table shows the main few-shot learning results of MEdITRON on downstream medical tasks against other open-source pretrained models. Our models (MEDITRON-7B and MEdITRON70B) are continue-pretrained raw models with no additional supervised finetuning on task-specific training sets. For the 7B models, we apply 3-shot in-context learning with 3 demonstrations randomly sampled from each benchmark's training set because the maximum context window size is limited to 2048 tokens. For the 70B models, we use 5 -shot in-context learning. We report the average accuracy across three random seeds used for sampling random demonstrations.</p>
<p>MedMCQA: The MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022) dataset consists of more than 194k 4-option multiple-choice questions from the Indian medical entrance examinations (AIIMS/NEET). This dataset covers 2.4 k healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects. The training set contains 187 k samples, and the validation set has 4183 questions. Because the test set of MedMCQA does not provide the answer keys to the general public, we follow Wu et al. (2023a) and use the validation set to report evaluations. For hyperparameter tuning, we randomly split the training set into new train/validation splits. For both single-answer and chain-of-thought training data, we also remove all the samples with "None" as the explanation, resulting in 159,669 training samples.</p>
<p>PubMedQA: The PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019) dataset consists of 200k artificially created multiplechoice QA samples and 1 k samples QA labeled by experts. Given a PubMed abstract as context and a question, the model needs to predict a yes, no, or maybe answer. We follow the reasoning-required evaluation setting where the model is given a question together with a PubMed abstract as context. Out of the 1 k expert-labeled samples, we use the 500 test samples for evaluation following Singhal et al. (2023a)'s setting. Because the size of the other 500 training samples is relatively small, we use the 200k artificially labeled examples as the training data to finetune our models.</p>
<p>MMLU-Medical: The MMLU dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) includes exam questions from 57 subjects (e.g., STEM, social sciences, etc.). Each MMLU subject contains four-option multiplechoice questions and their respective answer. We selected the nine subjects that are most relevant to medical and clinical knowledge: high school biology, college biology, college medicine, professional medicine, medical genetics, virology, clinical knowledge, nutrition, and anatomy, and we concatenate them into one medical-related benchmark: MMLU-Medical. The total number of questions in MMLU-Medical is 1862 . Note that MMLU does not provide any training data. Therefore, we used MedMCQA's training data (four-answer options, the same as MMLU-Medical) to finetune our models and evaluate the generalization performance from MedMCQA to MMLU-Medical.</p>
<h1>6 Main Results</h1>
<h3>6.1 Pretrained Model Evaluation</h3>
<p>Setup: For the benchmarks that provide publicly available training sets, i.e., PubMedQA (Jin et al., 2019), MedMCQA (Pal et al., 2022), and MedQA (Jin et al., 2020), we randomly sample few-shot demonstrations from the training data using three different random seeds ( 3 -shot for 7 B models and 5 -shot for 70 B models). We report the average accuracy across three random seeds. As baselines, we compare the raw MEDITRON models to other pretrained models. Our first baselines are the Llama-2 models ( 7 B and 70B) without any continued pretraining, as it allows us to control for the effect of our continued pretraining. For MEdITRON-7B, we additionally run comparisons with PMC-Llama-7B</p>

<p>Table 5: Main results of MEdiTRON against open-source baselines. This table shows the main results of MEdiTRON's downstream medical task performance against other best-performing opensource medical models measured by accuracy. Our models (MEdiTRON-7B and MEdiTRON-70B), the Llama-2 models (7B and 70B), and PMC-Llama-7B are individually finetuned on PubMedQA, MedMCQA, and MedQA training sets. The baselines with ${ }^{*}$, i.e., Mistral-7B (instruct version), Zephyr-7B- $\beta$, Med42-70B, and Clinical-Camel-70B are instruction-tuned, so we do not perform further finetuning on the training sets and use the out-of-box model for inference. The inference modes consist of (1) top-token selection based on probability, (2) zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3) self-consistency chain-of-thought prompting ( 5 branches with 0.8 temperature). According to Tian et al. (2023), the passing score for humans on MedQA is 60.0 .
(Wu et al., 2023a), a medical LLM adapted from Llama through continued pretraining on PubMed Central papers. We also select general-purpose pretrained models that perform well in open-source reasoning benchmarks as baselines, including Falcon-7B (Almazrouei et al., 2023) and MPT-7B (MosaicML NLP Team, 2023).</p>
<p>Results: In Table 4, we observe that at the 7B-scale, MEdiTRON-7B with in-context learning outperforms other pretrained baselines. A potential reason for the improved performance is that MEdiTRON-7B uses Llama-2 as a backbone model, which already achieves much higher average performance than other pretrained baselines. However, we show that continued pretraining on medical data brings additional benefits and further improves Llama-2's performance on the medical benchmarks. In particular, MEdiTRON-7B shows much higher performance on PubMedQA than the base model ( $20 \%$ increase). At the 70B scale, the base model Llama-2-70B and MEdiTRON-70B's performances increase significantly compared to the 7B models, with MEdiTRON-70B outperforming the base model on all benchmarks. At the 7B scale, we observe that MEdiTRON-7B does not perform as well as the base model on the most difficult benchmark, MedQA (though the difference is within the margin of error). However, At the 70B scale, we see that MEdiTRON-70B outperforms the base Llama-2 by 3\%. Overall, we show that MEdiTRON models, particularly At the 70B scale, already demonstrate decent reasoning ability on medical tasks even before finetuning for a particular task. More specifically, for PubMedQA, the in-context learning performance ( $79.8 \%$ ) is only $0.2 \%$ behind the model finetuned on non-chain-of-thought PubMedQA training data ( $80.0 \%$ ).</p>
<h1>6.2 Finetuned Model Evaluation</h1>
<p>Setup: For the benchmarks that provide publicly available training sets, we conduct supervised finetuning individually on each training set and evaluate on the corresponding test sets. Both PubMedQA and MedMCQA provide reasoning traces (long answers or explanations) for chain-ofthought. For MedQA, which does not provide reasoning traces, we use a separate training set that</p>

<p>Figure 3: Main results of MEdiTRon against commercial LLMs. We compare MEdiTRON-70B's performance on four medical benchmarks (PubMedQA, MedMCQA, MedQA, MedQA-4-option) against commercial LLMs that have much larger parameter counts. We focus on GPT-3.5 (175B), GPT-4, Med-PaLM (540B), and Med-PaLM-2 (540B). The results of these commercial LLMs are directly taken from the associated papers (Nori et al., 2023; Singhal et al., 2023a,b). Note that MedPaLM does not report its performance on MedQA, and MedPaLM-2 does not report its performance on MedQA-4-option.
provides a human-written explanation for each question. ${ }^{6}$ We train with the format where the answer is concatenated to the explanation. For MMLU-Medical (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), which does not contain a training set, we test the model trained on MedMCQA instead since both datasets have the four-option answer format (with A, B, C, D). For the MedQA-4-option test set, we directly evaluate the model trained on the MedQA training set with five options.
We evaluate MEdiTRon models finetuned on each individual benchmark's training set against Llama-2 (7 and 70B) and PMC-Llama-7B (also finetuned on each benchmark's training sets). We then include 4 instruction-tuned models as public baselines: Mistral-7B-instruct (Jiang et al., 2023) and Zephyr-7B- $\beta$ (Tunstall et al., 2023) for as 7B-scale baselines, and Clinical-Camel-70B (Toma et al., 2023) and Med42-70B (M42-Health) as 70B-scale baseline. Clinical-Camel-70B is a Llama2 70B variant tuned using QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) on multi-turn dialogues transformed from conversations, clinical articles, and medical task data. Med42-70B is instruction-tuned on medical tasks, but the training details are not publicly released. We do not further finetune the public baselines on the task-specific training sets because they are already instruction-tuned. Finally, we compare MEdiTRon-70B against commercial LLMs, including GPT-3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b), Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2023a), and Med-PaLM-2 (Singhal et al., 2023b). These LLMs are pretrained or tuned on large-scale, high-quality, proprietary corpora and instruction data. They are also significantly larger than MEdiTRON (i.e., 175B, 540B). Note that only MEdiTRon, Llama-2, and PMC-Llama-7B models are finetuned on the training sets. Because Med42 (M42-Health) and Clinical-Camel (Toma et al., 2023) have already been tuned on these datasets as part of their initial instruction-tuning, we exclude them from further supervised finetuning.</p>
<p>Results: We report the performance of MEdiTRon and related baselines in both the 7B and 70B parameter scales. Table 5 shows all the performance measured in terms of accuracy ( $\uparrow$ ). At the 7B scale, we first compare with Llama-2-7B and PMC-Llama-7B, which are finetuned in the same manner as MEdiTRon-7B. The results show that MEdiTRon-7B outperforms these two baselines by an average of $4 \%$. Compared to the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023) and Zephyr- $\beta$ (Tunstall et al., 2023), MEdiTRon achieves significant performance gains on all benchmarks except MMLU-Medical, particularly on PubMedQA, with more than a $10 \%$ increase. Overall, MEdiTRon-7B achieves the best PubMedQA performance with $74.4 \%$ accuracy, the best MedMCQA performance with $59.2 \%$ accuracy, and the best performance on both MedQA and MedQA-4-option with $47.9 \%$ and $52.0 \%$ accuracy, respectively. At 70 B scale, we compare with</p>

<p>Llama-2-70B (finetuned exactly like MEdiTRon-70B) and two other medical LLMs, both of which are instruction-tuned for medical tasks from Llama-2-70B. On average, MEdiTRon-70B improves over all three baseline models with an $11.6 \%$ gain over Clinical-Camel-70B, a $5.4 \%$ performance gain over Med42-70B, and a $1.8 \%$ performance gain over the finetuned Llama-2-70B.
Next, we apply chain-of-thought (CoT) and self-consistency chain-of-thought (SC-CoT) to investigate if they can further improve our model's performance. CoT improves MEdiTRon-70B's average performance by $0.7 \%$, and SC-CoT improves the performance by $3 \%$. Although the finetuned Llama2-70B's performance also improves through CoT and SC-CoT, MEdiTRon-70B maintains and extends its advantage by outperforming Llama-2 (by $1.9 \%$ with CoT and $2.8 \%$ with SC-CoT). Overall, with SC-CoT, MEdiTRon-70B achieves the highest accuracy on average ( $72.0 \%$ ) and on all the benchmarks except MMLU-Medical ( $81.6 \%$ with PubMedQA, $66.0 \%$ with MedMCQA, $64.4 \%$ with MedQA, and $70.2 \%$ with MedQA-4-option). Interestingly, MEdiTRon-70B with the three inference modes all surpass the human passing score, 60.0, for MedQA (Tian et al., 2023).</p>
<p>MEDiTRon vs. Commercial LLMs: We also compare MEdiTRon's performance to commercial LLMs. These models often have a massive parameter count ( $&gt;100 \mathrm{~B}$ ). We focus on four popular LLMs: GPT-3.5 (i.e., text-davinci-003, (Ouyang et al., 2022)), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b; Nori et al., 2023), MedPaLM-540B (Singhal et al., 2023a), and MedPaLM-2-540B (Singhal et al., 2023b). In Figure 3, we show that MEdiTRon-70B outperforms the GPT-3.5 model on all benchmarks despite the latter having 175B parameters. On PubMedQA, MEdiTRon-70B outperforms MedPaLM and GPT-4, and its performance is only $0.2 \%$ behind the state-of-the-art model, Med-PaLM2. On MedMCQA and MedQA (5-option and 4-option), MEdiTRon-70B's performance falls between Med-PaLM and the SOTA performance (GPT-4 and Med-PaLM-2). ${ }^{7}$ Overall, we show that MEdiTRon-70B's performance on medical reasoning tasks is competitive with commercial LLMs with significantly larger parameter sizes.</p>
<h1>7 Analysis</h1>
<h3>7.1 Impact of Continued Pretraining</h3>
<p>During the continued pretraining process, we closely monitor the learning quality of the model. We report the language modeling losses of training and validation in Figure 4, indicating that both losses decrease as the model consumes more tokens and the model learns effectively without overfitting. To monitor MEdiTRon's downstream performance during the pretraining process, we also conduct intermediate evaluations on the $5 \mathrm{k}, 10 \mathrm{k}$, and 15 k iteration checkpoints. We evaluated each medical benchmark in a 5-shot in-context learning setting. We provided five demonstrations randomly sampled</p>

from each benchmark's training data with associated instructions from Table 2. We used top-token generation as the inference method used to get the model's prediction for each multiple-choice question-answer pair. Table 6 reports the in-context learning performance for these intermediate checkpoints. We observe that the intermediate performance fluctuates between different checkpoints. However, the average performance grows consistently across iterations, and the final checkpoint achieves the best performance. We note that on certain individual datasets, the model's performance drops in the intermediate checkpoints relative to the seed Llama-2 model, demonstrating the benefit of large-scale continual pretraining.</p>
<h1>7.2 Data Mixture Ablation</h1>
<p>Multiple prior works show that the content of pretraining data can significantly impact the pretraining and downstream performance of the model (Xie et al., 2023; Du et al., 2022; Penedo et al., 2023; Longpre et al., 2023). Thus, in this ablation study, we analyze the impact of different distributions of the training corpus on the model's downstream medical reasoning ability. Based on prior assumptions, we conduct continued pretraining of the Llama2-7B model on several data mixtures. The list of data mixtures and their details are shown in Table 7. We assess the downstream performance of the trial models by evaluating the finetuned models on the training sets of PubMedQA, MedMCQA, and MedQA. The setup for the supervised finetuning is the same as that described in Section 6.2. The results are displayed in Table 8, and all reported metrics are measured in terms of accuracy $(\uparrow)$. We now discuss the findings from the trial-run experiments.</p>
<p>Replay tokens are beneficial for downstream performance. Experience replay with tokens from the general domain improves the model's performance on all benchmarks except MedMCQA. On average, PMC + Replay increases the performance by $1.6 \%$ compared to PMC results. We</p>

<p>Table 8: Performance comparison of different trial-runs on 7B models. We analyze which pretraining data mixture yields the best performance on downstream medical benchmarks. For each data mixture, we first do continued pretraining from the base Llama-2-7B model. Next, we finetune the pretrained model on individual medical tasks' training sets and evaluate using their corresponding test sets. Note that for MMLU-Medical, we use the model finetuned on MedMCQA since both have 4 options. For inference, we select the token with the maximum log probability.
conclude that adding replay data to the training corpus for continued pretraining benefits the model's downstream performance. Based on this observation, we add the same 400M replay tokens to the final training data mixture (GAP + Replay) for our pretraining runs.</p>
<p>Upsampling the medical papers leads to weaker downstream performance. Comparing the upsampled version of PMC to the full PMC corpus, the model's performance on MedMCQA increases, but the performance on MedQA decreases, making this mixture weaker than PMC + Replay. Although showing a weaker performance, there may be other potential benefits of an upsampled version of PMC, such as allowing the model to generate content that is more clinic-ready or reducing the model's tendency to generate content that is not tested on human subjects. However, in the scope of this preliminary analysis of data mixture, we omit additional evaluations since they would require expert-level opinions that are hard to collect.</p>
<p>Adding code does not improve the performance. There has been some speculation that training on code could improve the model's ability to perform reasoning tasks (Chen et al., 2021). However, at this model scale, we find that adding code decreases the overall performance on medical benchmarks, with the PMC-Replay mixture slightly outperforming the 2B-Code addition ( $+0.6 \%$ ) and greatly outperforming the 10B-Code addition by $5.7 \%$. Thus, in this setting, where no explicit reasoning (e.g., mathematical reasoning) is required from the model, we decide against using code in the final pre-training mixture.
GAP mixture is better than PubMed only. The GAP mixture adds PubMed abstracts and medical guidelines to the PMC corpus. Here, we compare GAP + Replay with PMC + Replay, the latter outperforming the former by $2.8 \%$ on average. This mixture leads to the best average performance and is chosen for MEdiTRON's continued pretraining.</p>
<h1>8 Related Work</h1>
<p>Medical Large Language Models. Developing large language models in the medical domain and supporting biomedical and clinical tasks has been an ongoing effort. Early works on adapting pretrained language models to the medical domain focused on pretraining encoder-only models (e.g., BERT) with large-scale biomedical corpora such as the PubMed Central articles and PubMed abstracts (Gu et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2020). Further approaches used links between documents (Yasunaga et al., 2022b) and knowledge graphs (Yasunaga et al., 2022a) to improve model performance. As large autoregressive generative models became more popular and delivered improved performances, decoder-only architectures such as GPT (Radford and Narasimhan, 2018) and Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a) were used to pretrain medical LLMs on medical domain text data (Stanford CRFM; Wu et al., 2023a). With the recent trend of scaling up pretraining data size and model parameter size, multiple studies explored the benefit of scaling up on medical tasks. GatorTronGPT (Peng et al., 2023) is a GPT-3-like (Brown et al., 2020) model with 20B parameters pretrained on 227B words of mixed clinical and English text. Clinical-Camel (Toma et al., 2023) adapted from the Llama-2-70B (Touvron</p>
<p>et al., 2023b) model using QLoRA (Dettmers et al., 2023) training on medical data. Singhal et al. (2023a) and Singhal et al. (2023b) study the medical reasoning ability of Flan-PaLM and PaLM-2, both with 540B parameter sizes. PaLM-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the major medical benchmarks. Our work scales up full-parameter medical domain pretraining to 70B parameters. Our evaluations show that our model outperforms previous pretrained language models and is competitive with Flan-PaLM and PaLM-2.</p>
<p>Continued Pretraining. Early studies on pretrained language models show that continued pretraining in a specific domain is beneficial for downstream task performance (Hoang et al., 2019; Alsentzer et al., 2019; Chakrabarty et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021). Several studies found that continued pretraining of a language model on the unlabeled data of a given task improves the models' end-task performance (Howard and Ruder, 2018; Phang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020a). Gururangan et al. (2020) performed a comprehensive study exploring the benefit of continued pretraining on multiple domains for the BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) class of models and showed that a second phase of in-domain pretraining and adapting to the task's unlabeled data improved the performance on downstream domain-specific tasks. Additional benefits of continued pretraining also include improved zero-shot and few-shot promptability (Wu et al., 2022). In the medical domain, the most similar work to ours is PMC-Llama (Wu et al., 2023a), which adapts the Llama model through continued pretraining on PubMed Central papers and medical textbooks. In contrast to prior works, MEdiTRON studies the benefit of continued pretraining at the 70B scale and shows that expanding the domain-specific pretraining data brings significant performance gain on downstream tasks.</p>
<h1>9 Conclusion</h1>
<p>We release MEdiTRON, a suite of domain-adapted medical LLMs that demonstrate high-level medical reasoning and improved domain-specific benchmark performance. Through continued pretraining on carefully curated high-quality medical resources, including a novel set of clinical guidelines, MEdiTRON shows improved performance over all the state-of-the-art baselines at matched scale on clinical reasoning benchmarks, coming within $10 \%$ performance of state-of-the-art commercial LLMs that are $8 \times$ larger. Importantly, MEdiTRON outperforms all open-source generalist and medical LLMs on all medical benchmarks. We make our models (at both 7B and 70B scale), tools required for curating the training corpus, and our distributed training library available as an open resource. This not only ensures access to real-world evaluation but also enables further fine-tuning and the development of instruction-based models, among other efforts. By providing these resources openly, we aim to help unlock the transformative potential of openly shared models in enhancing medical research, improving patient care, and fostering innovation across various health-related fields.</p>
<p>Safety Advisory. While MEdiTRON is designed to encode medical knowledge from sources of high-quality evidence, it is not yet adapted to deliver this knowledge appropriately, safely, or within professional actionable constraints. We recommend against deploying MEdiTRON in medical applications without extensive use-case alignment, as well as additional testing, specifically including randomized controlled trials in real-world practice settings. While we do not view MEdiTRON as being ready for real-world use in its current form, we release MEdiTRON to the research community to promote work on the safety of language models in medical applications. Our work represents the largest open-source model adapted for the medical domain, trained on a large and diverse medical pretraining corpus. We hope these resources will enable the research community to more comprehensively study large language models for the medical domain.</p>

<p>The availability of open-access clinical practice guidelines (CPG) was critical to this work, and we thank all the societies listed in Table 9. A broader representation of geography, medical specialties, and contexts (especially low-resource settings) could be achieved through more standardized CPG formatting practices to ensure reliable textual extraction (e.g., releasing .txt or .html versions with structured content). We encourage the CPG community to continue to make these documents available (open-access with permissive licenses for incorporation into large language models) and easily usable.
