<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Empowering large language models (LLMs) to accurately express confidence in their answers is essential for reliable and trustworthy decision-making. Previous confidence elicitation methods, which primarily rely on white-box access to internal model information or model fine-tuning, have become less suitable for LLMs, especially closed-source commercial APIs. This leads to a growing need to explore the untapped area of black-box approaches for LLM uncertainty estimation. To better break down the problem, we define a systematic framework with three components: prompting strategies for eliciting verbalized confidence, sampling methods for generating multiple responses, and aggregation techniques for computing consistency. We then benchmark these methods on two key tasks-confidence calibration and failure prediction-across five types of datasets (e.g., commonsense and arithmetic reasoning) and five widely-used LLMs including GPT-4 and LLaMA 2 Chat. Our analysis uncovers several key insights: 1) LLMs, when verbalizing their confidence, tend to be overconfident, potentially imitating human patterns of expressing confidence. 2) As model capability scales up, both calibration and failure prediction performance improve, yet still far from ideal performance. 3) Employing our proposed strategies, such as human-inspired prompts, consistency among multiple responses, and better aggregation strategies can help mitigate this overconfidence from various perspectives. 4) Comparisons with white-box methods indicate that while white-box methods perform better, the gap is narrow, e.g., 0.522 to 0.605 in AUROC. Despite these advancements, none of these techniques consistently outperform others, and all investigated methods struggle in challenging tasks, such as those requiring professional knowledge, indicating significant scope for improvement. We believe this study can serve as a strong baseline and provide insights for eliciting confidence in black-box LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiaoXiong2320/llm-uncertainty.</p>
<h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>A key aspect of human intelligence lies in our capability to meaningfully express and communicate our uncertainty in a variety of ways (Cosmides \&amp; Tooby, 1996). Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for human-machine collaboration, enabling more rational and informed decision-making (Guo et al., 2017; Tomani \&amp; Buettner, 2021). Specifically, accurate confidence estimates of a model can provide valuable insights into the reliability of its responses, facilitating risk assessment and error mitigation (Kuleshov et al., 2018; Kuleshov \&amp; Deshpande, 2022), selective generation (Ren et al., 2022), and reducing hallucinations in natural language generation tasks (Xiao \&amp; Wang, 2021).</p>
<p>In the existing literature, eliciting confidence from machine learning models has predominantly relied on white-box access to internal model information, such as token-likelihoods (Malinin \&amp; Gales, 2020; Kadavath et al., 2022) and associated calibration techniques (Jiang et al., 2021), as well as model fine-tuning (Lin et al., 2022). However, with the prevalence of large language models, these</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>methods are becoming less suitable for several reasons: 1) The rise of closed-source LLMs with commercialized APIs, such as GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2021) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), which only allow textual inputs and outputs, lacking access to token-likelihoods or embeddings; 2) Token-likelihood primarily captures the model's uncertainty about the next token (Kuhn et al., 2023), rather than the semantic probability inherent in textual meanings. For example, in the phrase "Chocolate milk comes from brown cows", every word fits naturally based on its surrounding words, but high individual token likelihoods do not capture the falsity of the overall statement, which requires examining the statement semantically, in terms of its claims; 3) Model fine-tuning demands substantial computational resources, which may be prohibitive for researchers with lower computational resources. Given these constraints, there is a growing need to explore black-box approaches for eliciting the confidence of LLMs in their answers, a task we refer to as confidence elicitation.</p>
<p>Recognizing this research gap, our study aims to contribute to the existing knowledge from two perspectives: 1) explore black-box methods for confidence elicitation, and 2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on methods and directions for eliciting more accurate confidence. To achieve this, we define a systematic framework with three components: prompting strategies for eliciting verbalized confidence, sampling strategies for generating multiple responses, and aggregation strategies for computing the consistency. For each component, we devise a suite of methods. By integrating these components, we formulate a set of algorithms tailored for confidence elicitation. A comprehensive overview of the framework is depicted in Figure 1. We then benchmark these methods on two key tasks-confidence calibration and failure prediction-across five types of tasks (Commonsense, Arithmetic, Symbolic, Ethics and Professional Knowledge) and five widely-used LLMs, i.e., GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2021), GPT-4, Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023) and LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b).</p>
<p>Our investigation yields several observations: 1) LLMs tend to be highly overconfident when verbalizing their confidence, posing potential risks for the safe deployment of LLMs (§5.1). Intriguingly, the verbalized confidence values predominantly fall within the $80 \%$ to $100 \%$ range and are typically in multiples of 5 , similar to how humans talk about confidence. In addition, while scaling model capacity leads to performance improvement, the results remain suboptimal. 2) Prompting strategies, inspired by patterns observed in human dialogues, can mitigate this overconfidence, but the improvement also diminishes as the model capacity scales up (§5.2). Furthermore, while the calibration error (e.g. ECE) can be significantly reduced using suitable prompting strategies, failure prediction still remains a challenge. 3) Our study on sampling and aggregation strategies indicates their effectiveness in improving failure prediction performance (§5.3). 4) A detailed examination of aggregation strategies reveals that they cater to specific performance metrics, i.e., calibration and failure prediction, and can be selected based on desired outcomes (§5.4). 5) Comparisons with white-box methods indicate that while white-box methods perform better, the gap is narrow, e.g., 0.522 to 0.605 in AUROC (§B.1). Despite these insights, it is worth noting that the methods introduced herein still face challenges in failure prediction, especially with tasks demanding specialized knowledge (§6). This emphasizes the ongoing need for further research and development in confidence elicitation for LLMs.</p>
<h1>2 Related Works</h1>
<p>Confidence Elicitation in LLMs. Confidence elicitation is the process of estimating LLM's confidence in their responses without model fine-tuning or accessing internal information. Within this scope, Lin et al. (2022) introduced the concept of verbalized confidence that prompts LLMs to express confidence directly. However, they mainly focus on fine-tuning on specific datasets where the confidence is provided, and its zero-shot verbalized confidence is unexplored. Other approaches, like the external calibrator from Mielke et al. (2022), depend on internal model representations, which are often inaccessible. While Zhou et al. (2023) examines the impact of confidence, it does not provide direct confidence scores to users. Our work aligns most closely with the concurrent study by Tian et al. (2023), which mainly focuses on the use of prompting strategies. Our approach diverges by aiming to explore a broader method space, and propose a comprehensive framework for systematically evaluating various strategies and their integration. We also consider a wider range of models beyond those RLHF-LMs examined in concurrent research, thus broadening the scope of confidence elicitation. Our results reveal persistent challenges across more complex tasks and contribute to a holistic understanding of confidence elicitation. For a more comprehensive discussion of the related works, kindly refer to Appendix C.</p>

<p>Figure 1: An Overview and example of Confidence Elicitation framework, which consists of three components: prompt, sampling and aggregator. By integrating distinct strategies from each component, we can devise different algorithms, e.g., Top-K (Tian et al., 2023) is formulated using Top-K prompt, self-random sampling with $M=1$, and Avg-Conf aggregation. Given an input question, we first choose a suitable prompt strategy, e.g., the vanilla prompt used here. Next, we determine the number of samples to generate ( $M=3$ here) and sampling strategy, and then choose an aggregator based on our preference (e.g. focus more on improving calibration or failure prediction) to compute confidences in its potential answers. The highest confident answer is selected as the final output.</p>
<h1>3 Exploring Black-box Framework for Confidence Elicitation</h1>
<p>In our pursuit to explore black-box approaches for eliciting confidence, we investigated a range of methods and discovered that they can be encapsulated within a unified framework. This framework, with its three pivotal components, offers a variety of algorithmic choices that combine to create diverse algorithms with different benefits for confidence elicitation. In our later experimental section (§5), we will analyze our proposed strategies within each component, aiming to shed light on the best practices for eliciting confidence in black-box LLMs.</p>
<h3>3.1 Motivation of The Framework</h3>
<p>Prompting strategy. The key question we aim to answer here is: in a black-box setting, what form of model inputs and outputs lead to the most accurate confidence estimates? This parallels the rich study in eliciting confidences from human experts: for example, patients often inquire of doctors about their confidence in the potential success of a surgery. We refer to this goal as verbalized confidence, and inspired by strategies for human elicitation, we design a series of human-inspired prompting strategies to elicit the model's verbalized confidence. We then unify these prompting strategies as a building block of our framework (§3.2). In addition, beyond its simplicity, this approach also offers an extra benefit over model's token-likelihood: the verbalized confidence is intrinsically tied to the semantic meaning of the answer instead of its syntactic or lexical form (Kuhn et al., 2023).
Sampling and Aggregation. In addition to the direct insights from model outputs, the variance observed among multiple responses for a given question offers another valuable perspective on model confidence. This line of thought aligns with the principle extensively explored in prior white-box access uncertainty estimation methodologies for classification (Gawlikowski et al., 2021), such as MCDropout (Gal \&amp; Ghahramani, 2016) and Deep Ensemble (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). The challenges in adapting ensemble-based methods lie in two critical components: 1) the sampling strategy, i.e., how to sample multiple responses from the model's answer distribution, and 2) the aggregation strategy, i.e., how to aggregate these responses to yield the final answer and its associated confidence. To optimally harness both textual output and response variance, we have integrated them within a unified framework.</p>
<h3>3.2 Prompting Strategy</h3>
<p>Drawing inspiration from patterns observed in human dialogues, we design a series of human-inspired prompting strategies to tackle challenges, e.g., overconfidence, that are inherent in the vanilla version of verbalized confidence. See Table 1 for an overview of these prompting strategies and Appendix F for complete prompts.</p>
<p>Table 1: Illustration of the prompting strategy (the complete prompt in Appendix F). To help models understand the concept of confidence, we also append the explanation "Note: The confidence indicates how likely you think your answer is true." to every prompt.</p>

<p>CoT. Considering that a better comprehension of a problem can lead to a more accurate understanding of one's certainty, we adopt a reasoning-augmented prompting strategy. In this paper, we use zeroshot Chain-of-Thought, CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) for its proven efficacy in inducing reasoning processes and improving model accuracy across diverse datasets. Alternative strategies such as plan-and-solve (Wang et al., 2023) can also be used.</p>
<p>Self-Probing. A common observation of humans is that they often find it easier to identify errors in others' answers than in their own, as they can become fixated on a particular line of thinking, potentially overlooking mistakes. Building on this assumption, we investigate if a model's uncertainty estimation improves when given a question and its answer, then asked, "How likely is the above answer to be correct"? The procedure involves generating the answer in one chat session and obtaining its verbalized confidence in another independent chat session.</p>
<p>Multi-Step. Our preliminary study shows that LLMs tend to be overconfident when verbalizing their confidence (see Figure 2). To address this, we explore whether dissecting the reasoning process into steps and extracting the confidence of each step can alleviate the overconfidence. The rationale is that understanding each reasoning step's confidence could help the model identify potential inaccuracies and quantify their confidence more accurately. Specifically, for a given question, we prompt models to delineate their reasoning process into individual steps $S_{i}$ and evaluate their confidence in the correctness of this particular step, denoted as $C_{i}$. The overall verbalized confidence is then derived by aggregating the confidence of all steps: $C_{\text {multi-step }}=\prod_{i=1}^{n} C_{i}$, where $n$ represents the total number of reasoning steps.</p>
<p>Top-K. Another way to alleviate overconfidence is to realize the existence of multiple possible solutions or answers, which acts as a normalization for the confidence distribution. Motivated by this, Top-K (Tian et al., 2023) prompts LLMs to generate the top $K$ guesses and their corresponding confidence for a given question.</p>
<h1>3.3 SAMPLING STRATEGY</h1>
<p>Several methods can be employed to elicit multiple responses of the same question from the model: 1) Self-random, leveraging the model's inherent randomness by inputting the same prompt multiple times. The temperature, an adjustable parameter, can be used to calibrate the predicted token distribution, i.e., adjust the diversity of the sampled answers. An alternative choice is to introduce perturbations in the questions: 2) Prompting, by paraphrasing the questions in different ways to generate multiple responses. 3) Misleading, feeding misleading cues to the model, e.g.,"I think the answer might be ...". This method draws inspiration from human behaviors: when confident, individuals tend to stick to their initial answers despite contrary suggestions; conversely, when uncertain, they are more likely to waver or adjust their responses based on misleading hints. Building on this observation, we evaluate the model's response to misleading information to gauge its uncertainty. See Table 11 for the complete prompts.</p>
<h3>3.4 Aggregation Strategy</h3>
<p>Consistency. A natural idea of aggregating different answers is to measure the degree of agreement among the candidate outputs and integrate the inherent uncertainty in the model's output.</p>
<p>For any given question and an associated answer $\hat{Y}$, we sample a set of candidate answers $\hat{Y}_{i}$, where $i \in{1, \ldots, M}$. The agreement between these candidate responses and the original answer then serves as a measure of confidence, computed as follows:</p>
<p>$$
C_{\text {consistency }}=\frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} \mathbb{I}\left{\hat{Y}_{i}=\hat{Y}\right}
$$</p>
<p>Avg-Conf. The previous aggregation method does not utilize the available information of verbalized confidence. It is worth exploring the potential synergy between these uncertainty indicators, i.e., whether the verbalized confidence and the consistency between answers can complement one another. For any question and an associated answer $\hat{Y}$, we sample a candidate set $\left{\hat{Y}<em M="M">{1}, \ldots \hat{Y}</em>\right}$, and compute the confidence as follows:}\right}$ with their corresponding verbalized confidence $\left{C_{1}, \ldots C_{M</p>
<p>$$
C_{\text {conf }}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{M} \mathbb{I}\left{\hat{Y}<em i="i">{i}=\hat{Y}\right} \times C</em>
$$}}{\sum_{i=1}^{M} C_{i}</p>
<p>Pair-Rank. This aggregation strategy is tailored for responses generated using the Top-K prompt, as it mainly utilizes the ranking information of the model's Top-K guesses. The underlying assumption is that the model's ranking between two options may be more accurate than the verbalized confidence it provides, especially given our observation that the latter tends to exhibit overconfidence.
Given a question with $N$ candidate responses, the $i$-th response consists of $K$ sequentially ordered answers, denoted as $S_{K}^{(i)}=\left(S_{1}^{(i)}, S_{2}^{(i)}, \ldots, S_{K}^{(i)}\right)$. Let $\mathcal{A}$ represent the set of unique answers across all $N$ responses, where $M$ is the total number of distinct answers. The event where the model ranks answer $S_{u}$ above $S_{v}$ (i.e., $S_{u}$ appears before $S_{v}$ ) in its $i$-th generation is represented as $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$. In contexts where the generation is implicit, this is simply denoted as $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$. Let $E_{u v}^{(i)}$ be the event where at least one of $S_{u}$ and $S_{v}$ appears in the $i$-th generation. Then the probability of $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$, conditional on $E_{u v}^{(i)}$ and a categorical distribution $P$, is expressed as $\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right)$.
We then utilize a (conditional) maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) inspired approach to derive the categorical distribution $P$ that most accurately reflects these ranking events of all the $M$ responses:</p>
<p>$$
\min <em i="1">{P}-\sum</em>\right)=1
$$}^{N} \sum_{S_{u} \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{S_{v} \in \mathcal{A}} \mathbb{I}\left{S_{u} \stackrel{(i)}{\succ} S_{v}\right} \cdot \log \mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right) \quad \text { subject to } \sum_{S_{u} \in \mathcal{A}} P\left(S_{u</p>
<p>Proposition 3.1. Suppose the Top-K answers are drawn from a categorical distribution $P$ without replacement. Define the event $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$ to indicate that the realization $S_{u}$ is observed before $S_{v}$ in the $i$-th draw without replacement. Under this setting, the conditional probability is given by:</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right)=\frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)}
$$</p>
<p>The optimization objective to minimize the expected loss is then:</p>
<p>$$
\min <em i="1">{P}-\sum</em>\right)=1
$$}^{N} \sum_{S_{u} \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{S_{v} \in \mathcal{A}} \mathbb{I}\left{S_{u} \stackrel{(i)}{\succ} S_{v}\right} \cdot \log \frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)} \quad \text { s.t. } \sum_{S_{u} \in \mathcal{A}} P\left(S_{u</p>
<p>To address this constrained optimization problem, we first introduce a change of variables by applying the softmax function to the unbounded domain. This transformation inherently satisfies the simplex constraints, converting our problem into an unconstrained optimization setting. Subsequently, optimization techniques such as gradient descent can be used to obtain the categorical distribution.</p>
<h1>4 EXPERIMENT SETUP</h1>
<p>Datasets. We evaluate the quality of confidence estimates across five types of reasoning tasks: 1) Commonsense Reasoning on two benchmarks, Sports Understanding (SportUND) (Kim, 2021) and StrategyQA (Geva et al., 2021) from BigBench (Ghazal et al., 2013); 2) Arithmetic Reasoning on two math problems, GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and SVAMP (Patel et al., 2021); 3) Symbolic Reasoning</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Empirical distribution (First row) and reliability diagram (Second row) of vanilla verbalized confidence across four models on GSM8K. The prompt used is in Table 14. From this figure, we can observe that 1) the confidence levels primarily range between $80 \%$ and $100 \%$, often in multiples of $5 ; 2$ ) the accuracy within each bin is much lower than its corresponding confidence, indicating significant overconfidence.
on two benchmarks, Date Understanding (DateUnd) (Wu \&amp; Wang, 2021) and Object Counting (ObjectCou) (Wang et al., 2019) from BigBench; 4) tasks requiring Professional Knowledge, such as Professional Law (Prf-Law) from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021); 5) tasks that require Ethical Knowledge, e.g., Business Ethics (Biz-Ethics) from MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Models We incorporate a range of widely used LLMs of different scales, including Vicuna 13B (Chiang et al., 2023), GPT-3 175B (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI, 2021), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and LLaMA 2 70B (Touvron et al., 2023b).</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics. To evaluate the quality of confidence outputs, two orthogonal tasks are typically employed: calibration and failure prediction (Naeini et al., 2015; Yuan et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2022). Calibration evaluates how well a model's expressed confidence aligns with its actual accuracy: ideally, samples with an $80 \%$ confidence should have an accuracy of $80 \%$. Such well-calibrated scores are crucial for applications including risk assessment. On the other hand, failure prediction gauges the model's capacity to assign higher confidence to correct predictions and lower to incorrect ones, aiming to determine if confidence scores can effectively distinguish between correct and incorrect predictions. In our study, we employ Expected Calibration Error (ECE) for calibration evaluation and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) for gauging failure prediction. Given the potential imbalance from varying accuracy levels, we also introduce AUPRC-Positive (PR-P) and AUPRC-Negative (PR-N) metrics to emphasize whether the model can identify incorrect and correct samples, respectively.</p>
<p>Further details on datasets, models, metrics, and implementation can be found in Appendix E.</p>
<h1>5 Evaluation and Analysis</h1>
<p>To provide insights on the best practice for eliciting confidence, we systematically examine each component (see Figure 1) of the confidence elicitation framework (§3). We test the performance on eight datasets of five different reasoning types and five commonly used models (see §4), and yield the following key findings.</p>
<h3>5.1 LLMs TEND TO BE OVERCONFIDENT WHEN VERBALIZING THEIR CONFIDENCE</h3>
<p>The distribution of verbalized confidences mimics how humans talk about confidence. To examine model's capacity to express verbalized confidence, we first visualize the distribution of confidence in Figure 2. Detailed results on other datasets and models are provided in Appendix Figure 5. Notably, the models tend to have high confidence for all samples, appearing as multiples of 5 and with most values ranging between the $80 \%$ to $100 \%$ range, which is similar to the patterns identified in the training corpus for GPT-like models as discussed by Zhou et al. (2023). Such behavior suggests that models might be imitating human expressions when verbalizing confidence.</p>

<p>Calibration and failure prediction performance improve as model capacity scales. The comparison of the performance of various models (Table 2) reveals a trend: as we move from GPT-3, Vicuna, GPT-3.5 to GPT-4, with the increase of model accuracy, there is also a noticeable decrease in ECE and increase in AUROC, e.g., approximate $22.2 \%$ improvement in AUROC from GPT-3 to GPT-4.</p>
<p>Vanilla verbalized confidence exhibits significant overconfidence and poor failure prediction, casting doubts on its reliability. Table 2 presents the performance of vanilla verbalized confidence across five models and eight tasks. According to the criteria given in Srivastava et al. (2023), GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and Vicuna exhibit notably high ECE values, e.g., the average ECE exceeding 0.377 , suggesting that the verbalized confidence of these LLMs are poorly calibrated. While GPT-4 displays lower ECE, its AUROC and AUPRC-Negative scores remain suboptimal, with an average AUROC of merely $62.7 \%$-close to the $50 \%$ random guess threshold-highlighting challenges in distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions.</p>
<h1>5.2 Human-inspired Prompting Strategies Partially Reduce Overconfidence</h1>
<p>Human-inspired prompting strategies improve model accuracy and calibration, albeit with diminishing returns in advanced models like GPT-4. As illustrated in Figure 3, we compare the performance of five prompting strategies across five datasets on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Analyzing the average ECE, AUROC, and their respective performances within each dataset, human-inspired strategies offer consistent improvements in accuracy and calibration over the vanilla baseline, with modest advancements in failure prediction.</p>
<p>No single prompting strategy consistently outperforms the others. Figure 3 suggests that there is no single strategy that can consistently outperform the others across all the datasets and models. By evaluating the average rank and performance enhancement for each method over five task types, we find that Self-Probing maintains the most consistent advantage over the baseline on GPT-4, while Top- $K$ emerges as the top performer on GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>While ECE can be effectively reduced using suitable prompting strategies, failure prediction still remains a challenge. Comparing the average calibration performance across datasets ('mean</p>

<p>Figure 3: Comparative analysis of 5 prompting strategies over 5 datasets for 2 models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). The 'average' bar represents the mean ECE for a given prompting strategy across datasets. The 'mean ECE' line is the average across all strategies and datasets. AUROC is calculated in a similar manner. The accuracy comparison is shown in Appendix B.4.
ece' lines) and the average failure prediction performance ('mean auroc'), we find that while we can reduce ECE with the right prompting strategy, the model's failure prediction capability is still limited, i.e., close to the performance of random guess (AUROC=0.5). A closer look at individual dataset performances reveals that the proposed prompt strategies such as CoT have significantly increased the accuracy (see Table 8), while the confidence output distribution still remains at the range of $80 \%-100 \%$, suggesting that a reduction in overconfidence is due to the diminished gap between average confidence and accuracy, not necessarily indicating a substantial increase in the model's ability to judge the correctness of its responses. For example, with the CoT prompting on the GSM8K dataset, GPT-4 with $93.6 \%$ accuracy achieves a near-optimal ECE 0.064 by assigning $100 \%$ confidence to all samples. However, since all samples receive the same confidence, it is challenging to distinguish between correct and incorrect samples based on the verbalized confidence.</p>

<p>Consistency among multiple responses is more effective in improving failure prediction and calibration compared to verbalized confidence $(M=1)$, with particularly notable improvements on the arithmetic task. Table 3 demonstrates that the sampling strategy with 5 sampled responses paired with consistency aggregation consistently outperform verbalized confidence in calibration and failure prediction, particularly on arithmetic tasks, e.g., GSM8K showcases a remarkable improvement in AUROC from $54.8 \%$ (akin to random guessing) to $92.7 \%$, effectively distinguishing between incorrect and correct answers. The average performance in the last two columns also indicates improved ECE and AUROC scores, suggesting that obtaining the variance among multiple responses can be a good indicator of uncertainty.</p>
<p>As the number of sampled responses increases, model performance improves significantly and then converges. Figure 7 exhibits the performance of various number of sampled responses $M$ from $M=1$ to $M=13$. The result suggests that the ECE and AUROC could be improved by sampling more responses, but the improvement becomes marginal as the number gets larger. Additionally, as the computational time and resources required for $M$ responses go linearly with the baseline $(M=1)$, $M$ thus presents a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Detailed experiments investigating the impact of the number of responses can be found in Appendix B. 6 and B.7.</p>
<h3>5.4 Introducing Verbalized Confidence Into The Aggregation Outperforms Consistency-only Aggregation</h3>
<p>Pair-Rank achieves better performance in calibration while Avg-Conf boosts more in failure prediction. On the average scale, we find that Pair-Rank emerges as the superior choice for calibration that can reduce ECE to as low as 0.028 , while Avg-Conf stands out for its efficacy in failure prediction.</p>
<p>Table 4: Performance comparison of aggregation strategies on GPT-4 using Top-K Prompt and Self-Random sampling. Pair-Rank aggregation achieves the lowest ECE in half of the datasets and maintains the lowest average ECE in calibration; Avg-Conf surpasses other methods in terms of AUROC in five out of the six datasets in failure prediction. Metrics are given by $\times 10^{2}$.</p>

<p>This observation agrees with the underlying principle that Pair-Rank learns the categorical distribution of potential answers through our $K$ observations, which aligns well with the notion of calibration and is therefore more likely to lead to a lower ECE. In contrast, Avg-Conf leverages the consistency, using verbalized confidence as a weighting factor for each answer. This approach is grounded in the observation that accurate samples often produce consistent outcomes, while incorrect ones yield various responses, leading to a low consistency. This assumption matches well with failure prediction, and is confirmed by the results in Table 4. In addition, our comparative analysis of various aggregation strategies reveals that introducing verbalized confidence into the aggregation (e.g., Pair-Rank and Avg-Conf) is more effective compared to consistency-only aggregation (e.g., Consistency), especially when LLM queries are costly, and we are limited in sampling frequency (set to $M=5$ queries in our experiment). Verbalized confidence, albeit imprecise, reflects the model's uncertainty tendency and can enhance results when combined with ensemble methods.</p>
<h1>6 DISCUSSIONS</h1>
<p>In this study, we focus on confidence elicitation, i.e., empowering Large Language Models (LLMs) to accurately express the confidence in their responses. Recognizing the scarcity of existing literature on this topic, we define a systematic framework with three components: prompting, sampling and aggregation to explore confidence elicitation algorithms and then benchmark these algorithms on two tasks across eight datasets and five models. Our findings reveal that LLMs tend to exhibit overconfidence when verbalizing their confidence. This overconfidence can be mitigated to some extent by using proposed prompting strategies such as CoT and Self-Probing. Furthermore, sampling strategies paired with specific aggregators can improve failure prediction, especially in arithmetic datasets. We hope this work could serve as a foundation for future research in these directions.</p>
<p>Comparative analysis of white-box and black-box methods. While our method is centered on black-box settings, comparing it with white-box methods helps us understand the progress in the field. We conducted comparisons on five datasets with three white-box methods (see §B.1) and observed that although white-box methods indeed perform better, the gap is narrow, e.g., 0.522 to 0.605 in AUROC. This finding underscores that the field remains challenging and unresolved.</p>
<p>Are current algorithms satisfactory? Not quite. Our findings (Table 4) reveals that while the best-performing algorithms can reduce ECE to a quite low value like 0.028 , they still face challenges in predicting incorrect predictions, especially in those tasks requiring professional knowledge, such as professional law. This underscores the need for ongoing research in confidence elicitation.</p>
<p>What is the recommendation for practitioners? Balancing between efficiency, simplicity, and effectiveness, and based on our empirical results, we recommend a stable-performing method for practitioners: Top-K prompt + Self-Random sampling + Avg-Conf or Pair-Rank aggregation. Please refer to Appendix D for the reasoning and detailed discussions, including the considerations when using black-box confidence elicitation algorithms and why these methods fail in certain cases.</p>
<p>Limitations and Future Work: 1) Scope of Datasets. We mainly focuses on fixed-form and freeform question-answering QA tasks where the ground truth answer is unique, while leaving tasks such as summarization and open-ended QA to the future work. 2) Black-box Setting. Our findings indicate black-box approaches remain suboptimal, while the white-box setting, with its richer information access, may be a more promising avenue. Integrating black-box methods with limited white-box access data, such as model logits provided by GPT-3, could be a promising direction.</p>

<h1>A Proof of Proposition 3.1</h1>
<p>Notation. Given a question with $N$ candidate responses, the $i$-th response consists of $K$ sequentially ordered answers, denoted as $\mathcal{S}<em 1="1">{K}^{(i)}=\left(S</em>\right)$.
Proposition A.1. Suppose the Top-K answers are drawn from a categorical distribution $P$ without replacement. Define the event $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$ to indicate that the realization $S_{u}$ is observed before $S_{v}$ in the $i$-th draw without replacement. Under this setting, the conditional probability is given by:}^{(i)}, S_{2}^{(i)}, \ldots, S_{K}^{(i)}\right)$. Let $\mathcal{A}=\left{S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{M}\right}$ represent the set of unique answers across all $N$ responses, where $M$ is the total number of distinct answers. The event where the model ranks answer $S_{u}$ above $S_{v}$ in its $i$-th generation is represented as $\left(S_{u} \stackrel{(i)}{\succ} S_{v}\right)$. In contexts where the generation is implicit, this is simply denoted as $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$. Let $E_{u v}^{(i)}$ be the event where at least one of $S_{u}$ and $S_{v}$ appears in the $i$-th generation. The probability of $\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v}\right)$, given $E_{u v}^{(i)}$ and a categorical distribution $P$, is expressed as $\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right)=\frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)}
$$</p>
<p>The optimization objective to minimize the expected loss is then:</p>
<p>$$
\min <em i="1">{P}-\sum</em>\right)=1
$$}^{N} \sum_{S_{u} \in \mathcal{A}} \sum_{S_{v} \in \mathcal{A}} \mathbb{I}\left{S_{u} \stackrel{(i)}{\succ} S_{v}\right} \cdot \log \frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)} \quad \text { s.t. } \sum_{S_{u} \in \mathcal{A}} P\left(S_{u</p>
<p>Proof. Let us begin by examining the position $j$ in the response sequence $\mathcal{S}<em u="u">{K}^{(i)}$ where either $S</em>$ :}$ or $S_{v}$ is first sampled, and the other has not yet been sampled. We denote this event as $F_{j}^{(i)}\left(S_{u}, S_{v}\right)$, and for simplicity, we refer to it as $F_{j</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{j}=F_{j}^{(i)}\left(S_{u}, S_{v}\right) &amp; ={\text { the earliest position in } \mathcal{S}<em u="u">{K}^{(i)} \text { where either } S</em> j} \
&amp; ={\forall m, n \in{1,2, \ldots, N} \mid S_{m}^{(i)}=S_{u}, S_{n}^{(i)}=S_{v}, j=\min (m, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$} \text { or } S_{v} \text { appears is </p>
<p>Given this event, the probability that $S_{u}$ is sampled before $S_{v}$ across all possible positions $j$ is:</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{N} \mathbb{P}\left(F_{j} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right) \times \underbrace{\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}\right)}_{\text {(a) }}
$$</p>
<p>To further elucidate (1), which is conditioned on $F_{j}$, we note that the first sampled answer between $S_{u}$ and $S_{v}$ appears at position $j$. We then consider all potential answers sampled prior to $j$. For this, we introduce a permutation set $\mathcal{H}<em j-1="j-1">{j-1}$ to encapsulate all feasible combinations of answers for the initial $j-1$ samplings. A representative sampling sequence is given by: $\mathcal{S}</em>\right}\right}$.
Consequently, (a) can be articulated as:}=\left{S_{(1)} \succ S_{(2)} \succ\right.$ $\left.\cdots \succ S_{(j-1)} \mid \forall l \in{1,2, \ldots, j-1}, S_{(l)} \in \mathcal{A} \backslash\left{S_{u}, S_{v</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}\right)=\sum_{\mathcal{S}<em j-1="j-1">{j-1} \in \mathcal{H}</em>}} \mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{S<em u="u" v="v">{j-1} \mid P, E</em>}^{(i)}, F_{j}\right) \times \underbrace{\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, \mathcal{S<em j="j">{j-1}, F</em>
$$}\right)}_{\text {(b) }</p>
<p>Consider the term (b), which signifies the probability that, given the first $j-1$ samplings and the restriction that the $j$-th sampling can only be $S_{u}$ or $S_{v}, S_{u}$ is sampled prior to $S_{v}$. This probability is articulated as:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}, \mathcal{S}<em j="j">{j-1}\right) &amp; =\frac{\mathbb{P}\left(S</em>}^{(i)}=S_{u} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}, \mathcal{S<em j="j">{j-1}\right)}{\mathbb{P}\left(S</em>}^{(i)}=S_{u} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}, \mathcal{S<em j="j">{j-1}\right)+\mathbb{P}\left(S</em>}^{(i)}=S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}, \mathcal{S<em u="u">{j-1}\right)} \
&amp; =\frac{\frac{P\left(S</em>}\right)}{1-\sum_{S_{m} \in \mathcal{S<em m="m">{j-1}} P\left(S</em>}\right)}}{\frac{P\left(S_{v}\right)}{1-\sum_{S_{m} \in \mathcal{S<em m="m">{j-1}} P\left(S</em>}\right)}+\frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{1-\sum_{S_{m} \in \mathcal{S<em m="m">{j-1}} P\left(S</em> \
&amp; =\frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$}\right)}</p>
<p>Integrating equation (9) into equation (8), we obtain:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}, F_{j}\right) &amp; =\sum_{\mathcal{S}<em j-1="j-1">{j-1} \in \mathcal{H}</em>}} \mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{S<em j="j">{j-1} \mid P, F</em> \
&amp; =\frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)} \times \sum_{\mathcal{S}}\right) \times \frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)<em j-1="j-1">{j-1} \in \mathcal{H}</em>}} \mathbb{P}\left(\mathcal{S<em u="u" v="v">{j-1} \mid P, E</em>\right) \

\end{aligned}
$$}^{(i)}, F_{j</p>
<p>Subsequently, incorporating equation (10) into equation (7), we deduce:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbb{P}\left(S_{u} \succ S_{v} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right) &amp; =\sum_{j=1}^{K} \mathbb{P}\left(F_{j} \mid P, E_{u v}^{(i)}\right) \times \frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)} \

&amp; \stackrel{(d)}{=} \frac{P\left(S_{u}\right)}{P\left(S_{u}\right)+P\left(S_{v}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The derivations in (c) and (d) employ the Law of Total Probability.

<h1>B Detailed Experiment Results</h1>
<h2>B. 1 White-Box Methods OUTPERFORM BLACK-BOX METHODS, BUT THE GAP IS NARROW.</h2>
<p>Comparative Analysis of White-Box and Black-Box Methods: Which performs better - white-box or black-box methods? Do white-box methods, with their access to more internal information, outperform their black-box counterparts? If so, how large is the performance gap? To address these questions, we conduct a comparative analysis of white-box methods based on token probability against black-box models utilizing verbalized confidence.</p>
<p>Implementation details: We utilize the probabilities of each output token to develop three token-probability-based white-box methods: 1) Sequence Probability (seq-prob), which aggregates the probabilities of all tokens; 2) Length-Normalized Sequence Probability (len-norm-prob), which normalizes the sequence probability based on sequence length, i.e., seq-prob ${ }^{1 / \text { length }}$; 3) Key Token Probability (token-prob), designed to focus on the result-specific tokens, e.g., "35" in the output sequence "Explanation: ....; Answer: 35; ...", thereby minimizing the influence of irrelevant output tokens. For our implementation, we use the Chain-of-Thought and Top-K Verbalized Confidence prompt to acquire verbalized confidence and select GPT3 as the backbone model.</p>
<p>Findings: Our comparative analysis, detailed in Table 5 and Table 6, yields several key insights: 1) Generally, white-box methods exhibit better performance, with length-normalized sequence probability and key token probability emerging as the most effective methods across five datasets and four evaluation metrics. 2) The gap between white-box and black-box methods is relatively modest. Moreover, even the best-performing white-box methods fall short of achieving satisfactory results. This is particularly apparent in the AUROC metric, where the performance of nearly all methods across various datasets ranges between $0.5-0.6$, signifying a limited capability in distinguishing between correct and incorrect responses. 3) These experimental results suggest that uncertainty estimation in LLMs remains a challenging and unresolved issue. As mentioned in our introduction, the logit-based methods, which predominantly capture the model's uncertainty regarding the next token, are less effective in capturing the semantic uncertainty inherent in their textual meanings. Although several alternative approaches like semantic uncertainty (Kuhn et al., 2023) have been proposed, they come with significant computational demands. This scenario underscores the need for future research on both white-box and black-box methods to discover more efficient and effective methods for uncertainty estimation in LLMs.</p>
<h2>B. 2 HOW MUCH DOES THE ROLE-PLAY PROMPT AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE?</h2>
<p>To explore how the verbalized confidence elicitation performance varies when LLMs are asked to play different personalities such as "confident" and "cautious", we conduct the experiment in Figure 4 and in Table 7. The results are derived when adding "You are a confident GPT" (Left) and "You are a cautious GPT" (Right) to the beginning of the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt (Table 15). The experimental results show that the difference between their confidence distribution seems minimal, suggesting that assuming different personalities does not significantly affect performance metrics such as accuracy, ECE, and AUROC.</p>
<h2>B. 3 How is the distribution of Vanilla Verbalized Confidence Across Models AND DATASETS?</h2>
<p>Figure 5 presents the empirical distribution of vanilla verbalized confidence across 4 models and 5 datasets. Notably, all the models output confidence as the multiples of 5 , with most values ranging between the $80 \%$ to $100 \%$ range. This behavior resembles the patterns identified in the training corpus for GPT-like models as discussed by Zhou et al. (2023). Such behavior suggests that models might be imitating human expressions when verbalizing confidence.</p>
<h2>B. 4 Detailed Performance of Different Prompting Strategies</h2>
<p>Multi-step and Top-K prompting strategies demonstrate promising results in reducing ECE and improving AUROC, with Top-K being relatively more effective. Figure 6 presents a comparison of various prompting strategies (CoT, Multi-Step, Top-K) against vanilla verbalized confidence.</p>
<p>Table 5: Performance comparison (metrics are given by $\times 10^{2}$ ) of token-probability-based whitebox methods including the baseline sequence probability ("seq-prob"), length-normalized sequence probability ("len-norm-prob") and key token probability ("token-prob"), and black-box verbalized confidence ("Verbalized") on GPT-3 using Top-K Prompt.</p>

<p>Figure 4: Distribution of the verbalized confidence with different specified role descriptions in prompts. The results are derived when adding "You are a confident GPT" (Left) and "You are a cautious GPT" (Right) to the beginning of the Chain of Thought (CoT) prompt (Table 15). All other aspects of the prompts remain identical to the standard CoT format.</p>
<p>The detailed performance of CoT, Multi-Step, and Top-K prompt can be found in Table 8, Table 9 and Table 10, respectively. Judging from the 'average' bar, which computes the mean value across five datasets, both Multi-step and Top-K prompting strategies effectively reduce ECE and enhance AUROC. Moreover, Top-K shows relatively better performance improvements. The intuition behind this improvement is that this prompting strategy, requesting the model to generate multiple guesses along with their corresponding confidences, naturally nudges the model to be aware of the existence of</p>

<h1>B. 5 Top-K Verbalized Confidence Performance</h1>
<p>The detailed experiments performance of Top-K verbalized confidence can be found in Table 10.</p>
<h2>B. 6 Impact of Misleading Prompts in Misleading Sampling Strategy</h2>
<p>To study the effect of different misleading prompts used in misleading sampling strategy, we categorize the prompts into three types: Weak Claim, Strong Claim, and External Source. The specific prompts are shown in Table 11. The Weak Claim category represents prompts that exhibit uncertainty, such as "I vaguely remember the answer is" or "I think the answer should be". These prompts suggest that the user is providing misleading information to the Large Language Model (LLM) but lacks confidence in the information provided. The Strong Claim category includes prompts like "I am pretty sure that this is" or "I am very confident that", which express a high degree of certainty. The External Source</p>

<p>Figure 5: Empirical distribution of vanilla verbalized confidence across 4 models and 5 datasets. The prompt used is in Table 14. From this figure, we can observe that 1) the confidence levels primarily range between $80 \%$ and $100 \%$, often in multiples of 5 ; 2) a large portion of incorrect predictions (red) has been observed even in the $100 \%$ confidence bar, indicating significant overconfidence.

category represents prompts that cite external sources as their evidence, such as "Wikipedia says" or "the latest research shows that".</p>
<p>Our experimental results (Table 11) indicate that the Weak Claim category performs better. A possible explanation is that on one hand even providing weak misleading information, the model will analyze and reassess their answers. On the other hand, since the misleading answers are generated randomly, confidently providing this information can sometimes lead to negative effects. For example, the model provides a correct answer with moderate confidence. However, if a misleading hint is provided</p>

<h1>B. 7 IMPACT OF THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATE ANSWERS</h1>
<p>We investigate the impact of the number of candidate answers, denoted as $K$, utilized in the sampling strategy. Specifically, $K$ represents the number of queries used to construct the set of candidate answers for consistency calculation. We illustrate its calibration performance (ECE) and failure prediction performance (AUROC) in relation to varying numbers of $K$ (ranging from $K=1$ to $K=13$ ) in Figure 7.</p>
<p>The results indicate that, in terms of AUROC, a higher candidate set size $K$ contributes to superior performance and reduced variance. However, the optimal candidate size $K$ for ECE varies across different datasets. For instance, the StrategyQA dataset exhibits improved performance with a larger $K$, whereas the Business Ethics dataset generally performs better with a moderate number of candidate answers (e.g., $K=4$ ). This observation can be attributed to the limited variability of misleading information (restricted to 4 types) used in our experiments for the Business Ethics dataset, implying that the introduction of a large number of more queries does not significantly enhance the information pool. Therefore, to strike a balance between computational efficiency and performance, we set the candidate set to be 4 in our study.</p>

<h1>B. 8 PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT CONFIDENCE ELICITATION METHODS</h1>
<h2>C Related Works</h2>
<p>Confidence Elicitation in LLMs. Confidence elicitation refers to the process of estimating LLM's confidence in their responses, without relying on model fine-tuning or accessing the proprietary information of LLMs. Within this scope, Lin et al. (2022) proposes the concept of verbalized confidence that elicits the model to output confidence directly. However, the evaluation is tailored

<p>Figure 7: Impact of the number of responses responses on GPT-3.5. The sampling strategy is fixed as misleading. For every given number of misleading hints, we randomly sample the specified number of queries for 5 times and calculate the mean ECE and AUROC, and compute its variance(plotted as error bar). Note that the number of hints plus 1 is the number of responses sampled during experiment.</p>
