                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Null-trajectories, deflection angle, and gravitational lensing are studied in the background spacetime of the generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes and it's five dimensional version embedded in a warped background. We show that these wormholes can be distinguished through the study of gravitational lensing. In particular, the difference in deflection angles, radius of the Einstein rings, and the image positions are quantified by the wormhole parameters -- the steepness constant ($m\geq 2$), the throat radius, and `$\delta$' that characterizes the warping in extra dimension. We demonstrate our results analytically with $m=2$ cases and graphically otherwise.</p>

<p>Gravitational Lensing and Deflection Angle by generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole Embedded in Warped Braneworld Background
16 Nov 2024247BD37A785ADBD536C6F51C256F942FarXiv:2411.10804v1[gr-qc]
Null-trajectories, deflection angle, and gravitational lensing are studied in the background spacetime of the generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes and it's five dimensional version embedded in a warped background.We show that these wormholes can be distinguished through the study of gravitational lensing.In particular, the difference in deflection angles, radius of the Einstein rings, and the image positions are quantified by the wormhole parameters-the steepness constant (m ≥ 2), the throat radius, and 'δ' that characterizes the warping in extra dimension.We demonstrate our results analytically with m = 2 cases and graphically otherwise.</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Wormholes create "short-cuts" that enable "apparently faster than light" movement between two distant spacetime sites [1][2][3].Although initially the concept was discussed with great hope [4,5], it was quickly discovered that the Einstein-Rosen "wormhole" is not a stable structure as was previously thought.The speed at which the wormhole opens and closes prevents even photons from "traveling" through it.A wormhole may be supported by exotic matter [6], albeit it's not yet known if such configurations are physically possible.The presence of negative energy density makes them challenging to produce in macroscopic quantities [3].The initial purpose may have faded, but the Einstein-Rosen bridge is nevertheless mentioned on occasion as a practical answer to the perplexing problem of interplanetary travel [2,7].Many people believe that traversable wormholes are more science fiction than science.In classical general relativity, they are prohibited by the average null energy condition.Thus, within the paradigm of general relativity, wormholes are not real if energy conditions are strictly followed [1,2,8,9].Note that quantum fluctuations allow for the formation of tiny wormholes [10][11][12].However, they are insufficient to create macroscopic wormholes.</p>
<p>Exotic matter that violates energy conditions can be avoided classically [13][14][15][16].One approach is to use modified gravity theories as a framework.There are numerous modified gravity models with non-exotic matter [17][18][19][20][21][22][23].However, in some circumstances, the convergence criterion of null geodesics is violated.Using the models of dynamical wormholes [24][25][26][27][28] violations of the energy conditions could be avoided.The f (R) and higher order gravity theories [29][30][31][32] are common modified gravity theories that analyze wormhole geometries using a feasible matter source.Recent studies have successfully modeled and analyzed wormholes under Born-Infeld gravity [33][34][35] and torsional gravity [36][37][38] that satisfy energy conditions.</p>
<p>Various circumstances, including gravitational lensing [39][40][41], have distinct physical signatures.Advances in gravitational wave astronomy [42][43][44] and black hole imaging [45] have opened up the possibility of the search for wormhole signatures.Recently, the idea of astrophysical wormholes in dark matter galaxy haloes has been raised [46,47].</p>
<p>Wormholes, also known as black hole mimickers, have a distinct signature that can be imprinted during mergers or quasi-normal modes [48][49][50][51][52].These signatures, if detected, would support modified theories of gravity above general relativity.This article explores lensing properties of a recently introduced model of a wormhole embedded in a warped five-dimensional thick braneworld.Previous research has focused on wormholes within the Kaluza-Klein, DGP, and Randal-Sundrum thin braneworld scenarios [53][54][55][56][57][58].</p>
<p>Extra dimensions have been discussed in the literature for nearly a century, but have yet to be confirmed through experiments [59,60].This notion has remained popular due to the benefits it provide.For example, when creating models of unification, such as superstrings [61], or addressing the age-old hierarchy problem [62,63].Using octonions to reinterpret the standard model has led to extra dimensions naturally [64][65][66][67][68][69].Theories of extra dimensions are based on fundamental physical symmetries and not just extensions of existing theories.Warped braneworld models [70][71][72] are a prominent type of higher-dimensional model.This model has a nonfactorizable geometry and a curved five-dimensional spacetime.The geometry of the four-dimensional section is affected by the extra dimension via a warping factor, which is unique to this type of model.</p>
<p>Recently embedding of a four-dimensional wormhole in a static five-dimensional warped geometry has been considered [73].Numerical construction of such 5D geometry with a cosmological thick brane in the presence of the both growing and decaying warp factor is given earlier in [74].The wormhole family used for embedding is based on [75], which extends the Ellis-Bronnikov (EB) spacetime [76,77] to give a generalized family (GEB) of spacetimes that partially satisfy the energy conditions.</p>
<p>The GEB wormhole geometry embedded in a five-dimensional warped background, demonstrate that a diminishing warp factor leads to minimisation of violation of the weak energy conditions even for the EB geometry, while improving all other energy conditions in comparison to the four-dimensional case.Earlier we have analysed timelike trajectories and evolution of geodesic congruences in this background [78,79].</p>
<p>In continuation, in the present work, we study the null trajectories and gravitational lensing around the GEB wormholes and the resulting distinguishing features that differentiate the 4-D GEB from its warped 5-D counter parts.In Sec II, we briefly review the warped GEB (WGEB) model.Comparative studies of Null-Trajectories in 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB models are presented in Sec III.Deflection of light rays and gravitational lensing by different species are studied and thereby distinguished respectively in the Sec.IV and Sec.V. Finally, we summarize our results in Sec.VI.</p>
<p>II. WORMHOLE-GEOMETRY</p>
<p>The general form of the 4D-line-element embedded in a warped 5D spacetime is
ds 2 = g µν dx µ dx ν + g 44 (dx 4 ) 2 , (2.1)
where, g µν dx µ dx ν represents the 4 dimensional part on the right hand side of Eq.</p>
<p>(2.1) µ runs from 0 to 3 and x 4 represents the extra dimension .In the so-called tortoise coordinate l ∈ (−∞, ∞), our (5D-WGEB) model [73], is given by
ds 2 = e 2f (y) − dt 2 + dl 2 + r 2 (l) dθ 2 + sin 2 (θ) dϕ 2 + dy 2 , (2.2)
where, y is the extra dimension (−∞ ≤ y ≤ ∞), f (y) is a warp factor chosen as f (y) = ± log[cosh(y/y 0 )] which corresponds to a thick brane scenario [80].The growing and decaying warp factor solutions were found using tachyon and phantom scalar field, respectively in [81] and [82].At y = 0, metric (2.2) reduces to a generalised version of Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole geometry (4D-GEB) given by [75],
ds 2 = −dt 2 + dl 2 + r 2 (l) dθ 2 + sin 2 (θ) dϕ 2 (2.3)
where,
r(l) = (b m 0 + l m ) 1/m . (2.4) Metric (2.
3) is spherically symmetric and ultra-static model in which l represents the proper radial distance, b 0 is defined as the neck or throat radius of wormhole and m is a free metric parameter determining the steepness of the neck.The condition on the wormhole parameter, m ≥ 2s, where s ∈ N is the set of natural number, makes the r(l) smooth in the entire domain of proper radial distance, l (−∞ ≤ l ≤ ∞).In the usual radial coordinate r(l), the Eq.(2.3) can be written as,
ds 2 = −dt 2 + dr 2 1 − b(r) r + r 2 dθ 2 + sin 2 θdϕ 2 (2.5)
Where r and l are related through the shape function b(r) as,
dl 2 = dr 2 1 − b(r) r =⇒ b(r) = r − r (3−2m) (r m − b m 0 ) (2− 2 m ) . (2.6)
metric, geodesically complete, horizonless space-time constructed by using phantom scalar field (a scalar field with negative kinetic term in stress-energy-tensor violating null energy condition).The Ricci scalar for the 4D model is given by
(4) R = − 2 r 2 r ′2 + 2rr ′′ − 1 . (2.7)
Note that, about l ∼ 0.63 b 0 distance away from the neck, the curvature falls below 1/b 2 0 .For higher m -geometries the curvature begin to flatten out at even smaller distance from the neck.This implies that, trajectories that pass by at even further distance will feel lesser effect of the wormhole and one may consider the size of the wormhole as b 0 itself for all practical purposes.The geometry, curvature invariant quantity, time-like geodesics and geodesiccongruences for the 5D-WGEB spacetimes have been thoroughly discussed in the preceding papers [73,78,79].More recently, the stability analysis or the quasi-normal modes of the 5D-WGEB geometry is studied in detail that shows signature of the extra dimension through two distinct quasi-normal ringing era [83].</p>
<p>A. Null geodesics</p>
<p>This article's major objective is to examine the deflection angle and gravitational lensing by such 5D-WGEB wormhole's and to compare it with its 4D counterparts.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this, we must solve geodesic equations for null trajectories that correspond to 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB wormhole passages.The following are the geodesic equations for the 4D-GEB are:
d 2 t dλ 2 = 0, (2.8) d 2 l dλ 2 − l −1+m b m 0 + l m −1+ 2 m dθ dλ 2 + sin 2 θ dϕ dλ 2 = 0,(2.9
)
d 2 θ dλ 2 + 2l −1+m b m 0 + l m dl dλ dθ dλ − sin θ cos θ dϕ dλ 2 = 0,(2.10
)
d 2 ϕ dλ 2 + 2 cot θ dθ dλ dϕ dλ + 2l −1+m b m 0 + l m dl dλ dϕ dλ = 0. (2.11)
Geodesic equations for the 5D-WGEB model are as follows:
d 2 t dλ 2 + 2 f ′ (y)
dt dλ dy dλ = 0, (2.12)
d 2 l dλ 2 + 2 f ′ (y) dl dλ dy dλ − l −1+m b m 0 + l m −1+ 2 m dθ dλ 2 + sin 2 θ dϕ dλ 2 = 0, (2.13)d 2 θ dλ 2 + 2 f ′ (y) dθ dλ dy dλ + 2l −1+m (b m 0 + l m ) dθ dλ dl dλ − sin θ cos θ dϕ dλ 2 = 0, (2.14)d 2 ϕ dλ 2 + 2 f ′ (y) dϕ dλ dy dλ + 2 cot θ dθ dλ dϕ dλ + 2l −1+m b m 0 + l m dl dλ dϕ dλ = 0 (2.15)d 2 y dλ 2 + f ′ (y) e 2f (y) dt dλ 2 − dl dλ 2 − (b m 0 + l m ) 2/m dθ dλ 2 + sin 2 θ dϕ dλ 2 = 0.
(2.16)</p>
<p>In the above equations λ is the affine parameter, and each equation corresponds to motion along the appropriate coordinates (t, l, θ, ϕ, y).The differences in geodesic equations of two models (4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB) are the y, ẏ dependent terms in the right hand side of the Eqs.(2.12) to (2.15) as well as an additional geodesic equation for motion along the extra dimension y.A full investigation of the time-like geodesics for the same has previously been done [78], which reveals the confinement of test particles along the extra dimension in the case of growing warp factor, and runaway trajectories in presence of decaying warp factor.Here, we are interested in the deflection angle and gravitational lensing of the null trajectories.</p>
<p>III. NULL-TRAJECTORIES</p>
<p>It is difficult to deal with the highly coupled second order geodesic equations analytically.Therefore, we use the constants of the motion that can be derived from the metric itself using corresponding Euler-Lagrange's equations and the geodesic constraint for the null geodesic, given by,
g µν u µ u ν = 0,(3.1)
where, u µ is the four velocity null-vector.In the following, we discuss the null trajectories for both 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB scenarios.Two scenarios might be considered interesting.One is of course bending of light, relative to a distant observer, coming from the other side of the wormhole from our line of sight.Another is the hypothetical scenario of a spaceship getting close to a wormhole to examine it by sending light rays at it and receiving them back.In the following, we speculate that sending light rays with particular kinetic properties can result in return of it to the spaceship where, through interference, one might estimate the wormhole parameters.</p>
<p>A. 4D-GEB Space-time</p>
<p>The null geodesic constraint for 4D-GEB space-time is,
− ṫ2 + l2 + r 2 θ2 + sin 2 θ φ2 = 0. (3.2)
Where, an over-dot denotes derivative with respect to the affine parameter λ.From here on, we shall express r(l) as simply r.
l2 = k 2 − h 2 r 2 . (3.4)
The equation of the photon trajectories (in the l − ϕ plane) can be written in terms of the so-called impact parameter, r 0 = h/k, (which is defined as the perpendicular distance from the center of the wormhole lens to the projectile path) as follows,
dl dϕ 2 = r 2 r 2 r 2 0 − 1 . (3.5)
Since, the wormhole have a positive throat radius (at r = b 0 or l = 0), the photon coming form large (positive) l, will not reach the throat radius if their exists a point l 0 &gt; 0 at which l2 = 0. Then l 0 would be the point of closest approach or the turning point given by,
l 4D 0 = h k m − b m 0 1/m . (3.6)
Further, using Eqs.(3.5), we arrive at,
dϕ dl = ± 1 r 2 r 2 r 2 0 − 1 , (3.7)
which is the key equation to compute deflection angle.Note that, for a point of return to exist, the impact parameter must be greater than b 0 (otherwise we have passing or trapped trajectories [78]).Thus, choosing h/k is same as choosing the point of return (for a geometry with given b 0 and m).This also tells us that the radial geodesics with angular momentum h &lt; b 0 k will always pass through the neck.We shall return to this equation with it's solution in Sec.IV.</p>
<p>B. 5D-WGEB Space-time</p>
<p>The null trajectories in the 5D-WGEB space-time satisfies, e 2f (y) − ṫ2 + l2 + r 2 θ2 + sin 2 θ φ2 + ẏ2 = 0.</p>
<p>(3.8)</p>
<p>The constants of motion for 5D-WGEB wormhole at θ = π/2 are, e 2f (y) ṫ = E and e 2f (y) r 2 φ = H (3.9)</p>
<p>Note that the so-called areal velocity (r 2 dϕ/dt) is a conserved quantity in 5D scenario as well.By using the similar approach as in the case of 4D model, we obtain the following equation corresponding to null geodesics (2.12) to (2.16),
l2 = 1 e 2f (y) E 2 e 2f (y) − H 2 e 2f (y) r 2 − ẏ2 . (3.10)
This equation can be further simplified.Using Eqs.(3.8) in Eq. (2.16) we get,
d 2 y dλ 2 + f ′ (y) dy dλ 2 = 0,(3.11)
which after integration results in ẏ = Ce −f (y) , (3.12) where C is an integration constant with bound |C/E| &lt; 1.One may solve Eq. 3.12, for the growing and decaying warp factors, f (y) = ± log cosh( y y 0 ) .This leads to
y + = y 0 sinh −1 C y 0 λ + C 1 and y − = y 0 sin −1 tan C y 0 λ + C 1 . (3.13)
These analytic results however are not of our current interest.Moving ahead, Eq.</p>
<p>thus simplifies to
l2 = 1 e 4f (y) E 2 − H 2 r 2 − C 2 . (3.14)
Therefore, in the 5D case, the point of return or the impact parameter is given by Then l 0,5 can be written as
r 0,5 = H √ E 2 − C 2 or l 0,5 =   H 2 E 2 − C 2 m/2 − b m 0   1/m . (3l 0,5 = r m 0,5 − b m 0 1/m where r 0,5 = h k √ 1 − δ 2 . (3.17)
Here, we define δ = C/E = C/k to be the parameter that quantifies deviation from l 0,4 .For δ &lt;&lt; 1, we can further approximate the above equations as,
l 0,5 ∼ h k m 1 + m 2 δ 2 − b m 0 1/m where r 0,5 ∼ h k 1 + δ 2 2 . (3.18)
Thus, in principle, if one can measure the impact parameter, for known h/k, one can constrain δ or C which is carrying the signature of the extra dimension and enters our analysis as a parameter.This is possible if we can send a light beam that comes around the wormhole and made to interfere with itself.The resulting interference pattern depends on the path traveled which itself depends on r 0 .However, details of such interference will not be analysed here.The null trajectories, in 5D are given by,
dϕ dl = ± 1 r 2 r 2 r 2 0,5 − 1 . (3.19)
which looks functionally similar to the 4D case.Though, r 0,5 is carrying the extra dimensional factor and is different from r 0,4 , Eq. (3.7) and Eq.(3.19) looks degenerate.</p>
<p>From here onwards we drop the label-'5' in the subscripts of various parameters, as we assume the 5D scenario, and looking to determine δ and/or m as such.</p>
<p>The 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB wormhole geometries can have three types of time-like trajectories-Trapped, Returning and Crossing trajectories [78].Similar conditions are also applicable for light-like particles (with ϵ = 0).Depending on whether l 0 (the point of return) is zero, positive or imaginary, one can characterise these three types of trajectories: (a) trapped at the throat, (b) ones that return before reaching the throat and (c) the ones that cross the throat and reaches the other side.Thus, we get the following classifications for null geodesics for 4D-GEB model:
h = b 0 k =⇒ trapped; h &gt; b 0 k =⇒ returning; and h &lt; b 0 k =⇒ crossing. Similarly, in the 5D- WGEB wormhole scenario, we have, h = b 0 √ k 2 − C 2 =⇒ trapped, h &gt; b 0 √ k 2 − C 2 =⇒ returning, h &lt; b 0 √ k 2 − C 2 =⇒
crossing trajectories.This bounds are simplified versions of the ones presented in [78].</p>
<p>C. The photon sphere</p>
<p>The trapped trajectories essentially lead to the presence of a photon sphere at the throat radius.Photon sphere is a region where a photon can travel in a circular orbit i.e. it is the region where both l and l are zero.Using Eq. (3.4) and geodesic equation for l [78], we get the following conditions for 4D-GEB space-time:
l = h k m − b m 0 1/m = 0. (3.20)
These conditions are satisfied for particular choices of h = h and k = k say, such that, h = kb 0 .</p>
<p>(3.21)</p>
<p>Similarly, for 5D-WGEB wormhole, the condition for photon sphere, which also appears at l = 0, is given by r0
,5 = h k = b 0 √ 1 − δ 2 . (3.22)
The existence of trapped null geodesics at the throat radius form the photon sphere in both 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB wormhole geometries.Suppose the observation of photon sphere gives us b 0 .If there exists another phenomenon that connects h/k, b 0 and δ, in principle one can constrain C by eliminating b 0 .Remarkably, such a relation is provided by the deflection angle of null trajectories.The presence of photon sphere in a given wormhole passage, would give rise to relativistic images near throat radius [84].A full analysis of the photon sphere require a separate detailed investigation.This article primarily focuses on deflection of returning null trajectories and gravitational lensing.In the next section, we discuss these features for returning null trajectories and the resulting deflection angles.</p>
<p>IV. DEFLECTION-ANGLE</p>
<p>If we assume that, on the equatorial plane (θ = π/2), incident direction of photon is ϕ ∞ (at l = ∞) and the direction of photon at closest approach (at l 0 ) is ϕ 0 , then total change in ϕ can be given by,
∆ϕ = 2 ϕ 0 − ϕ ∞ . (4.1)
The pre-factor 2 appears simply because we are first considering the change in ϕ for decreasing l ∈ (∞, l 0 ) and then for increasing l ∈ (l 0 , ∞), second one is just time reversal of the first one.If the trajectory of the photon were a straight line, then deflection of the photon orbit from the straight line is (for a complete derivation of the deflection angle, see [85]),
α(l 0 ) = 2|ϕ 0 − ϕ ∞ | − π. (4I = ∞ x 0 dx (1 + x m ) 2/m (1+x m ) 2/m (1+x m 0 ) 2/m − 1 . (4.4)
For m = 2 geometry (4D-EB), Eq. (4.3) or (4.4) can be integrated analytically in terms of complete elliptic integral of the first kind as [86],
EB α(l 0 ) = −π + 2 1 + b 2 0 l 2 0 Elliptic K − b 2 0 l 2 0 . (4.5)
This deviation angle tends to infinity as l 0 → 0, which implies that the trajectories whirl around the neck many times before reaching l 0 and return to l → ∞ there after.</p>
<p>Note that for some l 0 , the right hand side of Eq. 4.5 may become multiple of 2π.</p>
<p>Thus providing means to measure the 'winding number' (perhaps) using interference phenomenon.However, we do not explore this possibility any further in this article.</p>
<p>For larger m-geometries, we may get some approximate ideas from Eq. (4.4).It is easy to see that the largest contribution in Eq. ( 4.3) comes from the region x → x 0+ .</p>
<p>If we take x 0 &gt; 1, then we can write upto a leading order approximation,
I ∼ ∞ x 0 dx x 0 x x 2 − x 2 0 1 − 1 mx m = π 2 − π 2 (m − 1)!! (m − 2)!! x −m 0 m 2 . (4.6)
This shows that the angle of deviation decreases with increasing x 0 (which is consistent with the analytic result of m = 2 case).Therefore, in the following, we choose x 0 &lt; 1 (trajectories flying close to the neck) in order to distinguish the effects of the wormhole parameters and the extra dimension.In this limit, the integral again is dominated by the values of the integrand near x ∼ x 0+ .The leading order term is given by,
I ∼ x 0 +ϵ x 0 dx m(x m − x m 0 ) , (4.7)
where ϵ ∼ x 0 .This shows that with increasing m and same x 0 , the deviation angle increases (because of the power law term in the denominator) which supports the numerical results presented in Fig. 1 below.This behavior can be physically understood as follows.As the neck steepens photons with fixed h/k gets closer to the neck and makes more rounds before reaching the point of closest approach thus increasing the total deviation angle.</p>
<p>B. 5D-WGEB scenario</p>
<p>Similarly, one can write the expression of deflection angle for our 5D-WGEB space-time using Eqs.(3.19) and (4.2),
5 α (l 0,5 ) = −π + 2 ∞ l 0,5dl(b m 0 + l m ) 2/m (b m 0 +l m ) 2/m (b m 0 +l m 0,5 ) 2/m − 1 − 1 e 2f (y) dy dϕ 2 , = −π + 2 ∞ l 0,5dl(b m 0 + l m ) 2/m (b m 0 +l m ) 2/m (b m 0 +l m 0,5 ) 2/m − 1 , (4.8)
The effect of the warped extra dimension is negligible in the limit δ = C/E → 0, which is consistent with Eq. (3.15).One could clearly see that there is degeneracy between Eq. (4.3) and Eq.(4.8).Thus overall dependence of α on l 0 , b 0 or m are same in both 4D and 5D scenarios.For instance, solution for m = 2 case will still be given by Eq. (4.5).However, Eq. (3.17) or Eq.(3.18) suggests that for known values of the impact parameter and the steepness constant, one can constrain δ as mentioned earlier.For a given m, 5 α (l 0 ) is essentially a function of h/k, b 0 and and δ (as l 0 is given by Eq. 3.17)).Lets us assume that b 0 is known from observing the photon sphere.Then one can determine δ from the deflection angle using null rays of known h/k, i.e. by fitting the α vs h/k plots.In spite of the degeneracy in  For simplicity, we shall only look at rays that are deflected by an angle less than 2π as these are the rays that form the so-called primary image.In the weak field limit (as l 0 → ∞), impact parameter, µ (or b) approximately will be equal to closest approach l 0 (see Eqs. (3.6) and (3.15)), for both the 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB wormhole spacetime.Therefore, lensing equation becomes
β = l 0 D L − D LS D S α| l 0 →∞ , for (l 0 &gt; 0) . (5.6)
Similarly, the images will be formed on the other side of wormhole (for l 0 &lt; 0) as well.In this situation, the direction of deflection angle in the above equation is wrong, and we need to change the sign of the deflection angle as
β = l 0 D L + D LS D S α| l 0 →∞ , for (l 0 &lt; 0) . (5.7)
However, in the Schwarzschild lensing [87], deflection angle is an odd function of l 0 and, therefore, one of the above two equations is sufficient to explain the both situations (l 0 &gt; 0 and l 0 &lt; 0).</p>
<p>When the light source, lens and observer will be aligned along the line of sight, then the image of the source will be circular (Einstein ring) and the radius of this image is known as Einstein radius (R E ).Hence, the Einstein radius in terms of deflection angle is defined, as given below, from the Eq.(5.6) with β = 0, (5.9)Thus, the Einstein radius for 4D-EB spacetime (from Eqs.(5.8)) and (5.9)) can be written as,
R E = D L D LS D S α| l 0 →∞ . (5EB R E = π 4 D L D LS D S b 2 0 1/3 . (5.10)
In case of m = 2, 5D-WEB spacetime,
W EB R E = π 4 D L D LS D S b 2 0 (1 − δ 2 ) 1/3 = EB R E (1 − δ 2 ) 1/3 , (5.11)
where δ = C/E is the deviation parameter for 5-D wormholes.</p>
<p>One can calculate the image position for 4D-EB/5D-GEB spacetime by using the following formula,
β = θ − θ 3 E θ 2 , for (θ &gt; 0)(5.12)
and, where,
β = θ + θ 3 E θ 2 , for (θ &lt; 0) (5U 1± =     β3 27 + 1 2 ± 1 4   1 + 2 β3 27   2 − β6 27 2     1/3 .
(5.17)</p>
<p>The real positive solutions implies the physical images of the source.Similarly, the discriminant of Eq. (5.15) is 4 β3 − 27, and so, if β &lt; (27/4) 1/3 then the corresponding equation has one real solution:
θ = β 3 + U 2+ + U 2− (5.18)
where,
U 2± =     β3 27 − 1 2 ± 1 4   1 − 2 β3 27   2 − β6 27 2     1/3 . (5.19)
The image will form inside the Einstein ring corresponding to solution given by Eq.</p>
<p>(5.18).Thus the differences in image position for 4D and 5D models are quantified by the Einstein radius R E which depends upon the deviation parameter δ.</p>
<p>VI. DISCUSSION</p>
<p>In this work we discussed deflection of light rays and gravitational lensing of the four dimensional generalised Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes and the five dimensional warped spacetime that embeds a 4D-GEB wormhole.Our goal is to find various distinguishing features of the two models that can help one to identify signature of a 4D or 5D wormhole.4D-GEB models were introduced as an improvement on the classic EB spacetimes regarding violation of energy conditions.It was shown recently that the warped nature provides even further improvement over 4D-EB spacetimes.</p>
<p>Thus our primary goal was to compare 5D-WEB with 4D-EB.However, for the sake of completeness we have analysed 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB scenarios in general.Below we summarise our results in a systematic way.</p>
<p>• Null geodesics with angular momentum larger than certain values (determined by wormhole parameters and impact parameter) will return before reaching the neck and will acquire a net deflection angle.</p>
<p>• This trajectories will whirl around before reaching the point of return and whirl back thereafter.Number of windings increases with increasing angular momentum.</p>
<p>• Some of the trajectories may come back to the point of it's origin thus can be made to interfere with itself revealing information about wormhole parameters.</p>
<p>Implications of such interference phenomenon will be explored elsewhere.</p>
<p>• We found analytic expression for deflection angle for m = 2 case that corresponds to 4D-EB and 5D-WEB scenario.Deflection angles for generalised models (m &gt; 2) are found numerically.</p>
<p>• Graphical demonstrations reveal the distinguishing features of wormhole parameters and extra dimension.Naturally, for a given steepness constant m, it is the ratio l 0 /b 0 , that quantifies relative strength of two length scales one coming from the kinetic properties of the photon and other from the wormhole, decides the nature of the deflection angle.From Fig. 1 we note that the deflection angle reduces for 5D-WGEB models in comparison to the 4D-GEB models for lower values of l 0 /b 0 .</p>
<p>• Since the gravitational lensing formula is directly connected to the deflection angle, the 4D-GEB and 5D-WGEB wormholes can be further distinguished through the study of gravitational lensing.In particular, the radius of the Einstein ring and the angular positions of images are affected by the steepness constant m as well as the constant δ arising from the extra dimension.We restrict ourselves only in the study of weak gravitational lensing and the primary image positions.For m = 2 we obtain analytical formula for the Einstein radius for 4D-EB and 5D-WEB nodels and we note that for 5D case, the Einstein radius reduces.The study of strong gravitational lensing could be more effective to distinguish the effect of extra dimension.We leave it for future work.</p>

A. 4D-GEB scenarioUsing Eqs.(3.7) and (4.2), we obtain the expression of deflection angle for 4D-GEB space-time as,4 α (l 0,4 ) = −π + l m ) 2/m (b m 0 +l m )Few general conclusions can be drawn on physical grounds about what to expect from Eq. (4.3).There are two length scales involvedb 0 and l 0 .There interplay further depends on the (dimensionless) steepness parameter m.The deviation angle is expected to be larger if l 0 ∼ b 0 .In increasing m-geometries, as the neck flattens out, l 0 &gt; b 0 trajectories will have smaller deviations.Note that, from measurement of deviation angle alone, a far away observer can not determine both b 0 and l 0 .Below we write the integral in Eq. (4.3) in a more convenient form with x = l/b 0 and x 0 = l 0 /b 0 as, 4D α (l 0 ) = −π + 2I, where</p>

is a schematic diagram representing the relation among source of light (star), lens (wormhole or black hole) and observer, where D L , D S and D LS are distances between 'observer-lens', 'observer-source', and 'lens-source', respectively.Here, θ and β are angles between 'lens-image' and 'lens-source'.Angle of deflection is represented by α, and µ (or b) is the impact parameter.Now, using basic geometrical law, one can write the following equations,Here, ψ is an angle between source and image, and SI is the arc-length between the same.Now, from Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3), we can write the following relation, can obtain the general formula for lensing equation, using Eqs.(5.1) and (5.4), which is given as,</p>

For a given b 0 and lower value of l 0,4 (or h/k), we see from the equation (3.18) that l 0,5 increases and, consequently, the deflection angle α decreases for 5D-WGEB case which is also clear from the Fig.1.Thus the Einstein radius, R E of the 5D-WGEB wormhole will be smaller than the 4D-GEB model (but asymptotically approaches each other for l 0 → ∞).It is difficult to get an exact analytic expression of Einstein radius for both the geometries, except for m = 2 spacetimes.For larger values of l 0 we can write approximate expressions of the deflection angle for m = 2 case from the Eq.(4.5) as EB α(l 0</p>

where θ = µ/D L ≈ l 0 /D L and θ E = R E /D L is the angular radius of Einstein ring.We can reduce the above equations into simple cubic equations, given below, via defining new parameters as follows, β = β/θ E and θ = θ/θ E .θ3 − θ2 β − 1 = 0, for θ &gt; 0 (5.14) and, θ3 − θ2 β + 1 = 0, for θ &lt; 0 (5.15)Since, the discriminant of Eqs.(5.14) is −4 β3 − 27 &lt; 0, therefore, Eqs.(5.14)would have two complex conjugate solutions and one real solution ( using Cardano's</p>
