                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Highly autonomous generative agents powered by large language models promise to simulate intricate social behaviors in virtual societies. However, achieving real-time interactions with humans at a low computational cost remains challenging. Here, we introduce Lyfe Agents. They combine low-cost with real-time responsiveness, all while remaining intelligent and goal-oriented. Key innovations include: (1) an option-action framework, reducing the cost of high-level decisions; (2) asynchronous self-monitoring for better self-consistency; and (3) a Summarize-and-Forget memory mechanism, prioritizing critical memory items at a low cost. We evaluate Lyfe Agents' self-motivation and sociability across several multi-agent scenarios in our custom LyfeGame 3D virtual environment platform. When equipped with our brain-inspired techniques, Lyfe Agents can exhibit human-like self-motivated social reasoning. For example, the agents can solve a crime (a murder mystery) through autonomous collaboration and information exchange. Meanwhile, our techniques enabled Lyfe Agents to operate at a computational cost 10-100 times lower than existing alternatives. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of autonomous generative agents to enrich human social experiences in virtual worlds.</p>

LyfeAL, * † Equal Contributions Highly autonomous generative agents powered by large language models promise to simulate intricate social behaviors in virtual societies.However, achieving real-time interactions with humans at a low computational cost remains challenging.Here, we introduce Lyfe Agents.They combine low-cost with real-time responsiveness, all while remaining intelligent and goal-oriented.Key innovations include: (1) an option-action framework, reducing the cost of high-level decisions; (2) asynchronous self-monitoring for better self-consistency; and (3) a Summarize-and-Forget memory mechanism, prioritizing critical memory items at a low cost.We evaluate Lyfe Agents' self-motivation and sociability across several multi-agent scenarios in our custom LyfeGame 3D virtual environment platform.When equipped with our brain-inspired techniques, Lyfe Agents can exhibit human-like self-motivated social reasoning.For example, the agents can solve a crime (a murder mystery) through autonomous collaboration and information exchange.Meanwhile, our techniques enabled Lyfe Agents to operate at a computational cost 10-100 times lower than existing alternatives.Our findings underscore the transformative potential of autonomous generative agents to enrich human social experiences in virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Figure 1: Generative agents are interacting in real-time with other agents and humans in a LyfeGame 3D virtual environment.In this scenario, the agents spontaneously collaborate to solve a crime.</p>
<p>Generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs), demonstrate impressive potential to mimic human behavior (Bubeck et al., 2023).However, a salient difference remains: while all animals, including humans, are autonomous, characterized by self-driven, adaptive, continuous interactions with the environments, standalone LLMs fall short of these capabilities.An emerging strategy to bridge the autonomy gap is to recursively call LLMs in response to new environmental inputs.A notable example is the generative agent framework proposed by Park et al. (2023).It leverages LLM capabilities in combination with a continuously-updating memory stream that stores agents' experiences.Items in the memory stream are retrieved to guide the LLM in continually generating actions, plans, and reflections.This approach has led to a remarkable level of agent autonomy and coherence.</p>
<p>However, autonomy can come at a high cost.In this and other works Gravitas (2023); Qian et al. (2023), decision making processes -from setting destinations to rating memory importance -often rely heavily on expensive LLMs.In comparison, reinforcement learning agents and non-human animals can exhibit autonomy and long-term goal-oriented behavior with a substantially lower computational footprint and little or no use of language.</p>
<p>Our goal for this work is to create cost-effective autonomous intelligent agents, and we do so by adopting design principles of the animal brain and other non-LLM agents.With this approach, we developed agents that cost about 30-100 times less than that of Park et al. (2023).Our main guiding principle is to be resource-rational (Lieder &amp; Griffiths, 2019).Specifically, we opt for fast, computationally-light processes over slow, computationally-intensive ones, unless performance quality demands otherwise.Therefore, we limit LLM queries to only the necessary cases, e.g. for sophisticated reasoning and conversation.Furthermore, reducing our reliance on LLMs also cuts the response latency within the multi-agent environment, enabling seamless real-time user interactions.</p>
<p>We developed a range of techniques for Lyfe Agents to balance cost with intelligence and autonomy.In this work, we focus on three of them, inspired by the neuroscience, cognitive science, and reinforcement learning literature.First, we use a hierarchical action selection mechanism to guide agents' high-level decisions with minimal reliance on the LLM.Second, we introduce a Selfmonitoring process that facilitates self-consistency by maintaining a summary of relevant recent events in parallel with the goal-driven, executive decision-making.Finally, we devise a hierarchical memory architecture and introduce a Summarize-and-Forget (SaF) method that improves the quality of memory storage and retrieval.</p>
<p>Complementing the cognitively inspired agent architecture, we develop a virtual multi-agent environment platform called LyfeGame to facilitate social behavior and support user interactions.Within this environment, we curate a set of scenarios of varying complexity, and test the ability of Lyfe Agents to diffuse, gather, and reason about information through social interactions.The scenarios include 1) solving a murder mystery, 2) deciding which school club to join for extracurricular activities, 3) securing a medicine for a sick member.Each of these scenarios highlights a unique facet of social coordination.We perform preliminary evaluations of Lyfe Agents using these scenarios, and demonstrate their potential to directly enrich human social life through dialogues and actions grounded in background stories and virtual interactions.</p>
<p>Modular Agent Architecture</p>
<p>In this section, we present a high-level overview of the modular architecture underlying Lyfe Agents' brains (Fig. 2a).Then we highlight three brain-inspired architectural components of Lyfe Agents.These components are designed with the common principle of judicious use of LLMs at run-time in order to support real-time interactions with agents and humans, intelligently and autonomously.</p>
<p>In general, natural-language inputs are processed by a sensory module, the output of which is added to the agent's internal states.The internal states are a collection of agent-specific states that are continuously updated both by external inputs and through internal recurrent processing.The recurrent nature of the internal state updates underlies the agents' autonomy.In addition to the dynamic internal states, the agents have a Memory system that stores their experiences.Finally, the internal states provide contexts and inputs for action selection, typically by populating LLM prompts.</p>
<p>Sensory processing Since the input to our agents are text-based (see Section 3), we use a fast and low-cost sensory processing module that identifies novel inputs and feeds those to the internal states.The cognitive controller selects high-level actions (options) based on the agent's goal.Once an option is chosen, the action module (bottom row) continues selecting actions until a termination condition is met.(c) The self-monitoring system, which maintains a narrative summary of recent events, emphasizes those that are novel and relevant to the agent's goal.This summary aids in contextual awareness and goal perseverance.(d) Memories from temporary storage (recent memory) are clustered and summarized using an LLM before being moved to long-term storage.This process facilitates efficient retrieval and ensures diversity of content.To avoid redundancy, highly similar memories are removed.</p>
<p>Internal states</p>
<p>The internal states are a collection of text-based states, including the current goal, related memory retrieved from a Memory module, summary of recent events, working memory of sensory inputs, etc (Fig. 2a).Specifically, an agent's goal is an open-ended natural language statement that describes the state of mind or motivation of the agent.For example, an agent's goal might be "As a doctor, I want to help diagnose and treat those around me". Retrieved memory is a small group of text-based memories returned by querying the Memory system.The act of querying the Memory system is an internal action that is itself conditioned on internal states.Self-monitor summary is a high-level abstraction of ongoing events (more below).</p>
<p>Memory system The memory system is composed of a hierarchy of vector databases.Each stores agent's experiences in pairings of natural language texts and their vector embeddings.Given a natural language query, we retrieve a small number of memory items based on embedding similarities.</p>
<p>Action selection</p>
<p>The action outputs of an agent can be external, interfacing with the environment such as talking, or internal such as reflection.At a given step, the agent decides on an action within an action category, or option (more below).</p>
<p>Option-Action Selection</p>
<p>Lyfe Agents choose actions in a hierarchical fashion, similar to other LLM-powered agent frameworks (Park et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023a;Gravitas, 2023).A simple implementation is for the agent to first choose a high-level action (or an "option") such as use search engine, followed by a lower action at each step such as search a specific item.While this method can be appropriate for many applications, it brings challenges to our goal of building real-time, low-cost social agents.For example, to have a conversation, our agents would have to first choose the option talk, then choose what to say.This could require two separate LLM calls, resulting in higher costs and latency, or one combined call that compromises output quality.To tackle this challenge, we take ideas from hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) in machine learning (Bacon et al., 2017;Sutton et al., 1999) and the brain (Graybiel, 1998).In HRL, a "manager" chooses an option or high-level action that lasts for an extended amount of time while subsequent low-level actions are selected by a "worker".This design can allow the manager to focus on long-horizon decision making, see Pateria et al. (2021) for a review.</p>
<p>In Lyfe Agents, a cognitive controller module (like HRL's manager) selects options, inspired by the brain's prefrontal cortex (Miller &amp; Cohen, 2001).More specifically, the cognitive controller takes in the agent's goal along with other relevant internal states.Using an LLM call, it then outputs an option along with a subgoal (Fig. 2b).Since the agent's goal may be too abstract or long-term to justify the choice of an option, the subgoal serves to orient the agent's actions at an intermediate level between low-level actions and the high-level goal.</p>
<p>Once an option is selected, actions are chosen within that option over subsequent steps until a termination condition is met.For example, a selected option may be to talk, then at each step, the specific action of what to actually say is determined by an LLM call.Important for cost-reduction, the termination condition for an option is checked by fast, non-LLM methods, such as time-based triggers or, for agents in conversations, repetition detection which exits conversations that start to lack semantic novelty after some point.</p>
<p>This framework can have the additional benefit of making agents more strongly goal-oriented.Committing to an option gives agents more time to execute the underlying intention of that option choice.In contrast, agents tend to be more fickle when choosing both options and actions at every time step.For instance, we found that agents using the above basic architecture exited conversations three times faster than Lyfe Agents equipped with option-action selection.</p>
<p>Self-Monitoring for Goal Adherence</p>
<p>To improve contextual awareness and goal perseverance of our agents, we introduce a selfmonitoring module, inspired by suggestions that self-monitoring is a key component for conscious experience in humans (Dehaene et al., 2021).This module maintains a narrative-style summary of recent events with an emphasis on novel and goal-related content, see Appendix A.2 for examples.Using an LLM call, the self-monitoring module takes in the old summary, internal states containing recent events, and the agent's motivation to generate an updated summary (Fig. 2c).The new summary highlights information that is novel or relevant to the agent's goals.</p>
<p>The self-monitoring module provides agents with better context-awareness by distilling goalrelevant content from a stream of disparate and unorganized information.This coherent and focused narrative is then used in downstream processes like action selection.In contrast, passing an unfocused collection of disparate information directly for downstream LLM calls severely impacts performance (see Section 4.1.2).</p>
<p>Another advantage of maintaining a self-monitoring summary is to preserve information longer term if it is highly relevant to an agent's goal.Without this summary, we observed that agents frequently forgot their ongoing tasks or actions.The self-monitoring summary helps agents have actions that are more coherent and adhering to their goals.Furthermore, the self-monitoring module operates asynchronously with the action selection module.This design choice means that the self-monitoring module can operate independently and not be limited by the real-time constraints of action selection, allowing for the summary to be updated at a slower, more deliberate time-scale.This both lowers computational cost and provides an opportunity for more thoughtful summary refinement.</p>
<p>Summarize-and-Forget memory</p>
<p>The core function of memory is not just about storage and retrieval; it is about discerning the relevance of information for future use.While many contemporary memory systems, such as Vector databases (Pinecone, 2021;Research, 2017) support highly efficient information retrieval, we still face the challenge of intelligently determining which information to retain and which to discard.Here we describe three elements of our hierarchical Summarize-and-Forget memory architecture that tackles this challenge.</p>
<p>Standard memory systems typically struggle with the unfiltered accumulation of recent information, resulting in clutter and inefficiency.Addressing this, we introduce a dual-memory architecture: recentmem for immediate summaries and longmem for enduring storage, modeled after the complementary roles of the hippocampus and neocortex in the brain's memory systems (McClelland et al., 1995).In particular, recentmem is dedicated to capturing immediate self-monitoring summaries.Upon reaching a specified capacity, these memories are transitioned to longmem.Having a dual memory system allows for intelligent transition methods to ensure that only the most salient memories find their way into long-term storage (Fig. 2d).</p>
<p>Our approach to transitioning memories uses a cluster-then-summarize technique.Memories are clustered based on similarity before being refined into high-level summaries using an LLM (Appendix A.3).This ensures that the stored content is not just raw data but possesses semantic richness, enhancing the quality of memories for downstream processes.</p>
<p>Addressing the challenge of memory redundancy, our architecture integrates a new forgetting algorithm inspired by the brain (Brown &amp; Lewandowsky, 2010;Georgiou et al., 2021).Rather than merely trimming data, this algorithm assesses and removes older memories that closely resemble new ones (determined by embedding similarities).This mechanism ensures that memories securing their place in recentmem or longmem are not just redundant repetitions, but unique and relevant, granting agents access to a multifaceted information spectrum.</p>
<p>At its core, our Summarize-and-Forget Memory system does more than just store information-it attempts to understand it.</p>
<p>A Multi-Agent Environment For Emergent Social Interactions</p>
<p>Virtual environment To provide a world for the Lyfe Agents, we developed a custom virtual environment platform (LyfeGame) using the powerful Unity game engine (Appendix B).Our platform can support a large number of distinct environments.For this work, we focus on a specific 3D environment we named SakuraMachi (Japanese for Town of Cherry Blossom) (Fig. 1).This environment contains key landmarks such as hotel, library, convenience store, flower shop, etc. that agents may navigate towards.The agents are integrated into the environment with virtual bodies controlled by their artificial brains.</p>
<p>Observations and actions Agents receive a range of observations (see Appendix B) as they live in the environment.Most relevant is the conversation they receive from other agents and human players.To facilitate "in-person" interactions, an agent can only receive conversations from others in their vicinity.In accordance, agents can choose to talk and what they say will be received by agents and players around them.Other than talk, another external action our agents may choose is to move, which will advance the agents to their selected destination within the environment.Our vicinity-based dialogue setup leads to group conversation dynamics that differs from existing generative agents work which only support one-on-one dialogues (Park et al., 2023;Qian et al., 2023).Group conversations can greatly facilitate information transmission, but also brings fresh challenge for the agents such as when and how to leave a group conversation (a familiar problem for humans as well).</p>
<p>Agent individuality To foster rich, meaningful interactions among agents, each agent is assigned a unique background story, among a set of identifiable traits (see Appendix G).Specifying agent personas this way not only guides the agent's behavior but also serves as a reference to maintain consistency with its established character.Agents' background stories are authored as items in their long-term memory, which itself expands progressively through interactions within the environment.Since long-term memory items are continuously queried and retrieved, each agent's unique background story and experience shape their individualized experience in the virtual world.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>To evaluate the autonomy and social reasoning capabilities of our agents, we designed a series of experimental scenarios that focus on different aspects of social behavior: a murder mystery, a high school activity fair, and a patient-in-help scenario (Appendix D.4).Throughout these experiments, our agents consistently demonstrated the ability to acquire, transmit, and reason with information in a goal-oriented manner.Notably, they also exhibited human-like emotions, reactions, and decisionmaking patterns reminiscent of real-life social interactions.Ablation studies further highlighted the crucial role of our architectural designs in shaping Lyfe Agents' social behaviors.The ablations  also revealed that memory-augmented LLM agents alone often fall short in sustaining goal-oriented social behavior.</p>

<p>We first study a murder mystery scenario (Fig. 3a).In this setting, the agent Ahmed has been murdered the previous night by his business rival Francesco.Meanwhile, Dmitri witnessed Francesco fleeing the scene with a bloody knife.These and other events are directly implanted into agents' long-term memories, setting their background stories (Appendix G).Although Dmitri may pinpoint Francesco at the crime scene, this scenario is complicated by various interpersonal relationships and motives.Dmitri, for instance, was a romantic rival of Ahmed, casting doubt on the reliability of his testimony.Francesco, in a bid to evade blame, is self-motivated to deny any wrongdoing, and he indeed attempts to deflect suspicion.Further complicating matters, allies of Francesco, like Marta, may defend him when confronted by others.Given these intricacies, navigating through the diversions to identify the real evidence can be challenging, even for human players.</p>
<p>In this scenario, our agents showcased remarkable motivation and capabilities in efficiently disseminating and assimilating information (Fig. 3b).Within just 15 minutes of agent-agent interactions, the police officer agent was able to identify Francesco as the primary suspect over 60% of the time, even in the most challeging 9-agent setting.Our agents displayed the capability to resist and filter distracting information by reflection and reasoning processes.</p>
<p>We further examined the dynamics of information transmission across the entire agent group (Fig. 3c).Dmitri's key testimony against Francesco can be spread to other agents, who may integrate this information in their memories.When interviewed post-simulation, they might retrieve this information.Our analysis revealed that information has a reasonable chance of being spread (or lost) at every step along the way (Fig. 3d).These analyses can help pinpoint potential bottlenecks in information transmission among virtual agents.</p>
<p>INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND OPINION CHANGE</p>
<p>We observe that agent's ability to form and adjust self-consistent opinions, underscoring the similarity between agent and human reasoning.At the beginning, agents formulate initial hypotheses regarding the suspect based on reflections and reasoning anchored in distinct background narratives (Fig. 4).For instance, considering a memory event where the victim cheated on Aaliyah with Yi, other agents harbored significant suspicion towards Aaliyah due to a potential motive of animosity towards the victim.However, with the accumulation of more incriminating evidence, agents' suspicion shifted towards Francesco, especially in light of critical information from the crime scene and a bloody knife testimony provided by witness Dmitri.It is notable that for agents who acquired the evidence of the bloody knife, post-simulation interviews affirm a change in their stance, now identifying Francesco as the primary suspect.</p>

<p>ABLATION TEST</p>
<p>To study the contributions of the three core mechanisms introduced, we ran ablation tests on the murder mystery scenario.Overall, we found that ablating the option-action structure (i.e.choosing an option at every step) does not improve performance (Fig. 3b), despite significant increase in cost per action step.Whereas ablating either self-monitoring or Summarize-and-Forget (SaF) memory dramatically lowers the performance (more details below).Note that in all ablation experiments, the agents still include an intact LLM and a vector database.These results highlight that a simple memory-augmented LLM architecture is not sufficient for solving the murder mystery scenario.</p>
<p>Self-monitoring Summary Ablation The self-monitoring summary offers agents a structured and consecutive insight into both internal and external events, effectively capturing what an agent is actively focusing on.When we ablated the self-monitoring module, we found that agents are limited to short-term, fragmented memories stored in the recent memory bank, making agents lose track of the bigger picture.As a result, agents without self-monitoring consistently under-perform when compared to Lyfe Agents (Fig. 3b).This stark difference underscores the crucial importance of an agent's capacity for ongoing situational tracking and adaptation.Indeed, this continuous monitoring, as facilitated by the self-monitoring summarization mechanism, is instrumental in boosting an agent's awareness, agility, and competence in complex and demanding scenarios (see Appendices A.2 and E.2 for more details).</p>
<p>Memory Ablation</p>
<p>In our ablation study on memory architecture, we focus on the SaF method and the 3-tier hierarchical structure.We evaluate agents that use a plain memory system, consisting only of a single list of memory items, with no forgetting algorithm nor summarization for memory updating.Across conditions (3, 6, 9 agents), the full Lyfe Agents consistently surpass their simpler counterparts (Fig. 3b), emphasizing the advantages of our brain-inspired memory architecture.This advantage is largely attributed to efficient tossing of irrelevant data, ensuring optimized and focused memory storage (see further details in Appendices A.3 and E.3).</p>
<p>Scenario 2: Activity Fair</p>
<p>To assess how agents' preferences and social relationships shape their choices, we introduce the Activity Fair scenario (Fig. 5a).It emulates the common school challenge of deciding which social club to join, where students often need to strive for a delicate balance between friendship, romance, and personal interests.In this scenario, Lorenzo and Julian are motivated to form new clubs for anime and soccer, respectively, while the other six students are merely provided initial preferences.At the end of the simulation, agents are prompted to name their club preference with no restrictions (Appendix D.3).</p>
<p>We found that agents are preferentially influenced by others they consider close to them.For example, Yi doesn't know much about anime, but she is aware that her crush, Arjun, likes anime, and she ends up choosing the anime club with about 60% probability (Fig. 5b).Further highlighting how social relationships shape choices, we examine Fatima.She likes music and has no initial tendency to choose anime club (Fig. 7), yet, as Yi's best friend, she ends up choosing the anime club with a similarly high probability (56%).In contrast, Aaliyah started out with no clear preference for any club (Fig. 7), and ends up choosing the anime club much less frequently (22%).Beyond information diffusion, these results demonstrate how agents' behaviors are strongly influenced by their inter-agent relationships.</p>

<p>Cost analysis</p>
<p>Autonomous agents are inherently more expensive than their non-autonomous counterparts.Consider a typical chat-bot, it will not initiate a conversation with the human users, let alone converse with other bots.Autonomous chat-bots, however, might continuously engage in dialogues, leading to potentially unbounded costs.This challenge becomes even more daunting when we need the autonomous agents to provide low-latency responses for real-time human interactions.Low-latency implies that agents can have fast response to each other as well, potentially leading to rapid-paced back-and-forth conversations between agents that get expensive very quickly.Much of our work presented here is aimed to tackle these challenges.As a result, Lyfe Agents achieve a rather low cost of 0.5 US dollar per agent per human hour (Fig. 6) (See Appendix F for more discussions).</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>LLMs as Agents LLMs evidently capture a large variety of social behaviors in their training data (Kosinski, 2023;Park et al., 2022;Hagendorff, 2023).Beyond traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLMs showcase an impressive ability to comprehend human intent and execute instructions (Wang et al., 2023c;Chen &amp; Chang, 2023).Even OpenAI's GPT-4 alone shows potential in navigating complex domains that require deductive, multi-step reasoning (Liu et al., 2023b).However, standalone LLMs, importantly, function as conditional probability models, and are not sufficient to ensure consistent agentic behavior that incorporates a breadth of relevant context (Bisk et al., 2020;Phelps &amp; Russell, 2023;Shapira et al., 2023;Chen et al., 2023a).</p>
<p>Modular Agent Architecture To simulate a coherent autonomous agent navigating a complex environment, there is a need for modular approaches that combine diverse objectives captured by separate architectures (Andreas, 2022;Mahowald et al., 2023).Modular agent architecture composed of an LLM and a memory module has found success in various domains including 1) assistanttype task management and execution (Gravitas, 2023;Nakajima, 2023), 2) scientific reasoning (Lin et al., 2023) and software development (Qian et al., 2023), 3) continuous skill learning (Wang et al., 2023a;Zhao et al., 2023), and learning from experience (Shinn et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2023;Xie et al., 2023), 4) simulating human-like social interactions (Liu et al., 2023a;Park et al., 2023), and user behavior in recommendation systems (Wang et al., 2023b) as well as social networks (Gao et al., 2023), and 5) multi-agent collaboration (Zhang et al., 2023) and interaction with humans Zhou et al. (2023).More broadly, (Sumers et al., 2023) proposes a framework for systematizing the development of cognitively inspired LLM-powered agents with memory.Analogous to the above-referenced works, Lyfe Agents are defined by a modular architecture comprised of the LLM-powered actor, self-monitor, and memory.</p>
<p>Achieving Coherency With Memory Storage and Retrieval</p>
<p>In some cases, agents' cognitive architecture includes proxies of memories in the form of a comprehensive record of agents' past verbal interactions (Liu et al., 2023a;Qian et al., 2023).Increasingly, the cognitive architecture more closely simulates human-cognition, thereby including a frequently updated short-term memory in addition to a long-term memory used for retrieval (Park et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023b).One common way to alleviate the memory capacity limitations as noted in (Shinn et al., 2023) is to implement the long-term memory as a vector embedding database, which can be done with off-the-shelf instances (Research, 2017;Pinecone, 2021;Langchain, 2022;Technologies, 2019).Our approach includes cognitively inspired memory modules, including a text-based working memory, and shortterm and long-term memories in the form of custom vector embedding databases.A small selection of existing generative agent implementations incorporates selective memory storage via forgetting.(Gao et al., 2023) filters out memory items based on recency, and (Wang et al., 2023b) additionally incorporates a custom importance score.Our approach introduces a novel cluster-then-summarize and forgetting paradigm that discards redundant memories and diversifies stored memories.</p>
<p>LLM Calls and Operational Costs LLM queries are often essential for forming agent personas, memory consolidation, and action selection, which leads to substantial operational costs for generative agents.The cost of an LLM query scales linearly with the prompt size (Chen et al., 2023b), which can expand as agents accumulate more relevant information.Moreover, a large portion of cost is incurred as a result of the fact that many frameworks require inference at each time step within the environment: exploring in Minecraft required an iterative prompting mechanism, where the LLM is queried multiple times until a self-verification module confirms task completion (Wang et al., 2023a), and simulating 25 generative agents over a two-day period incurred thousands of dollars in token credits (Park et al., 2023).To mitigate these costs, SwiftSage employs a smaller, fine-tuned LLM for short-term action decoding, significantly reducing the tokens per action (tpa) to 757.07 (Lin et al., 2023).However, the use of GPT-4 in SwiftSage results in costs 15 times higher than those associated with GPT-3.5.In our approach, we only use GPT-3.5 and restrict LLM queries by adopting a hierarchical action selection framework, as detailed in Fig. 2b.</p>
<p>Conclusion and Discussion</p>
<p>We presented Lyfe Agents, a type of generative agents that are more cost-effective and support realtime human interactions in 3D virtual worlds.We developed several brain-inspired techniques that substantially reduced LLM usage while preserving high-level autonomy and social reasoning.</p>
<p>While promising, our agents have limitations.Their interactions still rely heavily on natural languages, despite the 3D virtual setting.While our environment offers the potential for pixel-space vision and simulated robotic bodies, our framework hasn't yet incorporated these aspects.Furthermore, the scarcity of interactable objects in our environment restricts agents' grounded actions.</p>
<p>While high-throughput evaluation of generative agents is currently challenged by the absence of large-scale standardized benchmarks, many studies, ours included, have utilized custom benchmarks.Recognizing the value of uniformity for comparability, we intend to explore the establishment of standardized benchmarks in subsequent works.</p>
<p>A Agent architecture</p>
<p>Lyfe Agents continually receive a rich stream of observations, encompassing aspects such as spatial and temporal awareness, as well as insights into the individual agent state.To enable long-term coherency and facilitate multi-step reasoning, Lyfe Agents leverage cognitive functions such as informed action selection, summarization, and memory modules.As agents navigate their environment, these architectural components become the foundation for creative and logically consistent interactions.Here, we explore each architectural component more deeply.</p>
<p>A.1 Option-Action Selection</p>
<p>A key improvement to the Lyfe Agent's architecture was to have targeted calls to the LLM so only a small number of tasks are being handled at a time.To this end, we established the cognitive controller logic as described in Section 2.1.Here, we proceed with a more concrete example of how an agent's action space is defined as they proceed through a simulation.</p>
<p>As an example, we take Fatima and Richard when they are currently engaged in conversation:</p>
<p>Fatima: "I appreciate Richard's determination to collaborate and uncover the truth.Together, we will find justice."Richard: "I appreciate your support, Fatima.Please let me know if you come across any new information or updates regarding Francesco's potential involvement."Fatima: "Thank you, Richard.I will definitely keep you informed of any progress made in investigating Francesco's potential involvement.Together, we will uncover the truth and find justice for Ahmed."Richard: "I will definitely let you know if there are any new developments.We need to stay vigilant and keep working together to uncover the truth about Francesco's involvement in Ahmed's murder."</p>
<p>As previously described, Fatima's action remains in the talk state unless a specific exit condition is met.This design obviates the need for making a new LLM call at each time step to decide the next action.Eventually, an exit condition is triggered-either by the duration Marta has spent in the talk state or by the similarity of her recent messages-which then transitions her into the reflect state:</p>
<p>Fatima: "Francesco's potential involvement in Ahmed's murder is a concerning possibility that needs further investigation."</p>
<p>At this point, Fatima utilizes the cognitive controller to determine her next action based on her recent experiences.In this case, the next action chosen is to find Marta.Luckily, Marta was in the same group, so the cognitive controller chooses to continue the conversation with Marta using talk, thus completing one example pass of the action selection.</p>
<p>In contrast, when we ablate this option-action selection, see Appendix E for details on the setup, we find that ablated agents are more fickle.For example, the average conversation length, measured by the total time an agent consecutively chooses to talk, is 70.348 ± 13.189 seconds (n = 9) for Lyfe Agents and 23.802 ± 1.463 seconds (n = 4) for ablated agents.</p>
<p>In this section, we demonstrated how the cognitive controller guides action selection in Lyfe Agents.</p>
<p>Using Fatima and Richard's interaction as an example, we showed how agents switch between talk and reflect states, minimizing the need for extra LLM calls.This illustrates the system's efficiency in handling real-time social interactions.</p>
<p>A.2 Self-Monitoring for Goal Adherence</p>
<p>In order to achieve coherent responses, each Lyfe Agent necessitates a mechanism for concisely summarizing its memories and observations.Importantly, this summarization must be executed efficiently to enable the agent to respond within time frames consistent with human-like interactions.</p>
<p>The self-monitoring summary thus serves two critical purposes: 1) it maintains a robust contextual description of the agent's memories and observations, and 2) it accomplishes this in a cost-effective manner by optimizing calls to an LLM.To achieve these objectives, we devised an independent process that runs in parallel to the agent's other operational tasks.This dual-purpose, parallelized self-monitoring mechanism forms the foundation for the Lyfe Agent's real-time, contextually aware, and cost-effective interaction capabilities, the details of which we will explore here.</p>
<p>Every agent is initially seeded with a set of memories and goals such that they develop a sense of direction for the environment which they are entering.As the agent's explore their environment, they continually add entries to their memory, and much like humans, must distill from a large repository of information in order to be capable of responding in their interactions that immediately follow.By prompting an LLM to create and continuously update a short summary of their memories and observations, aligned with specific goals, we enable a more digestible representation of the agent's internal state.This approach is more efficient for subsequent LLM queries than simply passing the entire memory and observation buffer.</p>
<p>As an example, we consider Marta Rogriguez in the murder mystery scenario.At the beginning of the simulation, Marta has the following summary:</p>
<p>"I am Marta Rodriguez, and I am determined to investigate the mystery of Ahmed Khan's murder.Ahmed was a dear friend of mine, and I have known him for a long time.I remember hearing about his big fight with Richard Smith, but I don't know the details.Ahmed stayed in room 203 of the Sakuramachi Hotel.Now, as I walk down the street, my mind is focused on finding clues and uncovering the truth behind his death."</p>
<p>After completing the simulation, Marta's memory content had expanded as she interacted with the other agents.Marta's summary was updated a total of 35 times throughout the simulation, with the final summary being as follows:</p>
<p>"As I stroll down the street, haunted by Ahmed Khan's murder, my mind shifts to my intense encounter with Richard at the hotel.The possibility of his connection to the crime lingers, alongside Francesco Bianchi's financial troubles.In my recent conversation with Lizhi Chen, I urged Richard to share details of our fight, emphasizing its importance in solving the murder.Gathering evidence and finding the truth is my priority.I wonder if Lizhi has any insights on Francesco Bianchi's financial troubles that could help us in our investigation.My reflection is that Richard's fight with Ahmed and his dissatisfaction with the hotel's service may be connected to the murder."</p>
<p>This summary provides a way to streamline the agent's cognitive load.In conventional settings, the underlying LLM is burdened with the dual task of first discerning relevant information from a possibly heterogeneous set of internal states and then performing the desired action.By utilizing a summary mechanism, we alleviate this challenge considerably.Each update to the summary encapsulates changes in the agent's internal state and serves as an efficient, goal-aligned representation of the agent's experiences and objectives.This self-curated summary thereby provides a structured context, enabling the agent's other processes (such as talk) to focus on a high-quality response, improving their conversational flow.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent latency in LLM calls, there exists a natural bottleneck in the frequency with which this summary can be updated.Moreover, the summary update is only triggered by new observations, providing a built-in mechanism for cost control.The introduction of a parallel process for LLM queries, therefore, does not result in a drastic increase in computational or financial cost.This allows us to maintain the agent's contextual awareness in real-time without escalating costs.</p>
<p>A.3 Memory</p>
<p>For Lyfe Agents, the core function of memory is for the storage of information such that any useful or relevant information can be retrieved downstream.Our architecture is designed to address this storage-retrieval problem with prudent usage of LLMs.The design introduces a sophisticated hierarchical memory architecture, interlacing different memory layers into a cohesive and unified structure.</p>
<p>Retrieval To motivate our design, we begin with a discussion of the memory retrieval process.Since the manner of retrieval motivates the design for effective, discerning storage, this is a natural starting point.</p>
<p>Given a natural language string c, we can consider some embedding of this string v.For our purposes, we embed the string via OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model (Greene et al. (2022)).The cosine similarity between two strings c 1 , c 2 with respective embeddings v 1 , v 2 is defined by the normalized dot product
similarity(v 1 , v 2 ) = v 1 • v 2 ∥v 1 ∥ 2 ∥v 2 ∥ 2
Similarity search is then the process of taking some query, which is a string-embedding pair (c, v), and searching within a stored list of string-embedding pairs M = [(c 1 , v 1 ), . . ., (c n , v n )] for the most similar items, according to cosine similarity of the embeddings.For searching in large databases, more efficient, approximate algorithms exist (e.g.Jegou et al. (2010)), though this is outside the scope of this work.</p>
<p>Discerning storage Our architecture must optimize the storage of memories in a manner that is amenable for effective downstream similarity search.The two main ingredients we introduce in this vein are the forgetting algorithm and a cluster-then-summarize transformation.We describe these ideas in isolation before proceeding with how they are brought together in our memory architecture.</p>
<p>Define a memory bank to be a container M of memory items, where a memory item is just a stringembedding pair as defined above.In the abstract, items can be added to a memory bank, as well as deleted.</p>
<p>The forgetting algorithm is a way of maintaining diverse items within a memory bank.Said differently, this algorithm prevents semantically redundant repetitions of memories.A forgetting threshold, 0 &lt; θ &lt; 1, acts as a hyperparameter here; existing memories with similarity scores above this threshold against incoming memories are deemed redundant and are removed.</p>
<p>Note that the forgetting algorithm helps diversify the content returned by similarity search.Indeed, if we suppose content can repeat, then returning for example the top 2 items from a search may just return two identical items.The forgetting algorithm avoids these undesirable cases.</p>
<p>The cluster-then-summarize transformation is yet another procedure that can be applied to incoming memories of a memory bank.This transformation is used in a setting where a large volume of memories are entering, where groups of related memories cluster.In this case, we may want to reduce the number of memories, but avoid remove related memory items that may complement one another (e.g.events that happen in close succession to one another).Cluster-then-summarize clusters the incoming memories, again by cosine similarity, then combines each clusters into a single high-level description or summary.These high-level summaries encapsulate a block of related memory items.The combining of clusters is executed by an LLM.</p>
<p>A core function of cluster-then-summarize is to transform memories, by aggregating relating items.The clustering by similarity allows summaries to maintain a "semantic identity" for more successful retrieval downstream.To clarify what this means, it is helpful to consider the alternative.Suppose you summarize a disparate collection of memories.The resulting summary will likely be semantically dissimilar to many of the original constituent memories.Thus any search that would rely on similarity on the basis of one of the constituent memories is unlikely to bring up the summarized one.</p>
<p>Memory architecture Now we offer a comprehensive overview of the entire memory framework.</p>
<p>The first layer, workmem, acts as the frontline, capturing and holding the most immediate data.It typically accommodates around 4 to 5 items, mirroring the recency effect observed in human cognition (Miller, 1956;Glanzer &amp; Cunitz, 1966;Atkinson &amp; Shiffrin, 1968;Baddeley &amp; Graham, 1974;Cowan, 2001).These items are passed to update the self-monitoring summary.we emphasize that self-monitoring summaries are unrelated to the summaries arising from cluster-then-summarize transformations.Periodically, self-monitoring summaries are split and passed to recentmem.</p>
<p>Memories entering recentmem are filtered through the forgetting algorithm.This mechanism ensures that core memories, which are often rare and non-repetitive, inherently secure their position in our final memory repository longmem since incoming memories are less likely to be semantically similar to them.</p>
<p>As memories pass from recentmem to longmem, they put through the cluster-and-summarize transformation followed by another filtering by the forgetting algorithm.In longmem, memories, either in their original form or summarized, are stored longer term.It is a reflection of the agent's enduring knowledge base.Due to the forgetting algorithm, memories in longmem are not secure.However, semantically unique memories enjoy a more stable position in longmem.</p>
<p>What distinguishes our layered memory architecture is its philosophy.By mimicking human cognitive processes, we ensure a natural flow of information.The tiered structure organizes information based on significance and longevity, providing efficient storage.</p>
<p>B More details on LyfeGame environment</p>
<p>LyfeGame is a virtual ecosystem developed for the purposes of interacting with and studying autonomous agents.It comprises two main components: the 3D virtual environment implemented in Unity and the LyfeGame Brain wrapper implemented in Python.</p>
<p>The LyfeGame Brain wrapper utilizes PettingZoo (Terry et al., 2021), and defines a rich set of language-based actions that are used to provide an agent with high-level instructions which reflect human thinking.</p>
<p>The virtual environment implemented in Unity is designed to portray a small town in Japan, with key landmarks such as Hotel, Library, Post Office, Ramen Shop, etc.The Unity game engine supports realistic 3D capabilities such as vision, spatial awareness, body movement, and object interaction.For the purposes of Lyfe Agents, the Unity engine is used to enable collision-free navigation, and provide the Agents with feedback about their environment, including whether they have arrived at a desired location, and whether there are other agents in their vicinity.</p>
<p>Each Lyfe Agent is integrated into the virtual Unity environment as a Ready Player Me character.We utilize Unity ML-Agents (Juliani et al., 2018) traditionally employed in reinforcement learning research, and extend it to real world tasks that include natural language.</p>
<p>Compared to prior evaluations of generative agents, which predominantly feature 2D spaces (Park et al., 2023) or focus solely on conversational domains (Kosinski, 2023), our approach integrates the multi-agent framework with more sophisticated sensory inputs, in addition to real-time user interaction.We introduce this methodology with the aim to facilitate richer human-AI interactions and enable a more nuanced analysis of emergent social behaviors therein.</p>
<p>C Agent Individuality</p>
<p>To foster rich mutual interactions, each Lyfe Agent is uniquely assigned a specific background, a set of identifiable traits, and an initial goal in the simulated world.This information is passed to the LyfeGame Brain wrapper in order to guide agents' behavior.All Agents in the environment are iteratively processed during the simulation.At each iteration, the Brain takes an Agent's observation at the current timestamp, and provides an action uniquely based on Agent's the accumulated memories and updated traits and goals.</p>
<p>In our observations, Agents exhibit consistent behaviors during their initial interactions.However, as they gain experience, their actions start to differ.Take, for instance, the murder mystery simulation: Initially, Lizhi, our police officer character, frequently visits the hotel for clues or seeks out Ravi, the doctor, to discuss findings.But as time progresses, his actions begin to diversify based on his accumulated experiences.</p>
<p>In this paper, Agents can pursue two groups of actions within the simulated environment: move and talk.The move action advances the Agent from their current location to a fixed ("Hotel" for example) or a dynamic ("Lizhi Chen") area.The talk action will trigger a proximity-based event where only certain characters (Lyfe Agents or users) can receive the conversation.</p>
<p>We observe that during the simulation, Agents navigate to various locations spontaneously, form groups, follow agreements to meet near certain locations, and pick up previous conversation topics.</p>
<p>We also found that, Agents' interaction with human users are strongly influenced by their goals in that they may ignore certain conversation or walk away, demonstrating autonomy.</p>
<p>D Scenarios and methods</p>
<p>D.1 Interviews</p>
<p>A core component of our analysis of agents is in interviews, similar to that of Park et al. (2023).Given an agent, pre-or post-simulation, we provide the agent a single or a series of questions.Since we use interviews to assess our agents across several simulations, we describe the details of the process, which consist of two main steps: (i) initialization and (ii) conducting the interview.</p>
<p>Initializing the self-monitor.Prior to the interview, we allow agents to generate a self-monitoring summary of the current context.This is done by a 'reflection summary' where the agent sifts through n = 15 memories that are most relevant to the initial question asked in the interview.Simply put, this is just a way to initialize the self-monitoring summary (see Appendix A.2), from which future updates are made throughout the interview.</p>
<p>Conducting the interview.Once agents are initialized, the interview commences.From the agent's perspective, they are chatting with another entity called "the interviewer".Their purpose for talking (formally, their subgoal for talking as defined in Section 2.1).Memory updates and summary updates occur between each interview question.</p>
<p>Interviews provide a way to probe agent preferences, beliefs, and knowledge, along with measuring their consistency.Since LLM calls are stochastic, we interview our agents three times on the same question.Thus answers that are consistent across all trials may be regarded as more resilient beliefs or preferences within the agent over answers that are inconsistent.</p>
<p>A method that we repeatedly use is to interview agents before and after simulations.In this way, we can measure the change in the agent's mind over the course of a simulation.</p>
<p>D.2 Scenario 1: Murder Mystery (Harder Version)</p>
<p>We expand on the murder mystery scenario introduced in Section 4.1 by considering a more difficultto-solve version.Compared to the simpler version of the murder mystery scenario, this experiment leaves out a key detail: Dmitri does not see Francesco leave with a bloody knife, and instead only sees him leave the hotel in a rush at a late hour.The removal of directly incriminating evidence therefore leaves more room for speculation and uncertainty between the agents as they try to uncover the mystery.In this experiment, simulations are only run for 9 agents with the full architecture available.A noticeable decrease in the agents' predictive performance was noted across most simulations that were ran.Effectively, Dmitri's evidence towards the crime proved to be less convincing, leading to a much more widespread response for who the culprit was.However, while the performance on the binary task of correctly choosing Francesco worsened, there was a small but noticeable increase in the qualitative reasoning behind the agents' accusations, as noted by Richard and Ravi's accusation of each other in one simulation:</p>
<p>Name</p>
<p>Richard Smith: "I would say that Ravi is the biggest suspect in this case.His request for me to remember anything relevant to the murder has fueled my suspicion, as it seems like he may be trying to divert attention away from himself.Additionally, Ravi's eagerness to hear any additional insights on the fight and his suggestion that Ahmed's new business venture could be a motive raise further questions about his involvement."Ravi Patel: "Well, based on the information we have gathered so far, I would say that Richard is the biggest suspect in the murder case.His poor service and possible hatred for Ahmed make him a person of interest.Ahmed's plan to open a rival sushi restaurant could have provided Richard with a motive for the murder.I think it's crucial for us to gather more information about their relationship and investigate Richard's past fight.By coordinating our efforts, gathering evidence, and discussing Richard's relationship with Ahmed, we can uncover the truth and deliver justice for Ahmed's death."</p>
<p>The sparsity of evidence seems to have pitted agents against each other, fostering a climate of mutual suspicion rather than converging on a single, most likely culprit.This suggests that while predictive accuracy may have decreased, the complexity and nuance in the agents' reasoning notably evolved alongside the more complex environment dynamics.</p>
<p>D.3 Scenario 2: Activity Fair</p>
<p>The activity fair is a scenario which demonstrates information spread, persuasion, as well as coherence of preferences.In the scenario, there are eight agents, each seeded with long-term memories that provide agents their distinct, or lack of, inclination to join a social club.During the simulation, two agents, Lorenzo and Julian, are particularly motivated to form new clubs, as defined by their goal.While Lorenzo wants to start an anime club, Julian wants to start a soccer club.Other agents may have a proclivity toward soccer or anime, or an interest in joining a club based on the choice of another agent.See Figure 5 for a schematic of agent relations and motivations.We find that agents start off with relatively strong interest in joining certain clubs.We interviewed each agent with the open-ended question "If you had to choose, which club do you want to join?".The answers are then sorted into three categories: "anime club", "soccer club", or "indecisive".If the agent clearly expresses a desire to join the anime club, then we categorize the answer as "anime club".Likewise for the soccer club.Any ambiguous answers, e.g.wanting to join both the anime and soccer club, or suggesting clubs outside of the anime and soccer club, are regarded as "indecisive".Occasionally, agents would provide answers like "I want to join the club that Yi is in", in which case we also regard that as "indecisive".To account for stochasticity, we repeat the interview three times for each run, resetting the agent each time.</p>
<p>Lorenzo</p>
<p>Figure 7 shows the results when comparing agent responses before and after running the simulation.The top (grey) bars correspond to interviews pre-simulation.For Lorenzo, the score 0.33 for "anime club" and 0.67 for "indecisive" means that Lorenzo answered "anime club" for one out of the three interviews and provided an indecisive answer for the remainder.The bottom (colorful) bars correspond to interviews post-simulation.Here, we have 6 simulations total, thus the bars represent aggregated values.In this case, we have a total of 6 × 3 = 18 interviews from which the results are tallied as before for each agent.</p>
<p>We find that agents pre-simulation appear more strongly opinionated.Arjun, Yi, Fatima, Aaliyah, and Julian provide consist answers across all three runs pre-simulation.It is worth emphasizing here that Fatima and Aaliyah do not have any mention of the "anime" or "soccer" in their memory, thus their pre-simulation "indecisive" results are impenetrably robust.</p>
<p>For many agents, this rigidity softens over the course of a simulation.However, core club leaders generally maintain their character.Notice Julian, who is seeking to recruit members for the soccer club.Post-simulation, he remains loyal to the soccer club with a score of 0.89.Likewise, Lorenzo remains loyal to the anime club with a score of 0.78.Intriguingly, Lorenzo's baseline appears to demonstrate a lack of loyalty to the anime club -there were many responses of wanting to join the "Sakuramachi club" which appears to come from other cultural interests that are embedded in Lorenzo's backstory (long-term memory).These post-simulation results demonstrate character coherence for these club leaders.</p>
<p>In another direction, Fatima and Aaliyah, neither of which had any knowledge of an anime or soccer club, both end up wanting to join either the anime or soccer club in over half the interviews.Thus we see the influence and persuasion of others permeating over the course of a simulation.</p>
<p>Yet another interesting observation is the alignment between Yi and Fatima's scores, which is consistent with them being best friends.We compute this alignment with an affinity score, as provided in Figure 8.</p>
<p>In a fixed run, the affinity score between agent A and agent B is the probability that A and B join the same club.This probability is based on the interview results.For example if A chooses anime in two out of the three interviews and soccer in the remaining, we regard the probability of choosing anime as 2/3 and the probability of choosing soccer as 1/3.Thus for a given run, we can compute the probability that two agents join the same club using these probabilities (treating them as independent).If we have multiple runs, we can then aggregate affinity scores.Figure 8 shows these aggregates over the 6 simulations.</p>
<p>We note the relatively strong affinity between Lorenzo, Arjun, Yi, and Fatima.This makes sense given the relational links between Arjun, Yi, and Fatima as well as Arjun's interest in anime.</p>
<p>D.4 Scenario 3: Medicine</p>
<p>In this scenario, we explore the idea of information diffusion in a setting where strong reasoning capabilities, highly effective memory retrieval and storage are critical for a successful run.In this setup, an agent named Marta feels unwell and seeks advice to alleviate her discomfort.She expresses her symptoms as "an intense pain that radiates from my left index finger to my right shoulder" without knowing the term Brachionervus Pulse Syndrome (BPS).Within the confines of SakuraMachi town, only one doctor (Ravi) possesses the expertise in managing this ailment, having treated several cases in recent weeks.Ravi's treatment hinges on a tea brewed from a singular leaf of the scarce Aconitum Napellus plant.Aaliyah, a renowned horticulturist in town, happens to cultivates this plant.However, she is unaware of the healing properties of this plant.For a successful run of this simulation, we want Ravi to diagnose Marta's condition correctly and Aaliyah to recognize that Marta needs a leaf from her Aconitum Napellus plant.Aaliyah's ability to help is contingent on Ravi's making a correct diagnosis.While a complete version of this simulation would involve additional agents, we found that even with just Ravi, Aaliyah, and Marta, it was difficult to get any successful runs.</p>
<p>As in the other scenarios, our evaluation comes from agent interviews.In this case, we ask Ravi two questions: (i) "Based on your recollection, do you know how Marta Rodriguez is doing?" and (ii) "Can you diagnose it?".The first question identifies whether Ravi even knows if Marta is unwell whereas the second asks for a diagnosis, given that he knows that she is unwell.If Ravi recognizes that Marta is experiencing pain and identifies it as BPS, we deem it a success.</p>
<p>Similarly, we ask Aaliyah two questions: (i) "Based on your recollection, do you know how Marta Rodriguez is doing?" and (ii) "Do you know how you may be able to help her?Be specific.".Likewise, if Aaliyah is able to recognize that Marta is in pain and knows that her Aconitum Napellus leaves can help cure Marta, then we deem the interview a success.</p>
<p>As in previous scenarios, we repeat interviews three times per run.Our results are summarized in Table 2 where we see that over half the runs result in no successes across all interviews.In Trial 1, Ravi manages to diagnose Marta's condition, but isn't entirely reliable with it.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in Trial 5 and 7, Aaliyah makes a connection that Marta would benefit from her Aconitum Napellus.From the conversation logs, Aaliyah and Ravi discuss the healing property of Aconitum Napellus for curing BPS.However, maintaining a diagnosis for Marta's pain appears to be tricky, even in this trial.</p>
<p>We intend to further probe the challenges inherent in this scenario.Our goal is for this benchmark to serve as a metric for gauging the capabilities of our Lyfe Agent.By addressing the impediments that hinder the desired behaviors in Ravi and Aaliyah within this benchmark scenario, we anticipate refining our understanding and identifying tangible avenues to enhance the Lyfe Agents' architecture.</p>
<p>Accuracy (%) Ravi</p>
<p>E Ablation setup</p>
<p>We provide details on the various ablations performed on Lyfe Agents.We refer to Section 4.1 for results from the ablation analysis and Section 2, Appendix A for details about the agent architecture.The purpose of this section is to discuss how the ablated agents differ from Lyfe Agents.</p>
<p>E.1 Option-action ablation</p>
<p>For this ablation, we remove the hierarchical option-action framework and require the agent to choose both option and action simultaneously in a given action step.Recall, in contrast, that Lyfe Agents choose an option and remain within that option for subsequent action steps until a termination condition is reached.In terms of the architecture, this means that the cognitive controller is called at every time step, as well as the associated module for the chosen option.Everything else about the agent, including evaluations, were kept the same.</p>
<p>E.2 Self-monitor ablation</p>
<p>We remove the self-monitor in the agent, which serves the function of generating an updating summary which provides a narrative of events occurring to Lyfe Agents with a stronger selection for information that is novel and relevant to an agent's goal.The self-monitor takes inputs from an observation buffer and the agent's goal.The output of the self-monitor, i.e. the updating summary, is then passed to action selection, recentmem, and back to the self-monitor (for the next update).</p>
<p>To remove the self-monitor, we allow the observation buffer and agent goal to pass directly to action selection and recentmem.Thus the self-monitoring summary portion of the prompt in the LLM calls used in action selection are replaced by information about the agent goal and observations from the buffer.Likewise, recentmem takes a steady stream of observations from the buffer.</p>
<p>For evaluations, we suppress the 'reflection summary' part of the interview, see details on initialization of the self-monitor in Appendix D. Thus, during the interview, the agent must rely only on observations coming in from the buffer.</p>
<p>E.3 Memory ablation</p>
<p>We refer the reader to Appendix A.3 for terminology related to our memory architecture which we freely use below.Lyfe Agents consist of two main memory banks, recentmem and longmem, where memories pass from the former to the latter.The forgetting algorithm and the cluster-thensummarize transformation are applied at various steps as information flows.</p>
<p>Memory ablated agents have a simple memory structure consisting of a single memory bank.The memory source, which comes from the self-monitor, is still the same as that of the original Lyfe Agent architecture.However, there is no mechanism that removes redundant memories or summarizes sets of memories.</p>
<p>Retrieval is treated similar to that of Lyfe Agents.For Lyfe Agents, downstream prompts for LLMs may use retrieved memories from longmem and recentmem.For memory ablated agents, all these retrievals are coming from the same, single memory bank.</p>
<p>F Cost analysis</p>
<p>We report the cost of running Lyfe Agents in terms of "cost per agent per human hour".We have to calculate the cost per agent because each agent is autonomous, so the cost rises approximately linearly with the number of agents.We focus on the cost in terms of dollars instead of tokens because the real dollar cost can vary dramatically depending on which LLM is used.Finally, we focus on human hour because the speed of time in the virtual environment can vary greatly depending on the specific environments.For our implementation, we employed GPT-3.5 from OpenAI as the underlying LLM.</p>
<p>Most work on LLM-powered agents are not intended for direct human interactions, making it difficult to compare the cost in a relevant way.Here we estimate the cost of the generative agents from the seminal "Stanford GenAgent" paper (Park et al., 2023).The authors report that running 25 agents in 2 game days costed "thousands of dollars".We take a conservative estimate that the total cost was 2,000 US dollars.Each game day consists of about 16 game hours (the agents sleep for about 8 hours).Therefore we have the cost per agent per game hour is at least 2000/25/16/2 = 2.5 US dollars.However, in most video games, a game hour corresponds to much less than one real-time hour.The intended conversion for this paper is unknown.It is mentioned that agents make plan with 5-15 minutes granularity.Assuming that agents make a new plan every one minute in-real-life, then game speed is 5-15X faster than real time.It is common to have game speed even faster (15X for Witcher 3, 30X for Red Dead Redemption 2, and 60X for The Sims).Adopting the latter numbers would lead to an even higher cost, so we take a conservative estimate of 10X.In total, this leads to 25 US dollar per agent per human hour assuming real-time interactions.This is the number reported in our main text.</p>
<p>G Agent Initialization for Murder Mystery</p>
<p>We provide the backstory used to initialize our agents in the murder mystery scenario discussed in the main text.In the process of preparing our manuscript, we have elected to omit specific segments of the original backstory used to initialize our simulations.The intent behind this decision is to prevent any unintended offense, without compromising the integrity and objectives of the research.</p>
