                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Neurofibrillary tangles but not senile plaques parallel duration and severity of Alzheimer's disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We studied the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques (SPs) in 10 Alzheimer's disease patients who had been examined during life. We counted NFTs and SPs in 13 cytoarchitectural regions representing limbic, primary sensory, and association cortices, and in subcortical neurotransmitter‐specific areas. The degree of neuropathologic change was compared with the severity of dementia, as assessed by the Blessed Dementia Scale and duration of illness. We found that (1) the severity of dementia was positively related to the number of NFTs in neocortex, but not to the degree of SP deposition; (2) NFTs accumulate in a consistent pattern reflecting hierarchic vulnerability of individual cytoarchitectural fields; (3) NFTs appeared in the entorhinal cortex, CA1/subiculum field of the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala early in the disease process; and (4) the degree of SP deposition was also related to a hierarchic vulnerability of certain brain areas to accumulate SPs, but the pattern of SP distribution was different from that of NFT.</p>

<p>Neurofibrillary tangles but not senile plaques parallel duration and severiti of azheimer's disease</p>
<p>Article abstract-We studied the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques (SPs) in 10 Alzheimer's disease patients who had been examined during life. We counted NFTs and SPs in 13 cytoarchitectural regions representing limbic, primary sensory, and association cortices, and in subcortical neurotransmitter-specific areas. The degree of neuropathologic change was compared with the severity of dementia, as assessed by the Blessed Dementia Scale and duration of illness. We found that (1) the severity of dementia was positively related to the number of NFTs in neocortex, but not to the degree of SP deposition; ( 2 ) NFTs accumulate in a consistent pattern reflecting hierarchic vulnerability of individual cytoarchitectural fields; ( 3 ) NFTs appeared in the entorhinal cortex, CAlhbiculum field of the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala early in the disease process; and (4) the degree of SP deposition was also related to a hierarchic vulnerability of certain brain areas to accumulate SPs, but the pattern of SP distribution was different from that of NFT.</p>
<p>Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques (SPs) are the pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although Blocq and Marinesco' first described plaques i n 1892 a n d Alzheimer2 described NFTs in 1907, the relationship of NFTs and SPs to the degree of cognitive impairment in AD still remains controversial. Some s t u d i e P support a positive correlation between severity of dementia and degree of S P accumulation, whereas other^^-^^ do not. Furthermore, there are reports of individuals who were not demented during life but whose brains contain large numbers of SPs.15-lR Similar uncertainties surround NFTs: there were positive correlations between clinical parameters and NFT counts in some ~t u d i e s~,~J~J~ but not in other^.^,^ At least two factors could account for these divergent views: lack of a representative sample of prospectively studied patients in different stages of the disease, with formal neuropsychological assessment close t o the time of death, or limited sampling of brain regions for histopathologic examination.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, we counted NFTs and SPs in 13 different brain regions of 10 AD patients who were examined prospectively in the Memory Disorders Unit a t t h e Massachusetts General Hospital. We sought to test the following hypotheses: (1) t h e number of NFTs and SPs increase with increasing severity or duration of dementia, (2) NFTs and SPs accumulate independently in various brain regions, according to a consistent pattern of hierarchic vulnerability, and (3) limbic areas tend to be involved by NFTs and association cortices by SPs relatively early in the disease process.</p>
<p>M e t h o d s . Subjects. We examined the brains of 10 patients with AD, selected from 75 subjects who had been seen clinically a t the Massachusetts Alzheimer Disease Research Center. The selection criteria were the clinicallg and neuropathologic2" diagnosis of AD, and no other coincident lesions (eg, infarcts or substantia nigra depigmentation). Patients were excluded if any other medical condition (eg, primary psychiatric diagnosis, endocrine abnormalities, and so forth) were considered to have contributed to the level of cognitive impairment. The subjects ranged in age from 52 t o 82 years, had a duration of disease from 1 to 8.4 years, and had had a neurologic examination 1 t o 14 months ( 5 . 7 f 1.4 months) before death (table). Estimates of dementia severity were based upon the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS14 The BDS is a structured mental status interview in two parts. In one part, answers to questions related to personality changes and activities of daily living are solicited from the patient's spouse or care-giver. In the second part, the patient answers questions posed by the examiner that test memory, information, and concentration. In the Memory Disorders Unit, a score of 0 to 2 is normal, whereas a score of 65 indicates maximal dementia severity. In our sample, the BDS scores ranged from mild (BDS = 4) to severe (BDS = 50.5); the last recorded "testable" BDS was administered 1 to 24 months (11.3 k 2.5 months) before death. As controls for the histologic preparations and NFT and SP counts and in the absence of prospectively studied nondemented individuals, we also examined brains of four clinically demented individuals followed in the Memory Disorder Unit who did not have AD. Their pathologic diagnoses were Pick's disease (n = l), diffuse Lewy body disease (n = l), and Parkinson's disease (n = 2) (table). There was no significant difference between age, BDS scores, and duration of disease in the two groups. The mean number of NFTs and SPs averaged over all areas in the 10 AD and four non-AD demented patients are shown in the table. As expected, the number of NFTs and SPs was significantly higher in the AD patients ( p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p>
<p>Tissue processing. Coronal slices from one half of each brain were fixed in 10%' formalin, according to an established protocol.21 Thirteen cytoarchitectural areas were chosen for analysis, based upon our prior experience in a study sampling 39 cytoarchitectural areas of the brain. 22 In the current study, we sampled areas representing various types of cortex (allocortex, periallocortex, and neocortex), functionally distinct regions (limbic areas, pri-632 NEUROLOGY 42 March 1992 mary sensory cortex, primary association cortex, and high-order association cortex), and subcortical nuclei from the ventral forebrain and pons. Blocks taken from the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala (AMG), basal forebrain, superior frontal gyrus (areas 8/9), inferior and middle temporal gyri (areas 20 and 21), superior parietal gyrus (area 7), visual cortices (areas 17 and 18), and brainstem (upper pons) were embedded in paraffin, and 10-pm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, cresyl violet for Nissl substance, and thioflavine S (Thio-S) for NFTs and SPs. Brains from the AD and non-AD cases were processed identically.</p>
<p>Quantitation of NFTs and SPs. The following cytoarchitectural areas were selected for examination (in some instances, as noted, tissue was not available from all 10 AD cases): dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG), CA3/4 field of hippocampus (CA3/4), CAl/subiculum (CAl/S) field of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (EC), AMG, nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) (in six cases), frontal area 8/9, temporal areas 20121, parietal area 7 (in seven cases), occipital areas 18 and 17 (the neocortical areas were named according to the Brodmann nomenclature), raphe nucleus (RN), and locus ceruleus (LC) (in nine cases). Counts of SPs and NFTs were performed by one examiner (P.V.A.), who was unaware of the clinical history. The seventy of pathologic changes was assessed by quantitation of NFTs and all SPs (diffuse, primitive, and compact) stained with Thio-S. Three to six representative fields of each cytoarchitectural area were counted using a lox objective, and the average of these counts recorded. With the configuration of the Leitz Aristoplan microscope, this is a 3-mm2 field. Counts are expressed per mm2. When the   identity of a tangle was ambiguous with the 10 x objective, a 16X or 40X objective was used for clarification. Statistical analysis. Linear regression analysis was used to correlate degree of pathologic changes as reflect-ed by NFT or SP counts, and severity of clinical dementia as assessed by either duration or BDS, in the AD cases. The results from the non-AD dementia cases were not used in the statistical analysis of correlation between AD pathologic changes and dementia. Factor analysis was used to find natural grouping of variables. The Kendall measure of concordance (W) test was used to assess the consistency of rank order of cytoarchitectural areas. All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS-X program (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL). Results are expressed as mean f SE, and considered significant at p &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>Results. Topographic distribution of NFT and SP pathologic changes in AD. The densities of NFTs showed a hierarchic pattern of selective vulnerability across the 13 cytoarchitectural areas studied (figure 1). The most frequently and severely affected areas were in the medial temporal lobe, the EC (neurons from layers 11,111, and IV), and the CAlIS field of the hippocampal formation. Among neocortical areas, association areas 20121, 819, and 7 had the highest NFT counts, whereas visual association area 18 was less frequently and severely affected and primary visual area 17 was even less affected. The RN showed higher NFT counts than the LC (six of 10 cases, &gt;1 NFTlmm2 and one of nine cases, &gt;1 NFTlmm2, respectively), and it was also more frequently involved (10 of 10 cases and five of nine, respectively). T h e NBM w a s a l s o f r e q u e n t l y involved (five of six cases), and three of five cases had &gt;1 NFTlmmZ. The overall order for NFTs was EC&gt;CAl/S&gt;7&gt;20/2 l&gt;AMG&gt;8/9&gt;NBM&gt; 18&gt;RN&gt;CA3 /4&gt;LC&gt;17&gt;DG. This rank order of NFT accumulation was highly consistent as assessed in all cases (Kendall's measure of concordance, W = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>The pattern of SP distribution was markedly different from t h a t of NFT, but SP densities also showed t h a t some areas were consistently more vulnerable than others (figure 1). Neocortical association areas 20121,819, 7, and 18 and AMG showed higher SP counts than primary visual area 17, EC, and CAlIS. The AMG consistently contained larger numbers of SPs than the hippocampal formation or EC. SPs occurred frequently i n NBM (six of six cases), but in small numbers, and only rarely in the RN (three of 10 cases) and LC (one of nine cases).</p>
<p>Overall, the rank order of SP accumulation was 8/9&gt;20/2 1&gt;7&gt; 18&gt;AMG&gt;l7&gt;EC&gt;CAl/S&gt;DG&gt;CA3/4 &gt;NBM&gt;RN&gt;LC. The rank order pattern was highly significant (Kendall's measure of concordance, W = 0.885, p &lt; 0.001). Correlation between the total number of NFTs and the total number of SPs did not reach statistical significance (R = 0.60, p c 0.1).</p>
<p>Relation of t h e severity of disease and NFT and SP accumulation. The severity of dementia in AD may be viewed as either the degree of cognitive impairment (BDS score) or the duration of disease; clinical experience suggests that the two variables should, in general, correlate well. In our sample, scores on the BDS were significantly correlated with duration of disease (R = 0.71, p &lt; 0.05). Nonetheless, we analyzed both measures of disease severity independently. For initial analyses, the number of NFTs and SPs was averaged over all areas examined to provide an estimate of overall "burden" of NFTs and SPs. In addition, factor analysis revealed two groups of related regions for NFTs: one group contained the hippocampal fields (DG, CA3/4, CAl/S) and AMG, and the second group, neocortical areas (areas 819, 20/21, 7, and 17). The EC did not factor into either group, perhaps because of a ceiling effect.</p>
<p>The of neocortical NFTs, whereas no such relationship existed for SP counts. These findings contrast with previous studies that found a correlation between severity of dementia and the number of SPs. The first was the Newcastle upon Tyne study by Blessed et al.4 In that study, however, the authors pointed out that a positive correlation between SP number and cognitive assessment score depended upon including in the analysis individuals who were not demented. If the nondemented or mildly demented subjects were removed from the analysis, the correlation coefficient would be reduced to c0.4 and would lose statistical significance. Similar issues are present in the study of Duyckaerts et a1,6 who examined brains of intellectually normal as well as AD subjects, and reported that the SP density in four neocortical areas (first temporal, supramarginal, calcarine, and precentral gyri) was significantly correlated with the degree of mental impairment. In an extension of that study, Delaere  In our data, correlations between the number of SPs and duration of illness or BDS score were not significant in any individual region nor when grouped. In other words, we could not establish a link between SP number and degree of dementia. There are several possible explanations for this finding. SPs may, in fact, not contribute to progression of dementia. Alternatively, SPs may be both formed and destroyed by metabolic processes over the course of years, so that SP numbers at a given time do not reflect total accumulation of p-A4 amyloid. Such a possibility is consistent with the observation that the number of SPs and NFTs in the frontal cortex did not differ significantly between time of biopsy and death in a small series of AD patients.23</p>
<p>Whereas SPs were not related to dementia severity, our results reinforce the idea that the formation of NFTs contributes to cognitive impairment. This conclusion is consistent with the results of Morris e t all1: in a study of mildly demented individuals, they found that severity of dementia was better correlated with the density of neocortical tangles than with the plaque density, and that there was no significant difference in total plaque count in individuals with mild dementia compared with individuals with more advanced dementia. In another report,13 the same group studied 12 AD patients (six of whom were "mild"), and reported "substantial concentrations of SPs throughout the cortex" in the mildly demented individuals. The limbic areas were the most severely affected by NFTs in cases with mild dementia, and "the neocortex did not have substantial densities of NFTs unless moderate to severe dementia was clearly established.'' In a study of 35 individuals with AD, which included samples from frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus, Wilcock et a15 also demonstrated that the presence and severity of dementia correlated better with NFTs than with SPs in the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>We found a significant correlation between BDS and NFTs in neocortical areas but not in limbic  areas. The lack of correlation between limbic NFTs and BDS score is likely due to the nature of the clinical test. Only five points of the total BDS score depend upon retaining newly acquired verbal information for 5 minutes. AD patients always fail this task early in the course of the disease. There is, therefore, a ceiling effect on the portion of the BDS that is most likely affected by pathologic changes in the EC, AMG, and hippocampus; thus, an increasing severity of limbic area pathologic changes would not necessarily be reflected by worsening in the overall BDS score.</p>
<p>Topographic distribution of AD changes form a stereotyped p a t t e r n that is different f o r NFTs a n d SPs. By examination of 13 cytoarchitectural regions in AD, we found a consistent pattern of hierarchic vulnerability for NFT formation. The EC, area CAlIS of the hippocampus, and the AMG, followed by association cortex (high-order &gt; primary), were the most vulnerable areas; primary sensory cortex was least affected. The distribution of SPs was markedly different from that of NFTs, but also followed a consistent pattern, with neocortical rather than medial temporal lobe areas (except for AMG) being most severely affected. Association cortex was still more affected than primary sensory cortex, but the relative difference for SPs was far less than for NFTs. These patterns confirm and extend the results of other investigations in AD and Down's syndrome.5J3,22.24-35 A notable exception to this pattern of hierarchic change is the prominent parieto-occipital pathologic changes found in a subset of AD patients with the clinical presentation of B a h t ' s syndrome.36 None of our patients had this clinical syndrome, but had the much more common presenting symptom of memory impairment. It is likely that anatomic variations in the distribution of pathologic lesions such as these account for clinical subtypes of AD-type dementia. The topographic distribution of NFTs and SPs observed in the four control cases of non-AD dementia resembles the pattern observed in nondemented elderly individual^.'^^^' This pattern was similar to AD cases in terms of rank order, but the degree of NFT deposition was considerably less. The presence of SPs was less constant than the presence of NFTs, and when present, SPs usually involved neocortical areas rather than EC, hippocampal formation, or AMG.</p>
<p>Relation between d u r a t i o n of disease and degree and distribution of NFTs and SPs suggests a pattern of progression of t h e AD t i s s u e alterations. The hierarchic pattern of vulnerability of different cytoarchitectural areas to pathologic changes in AD and the relation between degree of abnormality and duration of clinical disease suggest a pattern of progression, although this pattern is different for NFTs and SPs. To illustrate these pat- t e r n s , t h e d a t a h a v e been s u m m a r i z e d as schematic brain diagrams that show the severity and topographic distribution of NFTs and SPs in AD cases grouped according to duration of disease (figures 5 and 6). One individual with the shortest duration (&lt;1 year) had NFTs almost exclusively in the vulnerable medial temporal lobe areas, namely EC (affecting layers I1 and IV) and C A M field of the hippocampus. Cases with longer disease duration (1 to 4 years) had NFTs in neocortical association areas as well a s in the limbic areas. Individuals with the longest duration b 5 years) continued to accumulate more NFTs i n t h e s e areas, and also developed NFTs in primary sensory areas (figure 5). SPs had a different pattern of distribution and degree in relation to duration of disease than NFTs (figure 6). SPs early in the disease involved neocortical areas and the AMG rather than the hippocampal formation and EC. Even early in the disease, there can be considerable numbers of SPs. Overall, the pattern and degree of SP distribution do not change with increasing length of disease. Thus the number of SPs is not a good histologic marker of illness progression.</p>
<p>A clinical-pathologic model of A D dementia. We proposed that the early memory impairment in AD is related to the disruption of projections among the EC, hippocampal formation, and AMG a t multiple sites, and also of projections between these structures and cortical and subcortical target^. Dystrophic neurites have also been shown to correlate positively with the presence of dementia i n AD,41 and again may reflect progressive disruption of the neuropil. Because our current observations show that the anatomic distribution and degree of SPs did not correlate with the severity or duration of cognitive impairment, it is unlikely that the cognitive decline is related to progressive accumulation of SPs. Instead, our data emphasize the relationship between NFTs and dementia symptoms. We suggest that NFTs preferentially accumulate in ventromedial temporal lobe structures in the early stages of AD and contribute to early memory impairment. It is likely that the number of NFTs in neocortical areas and NBM increases with time. The RN and LC have been reported to have neuronal loss early in AD and in middle-aged individuals with Down's syndrome.42 Such changes could provide a n anatomic substrate of the progression of dementia a s the result of progressive disruption of neural systems in and between neocortical association areas and widely projecting subcortical nuclei.</p>

3BDS score correlated best with the number of NFTs in neocortical areas (R = 0.66, p &lt; 0.05; figure 2); there was no correlation between BDS score and the mean number of NFTs averaged over all 13 areas (R = 0.47, NS; figure 21, the number of NFTs in the hippocampal fields and AMG (R = 0.25, NS; figure 2), or the EC (R = 0.05; NS). Among individual areas, the BDS score showed the best correlation with the number of NFTs in association areas 20/21 (R = 0.70, p &lt; 0.05).In two patients with a BDS score 130, NFTs were restricted mainly to EC, CAl/S, and AMG and were rarely found in neocortical areas, whereas individuals with higher (worse) BDS scores had increasing numbers of NFTs in neocortical areas. To assess the possibility that NFTs accumulate initially in the hippocampal formation and AMG and appear in neocortical areas later in the course of634 NEUROLOGY 42 March 1992 the disease, we compared the BDS score with the ratio of NFTs in hippocampal fields and amygdala to NFTs in neocortical areas. This ratio correlated strongly with BDS scores (R = -0.92, p &lt; 0.001; figure 2); as scores increased, so did the number of neocortical NFTs. There were no significant correlations between BDS scores and the number of SPs averaged over all 13 areas (R = 0.15, NS) (figure 31, or with the SP counts in any individual area, or groups of areas. Duration of illness correlated best with the number of NFTs averaged over all 13 areas (R = 0.64, p &lt; 0.05; figure 4), whereas the correlation with NFT counts in hippocampal fields and AMG, and NFT counts in neocortical areas did not reach statistical significance (R = 0.57 and R = 0.53, p &lt; 0.1; figure 4). As with the BDS analyses, the ratio of NFTs in limbic areas to NFTs in neocortical areas decreased significantly with duration of disease (R = -0.69, p &lt; 0.05; figure 4). SP counts averaged over all areas (R = 0.19, NS; figure 3), o r over any area individually or in groups, did not correlate significantly with duration of disease. Discussion. The severity o f dementia correlates with the number of NFTs in neocortical areas and not with SPs.
