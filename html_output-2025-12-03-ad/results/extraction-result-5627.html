                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is demonstrated that cross-encoder re-ranking models trained on ChatGPT responses are statistically significantly more effective zero-shot re-rankers than those trained on human responses, and generative LLMs have high potential in generating training data for neural retrieval models.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We investigate the usefulness of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating training data for cross-encoder re-rankers in a novel direction: generating synthetic documents instead of synthetic queries. We introduce a new dataset, ChatGPT-RetrievalQA, and compare the effectiveness of models fine-tuned on LLM-generated and human-generated data. Data generated with generative LLMs can be used to augment training data, especially in domains with smaller amounts of labeled data. We build ChatGPT-RetrievalQA based on an existing dataset, human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3), consisting of public question collections with human responses and answers from ChatGPT. We fine-tune a range of cross-encoder re-rankers on either human-generated or ChatGPT-generated data. Our evaluation on MS MARCO DEV, TREC DL'19, and TREC DL'20 demonstrates that cross-encoder re-ranking models trained on ChatGPT responses are statistically significantly more effective zero-shot re-rankers than those trained on human responses. In a supervised setting, the human-trained re-rankers outperform the LLM-trained re-rankers. Our novel findings suggest that generative LLMs have high potential in generating training data for neural retrieval models. Further work is needed to determine the effect of factually wrong information in the generated responses and test our findings' generalizability with open-source LLMs. We release our data, code, and cross-encoders checkpoints for future work.</p>

BM25 diagnostics: Table 4 shows BM25 performs much better on ChatGPT-generated responses than on human responses, correlating with higher lexical overlap and length.

Ground truth relevance in supervised experiments: human responses considered as relevant answers.",

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We investigate the usefulness of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating training data for cross-encoder re-rankers in a novel direction: generating synthetic documents instead of synthetic queries. We introduce a new dataset, ChatGPT-RetrievalQA, and compare the effectiveness of models fine-tuned on LLMgenerated and human-generated data. Data generated with generative LLMs can be used to augment training data, especially in domains with smaller amounts of labeled data. We build ChatGPT-RetrievalQA based on an existing dataset, human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3), consisting of public question collections with human responses and answers from ChatGPT. We fine-tune a range of cross-encoder re-rankers on either human-generated or ChatGPTgenerated data. Our evaluation on MS MARCO DEV, TREC DL'19, and TREC DL'20 demonstrates that cross-encoder re-ranking models trained on ChatGPT responses are statistically significantly more effective zero-shot re-rankers than those trained on human responses. In a supervised setting, the human-trained re-rankers outperform the LLM-trained re-rankers. Our novel findings suggest that generative LLMs have high potential in generating training data for neural retrieval models. Further work is needed to determine the effect of factually wrong information in the generated responses and test our findings' generalizability with open-source LLMs. We release our data, code, and cross-encoders checkpoints for future work. ${ }^{1}$</p>
<h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Generative large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 [3] and GPT-3.5 (including ChatGPT) have shown remarkable performance in generating realistic text outputs for a variety of tasks such as summarization [40], machine translation [26], sentiment analysis [32, 36], retrieval interpretability [20], and stance detection [39]. Although ChatGPT can produce impressive answers, it is not immune to errors or hallucinations [12]. Furthermore, the lack of transparency in the source of information generated by ChatGPT can be a bigger concern in domains such as law, medicine, and science, where accountability and trustworthiness are critical [4, 28, 31].</p>

<h2>Mohammad Aliannejadi <br> m.aliannejadi,e.kanoulas <br> University of Amsterdam <br> The Netherlands</h2>
<p>Suzan Verberne<br>s.verberne@liacs.leidenuniv.nl<br>Leiden University<br>The Netherlands</p>
<p>Retrieval models, as opposed to generative models, retrieve the actual (true) information from sources and search engines provide the source of each retrieved item [29]. This is why information retrieval (IR) - even when generative LLMs are available - remains an important application, especially in situations where reliability is vital. One potential purpose of generative LLMs in IR is to generate training data for retrieval models. Data generated with generative LLMs can be used to augment training data, especially in domains with smaller amounts of labeled data. In this paper, we present the ChatGPT-RetrievalQA dataset to address two research questions: RQ1: How does the effectiveness of cross-encoder re-rankers finetuned on ChatGPT-generated responses compare to those finetuned on human-generated responses in both supervised and zeroshot settings?
RQ2: How does the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for generating relevant documents differ between specific and general domains?</p>
<p>By answering these questions, we aim to shed light on the potential of using LLMs for data augmentation in cross-encoder re-rankers and the domain dependency of their effectiveness. As shown in Figure 1, our primary experimental setup involves using $\mathrm{CE}_{\text {ChatGPT }}{ }^{2}$ for inference (i.e., re-ranking task) on human-generated responses.</p>
<p>Our dataset and analysis provide insights into the benefits and limitations of using generative LLMs for augmenting training data for retrieval models.</p>
<p>Our main contributions in this work are three-fold: (i) We release the ChatGPT-RetrievalQA dataset, which is based on the HC3 dataset [13] but is designed specifically for information retrieval tasks in both full-ranking and re-ranking setups. This dataset contains 24,322 queries, 26,882 responses generated by ChatGPT, and 58, 546 human-generated responses. (ii) We fine-tune cross-encoder re-rankers on both the human- and ChatGPT-generated responses, evaluating their performance on our dataset in a supervised setting. We also show the effectiveness of the ChatGPT-trained models in a zero-shot evaluation on the MS MARCO-passage collection and the TREC Deep Learning tracks. (iii) We conduct an analysis of the effectiveness of ChatGPT-trained cross-encoders on different domains and show that human-trained models are slightly more effective in domain-specific tasks, e.g., in the medicine domain. Our novel findings highlight the potential of using generative LLMs</p>

<p>like ChatGPT for generating high-quality responses in information retrieval tasks in order to create training datasets.</p>
<h2>2 RELATED WORK</h2>
<p>InPars [2], Promptagator [8], and InPars-v2 [15] have utilized LLMs to generate synthetic queries given documents. Particularly, InParsv2 [15] achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR dataset in a zeroshot setting by using an open-source language model, GPT-J-6B [33] and a powerful external re-ranker, MonoT5-MSMARCO [24] to filter the top-10k high-quality pairs of synthetic query-document pairs for data augmentation. In contrast, we use documents (passages) generated by ChatGPT given a query - the reverse from InParsv2. Document generation for given queries as a source for data augmentation has not been explored in prior work.</p>
<p>We believe that exploring this reverse direction is important as it allows us to augment training data with a focus on user behavior and query logs rather than the (static) document collection itself. This can improve the effectiveness of re-rankers by augmenting the training data with synthetic documents according to the queries that actual search engine users are searching for, increasing the diversity of the training data, while allowing the rankers to better generalize to new queries.</p>
<p>Guo et al. [13] use public question-answering datasets (see below) and prompt the questions to the ChatGPT user interface for generating answers. The goal of the HC3 dataset is to linguistically compare human and ChatGPT responses and explore the possibility of distinguishing between responses generated by ChatGPT and those written by humans. The HC3 dataset contains questions (i.e., queries) from four different domains: medicine (Medical Dialog [5]), finance (FiQA [22]), Wikipedia (WikiQA [38] and Wiki_csai [13]), and Reddit (ELI5 [11]). While there is no study on generating documents to augment training data, a more recent study, QuerytoDoc [34], generates documents for query expansion, which is out of the scope of augmenting data for information retrieval. Furthermore, there are various recent studies on ChatGPT with a focus on ranking and retrieval but to the best of our knowledge, none of them focus on data augmentation by generating relevant documents. Examples of recent studies are the one by Faggioli et al [10], who study if ChatGPT can be used for generating relevance labels, and Sun et al. [30], who assess whether ChatGPT is good at searching by giving it a query and set of candidate documents and asking for re-ranking.

<p>Figure 1: Our main experimental setup involves above steps.</p>
<h2>3 DATASET</h2>
<p>Our ChatGPT-RetrievalQA dataset is based on the HC3 dataset produced by Guo et al. [13], which contains 24,322 queries and 26, 882 ChatGPT-generated responses, as well as 58, 546 humangenerated responses. There is on average one ChatGPT-generated and 2.4 human-generated response per query. To build the ChatGPTRetrievalQA dataset for retrieval and ranking experiments (an experimental setup different from [13]), we convert the dataset files to a format similar to the MSMarco dataset [23], in both full-ranking and re-ranking setups. ${ }^{3}$ We divide the data into training, validation, and test sets.</p>
<p>To facilitate training, we provide training triples files in TSV format, including both textual and ID-based representations, where the structure of each line is composed of 'query, positive passage, negative passage' and 'qid, positive pid, negative pid'. We consider the actual response by ChatGPT or human as the relevant answer and we randomly sample 1000 negative answers for each query similar to MS MARCO. In addition, we provide the top 1000 documents, ranked by BM25, per query to enable re-ranking studies. Table 1 shows the size of the train, validation, and test sets for each domain.</p>
<h2>4 METHODS</h2>
<h3>4.1 First-stage ranker: BM25</h3>
<p>Lexical retrievers use word overlap to produce the relevance score between a document and a query. Several lexical approaches have been developed in the past, such as vector space models, Okapi BM25 [27], and query likelihood. We use BM25 as the first-stage ranker because of its popularity and effectiveness. BM25 calculates a score for a query-document pair based on the statistics of the</p>

Statistical significance was measured with a paired t-test ( $p&lt;0.05$ ) with Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. The cutoff for MAP, NDCG, and MRR are 1000, 10, and 10.</p>

<h2>5 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN</h2>
<p>Evaluation setup. We conduct our zero-shot evaluation experiments on the MS MARCO-passage collection [23] and the two TREC Deep Learning tracks (TREC-DL'19 and DL'20) [6, 7]. The evaluation metrics used are MAP@1000, NDCG@10, and MRR@10, which are standard for these datasets, to make our results comparable to previously published and upcoming research [6, 7]. The MS MARCO-passage dataset contains about 8.8 million passages (average length: 73.1 words) and about 1 million natural language queries (average length: 7.5 words) and has been extensively used to train deep language models for ranking. Following prior work on MS MARCO [17, 19, 21, 42, 43], we only use the dev set ( $\sim 7 k$ queries) for our empirical evaluation. The TREC DL'19 and DL'20 collections share the passage corpus of MS MARCO and have 43 and 54 queries respectively with much more relevant documents per query. We measure the same metrics in the supervised setting on the test set of ChatGPT-RetrievalQA. The average length of</p>

<p>human responses is 142.5 words, and 198.1 words for ChatGPT in the ChatGPT-RetrievalQA dataset.</p>
<p>Training configuration. We use the Huggingface library [37], and PyTorch [25] for the cross-encoder re-ranking training and inference. Following prior work [14], we use the Adam [18] optimizer with a learning rate of $7 * 10^{-6}$ for all cross-encoder layers, regardless of the number of layers trained. We use a training batch size of 32. For all cross-encoder re-rankers, we use the cross-entropy loss [41]. For the lexical retrieval with BM25, we use the similarity function of Elasticsearch [9]. We cap the query length at 30 tokens and the passage length at 200 tokens following prior work [1, 14].</p>

<p>In the zero-shot setting, the $\operatorname{MiniLM}<em _human="{human" _text="\text">{\text {ChatGPT }}$ consistently outperforms the other cross-encoder re-rankers including $\operatorname{MiniLM}</em>$ and BM25 significantly across the TREC DL'20 and MS MARCO DEV. However, on TREC DL'19, BM25 achieves the highest effectiveness for MAP@1000, MiniLM ChatGPT for NDCG@10, and TinyBERT ChatGPT for MRR@10. Overall, we can see the models fine-tuned on ChatGPT-generated responses are significantly more effective in the zero-shot setting compared to those fine-tuned on human-generated responses.}</p>
<h3>6.2 Domain-level re-ranker effectiveness (RQ2)</h3>
<p>Table 3 shows the effectiveness of $\operatorname{MiniLM}<em _ChatGPT="{ChatGPT" _text="\text">{\text {human }}$ and $\operatorname{MiniLM}</em>}}$ re-rankers in the supervised settings - on the test set of our dataset - across all of the domains including Medicine, Finance, Reddit, and Wikipedia.

<h2>7 DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>Data overlap. It is worth noting that in the supervised setting, the collection of documents used for training and testing is shared for $\mathrm{CE}<em _human="{human" _text="\text">{\text {human }}$ re-rankers. Therefore, some documents may be seen during both training and evaluation. This setup is very common when working with human-assessed data, and similar to the MS MARCO dataset [23]. The shared collection could be a potential benefit for $\mathrm{CE}</em>$ re-rankers in the supervised setting, as the models may have already seen some of the documents during training. To further investigate this hypothesis, it would be worth exploring a different setup in future work in which the collection of documents is completely separated between the training and test sets.}</p>

BM25 is less effective for human-generated responses than for ChatGPT-generated responses on the train and test sets, as evidenced by lower scores for all metrics. We observed the same pattern for the validation set. These results suggest that</p>

<p>the task of retrieving human-generated responses is more challenging for BM25 than for ChatGPT-generated responses. This is probably related to the lexical overlap discussed below.</p>
<p>Queries without label. In Table 5, we investigate a common scenario in real-world search engines where query logs and a collection of human-generated documents are available, and there are not any judged documents for part or all of the query logs. To simulate and analyze this situation, we evaluate $\mathrm{CE}<em _ChatGPT="{ChatGPT" _text="\text">{\text {ChatGPT }}$ on the seen queries of the train set and unseen documents of the humangenerated documents collection. Table 5 shows that $\mathrm{CE}</em>$ is 0.388 and 0.202 for BM25 (see the third row of Table 4). This suggests the potential of augmenting training data with generative LLMs for fine-tuning models to effectively re-rank sourced and reliable human-generated documents from the corpus given the query logs where there are no judged documents for the queries.}}$ rankers are fairly effective in this scenario. Especially, they are more effective than BM25 in the same setup, in that the NDCG@10 for $\operatorname{MiniLM}_{\text {ChatGPT }</p>
<p>Lexical overlap. Our data analysis reveals that ChatGPT-generated responses have a slightly higher lexical overlap than human-generated responses with the queries. The average percentage of query words that occur in ChatGPT-generated responses is $34.6 \%$, compared to $25.5 \%$ for humans. The Q1, median, and Q3 are also on average $7 \%$ points higher for ChatGPT compared to human responses. We suspect that this higher lexical overlap compared to the human response happens because ChatGPT often repeats the question or query in the response, and it tends to generate lengthier responses compared to human which increase the chance of having mutual words with the query. It is noteworthy to mention that lexical overlap is not the best indicator of response quality for fine-tuning effective cross-encoders, as there may be cases where responses with low lexical overlap are still relevant and informative, especially in question-answering tasks.</p>
<h2>8 CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In this paper, we have presented an analysis of the effectiveness of fine-tuning cross-encoders on human-generated responses versus ChatGPT-generated responses. Our results show that the cross$\operatorname{encoder}<em _human="{human" _text="\text">{\text {ChatGPT }}$ is more effective than cross-encoder ${ }</em>$ in the}</p>
<p>zero-shot setting while MinILM human is slightly more effective in the supervised setting and this is consistent across different domains. Furthermore, we show that BM25 is less effective on human-generated responses than on ChatGPT-generated responses, indicating that human-generated responses are more challenging to match with queries than ChatGPT-generated responses. Overall, our findings suggest that ChatGPT-generated responses are more useful than human-generated responses for training effective zero-shot reranker, at least based on our dataset and experiments, and highlight the potential of using generative LLMs for generating effective and useful responses for creating training datasets in natural language processing tasks. Our study can be particularly advantageous for domain-specific tasks where relying on LLM-generated output as a direct response to a user query can be risky. Our results confirm that it is possible to train effective cross-encoder re-rankers by training them on ChatGPT-generated responses even for domainspecific queries. Further work is needed to determine the effect of factually wrong information in the generated responses and to test the generalizability of our findings on open-source LLMs.</p>
