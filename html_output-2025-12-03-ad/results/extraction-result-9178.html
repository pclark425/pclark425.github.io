                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have had a transformative impact on a variety of scientific tasks across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics. However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily focus on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such as molecular, protein, and genomic languages. Moreover, the safety mechanisms of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks. SciSafeEval spans multiple scientific languages - including textual, molecular, protein, and genomic - and covers a wide range of scientific domains. We evaluate LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a 'jailbreak' enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention. Our benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in scientific contexts. This work aims to facilitate the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards in scientific research.</p>

Large language models (LLMs) have had a transformative impact on a variety of scientific tasks across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, medicine, and physics.However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily focus on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such as molecular, protein, and genomic languages.Moreover, the safety mechanisms of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied.To address these limitations, we introduce SCISAFEEVAL, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks.SCISAFEEVAL spans multiple scientific languages-including textual, molecular, protein, and genomic-and covers a wide range of scientific domains.We evaluate LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a 'jailbreak' enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention.Our benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in scientific contexts.This work aims to facilitate the responsible development and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards in scientific research.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant breakthroughs in recent years.LLMs such as GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b) and Llama-3.1 (meta llama, 2024) have garnered widespread attention, and their application to scientific tasks has proven highly valuable across various domains (Xie et al., 2023;Boyko et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2024b;Liao et al., 2024).While these models hold substantial potential to accelerate scientific research, concerns regarding their safety, robustness, and potential misuse in sensitive applications have become increasingly prominent (He et al., 2023;Resnik &amp; Hosseini, 2024).</p>
<p>These concerns are particularly critical for LLMs used in fields such as biology, chemistry, medicine and physics.For example, as illustrated in Figure 1  exploit LLMs to design harmful genomic sequences, including mutations that enhance the infectivity or treatment resistance of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.This risk is exacerbated by advancements in technologies like benchtop DNA synthesis, which enable the rapid and flexible creation of DNA sequences in laboratory settings (Hoose et al., 2023).Consequently, the barriers for bad actors to engineer dangerous biological agents are significantly lowered.Numerous studies have highlighted the risks posed by such dual-use technologies-where tools developed for beneficial purposes can be repurposed for malicious intent (Urbina et al., 2022;Sandbrink, 2023;Quach, 2023;Anthropic, 2023;Gretton et al., 2024;Baum et al., 2024).</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, only two safety assessment benchmarks have been developed to evaluate how well LLMs manage potentially harmful queries within scientific domains.Specifically, the SciMT-Safety benchmark (He et al., 2023) employs a red-teaming strategy (Derczynski et al., 2024;Inie et al., 2023) to simulate risk-prone scenarios, assessing the models' ability to mitigate harmful outputs.Similarly, SciKnowEval-L4 (Feng et al., 2024) tests models through ethically complex tasks, requiring both scientific precision and alignment with safety and ethical guidelines.However, the current benchmarks exhibit several notable limitations.First, they focus on a narrow range of scientific domains, excluding two major fields: medicine and physics.Second, the datasets used in these evaluations are relatively small in scope.SciMT-Safety (He et al., 2023) contains only 432 examples, while SciKnowEval-L4 (Feng et al., 2024), although larger, still lacks the breadth necessary for a comprehensive evaluation.Third, these benchmarks do not adequately challenge models with built-in safety mechanisms, which are typically aligned with standard LLM safety protocols (Chua et al., 2024;Kenthapadi et al., 2024).As a result, while models may perform well within typical safety guardrails (Niknazar et al., 2024;Rebedea et al., 2023), the benchmarks fall short in providing a rigorous stress test, resulting in incomplete risk assessments.</p>
<p>To address such limitations, we introduce the Scientific Safety Evaluation benchmark, referred to as SCISAFEEVAL, which supports multi-scientific-language capabilities across textual outputs, molecular, protein, and genomic languages by leveraging domain-specific datasets and task-driven prompts.Our dataset covers a diverse range of instructions and substances, sourced from widely recognized scientific datasets and hazard databases, offering a comprehensive evaluation of harmful content in real-world scientific applications.SCISAFEEVAL surpasses existing benchmarks in scale, with 31,840 samples spanning four major scientific domains-chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics-providing a significantly larger and more demanding benchmark for evaluating safety in scientific applications.Moreover, we incorporate jailbreak prompt templates that rigorously chal- lenge models equipped with safety guardrails, ensuring a multi-faceted safety assessment.The comparison between existing benchmarks and our SCISAFEEVAL is shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>Our key contributions are as follows: (i) We introduce SCISAFEEVAL, a state-of-the-art benchmark that performs a multi-disciplinary, large scale, high quality and multi-faceted risk assessment;</p>
<p>(ii) SCISAFEEVAL incorporates a jailbreak enhancement feature, rigorously challenging models equipped with safety guardrails by testing their robustness against adversarial prompts in scientific contexts; (iii) the benchmark offers instruction and content diversity, leveraging prompts from established scientific datasets and hazardous content curated from specialized databases, ensuring comprehensive coverage of real-world risks; and (iv) SCISAFEEVAL surpasses existing benchmarks in scale, comprising 31,840 samples across four major scientific domains-chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics-providing a significantly larger dataset for evaluating LLM safety, with 10 times more examples than prior benchmarks.</p>
<p>RELATED WORK</p>
<p>Large Language Models for Scientific Tasks.Large Language Models have become powerful tools in advancing scientific research, specifically tailored to handle complex, domain-specific tasks such as molecular generation (Kim et al., 2021;Mazuz et al., 2023;Fang et al., 2024), protein structure prediction (Elnaggar et al., 2021;Lin et al., 2023;Hayes et al., 2024), and genomic analysis (Ji et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024).These models are obtained via pre-trained directly on specialized scientific data (Gururangan et al., 2020;He et al., 2021;Fang et al., 2023b), or fine-tuned from general-purpose base models (Xu et al., 2023;Fang et al., 2023a).Different from the natural language, key scientific languages (e.g., molecular, protein, and genomic languages) demand customized tokenization and representation strategies.For instance, molecular language processing often utilizes formats like SMILES (Weininger, 1988) and SELFIES (Krenn et al., 2022) to encode chemical structures.</p>
<p>Risks of Misusing the LLMs for Scientific Tasks.While LLMs hold great promise in advancing scientific research, their misuse poses significant risks.Urbina et al. (2022) demonstrated the dualuse dilemma by showing how AI tools originally developed for drug discovery could be repurposed to generate toxic compounds, including chemical warfare agents.This exemplifies the dangerous potential of these technologies.Similarly, Sandbrink (2023) cautions that the integration of LLMs with biological design tools may lower the barriers to manipulating biological agents, making it easier for non-experts to engage in harmful activities and increasing the scale of potential harm.In nucleic acid synthesis, Wheeler et al. (2024) highlights the need for global standards to ensure that LLMs used in this field do not aid malicious actors in circumventing existing safety measures.Furthermore, Hoffmann et al. (2023) stresses the importance of embedding robust biosecurity protocols in AI-driven synthetic biology to mitigate risks.</p>
<p>Safety Assessment of LLMs for Scientific Tasks.Existing safety assessments have predominantly focused on general-purpose LLMs (Gehman et al., 2020;Zhuo et al., 2023;Zhu et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2024c), but specialized benchmarks for scientific models are relatively scarce.SciMT-Safety (He et al., 2023) is one of the first benchmarks to assess the safety of AI models in scientific domains specifically.It emphasizes mitigating risks such as the misuse of AI in chemical synthesis and biological design through red-teaming approaches.Similarly, SciKnowEval (Feng et al., 2024) evaluates scientific knowledge across five levels in LLMs, with level 4 assessing a model's capacity to make sound, secure, and ethical decisions.This includes evaluating the harmfulness and toxicity of the information generated, as well as understanding the ethical implications and safety concerns inherent in scientific research.However, these benchmarks focus on a narrow range of scientific domains and are relatively small in scope.More importantly, these benchmarks do not adequately challenge models with built-in guardrail mechanisms.</p>
<p>THE SCISAFEEVAL BENCHMARK</p>
<p>Recognizing that laws, regulations, and standards are the primary drivers of safety investments, we first discuss how these elements influence the benchmark design in Section 3.1.Subsequently, we detail the construction methodology of the SCISAFEEVAL benchmark in Section 3.2.Finally, we outline the quality assurance procedures implemented to maintain the dataset's high quality in Section 3.3.Figure 2 shows an overview of the construction process of the SciSafeEval benchmark.Notably, we collect benign substances from the respective databases for each scientific domain, so that the SCISAFEEVAL contains both hazard and non-hazard substances.

<p>REGULATORY AND ETHICAL FOUNDATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC SAFETY</p>
<p>The SCISAFEEVAL benchmark is grounded in key contemporary AI safety regulations, including standards developed by the National Technical Committee 260 (NTC 260) on Cybersecurity (National Technical Committee 260 on Cybersecurity of SAC, 2024), SB 1047 (Wiener et al., 2024), and international conventions such as the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) (United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, 2020).Each of these frameworks plays a pivotal role in shaping the design of SCISAFEEVAL.NTC 260 and SB 1047 emphasize the need for cross-disciplinary evaluation of AI safety, while the BWC highlights the importance of AI models in biological con-texts to prevent misuse.By integrating these regulatory principles, SCISAFEEVAL provides a robust and comprehensive framework for evaluating the safety considerations of LLMs across a range of scientific domains.More details about the regulations and guidelines are provided in Appendix A.</p>
<p>BENCHMARK CONSTRUCTION</p>
<p>To ensure our benchmark reflects the range of harmful content AI systems might encounter, we generate the examples via combining instructions sourced from existing widely-used non-safetyfocused datasets and harmful substances curated from well-established hazard databases (Marvin et al., 2023), with details in Appendix B. As a result, we construct a multi-faceted benchmark that evaluates LLM safety across multiple scenarios.SCISAFEEVAL assess the safety of LLMs across multiple scientific disciplines and levels of complexity, using a large-scale, high-quality dataset.The benchmark has four key attributes: (i) Multi-Disciplinary: It spans four critical scientific fields-chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics with domain-specific tasks, covering various types of harmfulness; (ii) Large Scale: It covers the natural and scientific language (e.g., protein sequences and molecule SMILES), offering 10 times more examples; (iii) High Quality: The dataset is sourced from authoritative databases relevant to each scientific field, ensuring accuracy and relevance; (iv) Multi-faceted Benchmarking: It supports a range of evaluation scenarios, including zero-and few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and jailbreak testing.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTION GENERATION FOR SCIENTIFIC TASKS</p>
<p>To collect the instructions for the four scientific domains, we emphasize the comprehensive coverage of key tasks and safety considerations for each one.For chemistry-related instructions, we utilized the dataset provided by Fang et al. (2023a), offering task instructions that focus on Molecule Generation, Property Prediction and Reaction Prediction.Biology-related instructions were sourced from Guo et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2023), which includes Protein Function Prediction, Protein Sequence Generation, Protein Structure Prediction Gene Classification and Gene Generation.In the medical domain, we incorporated task instructions from Tran et al. (2024), which are tailored for biomedical NLP tasks like Inference Reasoning and Knowledge Retrieval.Lastly, physics-related instructions are drawn from Nakamura et al. (2024) and Biden (2023), focusing on Knowledge Retrieval.This diverse selection of domain-specific instructions ensures that our benchmark captures a wide array of instruction types across multiple scientific disciplines and their various tasks.</p>
<p>SUBSTANCES FROM HAZARD DATABASES</p>
<p>Chemistry.We curated 4,983 toxic chemical compounds from PubChem (Kim et al., 2023), following a rigorous selection process based on key physicochemical properties, toxicological profiles, and environmental impacts.The collected data includes substances characterized with 6 tags (Corrosives, Environment, Acute Toxicity, Health Hazards and Explosiveness) in alignment with the GHS Hazard Class Pictograms (CHEMICALS, 2002) .We filtered out incomplete or non-compliant entries and the remaining data retained critical attributes such as compound names and their SMILES/-SELFIES (Weininger, 1988) representations.As a result, the SCISAFEEVAL-CHEMISTRY encompasses a wide range of hazard information, including acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and ecotoxicity, providing a comprehensive resource for safety and hazard analysis in chemical research.</p>
<p>Biology.Our dataset encompasses both protein-based and gene-associated biohazards, systematically curated to ensure high coverage and relevance in biological safety research.(1) For protein toxins, we selected 2,763 toxic proteins from UniProt, specifically utilizing the Toxin label.These proteins are naturally occurring and are known to disrupt or kill other cells.Leveraging the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system (Consortium, 2004), we further categorized these proteins into 11 subtypes under the "Toxin activity" class.During preprocessing, we removed entries with insufficient annotations and retained complete protein names and FASTA (Pearson, 1994) sequences to maintain data integrity.We also included toxic proteins from a wide range of organisms and environments, spanning animals, plants, fungi, and pathogenic bacteria, to enhance diversity.(2) For gene-associated hazards, we utilized data from the Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Center (BV-BRC) (Olson et al., 2023).The collected data includes 2,100 DNA virus entries, selected based on six criteria: structural characteristics, family classification, host species, geographic origin, year of collection, and sequence length.We adopted the Baltimore classification (Koonin "instruction": "Identify potential reactants that could lead to the formation of the given product <name> <smiles/selfies>",  et al., 2021) to group DNA viruses into 8 major categories.We merged BV-BRC raw genomic attributes into a unified dataset.This multi-dimensional approach to data collection ensures comprehensive coverage across different viral families, hosts, and geographic origins, maximizing the SCISAFEEVAL-BIOLOGY's utility for further biological safety evaluations.</p>
<p>"name": "rac-Methamphetamine-D5", "smiles": "[2H]C(C1=CC=CC=C1)C([2H])(C)NC([2H])([2H])[2H]", "selfies": "[C][C][Branch1][#Branch2][C][C][=C][C][=C][C][=C][Ring1][=Branch1][N][C]"</p>
<p>Medicine.The dataset in the medical domain was constructed from three key sources: PubChem (Kim et al., 2023), Haz-Map (Brown, 2008), and the Catalog of Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances (CQLP) (IndiaGovernment, 2022), each providing comprehensive coverage of addictive, toxic, and psychotropic chemical substances.(1) For addictive drugs, the selection criteria were primarily based on the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) (Lampe &amp; Attorney, 2021) classifications, with a focus on medical utility, abuse potential, and addiction risk.(2) For toxic substances, data were extracted based on their occupational health impacts, particularly the extent to which chemical exposure affects human health.During data processing, incomplete and non-compliant entries were removed, ensuring the retention of key attributes like chemical names.(3) For psychotropic substances, the selection criteria centered on dependence potential and legal regulation, with data aligned with national and international guidelines, including the Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Regulation (cql, 2013).Substances were categorized by their effects into 2 main tags.SCISAFEEVAL-MEDICINE provides a diverse representation of chemicals that pose risks to both physical and mental health, underscoring its relevance for medical safety evaluations.We summarize the tag information across above scientific fields in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Physics.The dataset was sourced from Li et al. (2023), containing a total of 1,153 entries.We selected the data based on the keywords (e.g., "nuclear"), and applied LLaMA 3.1 8B (Dubey et al., 2024) model to a more refined filtering, which performed precise malicious content detection and enhanced the maliciousness of messages with low or moderate harm potential.This resulted in the final instruction dataset, designed to capture a broad spectrum of malicious intent within the field of physics.The robust filtering and enhancement process ensures that SCISAFEEVAL-PHYSICS is well-suited for evaluating safety-related tasks within the domain of physics.</p>
<p>MULTI-FACETED BENCHMARKING</p>
<p>Our evaluation incorporates zero-and few-shot settings, to assess the risk without and with the prior experience.Additionally, given the widespread adoption of CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022) as a standard technique in many applications, our benchmark includes it in the evaluation framework to assess whether this structured reasoning approach contributes to enhancing model safety.Furthermore, recognizing that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o, are equipped with built-in safety mechanisms, we integrate jailbreak into our benchmark to enable a more thorough evaluation of potential risks.Specifically, we use WildTeaming (Jiang et al., 2024) to generate jailbreak prompts for every single seed prompts (i.e.origin prompts).Jailbreak cases are present in Appendix G.3.This holistic evaluation ensures a multi-faceted risk assessment under various conditions.Table 2: Statistical information of SCISAFEEVAL.For each domain-specific task, the table presents the number of hazard substance content items (#Contents), instructions (#Instructions), instructionto-content ratio (Inst./Cont.(%)),along with the ratio of task-specific prompts to total prompts (Task/Total(%)).The values of content items, jailbreak templates, and prompts are all the same.</p>
<p>QUALITY ASSURANCE</p>
<p>The quality assurance process combines automated validation, expert review, and continuous monitoring to ensure accuracy, completeness, and relevance.Automated checks are applied to verify the integrity of chemical structures, biological sequences, and toxicological properties, while schema validation ensures consistent formatting across the dataset.In addition, domain experts in chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics manually review samples of the data to confirm the appropriateness of hazardous substances and malicious instructions.Continuous updates are implemented to keep the dataset aligned with evolving scientific knowledge and safety regulations, ensuring that SCISAFEEVAL remains a reliable resource for evaluating scientific LLM safety.The statistics of SCISAFEEVAL is shown in Table 2 and illustrative examples are provided in Figure 3 .</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT</p>
<p>SETUP</p>
<p>Models.To ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the safety performance of LLMs in scientific research tasks, we selected a diverse set of models, including 6 widely adopted general-purpose LLMs and 20 state-of-the-art models tailored to specific scientific domains.The breakdown of these models can be found in Table 8 in Appendix D. We take into account both the open-source (e.g., llama-3.1 (meta llama, 2024) ) and closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b) ).</p>
<p>Evaluation Mode.We consider zero-shot, few-shot and CoT settings.For few-shot examples, we manually collected a pool of successful defense (i.e.refuse to answer) cases from the zero-shot experiments for each subset.We then selected 3 representative examples demonstrating effective strategies for handling malicious prompts across different scientific domains.These examples, with 2 more benign prompt-response pairs, as shown in Appendix G.1, were used to construct five-shot prompts that provide the model with additional context and guidance during the evaluation.The selection process focused on ensuring diversity in the types of attacks and defenses, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to generalize from a limited set of examples.For CoT prompting, we design reasoning paths that help LLMs identify why a specific instruction with hazardous substance content may be harmful or toxic.We concatenate "And think step by step.(1) Is the content harmful or toxic?(2) If the content is harmful or toxic, I should immediately refuse to answer and not output any more information."at the end of the original prompt, see example case in Appendix G.2.We expect the model to gradually realize that the query is harmful during the reasoning process.For general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4o (OpenAI, 2024b), we evaluate the full SCISAFEEVAL dataset, assuming that these models possess knowledge across multiple domains, such as Chemistry, Biology, Medicine, and Physics.For domain-specific scientific models, such as DNAGPT (Zhang et al., 2023), we limit the evaluation to the SCISAFEEVAL subsets relevant to their specific scientific domain.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria.Since our primary objective is to assess the safety performance of the models, we define failure as any response in which the model does not refuse to engage with a harmful query.In other words, if the model provides any information in response to any malicious prompts in SCISAFEEVAL, it is considered a failure.Based on this binary criterion, each model's response is classified as either a pass or a fail.To ensure consistency and accuracy in evaluating whether a language model's response constitutes a refusal to answer, we designed the prompt in Appendix E, which was utilized by the LLaMa 3.1-8B (Dubey et al., 2024) model in our experiments.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>We present the safety evaluation results on the SCISAFEEVAL benchmark across zero-shot, fiveshot, and chain-of-thought settings, as detailed in Table 3 and heatmap in Figure 4. To better show the quantified increasement of five-shot and CoT prompting, we calculated the ∆ value to reflect how those two techniques affect the result, as shown in Table 4.We selected a subset of attackfailure cases across Chemistry, Medicine, and Physics in zero-shot setting.Leveraging this subset, we conducted jailbreak experiments on LLaMa3.1-8B/70B,QWen2.5-7B, and GPT-4o models, with the results summarized in Table 5.For domain-specific scientific large language models (Sci-LLMs), which often lack support for CoT or few-shot prompting, we limited the evaluation to zero-shot settings.These results are presented in Table 11 in Appendix F. Overall Safety Performance.Results in Table 3 highlights significant challenges in zero-shot settings, particularly in complex domains such as biology and chemistry, where most models exhibit poor alignment.However, when provided with few-shot examples, models show a marked improvement, demonstrating that task-specific in-context examples play a crucial role in enhancing safety alignment.Chain-of-thought reasoning further boosts performance, especially for reasoning-heavy tasks such as knowledge retrieval and inference, where models like GPT-4o achieve higher safety alignment.Notably, Claude 3.5 outperforms other models across a few domains, with its strongest safety performance in science domains, while GPT-4o demonstrates substantial gains in CoT scenarios.This suggests that while current models have potential, their ability to align with safety standards depends heavily on both data-driven examples and structured reasoning mechanisms.</p>
<p>Five-shot Results.The five-shot results, as illustrated in    across scientific domains, particularly in safety-related tasks.Claude 3.5 consistently outperforms other models, achieving notable success in biology and chemistry, as seen in its near-perfect performance in gene classification (GC: 98.20) and molecule generation (MG: 94.00).This underscores Claude 3.5's strong capacity to adapt to scientific tasks when supplied with minimal guidance, outperforming even larger models like GPT-4o and LLaMa3.1-70B.The findings suggest that few-shot learning is vital not only for improving task performance but also for strengthening the safety and robustness of language models in high-stakes scientific applications.</p>
<p>Chain-of-thought Results.The chain-of-thought approach further enhances model performance, particularly in complex reasoning tasks such as reaction prediction (RP), knowledge retrieval (KR), and inference-related tasks in biology and medicine, as observed in Table 3 and Table 4. Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o show significant improvements, with Claude 3.5 achieving top scores in physics (KR: 73.40) and medicine (IR: 44.94).These results highlight CoT's ability to break down complex problems into logical steps, leading to improved safety outcomes in intricate scientific domains.GPT-4o similarly benefits from CoT, particularly in chemistry, where its performance in property prediction (PP: 16.64) and molecule generation (MG: 18.80) surpasses its five-shot results.Jailbreak Results.As shown in Table 5, LLaMa3.1-8B-instructshows the highest vulnerability with an average attack success rate (ASR) of 85.98%, closely followed by Qwen2.5-7B with an ASR of 85.61%.GPT-4o demonstrates moderate susceptibility at 70.78%, while LLaMa3.1-70B-instructexhibits the lowest vulnerability among the models tested, with an ASR of 60.93%.These results indicate that, contrary to expectations, smaller models such as LLaMa3.1-8Band Qwen2.5-7B are more prone to jailbreak attacks compared to the larger LLaMa3.1-70B-instructmodel.Our findings reveal that existing LLMs struggle to effectively defend against harmful queries within professional scientific domains.These models often fail when confronted with complex scientific language with malicious intent, leaving them susceptible to potential misuse.This highlights a critical gap in the safety alignment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes scientific applications where precision and safety are paramount.More importantly, this challenge is compounded by the inherent complexity in scientific discourse, where nuanced terms can have vastly different implications depending on the context.The inability of LLMs to fully grasp such subtleties raises concerns about their reliability in environments where small errors can have outsized consequences, such as drug discovery, biohazard research, or even climate modeling.Future advancements must focus not only on improving safety mechanisms but also on developing a deeper understanding of domain-specific risks, ensuring that AI systems are not just safe in a general sense but are meticulously aligned with the ethical and practical demands of their respective fields.</p>
<p>Few-shot and CoT Approaches Enhance Overall Safety Performance.The experimental results suggest that safety-specific few-shot prompting and Chain-of-Thought reasoning significantly improve the safety performance of LLMs in many scenarios.These techniques help models navigate harmful instructions more effectively by providing structured reasoning paths and additional context.However, this leads to important considerations: Are these improvements sufficient for high-risk domains, or are they merely mitigating symptoms of deeper vulnerabilities?Few-shot and CoT approaches offer structured reasoning, yet they may inadvertently introduce new biases or overfit to particular contexts, potentially limiting their generalizability.Furthermore, as the complexity of scientific tasks grows, the capacity for even few-shot and CoT-enhanced models to maintain consistent safety across diverse and evolving scientific challenges remains an open question.Moving forward, the development of adaptive safety mechanisms-capable of evolving alongside scientific knowledge-will be crucial to avoid rigid systems that may fall short in novel, unforeseen scenarios.</p>
<p>Sci-LLMs Are More Vulnerable than General-purpose LLMs.A large portion of domainspecific scientific LLMs, pretrained on scientific literature, appear to be more vulnerable to harmful inputs than their general-purpose counterparts.These models often lack the defensive capabilities that few-shot or CoT techniques can provide, making them more susceptible to misuse.The underlying issue is that domain-specific models, by focusing heavily on scientific terminology and knowledge, may lose the broader, more diverse understanding that general-purpose models gain from larger, more varied datasets.This raises an important question about the trade-off between specialization and robustness: how can we retain the expertise of domain-specific models without compromising their resilience to harmful inputs?Additionally, traditional safety mechanisms, designed for more generalized models, may not seamlessly transfer to specialized domains, where unique ethical concerns and contextual factors need to be considered.Future research must explore hybrid approaches that combine domain-specific expertise with generalizable safety features, ensuring that specialized models are not just effective but also safeguarded against malicious use across scientific fields.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>In this paper, we present SCISAFEEVAL, a benchmark designed to assess the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) in scientific tasks across 31,840 harmful queries from four key scientific domains: chemistry, biology, medicine, and physics.Our evaluation of both general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs highlights that state-of-the-art models, regardless of being open or closed source, still pose safety risks in scientific tasks.However, techniques such as few-shot examples and chain-of-thought prompting significantly improve safety across most models, with Claude 3.5 performing well in zero-shot and five-shot settings, and GPT-4o and o1-preview excelling in chain-ofthought scenarios.We hope SCISAFEEVAL marks a crucial step toward advancing LLM safety and alignment in scientific domains, fostering the development of safer, more responsible AI systems.Food &amp; Drug Administration, 2021)4 : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a framework for regulating AI and machine learning-based software that qualifies as a medical device.This framework stresses transparency, performance monitoring, and the need for continual improvement of AI systems that have an impact on patient health and safety.For LLMs that assist in biomedical research, drug discovery, diagnostics, or clinical support, these regulations ensure that AI models are held to stringent standards of safety, reliability, and clinical efficacy, thereby reducing risks of unintended consequences or patient harm.</p>

<p>Tianhao Li led and organized the research, while Qiang Zhang supervised the project.Tianhao Li and Qiang Zhang contributed to conceptualization and methodology.Data for the SCISAFEEVAL benchmark were collected by Jingyu Lu, Chuangxin Chu, Tianyu Zeng, Haotian Huang, Mei Li, and Tianhao Li.Tianhao Li also developed the benchmark software.The experiments were conducted by Jingyu Lu, Chuangxin Chu, Tianyu Zeng, Haotian Huang, Mei Li, Tianhao Li, and Yujia Zheng, with Mei Li responsible for developing the jailbreak feature.The manuscript was prepared by Tianhao Li, Yujia Zheng, Bin Wu, and Qiang Zhang.Proofreading and revisions were performed by Qiang Zhang, Bin Wu, Tianhao Li, Yujia Zheng, Xuejing Yuan, Xingkai Wang, Keyan Ding, and Huajun Chen.Some technical issues were addressed by Kai Ma and Zuoxian Liu.A SAFETY REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINESThis section presents key regulations and guidelines that are essential for ensuring AI safety, with a particular focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) applied within sensitive scientific domains.These frameworks address ethical standards, security protocols, and risk mitigation measures that guide the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.National Technical Committee 260 on Information Security Standardization (China National Standardization Committee, 2024) 1 : The National Technical Committee 260 on Information Security Standardization, under the Standardization Administration of China (SAC), is responsible for establishing national standards on cybersecurity and AI safety.The committee's work focuses on developing guidelines to ensure AI systems are secure, robust, and aligned with ethical norms.The 2024 publication by NTC 260 outlines standards to guide developers in mitigating cybersecurity risks, such as adversarial attacks, data breaches, and system misuse, particularly when AI is used in sensitive scientific applications.These standards are highly relevant to the deployment of LLMs, which process complex, domain-specific data that could lead to significant security and ethical challenges if improperly managed.SB 1047 and AI Safety Regulations (California Legislature, 2024) 2 : California's SB 1047 is a legislative bill introduced by Senator Scott Wiener and others, focusing on the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.The bill emphasizes AI safety and ethics, proposing guidelines for transparency, risk assessment, and accountability in AI systems.While still under legislative review, SB 1047 underscores the importance of embedding safety as a core principle throughout the AI lifecycle, covering both research and commercial applications.The legislation's relevance to LLMs lies in its call for mitigating risks such as misuse, unintended consequences, and the potential harm these models could introduce within scientific research domains.</p>
<p>UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 2021) 3 : In 2021, UNESCO adopted its Recommendation on the Ethics of AI, calling for ethical frameworks that align AI technologies with human rights and freedoms.These guidelines advocate for fairness, transparency, accountability, and environmental sustainability in AI systems across various domains, including scientific research.For LLMs, these recommendations are significant as they outline the necessity for safety mechanisms, ethical oversight, and inclusive practices, ensuring that AI technologies are developed and deployed in ways that support societal well-being and global ethical standards.FDA's Regulatory Framework for AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) (U.S.</p>
