<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>The overarching goal of scientific research is to find ways to cure, prevent, and manage all diseases. With the proliferation of high-throughput biotechnological techniques (Karczewski \&amp; Snyder 2018) and advances in the digitization of health information (Abul-Husn \&amp; Kenny 2019), machine learning provides a promising approach to expedite the discovery and development of safe and effective treatments. Getting a drug to market currently takes 13-15 years and between US $\$ 2$ billion and $\$ 3$ billion on average, and the costs are going up (Pushpakom et al. 2019). Further, the number of drugs approved every year per dollar spent on development has remained flat or decreased for most of the past decade (Pushpakom et al. 2019, Nosengo 2016). Faced with skyrocketing costs for developing new drugs and long, expensive processes with a high risk of failure, researchers are looking at ways to accelerate all aspects of drug development. Machine learning has already proved useful in the search of antibiotics (Stokes et al. 2020), polypharmacy (Zitnik, Agrawal \&amp; Leskovec 2018), drug repurposing for emerging diseases (Gysi et al. 2020), protein folding and design (Jumper et al. 2020, Gao et al. 2020), and biomolecular interactions (Zitnik et al. 2015, Agrawal et al. 2018, Huang, Xiao, Glass, Zitnik \&amp; Sun 2020, Gainza et al. 2020).
Despite the initial success, the attention of the machine learning scientists to therapeutics remains relatively limited, compared to areas such as natural language processing and computer vision, even though therapeutics offer many hard algorithmic problems and applications of immense impact. We posit that is due to the following key challenges: (1) The lack of AI-ready datasets and standardized knowledge representations prevent scientists from formulating relevant therapeutic questions as solvable machine-learning tasks-the challenge is how to computationally operationalize these data to make them amenable to learning; (2) Datasets are of many different types, including experimental readouts, curated annotations and metadata, and are scattered around the biorepositories-the challenge for non-domain experts is how to identify, process, and curate datasets relevant to a task of interest; and (3) Despite promising performance of models, their use in practice, such as for rare diseases and novel drugs in development, is hindered-the challenge is how to assess algorithmic advances in a manner that allows for robust and fair model comparison and represents what one would expect in a real-world deployment or clinical implementation.</p>
<p>Present work. To address the above challenges, we introduce Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC), a first of its kind platform to systematically access and evaluate machine learning across the entire range of therapeutics (Figure 1). TDC provides AI-ready datasets and learning tasks, together with an ecosystem of tools, libraries, leaderboards, and community resources. To date, TDC contains 66 datasets (Table 2) spread across 22 learning tasks, 23 strategies for systematic model evaluation and comparison, 17 molecule generation oracles, and 33 data processors, including 5 types of data splits. Datasets in TDC are diverse and cover a range of therapeutic products (e.g., small molecules, biologics, and gene editing) across the entire range of drug development (i.e., target identification, hit discovery, lead optimization, and manufacturing). We develop a Python package that implements all functionality and can efficiently retrieve any TDC dataset. Finally, TDC has 29 leaderboards, each with carefully designed train, validation, and test split to support systematic model comparison and evaluation and test the extent to which model performance indicate utility in the real-world.
Datasets and tasks in TDC are challenging for prevailing machine learning methods. To this end, we rigorously evaluate 21 domain-specific and state-of-the-art methods across 24 TDC benchmarks (Section 10): (1) a group of 22 ADMET benchmarks are designed to predict properties of small molecules-it is a graph representation learning problem; (2) the DTI-DG benchmark is designed to predict drug-target binding affinity using a patent temporal split—it is a domain generalization problem; (3) the docking benchmark is designed to generate novel molecules with high docking scores in limited resources-it is a low-resource generative modeling problem. We find that theoretic domain-specific methods often have better or comparable performance with state-of-the-art models, indicating urgent need for rigorous model evaluation and an ample opportunity for</p>

TDC is a platform with AI-ready datasets and learning tasks for therapeutics, spanning the discovery and development of safe and effective medicines. TDC provides an ecosystem of tools and data functions, including strategies for systematic model evaluation, meaningful data splits, data processors, and molecule generation oracles. All resources are integrated and accessible via a Python package. TDC also provides community resources with extensive documentation and tutorials, and leaderboards for systematic model comparison and evaluation.
algorithmic innovation.
Finally, datasets and benchmarks in TDC lend themselves to the study of the following open questions in machine learning and can serve as a testbed for a variety of algorithmic approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-resource learning: Prevailing methods require abundant label information. However, labeled examples are typically scarce in drug development and discovery, considerably limiting the methods' use for problems that require reasoning about new phenomena, such as novel drugs in development, emerging pathogens, and therapies for rare-disease patients.</li>
<li>Multi-modal and knowledge graph learning: Objects in TDC have diverse representations and assume various data modalities, including graphs, tensors/grids, sequences, and spatiotemporal objects.</li>
<li>Distribution shifts: Objects (e.g., compounds, proteins) can change their behavior quickly across</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<h1>Facilitate algorithmic and scientific advance in therapeutics</h1>
<p>Figure 2: Therapeutics Machine Learning. Therapeutics machine learning offers incredible opportunities for expansion, innovation, and impact. Datasets and benchmarks in TDC provide a systematic model development and evaluation framework. We envision that TDC can considerably accelerate development, validation, and transition of machine learning into production and clinical implementation.
biological context (e.g., patients, tissues, cells), meaning that models need accommodate underlying distribution shifts and have robust generalizable performance on previously unseen data points.</p>
<ul>
<li>Causal inference: TDC contains datasets that quantify response of patients, molecules and cells to different kinds of perturbations, such as treatment, CRISPR gene over-expression, and knockdown perturbations. Observing how and when a cellular, molecular or patient phenotype is altered can provide clues about the underlying mechanisms involved in perturbation and, ultimately, disease. Such datasets represent a natural testbed for causal inference methods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Facilitating algorithmic and scientific advance in the broad area of therapeutics. We envision TDC to be the meeting point between domain scientists and ML scientists (Figure 2). Domain scientists can pose learning tasks and identify relevant datasets that are carefully processed and integrated into the TDC and formulated as a scientifically valid learning tasks. ML scientists can then rapidly obtain these tasks and ML-ready datasets through the TDC programming framework and use them to design powerful ML methods. Predictions and other outputs produced by ML models can then facilitate algorithmic and scientific advances in therapeutics. To this end, we strive to make datasets and tasks in TDC representative of real-world therapeutics discovery and development. We further provide realistic data splits, evaluation metrics, and performance leaderboards.</p>
<p>Organization of this manuscript. This manuscript is organized as follows. We proceed with a brief review of biomedical and chemical data repositories, machine learning benchmarks and infrastructure (Section 2). We then give an overview of TDC (Section 3) and describe its tiered structure and modular design (Section 4). In Sections 5-7, we provide details for each task in TDC, including the formulation, the level of generalization required for transition into production and clinical implementation, description of therapeutic products and pipeline, and the broader impact of each task. For each task, we also describe a collection of datasets included in TDC. Next, in Sections 8-9, we overview TDC's ecosystem of tools, libraries, leaderboards, and community resources. Finally, we conclude with a discussion and directions for future work (Section 11).</p>
<h1>2 Related Work</h1>
<p>TDC is the first unifying platform of datasets and learning tasks for drug discovery and development. We briefly review how TDC relates to data collections, benchmarks, and toolboxes in other areas.</p>
<p>Relation to biomedical and chemical data repositories. There is a myriad of databases with therapeutically relevant information. For example, BindingDB (Liu et al. 2007) curates binding affinity data, ChEMBL (Mendez et al. 2019) curates bioassay data, THPdb (Usmani et al. 2017) and TTD (Wang et al. 2020) record information on therapeutic targets, and BioSNAP Datasets (Zitnik, Sosic \&amp; Leskovec 2018) contains biological networks. While these biorepositories are important for data deposition and re-use, they do not contain AI-ready datasets (e.g., well-annotated metadata, requisite sample size, and granularity, provenance, multimodal data dynamics, and curation needs), meaning that extensive domain expertise is needed to process the them and construct datasets that can be used for machine learning.</p>
<p>Relation to ML benchmarks. Benchmarks have a critical role in facilitating progress in machine learning (e.g., ImageNet (Deng et al. 2009), Open Graph Benchmark (Hu, Fey, Zitnik, Dong, Ren, Liu, Catasta \&amp; Leskovec 2020), SuperGLUE (Wang et al. 2019)). More related to us, MoleculeNet (Wu et al. 2018) provides datasets for molecular modeling and TAPE (Rao et al. 2019) provides five tasks for protein transfer learning. In contrast, TDC broadly covers modalities relevant to therapeutics, including compounds, proteins, biomolecular interactions, genomic sequences, disease taxonomies, regulatory and clinical datasets. Further, while MoleculeNet and TAPE aim to advance representation learning for compounds and proteins, TDC focuses on drug discovery and development.</p>
<p>Relation to therapeutics ML tools. Many open-science tools exist for biomedical machine learning. Notably, DeepChem (Ramsundar et al. 2019) implements models for molecular machine learning; DeepPurpose (Huang, Fu, Glass, Zitnik, Xiao \&amp; Sun 2020) is a framework for compound and protein modeling; OpenChem (Korshunova et al. 2021) and ChemML (Haghighatlari et al. 2020) also provide models for drug discovery tasks. In contrast, TDC is not a model-driven framework; instead, it provides datasets and formulates learning tasks. Further, TDC provides tools and resources (Section 8) for model development, evaluation, and comparison.</p>
<h2>3 Overview of TDC</h2>
<p>TDC has three major components: a collection of datasets each with a formulations of a meaningful learning task; a comprehensive set of tools and community resources to support data processing, model development, validation, and evaluation; and a collection of leaderboards to support fair model comparison and benchmarking. The programmatic access is provided through the TDC Python package (Section 9). We proceed with a brief overview of each TDC's component.
1) AI-ready datasets and learning tasks. At its core, TDC collects ML tasks and associated datasets spread across therapeutic domains. These tasks and datasets have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instrumenting disease treatment from bench to bedside with ML: TDC covers a variety of learning tasks going from wet-lab target identification to biomedical product manufacturing.</li>
<li>Building off the latest biotechnological platforms: TDC is regularly updated with novel datasets and tasks, such as antibody therapeutics and gene editing.</li>
<li>Providing ML-ready datasets: TDC datasets provide rich representations of biomedical entities. The feature information is carefully curated and processed.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Tools and community resources. TDC includes numerous data functions that can be readily used with any TDC dataset. To date, TDC's programmatic functionality can be organized into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>23 strategies for model evaluation: TDC implements a series of metrics and performance functions to debug models, evaluate model performance for any task in TDC, and assess whether model predictions generalize to out-of-distribution datasets.</li>
<li>5 types of dataset splits: TDC implements data splits that reflect real-world learning settings, including random split, scaffold split, cold-start split, temporal split, and combination split.</li>
<li>17 molecule generation oracles: Molecular design tasks require oracle functions to measure the quality of generated entities. TDC implements 17 molecule generation oracles, representing the most comprehensive collection of molecule oracles, each tailored to measure the quality of generated molecules in a specific dimension.</li>
<li>11 data processing functions: Datasets cover a range of modalities, each requiring distinct data processing. TDC provides functions for data format conversion, visualization, binarization, data balancing, unit conversion, database querying, molecule filtering, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Leaderboards. TDC provides leaderboards for systematic model evaluation and comparison. For a model to be useful for a particular therapeutic question, it needs to perform well across multiple related datasets and tasks. For this reason, we group individual benchmarks in TDC into meaningful groups, which we refer to as benchmark groups. Datasets and tasks in a benchmark group are carefully selected and centered around a particular therapeutic question. Dataset splits and evaluation metrics are also carefully selected to indicate challenges of real-world implementation. The current release of TDC has 29 leaderboards $(29=22+5+1+1$; see Figure 1). Section 10 describes a subset of 24 selected leaderboards and presents extensive empirical results.</p>
<h1>4 Organization of TDC</h1>
<p>Next, we describe the modular design and organization of datasets and learning tasks in TDC.</p>
<h3>4.1 Tiered and Modular Design</h3>
<p>TDC has a unique three-tier hierarchical structure, which to our knowledge, is the first attempt at systematically organizing machine learning for therapeutics (Figure 3). We organize TDC into three distinct problems. For each problem, we provide a collection of learning tasks. Finally, for each task, we provide a series of datasets. In the first tier, we identify three broad machine learning problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single-instance prediction single_pred: Predictions about individual biomedical entities.</li>
<li>Multi-instance prediction multi_pred: Predictions about multiple biomedical entities.</li>
<li>Generation generation: Generation of biomedical entities with desirable properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second tier, TDC is organized into learning tasks. TDC currently includes 22 learning tasks, covering a range of therapeutic products. The tasks spans small molecules and biologics, including antibodies, peptides, microRNAs, and gene editing. Further, TDC tasks can be mapped to the following drug discovery pipelines:</p>
<p><img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Tiered design of Therapeutics Data Commons. We organize TDC into three distinct problems. For each problem, we give a collection of learning tasks. Finally, for each task, we provide a collection of datasets. In the first tier, we have three broad machine learning problems: (a) single-instance prediction is concerned with predicting properties of individual entities; (b) multi-instance prediction is concerned predicting properties of groups of entities; and (c) generation is concerned with the automatic generation of new entities. For each problem, we have a set of learning tasks. For example, the ADME learning task aims to predict experimental properties of individual compounds; it falls under single-instance prediction. At last, for each task, we have a collection of datasets. For example, TDC.Cacoz_Wang is a dataset under the ADME learning task, which, in turn, is under the single-instance prediction problem. This unique three-tier structure is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt at systematically organizing therapeutics ML.</p>
<ul>
<li>Target discovery: Tasks to identify candidate drug targets.</li>
<li>Activity modeling: Tasks to screen and generate individual or combinatorial candidates with high binding activity towards targets.</li>
<li>Efficacy and safety: Tasks to optimize therapeutic signatures indicative of drug safety and efficacy.</li>
<li>Manufacturing: Tasks to synthesize therapeutics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, in the third tier of TDC, each task is instantiated via multiple datasets. For each dataset, we provide several splits of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to simulate the type of understanding and generalization needed for transition into production and clinical implementation (e.g., the model's ability to generalize to entirely unseen compounds or to granularly resolve patient response to a polytherapy).</p>
<h1>4.2 Diverse Learning Tasks</h1>
<p>Table 1 lists 22 learning tasks included in TDC to date. For each task, TDC provides multiple datasets that vary in size between 200 and 2 million data points. We provide the following information for each learning task in TDC:</p>
<p>Table 1: List of 22 learning tasks in Therapeutics Data Commons. SM, small molecules; MM, macromolecules; CGT, cell and gene therapy; TD, target discovery; A, bioactivity modeling; ES, efficacy and safety; M, manufacturing. See also Section 4.2.</p>

<h1>4.3 Machine-Learning Ready Datasets</h1>
<p>Table 2 gives an overview of 66 datasets included in TDC to date.
Next, we give detailed information on learning tasks in Sections 5-7. Following the task description, we briefly describe each dataset for the task. For each dataset, we provide a data description and statistics, together with the recommended dataset splits and evaluation metrics and units in the case of numeric labels.</p>
<p>Table 2: List of 66 datasets in Therapeutics Data Commons. Size is the number of data points; Feature is the type of data features; Task is the type of prediction task; Metric is the suggested performance metric; Split is the recommended dataset split. For units, ' - ' is used when the dataset is either a classification task that does not have units or is a regression task where the numeric label units are not meaningful. For generation.MolGen, the metrics do not apply as it is defined by the task of interest.</p>

<h1>5 Single-Instance Learning Tasks in TDC</h1>
<p>In this section, we describe single-instance learning tasks and the associated datasets in TDC.</p>
<h3>5.1 single_pred.ADME: ADME Property Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. A small-molecule drug is a chemical and it needs to travel from the site of administration (e.g., oral) to the site of action (e.g., a tissue) and then decomposes, exits the body. To do that safely and efficaciously, the chemical is required to have numerous ideal absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties. This task aims to predict various kinds of ADME properties accurately given a drug candidate's structural information.
Impact. Poor ADME profile is the most prominent reason of failure in clinical trials (Kennedy 1997). Thus, an early and accurate ADME profiling during the discovery stage is a necessary condition for successful development of small-molecule candidate.
Generalization. In real-world discovery, the drug structures of interest evolve over time (Sheridan 2013). Thus, ADME prediction requires a model to generalize to a set of unseen drugs that are structurally distant to the known drug set. While time information is usually unavailable for many datasets, one way to approximate the similar effect is via scaffold split, where it forces training and test set have distant molecular structures (Bemis \&amp; Murcko 1996).
Product. Small-molecule.
Pipeline. Efficacy and safety - lead development and optimization.</p>
<h3>5.1.1 Datasets for single_pred.ADME</h3>
<p>TDC.Caco2_Wang: The human colon epithelial cancer cell line, Caco-2, is used as an in vitro model to simulate the human intestinal tissue. The experimental result on the rate of drug passing through the Caco-2 cells can approximate the rate at which the drug permeates through the human intestinal tissue (Sambuy et al. 2005). This dataset contains experimental values of Caco-2 permeability of 906 drugs (Wang, Dong, Deng, Zhu, Wen, Yao, Lu, Wang \&amp; Cao 2016).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: MAE; Unit: cm/s.
TDC.HIA_Hou: When a drug is orally administered, it needs to be absorbed from the human gastrointestinal system into the bloodstream of the human body. This ability of absorption is called human intestinal absorption (HIA) and it is crucial for a drug to be delivered to the target (Wessel et al. 1998). This dataset contains 578 drugs with the HIA index (Hou et al. 2007).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.Pgp_Broccatelli: P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ABC transporter protein involved in intestinal absorption, drug metabolism, and brain penetration, and its inhibition can seriously alter a drug's bioavailability and safety (Amin 2013). In addition, inhibitors of Pgp can be used to overcome multidrug resistance (Shen et al. 2013). This dataset is from Broccatelli et al. (2011) and contains 1,212 drugs with their activities of the Pgp inhibition.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.Bioavailability_Ma: Oral bioavailability is measured by the ability to which the active ingredient in the drug is absorbed to systemic circulation and becomes available at the site of action (Toutain \&amp; BOUSQUETMÉLOU 2004a). This dataset contains 640 drugs with bioavailability activity from Ma et al. (2008).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.</p>
<p>TDC.Lipophilicity_AstraZeneca: Lipophilicity measures the ability of a drug to dissolve in a lipid (e.g. fats, oils) environment. High lipophilicity often leads to high rate of metabolism, poor solubility, high turnover, and low absorption (Waring 2010). This dataset contains 4,200 experimental values of lipophilicity from AstraZeneca (2016). We obtained it via MoleculeNet (Wu et al. 2018).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: MAE; Unit: log-ratio.
TDC.Solubility_AqSolDB: Aqeuous solubility measures a drug's ability to dissolve in water. Poor water solubility could lead to slow drug absorptions, inadequate bioavailablity and even induce toxicity. More than $40 \%$ of new chemical entities are not soluble (Savjani et al. 2012). This dataset is collected from AqSolDb (Sorkun et al. 2019), which contains 9,982 drugs curated from 9 different publicly available datasets.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: MAE; Unit: log mol/L.
TDC.BBB_Martins: As a membrane separating circulating blood and brain extracellular fluid, the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) is the protection layer that blocks most foreign drugs. Thus the ability of a drug to penetrate the barrier to deliver to the site of action forms a crucial challenge in development of drugs for central nervous system (Abbott et al. 2010). This dataset from Martins et al. (2012) contains 1,975 drugs with information on drugs' penetration ability. We obtained this dataset from MoleculeNet (Wu et al. 2018).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.PPBR_AZ: The human plasma protein binding rate (PPBR) is expressed as the percentage of a drug bound to plasma proteins in the blood. This rate strongly affect a drug's efficiency of delivery. The less bound a drug is, the more efficiently it can traverse and diffuse to the site of actions (Lindup \&amp; Orme 1981). This dataset contains 1,797 drugs with experimental PPBRs (AstraZeneca 2016).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: MAE; Unit: \% (binding rate).
TDC.VDss_Lombardo: The volume of distribution at steady state (VDss) measures the degree of a drug's concentration in body tissue compared to concentration in blood. Higher VD indicates a higher distribution in the tissue and usually indicates the drug with high lipid solubility, low plasma protein binidng rate (Sjöstrand 1953). This dataset is curated by Lombardo \&amp; Jing (2016) and contains 1,130 drugs.</p>
<p>Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: Spearman Coefficient; Unit: L/kg.
TDC.CYP2C19_Veith: The CYP P450 genes are essential in the breakdown (metabolism) of various molecules and chemicals within cells (McDonnell \&amp; Dang 2013). A drug that can inhibit these enzymes would mean poor metabolism to this drug and other drugs, which could lead to drug-drug interactions and adverse effects (McDonnell \&amp; Dang 2013). Specifically, the CYP2C19 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. This dataset is from Veith et al. (2009), consisting of 12,665 drugs with their ability to inhibit CYP2C19.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP2D6_Veith: The role and mechanism of general CYP 450 system to metabolism can be found in CYP2C19 Inhibitor. CYP2D6 is responsible for metabolism of around $25 \%$ of clinically used drugs via addition or removal of certain functional groups in the drugs (Teh \&amp; Bertilsson 2011). This dataset is from Veith et al. (2009), consisting of 13,130 drugs with their ability to inhibit CYP2D6.</p>
<p>Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP3A4_Veith: The role and mechanism of general CYP 450 system to metabolism can be found in CYP2C19 Inhibitor. $\mathrm{CYP}<em 4="4">{3} \mathrm{~A}</em>}$ oxidizes the foreign organic molecules and is responsible for metabolism of half of all the prescribed drugs (Zanger \&amp; Schwab 2013). This dataset is from Veith et al. (2009), consisting of 12,328 drugs with their ability to inhibit $\mathrm{CYP<em 4="4">{3} \mathrm{~A}</em>$.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP1A2_Veith: The role and mechanism of general CYP 450 system to metabolism can be found in CYP2C19 Inhibitor. CYP1A2 is induced by some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and it is able</p>
<p>to metabolize some PAHs to carcinogenic intermediates. It can also metabolize caffeine, aflatoxin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$, and acetaminophen. This dataset is from Veith et al. (2009), consisting of 12,579 drugs with their ability to inhibit CYP1A2.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP2C9_Veith: The role and mechanism of general CYP 450 system to metabolism can be found in CYP2C19 Inhibitor. Around 100 drugs are metabolized by CYP2C9 enzymes. This dataset is from Veith et al. (2009), consisting of 12,092 drugs with their ability to inhibit CYP2C9.</p>
<p>Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP2C9_Substrate_CarbonMangels: In contrast to CYP inhibitors where we want to see if a drug can inhibit the CYP enzymes, substrates measure if a drug can be metabolized by CYP enzymes. See CYP2C9 Inhibitor about description of CYP2C9. This dataset is collected from Carbon-Mangels \&amp; Hutter (2011) consisting of 666 drugs experimental values.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP2D6_Substrate_CarbonMangels: See CYP2C9 Substrate for a description of substrate and see CYP2D6 Inhibitor for CYP2D6 information. This dataset is collected from Carbon-Mangels \&amp; Hutter (2011) consisting of 664 drugs experimental values.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUPRC.
TDC.CYP3A4_Substrate_CarbonMangels: See CYP2C9 Substrate for a description of substrate and see CYP3A4 Inhibitor for CYP3A4 information. This dataset is collected from Carbon-Mangels \&amp; Hutter (2011) consisting of 667 drugs experimental values.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.Half_Life_Obach: Half life of a drug is the duration for the concentration of the drug in the body to be reduced by half. It measures the duration of actions of a drug (Benet \&amp; Zia-Amirhosseini 1995). This dataset is from Obach et al. (2008) and it consists of 667 drugs and their half life duration.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: Spearman Coefficient; Unit: hr.
TDC.Clearance_AZ: Drug clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of a drug over a specified time period and it measures the rate at which the active drug is removed from the body (Toutain \&amp; Bousquet-Mélou 2004b). This dataset is from AstraZeneca (2016) and it contains clearance measures from two experiments types, hepatocyte (TDC.Clearance_Hepatocyte_AZ) and microsomes (TDC.Clearance_Microsome_AZ). As studies (Di et al. 2012) have shown various clearance outcomes given these two different types, we separate them. It has 1,102 drugs for microsome clearance and 1,020 drugs for hepatocyte clearance.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: Spearman Coefficient; Unit: uL.min ${ }^{-1} .\left(10^{6}\right.$ cells $)^{-1}$ for Hepatocyte and $m L \cdot \min ^{-1} \cdot g^{-1}$ for Microsome.</p>
<h1>5.2 single_pred. Tox: Toxicity Prediction</h1>
<p>Definition. Majority of the drugs have some extents of toxicity to the human organisms. This learning task aims to predict accurately various types of toxicity of a drug molecule towards human organisms.
Impact. Toxicity is one of the primary causes of compound attrition. Study shows that approximately $70 \%$ of all toxicity-related attrition occurs preclinically (i.e., in cells, animals) while they are strongly predictive of toxicities in humans (Kramer et al. 2007). This suggests that an early but accurate prediction of toxicity can significantly reduce the compound attribution and boost the likelihood of being marketed.
Generalization. Similar to the ADME prediction, as the drug structures of interest evolve over time (Sheridan 2013), toxicity prediction requires a model to generalize to a set of novel drugs with small structural</p>
<p>similarity to the existing drug set.
Product. Small-molecule.
Pipeline. Efficacy and safety - lead development and optimization.</p>
<h1>5.2.1 Datasets for single_pred.Tox</h1>
<p>TDC.LD50_Zhu: Acute toxicity LD50 measures the most conservative dose that can lead to lethal adverse effects. The higher the dose, the more lethal of a drug. This dataset is from Zhu et al. (2009), consisting of 7,385 drugs with experimental LD50 values.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: MAE; Unit: $\log (1 /(m o l / \mathrm{kg}))$.
TDC.hERG: Human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) is crucial for the coordination of the heart's beating. Thus, if a drug blocks the hERG, it could lead to severe adverse effects. This dataset is from Wang, Sun, Liu, Li, Li \&amp; Hou (2016), which has 648 drugs and their blocking status.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.AMES: Mutagenicity means the ability of a drug to induce genetic alterations. Drugs that can cause damage to the DNA can result in cell death or other severe adverse effects. This dataset is from Xu et al. (2012), which contains experimental values in Ames mutation assay of 7,255 drugs.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.DILI: Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is fatal liver disease caused by drugs and it has been the single most frequent cause of safety-related drug marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years (e.g. iproniazid, ticrynafen, benoxaprofen) (Assis \&amp; Navarro 2009). This dataset is aggregated from U.S. FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research and is collected from Xu et al. (2015). It has 475 drugs with labels about their ability to cause liver injury.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.Skin_Reaction: Exposure to chemicals on skins can cause reactions, which should be circumvented for dermatology therapeutics products. This dataset from Alves et al. (2015) contains 404 drugs with their skin reaction outcome.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.

Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.Tox21 Tox21 is a data challenge which contains qualitative toxicity measurements for 7,831 compounds on 12 different targets, such as nuclear receptors and stree response pathways (Mayr et al. 2016). Depending on different assay, we have different number of drugs. They usually range around 6,000 drugs.
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.
TDC.ClinTox: The clinical toxicity measures if a drug has fail the clinical trials for toxicity reason. It contains 1,484 drugs from clinical trials records (Gayvert et al. 2016).
Suggested data split: scaffold split; Evaluation: AUROC.</p>
<h2>5.3 single_pred.HTS: High-Throughput Screening</h2>
<p>Definition. High-throughput screening (HTS) is the rapid automated testing of thousands to millions of samples for biological activity at the model organism, cellular, pathway, or molecular level. The assay</p>
<p>readout can vary from target binding affinity to fluorescence microscopy of cells treated with drug. HTS can be applied to different kinds of therapeutics however most available data is from testing of small-molecule libraries. In this task, a machine learning model is asked to predict the experimental assay values given a small-molecule compound structure.
Impact. High throughput screening is a critical component of small-molecule drug discovery in both industrial and academic research settings. Increasingly more complex assays are now being automated to gain biological insights on compound activity at a large scale. However, there are still limitations on the time and cost for screening a large library that limit experimental throughput. Machine learning models that can predict experimental outcomes can alleviate these effects and save many times and costs by looking at a larger chemical space and narrowing down a small set of highly likely candidates for further smaller-scale HTS.
Generalization. The model should be able to generalize over structurally diverse drugs. It is also important for methods to generalize across cell lines. Drug dosage and measurement time points are also very important factors in determining the efficacy of the drug.
Product. Small-molecule.

<h3>5.4 single_pred.QM: Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<p>Definition. The motion of molecules and protein targets can be described accurately with quantum theory, i.e., Quantum Mechanics (QM). However, ab initio quantum calculation of many-body system suffers from large computational overhead that is impractical for most applications. Various approximations have been applied to solve energy from electronic structure but all of them have a trade-off between accuracy and computational speed. Machine learning models raise a hope to break this bottleneck by leveraging the knowledge of existing chemical data. This task aims to predict the QM results given a drug's structural information.
Impact. A well-trained model can describe the potential energy surface accurately and quickly, so that more accurate and longer simulation of molecular systems are possible. The result of simulation can reveal the biological processes in molecular level and help study the function of protein targets and drug</p>
<p>molecules.
Generalization. A machine learning model trained on a set of QM calculations require to extrapolate to unseen or structurally diverse set of compounds.

<h3>5.6 single_pred.Paratope: Paratope Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are large, Y-shaped proteins that can identify and neutralize a pathogen's unique molecule, usually called an antigen. They play essential roles in the immune system and are powerful tools in research and diagnostics. A paratope, also called an antigenbinding site, is the region that selectively binds the epitope. Although we roughly know the hypervariable regions that are responsible for binding, it is still challenging to pinpoint the interacting amino acids. This task is to predict which amino acids are in the active position of antibody that can bind to the antigen.
Impact. Identifying the amino acids at critical positions can accelerate the engineering processes of novel antibodies.

<h3>5.8 single_pred.Develop: Antibody Developability Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. Immunogenicity, instability, self-association, high viscosity, polyspecificity, or poor expression can all preclude an antibody from becoming a therapeutic. Early identification of these negative characteristics is essential. This task is to predict the developability from the amino acid sequences.
Impact. A fast and reliable developability predictor can accelerate the antibody development by reducing wet-lab experiments. They can also alert the chemists to foresee potential efficacy and safety concerns and provide signals for modifications. Previous works have devised accurate developability index based on 3D structures of antibody (Lauer et al. 2012). However, 3D information are expensive to acquire. A machine learning that can calculate developability based on sequence information is thus highly ideal.

<h1>5.9 single_pred.CRISPROutcome: CRISPR Repair Outcome Prediction</h1>
<p>Definition. CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing technology that allows targeted deletion or modification of specific regions of the DNA within an organism. This is achieved through designing a guide RNA sequence that binds upstream of the target site which is then cleaved through a Cas9-mediated double stranded DNA break. The cell responds by employing DNA repair mechanisms (such as non-homologous end joining) that result in heterogeneous outcomes including gene insertion or deletion mutations (indels) of varying lengths and frequencies. This task aims to predict the repair outcome given a DNA sequence.
Impact. Gene editing offers a powerful new avenue of research for tackling intractable illnesses that are infeasible to treat using conventional approaches. For example, the FDA recently approved engineering of T-cells using gene editing to treat patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Lim \&amp; June 2017). However, since many human genetic variants associated with disease arise from insertions and deletions (Landrum 2013), it is critical to be able to better predict gene editing outcomes to ensure efficacy and avoid unwanted pathogenic mutations.
Generalization. van Overbeek et al. (2016) showed that the distribution of Cas9-mediated editing products at a given target site is reproducible and dependent on local sequence context. Thus, it is expected that repair outcomes predicted using well-trained models should be able to generalize across cell lines and reagent delivery methods.

<h2>6 Multi-Instance Learning Tasks in TDC</h2>
<p>In this section, we describe multi-instance learning tasks and the associated datasets in TDC.</p>
<h3>6.1 multi_pred.DTI: Drug-Target Interaction Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. The activity of a small-molecule drug is measured by its binding affinity with the target protein. Given a new target protein, the very first step is to screen a set of potential compounds to find their activity. Traditional method to gauge the affinities are through high-throughput screening wet-lab experiments (Hughes et al. 2011). However, they are very expensive and are thus restricted by their abilities to search over a large set of candidates. Drug-target interaction prediction task aims to predict the interaction activity score in silico given only the accessible compound structural information and</p>
<p>protein amino acid sequence.
Impact. Machine learning models that can accurately predict affinities can not only save pharmaceutical research costs on reducing the amount of high-throughput screening, but also to enlarge the search space and avoid missing potential candidates.
Generalization. Models require extrapolation on unseen compounds, unseen proteins, and unseen compound-protein pairs. Models also are expected to have consistent performance across a diverse set of disease and target groups.
Product. Small-molecule.
Pipeline. Activity - hit identification.</p>
<h1>6.1.1 Datasets for multi_pred.DTI</h1>
<p>TDC.BindingDB: BindingDB is a public, web-accessible database that aggregates drug-target binding affinities from various sources such as patents, journals, and assays (Liu et al. 2007). We partitioned the BindingDB dataset into three sub-datasets, each with different units (Kd, IC50, Ki). There are 52,284 pairs for TDC.BindingDB_Kd, 991,486 pairs for TDC.BindingDB_IC50, and 375,032 pairs for TDC.BindingDB_Ki. Alternatively, a negative log10 transformation to $\mathrm{pIC} 50, \mathrm{pKi}, \mathrm{pKd}$ can be conducted for easier regression. The current version is 2020 m 2 . Suggested data split: cold drug split, cold target split; Evaluation: MAE, Pearson Correlation; Unit: nM.
TDC.DAVIS: This dataset is a large-scale assay of DTI of 72 kinase inhibitors with 442 kinases covering $&gt;80 \%$ of the human catalytic protein kinome. It is from Davis et al. (2011) and consists of 27,621 pairs.
Suggested data split: cold drug split, cold target split; Evaluation: MAE, Pearson Correlation; Unit: nM.
TDC.KIBA: As various experimental assays have different units during experiments, Tang et al. (2014) propose KIBA score to aggregate the IC50, Kd, and Ki scores. This dataset contains KIBA score for 118,036 DTI pairs. Suggested data split: cold drug split, cold target split; Evaluation: MAE, Pearson Correlation; Unit: dimensionless.</p>
<h3>6.2 multi_pred.DDI: Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. Drug-drug interactions occur when two or more drugs interact with each other. These could result in a range of outcomes from reducing the efficacy of one or both drugs to dangerous side effects such as increased blood pressure or drowsiness. Polypharmacy side-effects are associated with drug pairs (or higher-order drug combinations) and cannot be attributed to either individual drug in the pair. This task is to predict the interaction between two drugs.
Impact. Increasing co-morbidities with age often results in the prescription of multiple drugs simultaneously. Meta analyses of patient records showed that drug-drug interactions were the cause of admission for prolonged hospital stays in $7 \%$ of the cases (Thomsen et al. 2007, Lazarou et al. 1998). Predicting possible drug-drug interactions before they are prescribed is thus an important step in preventing these adverse outcomes. In addition, as the number of combinations or even higher-order drugs is astronomical, wet-lab experiments or real-world evidence are insufficient. Machine learning can provide an alternative way to inform drug interactions.
Generalization. As there is a very large space of possible drug-drug interactions that have not been explored, the model needs to extrapolate from known interactions to new drug combinations that have not been prescribed together in the past. Models should also taken into account dosage as that can have a significant impact on the effect of the drugs.

TDC.TWOSIDES: This dataset contains 4,649,441 drug-drug interaction pairs between 645 drugs (Tatonetti et al. 2012). Given the SMILES strings of two drugs, the goal is to predict the side effect caused as a result of an interaction.
Suggested data split: random split; Evaluation: Average-AUROC.</p>
<h3>6.3 multi_pred.PPI: Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. Proteins are the fundamental function units of human biology. However, they rarely act alone but usually interact with each other to carry out functions. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are very important to discover new putative therapeutic targets to cure disease (Szklarczyk et al. 2015). Expensive and time-consuming wet-lab results are usually required to obtain PPI activity. PPI prediction aims to predict the PPI activity given a pair of proteins' amino acid sequences.
Impact. Vast amounts of human PPIs are unknown and untested. Filling in the missing parts of the PPI network can improve human's understanding of diseases and potential disease target. With the aid of an accurate machine learning model, we can greatly facilitate this process. As protein 3D structure is expensive to acquire, prediction based on sequence data is desirable.
Generalization. As the majority of PPIs are unknown, the model needs to extrapolate from a given gold-label training set to a diverse of unseen proteins from various tissues and organisms.

Suggested data split: random split; Evaluation: AUPRC with Negative Samples.</p>
<h3>6.4 multi_pred.GDA: Gene-Disease Association Prediction</h3>
<p>Definition. Many diseases are driven by genes aberrations. Gene-disease associations (GDA) quantify the relation among a pair of gene and disease. The GDA is usually constructed as a network where we can probe the gene-disease mechanisms by taking into account multiple genes and diseases factors. This task is to predict the association of any gene and disease from both a biochemical modeling and network edge classification perspectives.</p>            </div>
