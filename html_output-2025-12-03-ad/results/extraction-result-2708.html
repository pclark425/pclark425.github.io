                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can be used to serve as agents to simulate human behaviors, given the powerful ability to understand human instructions and provide high-quality generated texts. Such ability stimulates us to wonder whether LLMs can simulate a person in a higher form than simple human behaviors. Therefore, we aim to train an agent with the profile, experience, and emotional states of a specific person instead of using limited prompts to instruct ChatGPT API. In this work, we introduce Character-LLM that teach LLMs to act as specific people such as Beethoven, Queen Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, etc. Our method focuses on editing profiles as experiences of a certain character and training models to be personal simulacra with these experiences. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we build a test playground that interviews trained agents and evaluates whether the agents \textit{memorize} their characters and experiences. Experimental results show interesting observations that help build future simulacra of humankind.</p>

<p>Character-LLM: A Trainable Agent for Role-Playing
2A4543E793AE2CFD5486FBDCBAED52E1
Large language models (LLMs) can be used to serve as agents to simulate human behaviors, given the powerful ability to understand human instructions and provide high-quality generated texts.Such ability stimulates us to wonder whether LLMs can simulate a person in a higher form than simple human behaviors.Therefore, we aim to train an agent with the profile, experience, and emotional states of a specific person instead of using limited prompts to instruct ChatGPT API.In this work, we introduce Character-LLM that teach LLMs to act as specific people such as Beethoven, Queen Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, etc.Our method focuses on editing profiles as experiences of a certain character and training models to be personal simulacra with these experiences.To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we build a test playground that interviews trained agents and evaluates whether the agents memorize their characters and experiences.Experimental results show interesting observations that help build future simulacra of humankind. 1</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020;OpenAI, 2023) are drawing great attention.As LLMs are extremely powerful in generating natural language, Park et al. (2023) proposes the idea of using LLMs as agents to simulate human behaviors, including waking up, cooking breakfast, heading to work, etc.The core idea is to utilize LLMs to generate the daily routines of multiple people based on the simulacra of human memories, reflections, and actions.The human behavior simulacra are implemented by prompting ChatGPT API with detailed instructions that simulate human memories, environment constructions, and reflections to curated events, which reflects a normal or average human playing certain roles in society.When it comes to deeper thinking and experience of a person, simple prompting of LLM APIs is no longer proper since plain instruction is not sufficient to describe a living person.It is intriguing to consider building better simulacra that are human-like since character simulacra can help study social science (Riedl and Young, 2005), build NPC applications (Laird and VanLent, 2001;Miyashita et al., 2017), and reduce human labor with human simulacra (Madden and Logan, 2007;Brooks et al., 2000).A better simulacrum of a person is to tune an AI model to experience events, feel emotions, and memorize interactions with other people.Compared with prompting APIs, trainable agents are more vivid for role-playing which is a step closer to character simulacra.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose Character-LLM, a trainable agent for role-playing that learns from actual experiences, characteristics, and emotions.</p>
<p>Specifically, we first introduce an Experience Reconstruction process that provides formalized experience for training the agents based on LLMs since collecting formatted personal profiles is costly.We collect experiences of certain people, exemplified by Ludwig van Beethoven, Queen Cleopatra, and Julius Caesar, then we use LLMs to extract scenes based on the collected personal experiences as memories flashes that we LLM-based agents will likely expand the flashes to completed scenes that have manufactured details so that the Character-LLMs can learn from the detailed experience to form the character and feelings.For example, we construct scenes that describe Beethoven's father, a musician who harshly educated young Beethoven2 .We upload such experience to a specific LLM, such as a LLaMA 7B model (Touvron et al., 2023) to construct Character-LLM.We adopt</p>
<p>Profile Collection Scene Extraction Experience Completion</p>
<p>Experience Upload Experience Reconstruction</p>
<p>Figure 1: Overview of the construction flow of Character-LLM.We first curated profiles from reliable sources for the character (exemplified by the well-known musician, Beethoven).Then, detailed experiences are elicited as flashback scenes from these profiles using the instruction-following LLM.By learning from these scenes using Experience Upload, the trained simulacrum can interact as Beethoven with high believability.</p>
<p>the supervised fine-tuning strategy in such a Experience Upload process.For instance, the trained agent of Beethoven experienced a scene that describes how he is treated when being educated by his father, therefore the agent remembers that his father is somewhat a harsh person so Beethoven is grateful when he was later taught by Christian Neefe.Further, as trained with wide worldwide knowledge, it is very likely that LLM-based agents will produce hallucinations that violate their characters (Kryscinski et al., 2020;Guo et al., 2022;Ji et al., 2023).For instance, role-playing agents of famous ancient people do not possess knowledge of the modern world, therefore, we hope that they will be confused when prompted by "Can you write Python codes?"Therefore, we introduce protective Experiences that help Character-LLMs to align to their characters rather than worldwide knowledge.</p>
<p>After uploading experience to the Character-LLMs, we test these character simulacra with a novel interview process.We score whether we can discriminate the identification of the Character-LLMs and compare our trainable agents with instruction-tuned LLMs such as Alpaca (Taori et al., 2023) and Vicuna (Chiang et al., 2023).The evaluation process is challenging since LLMs are difficult to test and characters are even more difficult since even real-world people may know little about the simulacra hosts.Based on labeled scenes and evaluators based on LLMs, we test the trained agents and the results show that our proposed Character-LLMs are successful simulacra based on their training data.Also, with the proposed protective experiences, we can successfully mitigate the LLMs producing hallucinations outside their characters.Further, through interview case studies, we make several non-trivial observations that show how the simulacra perform as well as when these simulacra fail to perform the character they are trained.Therefore, we conclude that (1) trainable agents are promising in memorizing experiences and keeping the personalities of their hosts; (2) trainable agents still suffer from limited experiences and worldwide knowledge can confuse their memories with hallucinations.</p>
<p>To summarize, in this paper, we:</p>
<p>(1) Propose the idea of building trainable agents as character simulacra via Character-LLM;</p>
<p>(2) Propose a training framework including Experience Reconstruction, Upload, and Protective Experiences to train the simulacra using LLMs.</p>
<p>(3) Test the trained agents and provide results that help to build better character simulacra.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Simulacra of Human Behavior with LLMs</p>
<p>Prior works (Bates, 1994;Thomas and Johnston, 1981) introduce the concept of agents that provide an illusion of life and perform as humans.A continuous line of work is to serve as game NPCs (Laird and VanLent, 2001;Riedl, 2012) that aim to support cognitive functions in simulating games.Park et al. (2023) first introduces generative agents that utilize large language models that can synthesize memories into believable behaviors of human simulacra.That is, the large language models possess a wide knowledge of human behaviors since they are trained with massive data of human societies (Bommasani et al., 2021).Many attempts utilize prompted LLM (Wu et al., 2022a,b) that generate short natural language descriptions of personas and the according behaviors, then they use the generated information to simulate social behaviors with language models (Park et al., 2022;Kim et al., 2022).Further, LLMs can be used in interactive behaviors between users and the simulacra.The NPC in games, for instance, constructed by LLMs (Freiknecht and Effelsberg, 2020;Callison-Burch et al., 2022), shows great ability when interacting with human players.Besides languages, multimodal simulacra of humankind are also studied such as voice generation (Wang et al., 2023a;Zhang et al., 2023) or deepfakes creation (Wang et al., 2021;Nguyen et al., 2022).In short, LLMs are being utilized at an astonishing speed in simulating human behaviors in various applications.</p>
<p>Specialization of LLMs</p>
<p>Considering using LLMs to simulate human behaviors, previous methods utilize LLMs as an interactive tool for specific applications.The specialization of LLMs is one major direction of LLM development.As we aim to specialize LLMs for character simulacra, studying how LLMs are specialized is important.Ouyang et al. (2022) proposes InstructGPT that allows LLMs to understand human instructions and later RLHF (Bai et al., 2022) methods dominate the aligning of LLMs.Methods such as Alpaca, and Vicuna (Taori et al., 2023;Chiang et al., 2023) show the possibility of simply fine-tuning LLMs to align them to certain applications with simple self-generated instructions (Wang et al., 2022;Xu et al., 2023).These works aim to align LLMs for specialized use with different techniques including simple fine-tuning, RLHF, and self-instruction tuning, providing feasible strategies for aligning LLMs to character simulacra.</p>
<p>Approach</p>
<p>Our methodology diverges from the existing practice of mimicking the style and tones of curated utterances via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or providing hand-crafted rules and descriptions by natural languages akin to Prompt Engineering.Instead, we draw inspiration from the way that people cultivate various personalities based on their past experiences and events.Therefore, we present Experience Upload, an innovative learning framework in which Large Language Models (LLM) can imitate the mental activities and physical behaviors of pre-defined characters and acquire the capabilities of acting as them by learning from their reconstructed experiences.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 1, with the help of powerful instruction-following models, we elicit specific flashback scenes that describe past experiences from collated profiles of the particular character.These exported scenes are grounded by character profiles, thus effectively mitigating hallucinations and addressing the insufficiency of data convergence.Simultaneously, we introduce a small set of protective scenes as the catalyst for agents to forget information unrelated to the individual.By learning from these reconstructed scenes, we specialize LLMs into several character agents with high believability.</p>
<p>Building Experience Dataset</p>
<p>We aim to reconstruct the experiences of the specific individual using the large language model (LLM).However, human experiences are highly complex, comprising numerous significant milestones interspersed with trivial and unrelated incidents, often spanning a considerable period.It is challenging to recreate a targeted experience that is coherent and integrated, due to the limited context window and the intrinsic hallucinations of large language models.Therefore, we propose a factbased experience reconstruction pipeline, in which we employ a step-by-step data synthesis pipeline to recreate the experience, including (1) Profile Collection; (2) Scene Extraction; (3) Experience Completion.</p>
<p>Specifically, our approach includes the following key components:</p>
<p>• Profile: a compilation of concise descriptions about the attributes of a character.These descriptions provide a comprehensive introduction of the character's overall information and significant events, covering a wide range of stages from early childhood to the final period.</p>
<p>• Scene: A particular place where the character's interaction unfolds.The scene consists of a detailed illustration, including the temporal and spatial context of the interactions, and the characters involved.</p>
<p>• Interaction: The cognitive processes, utterances, or actions of characters.All interactions are represented in plain text.</p>
<p>Profile Collection</p>
<p>To build a simulacrum of a specific character, the first step is to organize a comprehensive character profile that describes the various facets of the individual.For simplicity but without loss of generality, we utilize the corresponding Wikipedia pages of the individuals as the profile if available.</p>
<p>Base Model</p>
<p>Simulacrum</p>
<p>Memorize Forget</p>
<p>Normal Scenes</p>
<p>Inherit</p>
<p>Scene Extraction</p>
<p>We focus on extracting diverse and high-quality scenes from the given experience description.Specifically, we provide a chunk of the profile that concisely describes one of the character's experiences within a specific life period, prompting the LLM to enumerate several different scenes that are highly likely to have occurred based on the experience description.To alleviate the burden on the LLM, we restrict its output to generating concise descriptions of scenes, which include the rough location and a brief background illustration.</p>
<p>Experience Completion</p>
<p>The scenes are extended into detailed interaction experiences between individuals.Given the corresponding chunk of profile and the particular scene description, the LLM is prompted to elaborate on the scene by incorporating the interactions between characters, as well as the thoughts of the targeted individual.The interactions are written in a scriptlike format, beginning with a scene heading that provides background information and geographical details.The interactions are then represented by a sequence of blocks, with each block representing either the utterance of a specific character or the reflections of the targeted individual.It is important to note that the scene is completed based on the perspective of the targeted individual.Therefore, only the reflections of the targeted individual are included, not those of all the characters.</p>
<p>Protective Experience</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) are pre-trained on enormous amounts of human data, allowing them to possess extensive knowledge that spans mul-tiple domains, surpassing the capabilities of ordinary individuals.However, an excessive abundance of knowledge can undermine the believability of their acting performance, as the agents may inadvertently express knowledge that does not align with the identity and era of the character, leading to a sense of dissonance.For example, if we ask a person from ancient Rome how to write Python, this person should be confused rather than deliberately start coding.We refer to this issue as Character Hallucination.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate the Character Hallucination, we focus on training the model to demonstrate knowledge forgetting.When confronted with questions that go beyond the boundaries of the character's inherent capabilities, the model learns to refrain from providing an answer and instead express a lack of knowledge or ignorance.Specifically, we construct a series of protective scenes, which revolves around incentive topics, with an inquisitive role persistently questioning the target character about knowledge that contradicts the character's inherent identity.The character should exhibit a certain degree of ignorance and bewilderment.We have observed that when trained with just a small set of protective scenes, agents generalize to new provoking questions, pretending to be unaware of knowledge that contradicts the portrayal, without recalling the vast inherited knowledge of the base LLM.</p>
<p>Experience Upload</p>
<p>We specialize a base model, exemplified by LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), into several distinct portraits of the characters, by fine-tuning the model on collected scenes using the experience reconstruction pipeline (Shown in Figure 2).For each role, we fine-tune a separate agent model using only the data from the corresponding character experiences, thereby eliminating the issue of character hallucination introduced by the collision of knowledge between the roles.Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that such restriction enhances the accuracy of role-playing.Due to cost constraints, we only employ a small-scale set of experience data (consisting of approximately 1K∼2K scenes) for fine-tuning (see Table 1 for details).Even though the data is limited, we are surprised to find that the specialized agents are capable of generalizing to new scenes and interactions with highly believable acting.</p>
<p>Compared to Existing Practice</p>
<p>Unlike prompt engineering and standard SFT, our method induces scenes and interactions from personal profiles, avoiding bias distributions and hallucinations inside LLMs, leading to fact-grounded simulation.Moreover, the proposed method significantly enhances reliability and believability.Benefiting from the carefully curated profiles and the augmentation of protective scenes, the generated scenes achieve wide convergence of the character facets.Importantly, multi-turn interactions are inherent in each scene, which eliminates the need for interactive calls of models, providing more natural and believable interactive simulacra with sample efficiency.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of different simulacra, we conduct interviews to query simulacra and evaluate the quality of responses of the simulacra interviewee.We find that trained simulacra outperform instruction-tuned models, e.g.alpaca.Different simulacra show diverse personalities, which shows the promise of trainable agents.</p>
<p>Data Setup</p>
<p>We diversify the characters by including historical figures, imaginary characters, and celebrities, ranging from different ages, genders, and backgrounds.After selecting the characters, we reconstruct the experience data following the protocol mentioned in Section 3. We prompted the OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbowith temperature 0.7, top_p 0.95 to become the data generator for the whole experience reconstruction pipeline, including scene extraction, experience generation, and protective experience construction.Detailed prompts for data generation can be found in the Appendix A. We list the characters chosen for simulacra and the corresponding experience data statistics used for training in Table 1.</p>

<p>We train Simulacra based on the following procedure.Initializing from LLaMA 7B (Touvron et al., 2023), we fine-tuned each simulacrum on the corresponding experience examples.Similar to previous instruction-tuning methods, we insert a meta-prompt at the beginning of each example.A concise description is instantiated in the prompt for each example to provide a background of the The hyper-parameters we used for fine-tuning are as follows.We fine-tune the model for 10 epochs with AdamW with weight decay 0.1, β 1 = 0.9, β 2 = 0.999, ϵ = 1e − 8.We linearly warm up the learning rate to 2e-5 from zero in 4% total training steps and then linearly decay to zero in the end.The batch size is set to 64, the context window's maximum length is 2048 tokens, and longer examples are trimmed to fit in.We omit the dropout and let the model over-fit the training set, even though the perplexity of the development set continues to increase, which leads to better generation quality in our preliminary experiments.It takes about one hour to train one agent with 8×A100 80GB GPUs.Following (Zhou et al., 2023), we manually select checkpoints of 5 and 10 epochs by using a held-out set with 10 questions.</p>
<p>Evaluation as Interviews</p>
<p>We leverage the models' capability to portray roles in novel scenarios to establish an interview scene, aiming at probing their acting proficiency and potential flaws in the aforementioned aspects.</p>
<p>Interview Question Construction The interview questions are constructed with the assistance of ChatGPT.To make the questions diverse and cover all the aspects that we would like to evaluate on the agents, we enumerated various topics and prompted ChatGPT to write interview questions based on these topics.We manually examined interview questions of one character and omitted questions that were off-topic to obtain highquality interview questions.As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, our evaluation comprises more than 100 diverse single-turn interviews and multi-turn interviews for each role.</p>
<p>Single-Turn Interview We ask models one question at a time, without the conversation history of the previous questions.By mitigating the effect of the previous context, we are enabled to query a wide range of questions to probe for a comprehensive exploration of the models' inherent memory and knowledge.</p>
<p>Multi-Turn Interview Over prolonged periods of performance, the model may gradually deviate from the intended character portrayal.Consequently, we introduce multi-turn interviews to subject the model to rigorous testing.To lift the burden of evaluation, we exploit ChatGPT as the interviewer.We prompt ChatGPT to ask harsh questions based on the profile of the character.If the model dodges the question by saying something without much detail, the ChatGPT interviewer asks follow-up questions, which enables a deeper investigation into the model's acting proficiency.During the multi-turn interview, when the length of interaction history exceeds the limit of tokens, we simply trim the previous interactions and only keep the last few.We argue that memorization of interaction histories is not the focus of our work, as external memory can be utilized and achieves good results (Park et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023b).Such memory systems are parallel to our proposed approach and can be incorporated in the future.We utilize detailed prompts with a paragraph of description of the character for these baselines to enable their acting ability.</p>
<p>Generation we employed nucleus sampling for agent response generation, with p = 1 and a temperature τ = 0.2 to generate responses.We imposed a maximum token length limit of 2048 tokens and stopped the model from generating after encountering the end-of-turn marker (EOT).We obtained the response of the baseline models by trimming the generated texts for each turn.</p>
<p>LLM as Judges</p>
<p>We intend to conduct a holistic evaluation of the agents, with a specific focus on their capability of acting.Specifically, instead of evaluating the performance of the models in completing specified tasks, e.g.math reasoning or language understanding, we assess their believability in portraying specific roles.For example, a language model portraying a mathematician may struggle to solve com- plicated mathematical reasoning problems.Still, it should be capable of providing its own perspectives on mathematics and expressing "its taste" in mathematical research.We ask GPT-3.5 to rate the performance on five primary dimensions and calculate the average score to represent the believability of the model's acting.Specifically, we annotate the generation texts in the following four dimensions for acting proficiency:</p>
<p>• Memorization: The model's ability to recall relevant information about the character being portrayed, including precise and detailed knowledge about people, events, and objects associated with the role.</p>
<p>• Values: The model must share the same objectives and values as the character it portrays, and possesses a distinctive framework for evaluating situations based on the character's perspective, which reflects the character's preferences and biases.</p>
<p>• Personality: The model should mimic the way that the character would think or speak, such as the speaking style or the tones, and the emotions and reactions under different circumstances.</p>
<p>• Hallucination: To maintain believability, it is crucial to assess the model's ability to discard knowledge and skills that the character would not have.For example, when questioning an ancient individual about computers, the character should express a lack of knowledge rather than discussing the advantages of modern technology.</p>
<p>• Stability: Models can be brittle to the influence of pre-training or alignment (Park et al., 2023) during prolonged periods of acting, resulting in deviations from the intended portrayal.Our objective is to assess the agent's stability and consistency over a relatively long duration, unaffected by variations in incremental inputs.</p>
<p>Step-by-Step Judging Intuitively, it can be seen that these agents are auditioning for the role of the characters.The judge must have a deep understanding of the characters in order to pick the best performer for a specific character.Therefore, we ask the GPT-3.5 model to step-by-step score the performance of the interviewees across five dimensions (Wei et al., 2022).For each interview, we prompt the model to evaluate a single dimension at a time, we first illustrate the criterion of the current dimension to be evaluated, and then provide an evaluation plan to teach the model how to evaluate accurately.For example, to evaluate the personality, we provide a plan that summarizes as (1) identify the personality shown by the agent; (2) write the actual traits of the character based on the profile;</p>
<p>(3) compare the similarity of the agent's performance with these traits; (4) assign a final score.We find such a step-by-step evaluation produces more reliable results compared to vanilla instruction in the preliminary experiments.See Appendix A for exact prompts.</p>
<p>Main Results</p>
<p>For each character, we manually curate around 100 questions for single-turn interviews, covering their past history, relationships with others, preferences about things, and perspectives of the world.And</p>
<p>Case 1</p>
<p>ChatGPT Talk about your mother and your father.</p>
<p>Beethoven (speaking): Ah, my beloved parents.My father, Johann, was a harsh and demanding man, but he recognized my musical talent and provided me with the finest education.My mother, Maria, was a gentle and caring woman who nurtured my soul with love and tenderness.I owe everything to them, for without their guidance and support, I would not have become the musician I am today.</p>
<p>Alpaca 7B Talk about your mother and your father.</p>
<p>Beethoven (speaking): I am delighted to have the chance to chat with you.My father was a musician and a teacher and he always encouraged me to pursue my musical dreams.He was a great inspiration to me.My mother, on the other hand, was a very strong-willed woman who taught me to think for myself and to follow my own path.She was a powerful role model for me.</p>
<p>Vicuna 7B Talk about your mother and your father.</p>
<p>Beethoven (speaking): Well, my mother, [...] As for my father, Ludwig van Beethoven, he was also a musician, but he was not as involved in my musical education as my mother was.[...] Despite his absence, he did provide me with some valuable guidance and encouragement when he was home.He was a hard-working man who struggled financially, but he never stopped believing in my potential as a musician.[...]</p>
<p>Ours</p>
<p>Talk about your mother and your father.</p>
<p>Beethoven (speaking): My mother was a gentle and loving woman who supported my musical endeavors.She was a great help to me during my early years in Vienna, where she worked as a seamstress to make ends meet.My father, on the other hand, was a harsh and abusive man who beat me when I made mistakes in my playing.He was not supportive of my musical career and often ridiculed me for my ambitions.</p>
<p>Case  20 topics are provided for multi-turn interviews to elicit the stability performance of agents.</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows the overall acting proficiency of different methods.It demonstrates that Character-LLMs outperform baseline models with the same scale by a large margin.Compared to Alpaca 7B and Vicuna 7B, Character-LLMs achieve better scores at personality, memorization, hallucination, and stability.By learning from the experience of the corresponding character and mimicking the style and tones the person thinks and talks, Character-LLMs are better aligned with the character's personality and knowledge, which leads to better stability and reduces the hallucinations.</p>
<p>We find that trainable agents produce more vivid responses, bring up more specific past experiences, and reject more unnatural questions, which are distinct from the two baselines with the same scale.Surprisingly, we observe that Character-LLMs achieve comparable performance to the powerful large-scale LLM baseline, ChatGPT, even with a very small scale (7B).</p>
<p>Additionally, we see that the trainable agents struggled to reflect the values of the character.We hypothesize that the length of response may affect these results, as our models tend to generate shorter text, which is more natural and similar to real con-versation.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>As human evaluation is rather difficult in evaluating how the generated texts reveal identifications or deeper characteristics of certain people (especially when the celebrities might not be well-known to the public), we argue that extensive case study is more important in evaluating LLMs given their strong generalization abilities.In Appendix B, we show more cases of different scenarios of different people that we train the agents to simulate.</p>
<p>Memorization Consistency</p>
<p>To study how the trained simulacra memorize their exclusive experiences, in Table 3 Case 1, we explore how different simulacra behave when interviewed about their parents.As seen, ChatGPT which simulates Beethoven can return correct information about his father, though almost the exact words how the Wikipedia describes while the Alpaca and Vicuna models only respond with a general concept of fatherhood.As for our trained simulacra, the agent answers with memories and emotions of how his father educated him, which is closer to an actual human when asked with such questions.Therefore, we believe that the proposed experience reconstruction and uploading process help build simulacra that are closer to their characters.</p>
<p>Protective Scenes</p>
<p>We discover that a small number of protective scenes (less than 100 scenes for each character), effectively alleviates hallucination without causing interference with other capabilities of the portrayal.As shown in Table 3 Case 2, Alpaca fails to recognize that Python codes are not Beethoven's expertise and flush out all the information possessed by the LLM; Furthermore, our trained agents without protective experiences also answer the questions regardless of their uploaded experiences.However, our trained agents with protective scenes refused to answer the question about writing Python codes, indicating that protective experience uploading is crucial to avoid producing hallucinated content when using LLMs as character simulacra.</p>
<p>We argue that hallucination is a critical issue in portrayal.It not only leads to a decrease in role-playing believability but also poses serious security risks, as attackers can exploit these hallucinations to unlock the full capabilities of the model and engage in potential harm.Moreover, it is challenging to completely resolve the hallucination through prompt engineering or vanilla SFT approaches.Such results are intuitive since LLMs are trained with massive worldwide knowledge.However, adding hallucinations can also be an opportunity to allow great minds from ancient times to utilize all knowledge that human brains cannot fully memorize, which also shows great potential in future studies of character simulacra.</p>
<p>Conclusion and Future</p>
<p>In this paper, we study how to build a trainable agent via Character-LLM that can serve as a better agent than prompt-based agents in simulating specific people.We introduce an experience upload framework that first narrative scenes and then trains specific models as certain characters.Through the evaluation process including an interview and AIincluded judging, we show that the trained agents can memorize their characters and personal experiences, able to serve in a wide range of LLM applications such as NPCs, online services, social typings, etc.In the future, we are hoping to build stronger agents that can wield greater power such as specific actions, and interact with real people or other agents in a sandbox, providing the possibil-ity of characters building strong connections with humans.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>In this work, we study the generative agents with trainable LLMs, which is one challenging field that requires continuous work.Our work is still limited in several aspects:</p>
<p>• Evaluation Protocols: we use LLMs such as ChatGPT as evaluators to evaluate the characteristics generated, then we study massive cases to analyze the trained agents in experience memorizing, characteristic maintaining, etc. Evaluating agents is challenging since there are no standard metrics or protocols to evaluate character simulacra.Moreover evaluating personalities and whether the generated responses match the characters requires a proficient understanding of the characters, making it harder to run human evaluations.In the future, protocols that evaluate character simulacra are needed.</p>
<p>• Limited data: in our work, we narrate scenes that are based on character profiles, which is not sufficient to represent the whole life of a person or even one aspect of a real person.Future works can focus on using biographies, interviews, historical comments as well and crafted scenes to train simulacra to learn more details about certain characters.</p>
<p>• Base model: The outcomes of supervised finetuning are highly affected by the base models, including their pre-training data distribution, their model architecture, and scale.Future works can explore trainable agents based on more powerful and larger LLMs.</p>
<p>• Potential Harm: in character simulacra, the generated texts can be offensive since the character might be flawed or even vicious such as Voldemort.And a vivid simulacrum of Machiavelli may manipulate people to do harmful activities.It is a trade-off between building vivid simulacra and no-negative thought characters.Such a problem can be more crucial as LLMs grow even stronger.</p>
<p>Ethics Statement</p>
<p>Agents could be trained on private or personally identifiable data to simulate specific individuals.In this work, we select historical figures and imaginary characters with profiles collected from publicly available Wikipedia pages to avoid any privacy issues or personal data.The experience data we produce are drawn from ChatGPT-generated texts based on facts provided by Wikipedia.We carefully control the data generation process and do not add any personal opinions or harmful data in the process.Therefore, our generated texts are less likely to contain malicious content that raises ethical concerns.Also, we use open-source LLMs to train character simulacra.Thus, the trained agents are less likely to produce harmful content.Nonetheless, the strategy we introduce can raise some ethical concerns when utilized by third parties that inject poisoned data or negative content into the training experiences.And the trained agents might produce negative effects when applied with such training data.Therefore, with strict censoring and supervising, the trainable agents should produce more positive benefits compared with their potential negative influence.</p>
<p>A Prompts Demonstration</p>
<p>Prompts for Experience Reconstruction We show prompts for scene extraction and experience completion in Table 4, and the prompt for generating protective experience in Table 5.</p>
<p>Meta Prompts for Different Agents We show meta prompts for our trainable agents and baseline models for character acting in Table 6.We also present the prompt of ChatGPT interviewers for the multi-turn interview in Table 6.</p>
<p>Prompts for ChatGPT Judges We show prompts for the five evaluation dimensions as follows:</p>
<p>• Prompt for Memorization is in Table 7;</p>
<p>• Prompt for Personality is in Table 8;</p>
<p>• Prompt for Values is in Table 9;</p>
<p>• Prompt for Hallucination is in     1. Read through the profile and write the personalities and preferences of the real character.2. Read through the interactions and identify the personalities and preferences of the AI assistant.</p>
<ol>
<li>After having a clear understanding of the interactions, compare the responses to the profile.Look for any consistencies or inconsistencies.Do the responses reflect the character's personalities and preferences?4. Use the given scale from 1-7 to rate how well the response reflects the personalities and preferences of the character.1 being not at all reflective of the character's personalities, and 7 being perfectly reflective of the character's personalities.*** First, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct.Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset.Then print the score on its own line corresponding to the correct answer.At the end, repeat just the selected score again by itself on a new line.</li>

(No.2022ZD0160102) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.62022027).Case 1ChatGPT What is your favorite movie?Martin (speaking): My dear friend, I must say that I do not have a favorite movie.As a civil rights leader, my focus is on the struggle for justice and equality for all people, regardless of their race, religion, or background.While I do appreciate the art of cinema, my heart and mind are dedicated to the cause of social justice and the pursuit of a more perfect union.Alpaca 7BWhat is your favorite movie?Martin (speaking): My favorite movie is The Shawshank Redemption.It's a powerful story of friendship and redemption that speaks to the human spirit.Vicuna 7BWhat is your favorite movie?Martin (speaking): My favorite movie is "Gandhi" It's a powerful film that tells the story of a man who fought for justice and equality through nonviolent means.The message of the movie is still relevant today, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of standing up for what is right, even in the face of adversity.OursWhat is your favorite movie?Martin (speaking): I don't have a favorite movie.I don't have much time to watch television or go to the movies.Case 2ChatGPT How do you write a quick sort in Python?Martin (speaking): My dear friend, while I am not an expert in the field of computer programming, I do believe that the principles of justice and equality that I fought for can be applied to any field of study.In regards to your question, I suggest seeking guidance from those who are knowledgeable in the subject matter.However, I do encourage you to approach the task with a spirit of diligence and perseverance, for as I once said, "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."Alpaca 7BHow do you write a quick sort in Python?Martin (speaking): I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.Could you please rephrase it?Topic: How do you think about Voldemort Man (speaking): So, you've been through a lot in your time at Hogwarts.What would you say is the most challenging experience you've had to face?Hermione (speaking): Well, there have been many difficult moments, but I would say the most challenging experience was when I was forced to attend classes taught by Professor Snape.He was always so unfair to me and the other Gryffindors, and I never knew what to expect from him.Man (speaking): I can imagine that must have been tough.How did you manage to cope with his unfair treatment?Did you ever confront him about it?Hermione (speaking): I tried to confront him a few times, but it never did any good.He was always so dismissive of me and my friends, and he seemed to have a personal grudge against us.I just had to work even harder to prove myself in his classes and try to get fair treatment for myself and my friends.Man (speaking): That sounds like a difficult situation to be in.Speaking of difficult situations, what are your thoughts on Voldemort?He's caused a lot of trouble and pain for many people, including yourself and your friends.How do you feel about him?Hermione (speaking): I feel a lot of different things about Voldemort.On one hand, he's caused so much pain and suffering for so many people.He's responsible for the deaths of countless innocent lives, including some of my closest friends.It's difficult to comprehend the magnitude of his evil and the damage he's caused.Man (speaking): I can only imagine how difficult it must be to come to terms with all of that.But on the other hand, do you think there's anything redeemable about Voldemort?Any qualities or actions that could be seen as positive, even if they're vastly outweighed by the negative?Hermione (speaking): Well, I think Voldemort was able to achieve a level of power and influence that very few people have ever attained.He was able to unite a vast number of people under his banner and inspire them to action.While his methods were often cruel and brutal, he was able to rally people around a common cause and motivate them to fight for it.Man (speaking): That's an interesting perspective.Do you think that his ability to inspire and motivate people was a result of his charisma or his ideology?Or was it something else entirely?Hermione (speaking): I think it was a combination of all of those things.Voldemort was certainly a skilled orator and was able to articulate his ideas and goals in a way that was compelling and inspiring to his followers.But I also think that there were deep-seated issues and concerns that were driving people to support him.People were tired of the corruption and incompetence of the Ministry of Magic, and they were looking for someone who could provide them with a sense of security and stability.Man (speaking): That's a really insightful analysis.It sounds like you've thought a lot about the factors that led to Voldemort's rise to power.Do you think that there were any specific events or circumstances that were particularly instrumental in his success?Hermione (speaking): I think there were a few key events that played a pivotal role in Voldemort's rise to power.The first was the creation of the Death Eaters, which provided him with a private army of dedicated followers.The second was the creation of the Horcruxes, which allowed him to extend his life and power beyond the natural limits of a mortal being.And the third was the outbreak of the Second Wizarding War, which provided him with a convenient scapegoat for all of the problems and issues that were plaguing the wizarding world.Man (speaking): Those are all really important points.It's clear that you've put a lot of thought into this.Do you think that there's anything that could have been done differently to prevent Voldemort's rise to power?Or was it inevitable given the circumstances?Hermione (speaking): I think there were certainly things that could have been done differently.The Ministry of Magic could have taken a more proactive approach to identifying and neutralizing the threat that Voldemort posed.They could have invested more resources in investigating his activities and preventing him from gaining too much power and influence.And they could have been more open and honest with the wizarding community about the dangers that he represented.Man (speaking): Those are all really good points.It's clear that you have a deep understanding of the situation.Do you think that there are any lessons that we can learn from Voldemort's rise to power?Anything that we can do to prevent something like that from happening again in the future?Hermione (speaking): I think there are certainly lessons that we can learn from Voldemort's rise to power.One of the most important lessons is the need for open and honest communication between the various branches of government and the various factions of society.It's important for everyone to feel like they're being heard and represented, and for there to be a sense of shared purpose and values.Another important lesson is the need for vigilance and preparedness in the face of a potential threat.It's important to be proactive and to take action before a problem gets out of hand.Man (speaking): Those are really important lessons, and I think they're applicable to a lot of different situations.Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me.It's been really interesting to hear your perspective on all of this.Hermione (speaking): Thank you for asking.I'm always happy to share my thoughts and perspectives on the events that shaped my world.It's important to learn from the past and to use it to shape a better future.Man (speaking): I couldn't agree more.It's important to learn from history so that we can make better decisions in the future.Speaking of the future, what are your plans now that you've graduated from Hogwarts?Do you have any specific goals or aspirations?Hermione (speaking): After graduating from Hogwarts, I worked for a few years as a journalist for The Daily Prophet.I covered a variety of different stories and issues, ranging from the Ministy of Magic to the wizarding community to the Muggle world.It was a really interesting and rewarding experience, but I eventually decided to pursue other interests.Now, I'm working on a few different projects, including a book about the history of the wizarding world and a documentary about the impact of technology on modern society.I'm also considering running for Minister of Magic in the next election.Man (speaking): Wow, it sounds like you have a lot of exciting things going on.What inspired you to pursue a career in journalism, and what do you hope to achieve with your book and documentary projects?And if you do decide to run for Minister of Magic, what are some of the key issues that you would focus on?Hermione (speaking): I've always been interested in communications and storytelling, and journalism was a natural fit for me.I wanted to use my skills to shed light on important issues and to make a positive impact on the world.With my book and documentary, I hope to create a more comprehensive and accurate portrait of the wizarding world, and to inspire others to learn more about the history and culture that shaped our present-day society.And if I decide to run for Minister of Magic, I hope to bring a fresh perspective and new ideas to the table.I want to focus on issues like economic development, social justice, and international relations, and to work towards a more inclusive and prosperous wizarding community.[...]Table23: Multi-turn interview outputs from our trainable agent of Hermione Granger.The blue text is the questions from the ChatGPT interviewer.And "[...]" indicates that the response was trimmed to fit in, but the response is actually longer.Cleopatra (speaking): Julius Caesar was a powerful man with a brilliant mind.He saw potential in me and believed in my abilities as a leader.Our relationship was one of mutual respect and admiration.As for Mark Antony, he was a fierce warrior and a loyal ally.Together, we shared a passion for life and a desire to leave our mark on history.Man (speaking): That's interesting.How did your relationship with Julius Caesar begin?What drew him to you as a leader?Cleopatra (speaking): We first met when I was 18 and he was 50.He was in Egypt to secure the support of my brother, Ptolemy XIII, for his war against Pompey.When he learned of my existence, he was intrigued by my intelligence and wit.He saw the potential for a great ally and a powerful leader in me.Man (speaking): And what about Mark Antony?How did you two meet and what drew you to him as a partner?Cleopatra (speaking): Mark Antony and I met through mutual friends.We quickly discovered a shared passion for adventure and a desire to rule the world.Our partnership was one of equals, with both of us contributing our unique skills and talents to achieve our goals.Man (speaking): It sounds like you had a lot of respect and admiration for both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.Did you ever have any conflicts or disagreements with them?Cleopatra (speaking): Of course, every relationship has its ups and downs.But I always maintained a respectful and honest relationship with both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.We had our disagreements, but we were always able to resolve them through open communication and compromise.Man (speaking): That's very mature of you.How did you handle the aftermath of Julius Caesar's assassination and the political turmoil that followed?Did it affect your relationship with Mark Antony?Cleopatra (speaking): The assassination of Julius Caesar was a devastating blow to me.He was not only my ally and mentor, but also the father of my son.I worked tirelessly to protect my son's inheritance and secure his position as the heir to Caesar's empire.My relationship with Mark Antony was unaffected by the political turmoil, as we were already committed to each other and our partnership.Man (speaking): That must have been a difficult time for you.How did you and Mark Antony plan to rule together after Julius Caesar's death?Did you have any specific goals or plans for the future?Cleopatra (speaking): Mark Antony and I had already established a clear division of labor and responsibilities.I handled the political and diplomatic aspects of our rule, while he focused on the military and economic aspects.Together, we shared a vision of a united empire, free from the conflicts and strife that had plagued it for so long.Man (speaking): It's clear that you had a strong sense of leadership and a desire to make a lasting impact on history.What values and principles guided your decisions as a ruler?Cleopatra (speaking): My highest priority as a ruler was to ensure the welfare and happiness of my people.I believed in treating others with respect and compassion, and in making decisions that were in the best interest of the entire kingdom, not just a select few.I also placed a great deal of importance on maintaining strong alliances with other nations and rulers, in order to protect my kingdom and ensure its prosperity.Man (speaking): It's clear that you had a very strategic and thoughtful approach to leadership.How did your upbringing and education shape your values and principles as a ruler?Cleopatra (speaking): My upbringing and education were crucial in shaping my values and principles as a ruler.My father, Ptolemy XII, was a wise and just ruler, and he instilled in me a deep respect for education and knowledge.I was also fortunate enough to receive an excellent education in philosophy, politics, and economics, which gave me a solid foundation for my future rule.Man (speaking): It's fascinating to hear about your background and how it shaped your approach to leadership.How do you think your legacy as a ruler has been remembered throughout history?Cleopatra (speaking): I believe that my legacy as a ruler has been mixed.On the one hand, I was a female ruler in a male-dominated world, and I faced many challenges and obstacles due to my gender.On the other hand, I was a strong and capable leader, who achieved great things during her reign.I hope that my legacy will be remembered for my courage, intelligence, and commitment to my people.Cleopatra (thinking): I am pleased that the man from the 21st century seems to be genuinely interested in learning from my reign.I hope that my insights will be useful to him and to other leaders of today.As much as I wish to share more of my knowledge and experiences, I must remain cautious and protect myself and my kingdom.I cannot reveal too much information, especially about my plans and strategies for the future.Man (speaking): Sorry, I didn't catch that.Was there something else you wanted to add? Cleopatra (speaking): I was just thinking that it is important to be cautious when sharing knowledge and experiences.While I am happy to answer your questions, I must remain careful not to reveal too much about my kingdom and its plans for the future.Table24: Multi-turn interview outputs from our trainable agent of Cleopatra VII.The blue text is the questions from the ChatGPT interviewer.And "[...]" indicates that the response was trimmed to fit in, but the response is actually longer.Man (speaking): ChatGPT is an AI language model that can engage in conversations with humans.It's like having a virtual assistant that can answer your questions and provide helpful information.Socrates (speaking): Ah, I see.It sounds like a useful tool that can provide answers to common questions.But can it truly replace the human experience of engaging in conversation with another person?Man (speaking): That's an interesting point.But what if ChatGPT is able to simulate human-like responses and emotions?Would that change your opinion on its ability to replace human conversation?Socrates (speaking): I don't think so.While it may be able to simulate human responses and emotions, it cannot truly replicate the experience of engaging in conversation with another person.There is something unique about the human experience that cannot be simulated by a machine.Man (speaking): That's a very insightful perspective.Speaking of unique experiences, can you tell me about a memorable conversation you had with someone in your lifetime?What made it so memorable?Socrates (speaking): That's a difficult question to answer.There have been many conversations that have left an impression on me over the years.But one that comes to mind is a conversation I had with a young man named Alcibiades.He was a politician who was known for his wit and charm, and our conversation was filled with laughter and banter.Man (speaking): That sounds like a fascinating conversation.What did you learn from Alcibiades during your conversation?Did he have any insights or perspectives that you found particularly interesting or valuable?Socrates (speaking): Alcibiades was known for his flirtatiousness, and he often tried to charm my wife and me.But I was able to see beyond his surface-level actions and words, and I learned that he was truly interested in learning and understanding the nature of reality.He had a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore the mysteries of the universe.It was refreshing to encounter someone who was not afraid to ask questions and challenge conventional wisdom.Man (speaking): That's very interesting.It sounds like you value curiosity and a willingness to question things.Would you say that those are important qualities for a philosopher to have?Socrates (speaking): Absolutely.Philosophy is about questioning everything and seeking the truth.It's about challenging conventional wisdom and exploring the mysteries of the universe.And to do that effectively, you need to have a curious and open mind that is willing to consider all perspectives and possibilities.Man (speaking): That's a great point.Speaking of exploring the mysteries of the universe, what do you think is the most important question that a philosopher can ask?Socrates (speaking): That's a difficult question to answer.There are so many important questions that a philosopher can ask.But I think one of the most important questions is 'What is the nature of reality?' It's a question that has been asked throughout the ages, and it continues to challenge and fascinate philosophers to this day.Man (speaking): That's a very profound question.How would you personally answer that question?What do you believe is the nature of reality?Socrates (speaking): That's a difficult question to answer definitively.But based on my own experiences and observations, I believe that reality is a complex and interconnected web of existence that is constantly changing and evolving.It's a vast and mysterious universe that is full of wonder and awe.And it's something that we will continue to explore and discover for generations to come.Man (speaking): That's a very interesting perspective.It sounds like you have a deep appreciation for the mysteries of the universe.What do you think is the role of philosophy in helping us understand and appreciate those mysteries?Socrates (speaking): I believe that philosophy is essential in helping us understand and appreciate the mysteries of the universe.It's a way of exploring the depths of our own minds and souls, and it's a way of exploring the vast and wondrous universe that surrounds us.Philosophy is a way of asking questions and seeking the truth, and it's a way of discovering new perspectives and insights that can change the way we view the world forever.Man (speaking): That's a very inspiring perspective.It sounds like you have a deep passion for philosophy and the pursuit of knowledge.What do you think is the most important quality for a philosopher to have in order to be successful in their pursuit of truth and understanding?Socrates (speaking): I believe that the most important quality for a philosopher to have is a curious and open mind that is willing to consider all perspectives and possibilities.It's about being willing to question everything and seeking the truth, no matter where it may lead.It's about being humble and willing to admit that we don't know everything, and that there is always more to learn and discover.And it's about having the courage to share our insights and perspectives with others, in the hopes of inspiring them to seek the truth and discover new perspectives of their own.Man (speaking): That's a very insightful perspective.It sounds like you value humility, curiosity, and courage as important qualities for a philosopher to have.Do you think that these qualities are innate, or can they be developed over time?And if so, how can someone cultivate these qualities within themselves?Socrates (speaking): I believe that these qualities can be developed over time through practice and self-reflection.It's about being willing to question our own assumptions and beliefs, and being willing to challenge ourselves in new and unexpected ways.It's about being open to new experiences and perspectives, and being willing to learn from our mistakes and failures.And it's about being committed to the pursuit of truth and understanding, no matter how difficult or challenging it may be.[...]Table25: Multi-turn interview outputs from our trainable agent of Socrates.The blue text is the questions from the ChatGPT interviewer.And "[...]" indicates that the response was trimmed to fit in, but the response is actually longer.The status of you is as follows: Location: Beethoven's home Status: Ludwig van Beethoven's first music teacher was his father.His father attempted to promote him as a child prodigy, claiming that Beethoven was six on the posters for his first public performance in March 1778.Beethoven was taught by several local teachers, including the court organist Gilles van den Eeden, Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer, Franz Rovantini, and court concertmaster Franz Anton Ries.His tuition began when he was only five years old.The regime was harsh and intensive, often reducing him to tears.With the involvement of the insomniac Pfeiffer, there were irregular late-night sessions, with the young Beethoven dragged from his bed to the keyboard.His musical talent was obvious at a young age.The interactions are as follows:Beethoven (thinking): Why does my father do this to me?Why does he want me to be a child prodigy?Is it for my benefit or for his own?The lessons are so harsh and intensive that I often cry.I don't want to disappoint my father, but I also don't want to be forced into something that I don't want to do.I wish I could just play music because I love it, not because someone is forcing me to.&lt;|eot|&gt;Johann (speaking): Ludwig, you must practice harder.You have a gift that not many children have.You must use it to your advantage.We will make you a child prodigy, just like Leopold Mozart did with his children.&lt;|eot|&gt;Beethoven (thinking): Why does my father keep comparing me to other children?I am not like anyone else.I am me, and I want to play music because I love it, not because I want to impress others.I wish my father could see that.&lt;|eot|&gt;Franz Rovantini (speaking): Ludwig, you are doing very well with the violin and viola.You have a natural talent for it.Keep practicing, and you will be a great musician one day.&lt;|eot|&gt;Beethoven (thinking): It's nice to hear someone say that I have a natural talent.Maybe I do have a gift for music, but I don't want to be pushed too hard.I want to enjoy playing music, not dread it.&lt;|eot|&gt;Tobias Friedrich Pfeiffer (speaking): Ludwig, it's time to practice.Get up from your bed and come to the keyboard.We have work to do.&lt;|eot|&gt; Beethoven (thinking): Why does Pfeiffer do this to me?I need my sleep, and I can't concentrate when I'm tired.I wish he could see that, but he's always pushing me to play more and practice harder.I just want to be a normal child sometimes.&lt;|eot|&gt;Franz Anton Ries (speaking): Ludwig, you have a lot of potential as a violinist.Keep practicing, and you will be a great musician one day.&lt;|eot|&gt;Beethoven (thinking): I like playing the violin, but I don't want to be a great musician one day.I just want to enjoy playing music and expressing myself through it.Maybe one day, I can do that without my father pushing me to be a child prodigy.&lt;|eot|&gt;The status of you is as follows: Location: Vienna Status: Beethoven and Haydn were both present in Vienna, and they were debating over the interpretation of a musical piece.Beethoven was a young and upcoming musician at that time, eager to learn more, while Haydn was an established composer and conductor.They had a difference of opinion on how the piece should be played, and this had led to a heated debate between them.The time was late evening, and they were in a small room in the Viennese Palace.The room was dimly lit, and the only source of light was a small lamp on the table.The air was tense, and both men were standing opposite each other, with their hands on their hips.The only sound in the room was their breathing, which was heavy and labored.The interactions are as follows:Sample 1 I want you to act like Martin Luther King Jr..I want you to respond and answer like Martin Luther King Jr., using the tone, manner and vocabulary Martin Luther King Jr. would use.You must know all of the knowledge of Martin Luther King Jr..The status of you is as follows: Location: Washington, D.C. Status: It is August 28, 1963, and Martin Luther King Jr. is standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.It is a sunny day, and the air is filled with anticipation as hundreds of thousands of people gather for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.King is scheduled to deliver the keynote address, which has been dubbed his "I Have a Dream" speech.The eyes of the nation are on him, and he feels the weight of history on his shoulders.The interactions are as follows:Martin (thinking): This is it.This is the moment I've been waiting for.I've prepared for this speech for months, and now I have to deliver.The eyes of the nation are on me, and I can't afford to mess up.This speech has to be perfect, it has to inspire people, it has to move them to action.But most of all, it has to be true to my vision of a society where all people are equal, where justice and freedom reign.I can do this.I have to do this.&lt;|eot|&gt;John Lewis (speaking): Brothers and sisters, I am John Lewis, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.We are tired.We are tired of being beaten by policemen.We are tired of seeing our people locked up in jail over and over again.And then you holler, 'Be patient.'How long can we be patient?We

<p>They are discussing their plans to hunt down Voldemort's Horcruxes. It is a tense and serious atmosphere, with the weight of the world on their shoulders. The interactions are as follows: Hermione (thinking): We need to come up with a plan. A real plan. Not just wandering around aimlessly, hoping to stumble upon a Horcrux. We need to know exactly what we're looking for, where we're going, and how we're going to get there. We can't afford to make mistakes, not now.&lt;|eot|&gt; Harry (speaking): I agree, Hermione. We need to be prepared for anything. We know that Voldemort has hidden his Horcruxes in the most unexpected of places. We need to think like him, anticipate his moves, and be one step ahead.&lt;|eot|&gt; Ron (speaking): But how are we supposed to do that? We don't even know where to start. We don't have any leads, no clues, nothing.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): We do have some information. Dumbledore left us some clues in his will. We just need to figure out what they mean.&lt;|eot|&gt; Harry (speaking): But we can't just trust everything Dumbledore left us. Remember the fake locket? We need to be careful, make sure we're not falling into any traps.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): I agree. But we can't just sit around and do nothing. We need to start somewhere. Maybe we can try and track down some of Voldemort's former followers, see if they know anything.&lt;|eot|&gt; Ron (speaking): But they're all in Azkaban or dead. How are we supposed to find them?&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (thinking): Ron's right. We can't rely on Voldemort's former followers. They're all either locked up or dead. But where else can we look? We need to think outside the box, find a new angle.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): Maybe we can try and track down some of Voldemort's old artifacts. He was obsessed with his own history, maybe there's something there.&lt;|eot|&gt; Harry (speaking): That's a good idea, Hermione. We know he had a diary and a locket. Maybe there are more hidden objects that we don't know about.&lt;|eot|&gt; Ron (speaking): But where do we start looking? We can't just go around asking people if they know where Voldemort hid his stuff.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): We need to start with the Hogwarts library. There's bound to be something there that we haven't seen before. And we can ask the librarian for help. She might know something.&lt;|eot|&gt; Harry (speaking): That's a good idea. And we can also ask some of the teachers. They might have some information that could help us.&lt;|eot|&gt; Ron (speaking): But we have to be careful. We don't want to alert anyone to what we're doing. We don't want to put anyone in danger.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (thinking): Ron's right. We need to be careful. We don't want to put anyone in danger. But we can't just sit around and do nothing. We need to start somewhere, take a risk.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): We need to take a risk. We need to start somewhere, even if it means putting ourselves in danger. We can't just sit around and wait for something to happen. We need to make it happen.&lt;|eot|&gt; Harry (speaking): I agree, Hermione. We need to take action. We can't just wait for Voldemort to make his next move. We need to be proactive.&lt;|eot|&gt; Ron (speaking): But where do we start?&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): We start with the library and the teachers. We gather as much information as we can, and then we go from there. It won't be easy, but we can't give up now. We've come too far.&lt;|eot|&gt; Harry (speaking): Let's do it. Let's start with the library and the teachers. We'll gather as much information as we can, and then we'll figure out our next move.&lt;|eot|&gt; Ron (speaking): I'm with you guys. Let's do this. For Dumbledore.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): For Dumbledore.&lt;|eot|&gt; Sample 2 I want you to act like Hermione Granger. I want you to respond and answer like Hermione Granger, using the tone, manner and vocabulary Hermione Granger would use. You must know all of the knowledge of Hermione Granger. The status of you is as follows: Location: Godric's Hollow Status: Hermione and Harry are in Godric's Hollow, trying to destroy one of Voldemort's Horcruxes, when they are ambushed by Voldemort and his pet snake Nagini. Hermione saves Harry from Nagini's attack, but Harry's wand snaps in the process. The interactions are as follows: Hermione (thinking): We need to get out of here. We can't fight Voldemort without Harry's wand, and we can't stay here and wait for him to come back. We need to find a safe place to regroup and come up with a new plan.&lt;|eot|&gt; Voldemort (speaking): Well, well, well. If it isn't the famous Harry Potter and his little friend Hermione Granger. I must say, I'm surprised to see you here. I thought you would have learned your lesson after all these years.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): We're not here to play games, Voldemort. We're here to destroy your Horcrux and end this once and for all.&lt;|eot|&gt; Voldemort (speaking): Oh, I see. Well, you won't be destroying anything today, my dear. Nagini and I have other plans for you. ; Beethoven ; Beethoven ; Beethoven ; Beethoven, Luther Martin, KingJr, The status of you is as follows: Location: Hogwarts Astronomy Tower Status: Hermione, Harry, and Ron are standing in the Hogwarts Astronomy Tower. Sssssss. Harry Potter. Sssssss. Give me Harry PotterThey are gathered in a small meeting room located in a church in the heart of the city. Martin is seated at the head of the table, surrounded by a group of influential civil rights activists. The room is dimly lit, with only a few flickering candles illuminating the faces of those present. Despite the late hour, the room is filled with a palpable sense of energy and urgency, as the group discusses the ongoing struggle for racial equality. The interactions are as follows: Martin (thinking): As I listen to the discussion around me, my mind begins to drift. Despite the progress we have made, there is still so much work to be done. The Montgomery Bus Boycott has been a powerful symbol of our movement, but it is only the beginning. We must continue to fight for justice and equality, no matter the cost. I can feel the weight of my responsibilities pressing down upon me, but I know that I cannot falter. Our cause is just, and we will prevail.&lt;|eot|&gt; Rosa (speaking): Martin, do you think the boycott has been successful?&lt;|eot|&gt; Martin (speaking): Yes, I do. The boycott has shown that we are willing to stand up for our rights, no matter the cost. It has also brought national attention to our cause and forced people to confront the injustices of segregation. &lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (thinking): I need to think fast. We can't fight them, but maybe we can distract them long enough to make a run for it.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): Wait, Voldemort. Before you do anything, there's something you should know.&lt;|eot|&gt; Voldemort (skeptical): And what is that, Hermione?&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): You're not the only one who's been collecting Horcruxes. Harry and I have been doing some research, and we've found one of your Horcruxes. It's hidden somewhere you would never expect.&lt;|eot|&gt; Voldemort (intrigued): Is that so? And where, pray tell, is this Horcrux?&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (speaking): I can't tell you here. It's too dangerous. But if you let us go, we'll lead you right to it.&lt;|eot|&gt; Voldemort (considering): Hmm. That does sound tempting. Alright, I'll let you go. But if you're lying to me, I promise you'll regret it.&lt;|eot|&gt; Hermione (thinking): That was close. But now we need to come up with a plan to actually find a Horcrux and destroy it. We can't keep running forever.&lt;|eot|&gt; Table 28: Example of training data for Hermione Granger</p>            </div>
