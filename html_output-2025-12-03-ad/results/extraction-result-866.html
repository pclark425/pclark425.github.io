                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A framework that leverages code-generation models to compose vision-and-language models into subroutines to produce a result for any query is introduced, which achieves state-of-the-art results across various complex visual tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Answering visual queries is a complex task that requires both visual processing and reasoning. End-to-end models, the dominant approach for this task, do not explicitly differentiate between the two, limiting interpretability and generalization. Learning modular programs presents a promising alternative, but has proven challenging due to the difficulty of learning both the programs and modules simultaneously. We introduce ${\color{green}{\text{ViperGPT}}}$, a framework that leverages code-generation models to compose vision-and-language models into subroutines to produce a result for any query. ${\color{green}{\text{ViperGPT}}}$ utilizes a provided API to access the available modules, and composes them by generating Python code that is later executed. This simple approach requires no further training, and achieves state-of-the-art results across various complex visual tasks.</p>

These tasks are partially observable in practice because the visual input is only a partial, sensor-limited view of the world (single camera frame or a finite set of frames) and temporal queries require reasoning across sparse frames; challenges include occlusion, ambiguous referring expressions, long temporal horizons, and limited access to frames due to memory constraints.",

Subsequent program logic (sorting, filtering, comparisons, control flow) reads those variables to select next actions (e.g., choose frame index when a detection is found, iterate frames until an event is detected). The API objects (ImagePatch, VideoSegment) carry metadata (coordinates, centers, frame indices) that the program uses to update and reason about state. There is no formal belief-propagation or probabilistic update described.",

(3) Procedural program state (Python variables, lists, dicts) serves as the belief state; no learned belief model is used. (4) The approach handles partial observability in videos by searching frames (looping over frame_iterator), selecting frames where events are detected, and reasoning over associated frame indices, yielding strong temporal/causal performance despite no video training.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Answering visual queries is a complex task that requires both visual processing and reasoning. End-to-end models, the dominant approach for this task, do not explicitly differentiate between the two, limiting interpretability and generalization. Learning modular programs presents a promising alternative, but has proven challenging due to the difficulty of learning both the programs and modules simultaneously. We introduce ViperGPT, a framework that leverages codegeneration models to compose vision-and-language models into subroutines to produce a result for any query. ViperGPT utilizes a provided API to access the available modules, and composes them by generating Python code that is later executed. This simple approach requires no further training, and achieves state-of-the-art results across various complex visual tasks.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>How many muffins can each kid in Figure 1 (top) eat for it to be fair? To answer this, we might 1) find the children and the muffins in the image, 2) count how many there are of each, and 3) reason that 'fair' implies an even split, hence divide. People find it natural to compositionally combine individual steps together to understand the visual world. Yet, the dominant approach in the field of computer vision remains end-to-end models, which do not inherently leverage this compositional reasoning.</p>
<p>Although the field has made large progress on individual tasks such as object recognition and depth estimation, end-to-end approaches to complex tasks must learn to implicitly perform all tasks within the forward pass of a neural network. Not only does this fail to make use of the advances in fundamental vision tasks at different steps, it does not make use of the fact that computers can perform mathematical operations (e.g., division) easily without machine learning. We cannot trust neural models to generalize systematically to different numbers of muffins or children. End-</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>to-end models also produce fundamentally uninterpretable decisions - there is no way to audit the result of each step to diagnose failure. As models grow increasingly data and compute-hungry, this approach grows increasingly untenable. We would like to perform new tasks without additional training by recombining our existing models in new ways.</p>
<p>What limits us from creating such modular systems for more complex tasks? In previous years, the pioneering works of Neural Module Networks [2, 27, 19] attempted to decompose tasks into simpler modules. By training end-toend with modules rearranged in different ways for different problems, the hope was that each module would learn their appropriate function and thereby become reusable. However, numerous issues made this approach difficult to extend to the real world. In particular, program generation relied on hand-tuned natural language parsers [2], or otherwise required reinforcement learning from scratch and were thus difficult to optimize [19, 27]. In each case, program generation was highly domain-limited. Furthermore, learning the perceptual models jointly with the program generator made training even more difficult, often failing to produce the intended modular structure $[3,48]$.</p>
<p>In this work, we present ViperGPT ${ }^{1}$, a framework that overcomes these bottlenecks by leveraging code generating large language models (e.g. GPT-3 Codex [9]) to flexibly compose vision models based on any textual query that defines the task. It creates customized programs for each query that take images or videos as argument and return the result of the query for that image or video. We show that providing Codex an API exposing various visual capabilities (e.g. find, compute_depth), just as one might provide an engineer, is sufficient for the creation of these programs. The model's prior training on code enables it to reason about how to use these functions and implement the relevant logic. Our results demonstrate that this simple approach delivers remarkable zero-shot performance (i.e. without ever training on task specific images).</p>
<p>Our simple approach enjoys many benefits: it is 1) interpretable, as all the steps are explicit as code function calls</p>

<p>Figure 1. In-the-wild results. Given a visual input and a query, ViperGPT synthesizes a program, then executes it with the Python interpreter in order to produce the final answer. This figure shows both the generated code, and the result of intermediate variables during the execution. By composing pretrained modules, ViperGPT obtains answers that are both correct and interpretable for open-world queries.</p>
<p>with intermediate values that can be inspected; 2) logical, as it explicitly uses built-in Python logical and mathematical operators; 3) flexible, as it can easily incorporate any vision or language module, only requiring the specification of the associated module be added to the API; 4) compositional, decomposing tasks into smaller sub-tasks performed step-by-step; 5) adaptable to advances in the field, as improvements in any of the used modules will result in a direct improvement in our approach’s performance; 6) training-free, as it does not require to re-train (or finetune) a new model for every new task; and finally, 7) general, as it unifies all tasks into one system.</p>
<p>In summary, our contributions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>We propose a simple framework for solving complex visual queries by integrating code-generation models into vision with an API and the Python interpreter, with the benefits above.</li>
<li>We achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot results across tasks in visual grounding, image question answering, and video question-answering, showing this interpretability aids performance rather than hindering it.</li>
<li>To promote research in this direction, we develop a Python library enabling rapid development for program synthesis for visual tasks, which will be opensourced upon publication.</li>

<h2>2 Related Work</h2>
<p>Modular Vision. Our work takes inspiration from Neural Module Networks <em>[2, 27]</em>, who argue that complex vision tasks are fundamentally compositional and propose dividing them into atomic perceptual units. This visual reasoning procedure has been explored by a variety of works <em>[29, 57]</em>. Posterior efforts have focused on explicitly reasoning about the composition by separating the reasoning from the perception, with connections to neuro-symbolic methods <em>[19, 27, 62]</em>. These approaches are similar in spirit to ours, but require expensive supervision in the form of programs and end-to-end train the perception modules, which makes them not generalizable to different domains.</p>
<p>Due to the practical difficulty of using these methods, the field has primarily moved towards end-to-end all-in-one models <em>[1, 22, 23, 30]</em>. Such models currently obtain state-of-the-art results, and we compare to them in Section 4. Other recent works <em>[63, 45, 55, 35, 37, 15]</em> show that large pretrained models can be used together to great effect, but hand-specify the particular way models are combined.</p>
<p>Over the course of this project, a surge of interest in the area has resulted in a number of related manuscripts appearing on arXiv which use large language models (LLMs) for automatic module integration. In the natural language processing domain, they have been aimed at using external tools <em>[46, 40]</em>, or for structured reasoning using Codex <em>[34, 54, 14, 10]</em>. Concurrent work <em>[17]</em> generates a list</p>

<p>Figure 2. Method. ViperGPT is a framework for solving complex visual queries programmatically.</p>
<p>of pseudocode instructions and interprets them as a 'visual program,' relying on in-context learning from provided examples. Unlike them, we directly generate unrestricted Python code, which is much more flexible and enables us to demonstrate more advanced emergent abilities, such as control flow and math. Crucially, using Python allows us to leverage the strong prior knowledge Codex learns by training at scale from the Internet. Additionally, we evaluate on many established benchmarks measuring visual understanding and achieve top-performing zero-shot results.</p>
<p>Interpretability. The area of interpretability for complex queries in vision is extensive. Many approaches provide explanations in the form of pixel importance, à la Grad-CAM <em>[47, 65, 11, 41]</em>, some also providing textual explanations <em>[41]</em>. These are often post-hoc explanations rather than by construction, and do not give step-by-step reasoning including image crops and text. Hard attention in captioning <em>[59]</em> aims for a similar goal regarding intermediate image crops, similarly to our find module, but has proven difficult to incorporate into learning algorithms. See He et al. <em>[18]</em> for a complete overview.</p>
<p>Pretrained models. The perception and external knowledge modules used by ViperGPT are GLIP <em>[31]</em> for object detection, X-VLM <em>[64]</em> for text-image similarity (as it surpasses CLIP <em>[43]</em> at attribute detection <em>[5]</em>), MiDaS <em>[44]</em> for depth estimation, GPT-3 <em>[6]</em> for external knowledge, and BLIP-2 <em>[30]</em> for simple visual queries.</p>
<h2>3 Method</h2>
<p>We use notation following Johnson et al. <em>[27]</em>. Given a visual input $x$ and a textual query $q$ about its contents, we first synthesize a program $z=\pi(q)$ with a program generator $\pi$ given the query. We then apply the execution engine $r=\phi(x, z)$ to execute the program $z$ on the input $x$ and pro</p>

<p>duce a result <em>r</em>. Our framework is flexible, supporting image or videos as inputs <em>x</em>, questions or descriptions as queries <em>q</em>, and any type (<em>e.g</em>., text or image crops) as outputs <em>r</em>.</p>
<p>While prior work represents programs as graphs, like syntax trees [27] or dependency graphs [8], we represent the class of programs <em>z</em> ∈ Z directly through Python code, allowing our programs to capitalize on the expressivity and capabilities afforded by modern programming languages.</p>
<h3>3.1. Program Generation</h3>
<p>Johnson <em>et al</em>. [27] and other work in this direction [19, 62, 25] typically implement π with a neural network that is trained with either supervised or reinforcement learning in order to estimate programs from queries. However, these approaches have largely been unable to scale to in-the-wild settings because either a) the supervision in the form of programs cannot be collected at scale or b) the optimization required for finding the computational graph is prohibitive.</p>
<p>In our approach, we instead capitalize on LLMs for code generation in order to instantiate the program generator π that composes vision and language modules together. LLMs take as input a tokenized code sequence ("prompt") and autoregressively predict subsequent tokens. We use Codex [9], which has shown remarkable success on code generation tasks. Since we replace the optimization of π with an LLM, our approach obviates the need for task-specific training for program generation. Using Codex as the program generator and generating code directly in Python allows us to draw on training at scale on the Internet, where Python code is abundant.</p>
<p>To leverage LLMs in this way, we need to define a prompt that will sample programs <em>z</em> that compose and call</p>

<p>these modules as needed. Our prompt consists of an application programming interface (API), detailed in the following section, which we provide to the LLM as part of its input context. The final input to the LLM is a sequence of code text consisting of the API specification followed by the query for the sample under consideration. The expected output is a Python function definition as a string, which we then compile and execute.</p>
<h3>3.2. Modules and Their API</h3>
<p>Our prompt, included in the Appendix B, provides the API for different perceptual and knowledge modules, such as for object detection, depth estimation, or language model queries. From this prompt, we found that LLMs are able to induce correct programs <em>z</em> from the query <em>q</em>.</p>
<p>The API we provide defines two global classes ImagePatch and VideoSegment, which represent an image patch and a video segment respectively. Each module is implemented as a class method, which internally calls a pretrained model to compute the result. For example, the compute_depth method of ImagePatch returns an estimate of the median (relative) depth of the pixels in the image patch; we implement this with state-of-the-art large-scale models such as MiDaS [44]. We provide more details about the modules used in Section 4.</p>
<p>The API specifies the input and output types for each method it defines, as well as docstrings to explain the purpose of these functions in natural language. Like most APIs, it additionally provides examples that show how to use these classes and their functions, specified in the form of query-code pairs similarly to in-context learning [50, 6].</p>
<p>The input to Codex does not contain the full <em>implementation</em> of the API. Instead, it is given the <em>specification</em> for the API, including the function signatures and docstrings. Abstracting away the implementation details is beneficial for two reasons. First, LLM context windows are limited in size [6], making it infeasible to include the entire implementation. In addition, the abstraction makes code generation independent of changes made to the module implementation.</p>
<p>End-to-end perception modules are excellent when used in the right places, and ViperGPT strongly relies on them.</p>

<p>Figure 4. Compositional image question answering on GQA.</p>
<p>Analogous to dual-system models [28] in cognitive science, we argue that generated programs (System 2 - analytic) should be utilized to break down tasks that require multiple steps of reasoning into simpler components, where end-to-end perception modules (System 1 - pattern recognition) are the most effective approach. By composing end-to-end modules into programs, ViperGPT brings the System 2 capability of sequential processing to deep learning [4].</p>
<h3>3.3. Program Execution</h3>
<p>At execution time, the generated program z accepts an image or video as input and outputs a result r corresponding to the query provided to the LLM. To execute this program, previous work (e.g., [27]) learns an execution engine φ as a neural module network, composing various modules implemented by neural networks. Their modules are responsible for not only perceptual functions such as find, but also logical ones such as compare. They learn all neural modules together simultaneously end-to-end, which fails to enable systematic generalization [3] and results in modules that are not faithful to their intended tasks [48], compromising the interpretability of the model.</p>
<p>We provide a simple, performant alternative by using the Python interpreter in conjunction with modules implemented by large pretrained models. The Python interpreter enables logical operations while the pretrained models enable perceptual ones. Our approach guarantees faithfulness by construction.</p>
<p>The program is run with the Python interpreter; as such, its execution is a simple Python call. This means it can leverage all built-in Python functions like sort; control flow tools like for or if/else; and modules such as datetime or math. Notably, this does not require a custom interpreter, unlike prior approaches [17, 46] Another advantage of a fully Pythonic implementation is compatibility with a wide range of existing tools, such as PyTorch JIT [42].</p>
<p>In our implementation, each program in a generated batch is run simultaneously with multiprocessing. Our producer-consumer design [12] enables efficient GPU batching, reducing the memory and computation costs. Our code is made available at viper.cs.columbia.edu/.</p>
<h2>4. Evaluation</h2>
<p>ViperGPT is applicable to any tasks that query visual inputs with text. Unlike other work using large language models for vision tasks, the return values of our programs can be of arbitrary types, such as text, multiple choice selections, or image regions. We select four different evaluation settings to showcase the model's diverse capabilities in varied contexts without additional training. The tasks we consider are: 1) visual grounding, 2) compositional image question answering, 3) external knowledge-dependent image question answering, and 4) video causal and temporal reasoning.</p>
<p>We consider these tasks to roughly build on one another, with visual grounding being a prerequisite for compositional image question answering and so on. In the following sections, we explore the capabilities ViperGPT demonstrates in order to solve each task.</p>
<p>|  Accuracy (%) ↑ |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | </p>

<h3>4.1. Visual Grounding</h3>
<p>Visual grounding is the task of identifying the bounding box in an image that corresponds best to a given natural language query. Visual grounding tasks evaluate reasoning about spatial relationships and visual attributes. We consider this task first as it serves as the first bridge between text and vision: many tasks require locating complex queries past locating particular objects.</p>
<p>We provide ViperGPT with the API for the following modules (pretrained models in parentheses). find (GLIP [31]) takes as input an image and a short noun phrase (e.g. "car" or "golden retriever"), and returns a list of image patches containing the noun phrase. exists (GLIP [31]) takes as input an image and a short noun phrase and returns a boolean indicating whether an instance of that noun phrase is present in the image. Similarly, verify_property (XVLM [64]) takes as input an image, a noun phase representing an object, and an attribute representing a property of that object; it returns a boolean indicating whether the property is present in the image. best_image_match (X-VLM [64]) takes as input a list of image patches and a short noun phrase, and returns the image patch that best matches the noun phrase. Symmetric to this operation, best_text_match takes as input a list of noun phrases and one image, and returns the noun phrase that best matches the image. (This module is not necessary for visual grounding, but rather for tasks with text outputs; we describe it here for simplicity.) They are implemented using an image-text similarity model as in CLIP [43]. Finally, compute_depth (MiDaS [44]) computes the median depth of the image patch. We also define the function distance, which computes the pixel-distance between two patches, using only built-in Python tools.</p>
<p>For evaluation, we use the RefCOCO and RefCOCO+ datasets. The former allows for spatial relations while the latter does not, thereby providing different insights into ViperGPT's capabilities. We compare ViperGPT against end-to-end methods, and outperform other zero-shot methods on both datasets (see Table 1). We show examples ${ }^{2}$ in Figure 3. See Appendix A for more details about the experimental setup.</p>

<h3>4.2. Compositional Image Question Answering</h3>
<p>We also evaluate ViperGPT on image question answering. We focus on compositional question answering, which requires decomposing complex questions into simpler tasks. We use the GQA dataset [26], which was created to measure performance on complex compositional questions. Consider Figure 4 for example questions as well as our provided reasoning. Even if a question can be answered end-toend, it is both more interpretable and more human-aligned to provide intermediate reasoning rather than requiring the model to compress all steps into one forward pass; as our final result is constructed directly from the intermediate values, they provide a fully faithful interpretation of how the model came to its answer.</p>
<p>For GQA, we incorporate the module simple_query (BLIP-2 [31]), which handles basic queries that are not further decomposable, such as "What animal is this?" We also add the aforementioned best_text_match. This leads us to the best accuracy on GQA among zero-shot models (Table 4).</p>
<h3>4.3. External Knowledge-dependent Image Question Answering</h3>
<p>Many questions about images can only be answered correctly by integrating outside knowledge about the world. By equipping ViperGPT with a module to query external knowledge bases in natural language, it can combine knowledge with visual reasoning to handle such questions. We add a new module llm_query (GPT-3 [6]), which exploits text models as unstructured knowledge bases. We find that the combination of step-by-step reasoning from Codex along with external knowledge queried from GPT-3's text model achieves impressive performance in this setting.</p>
<p>We evaluate on the OK-VQA dataset [36], which is designed to evaluate models' ability to answer questions about images that require knowledge that cannot be found in the image. Items in this dataset often require more than one step of reasoning to produce a correct answer. For example, in Figure 5, one must first perceive from the image that</p>

<p>class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
        <strong>*</strong>*
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left : int
        An int describing the position of the left border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    lower : int
        An int describing the position of the bottom border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    right : int
        An int describing the position of the right border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    upper : int
        An int describing the position of the top border of the crop's bounding box in the original image.
    Methods
    find(object_name: str)-&gt;List[ImagePatch]
        Returns a list of new ImagePatch objects containing crops of the image centered around any objects found in the
        image matching the object.name.
    exists(object.name: str)-&gt;bool
        Returns True if the object specified by object.name is found in the image, and False otherwise.
    verify.property(property: str)-&gt;bool
        Returns True if the property is met, and False otherwise.
    best.text.match(option,list: List[str], prefix: str)-&gt;str
        Returns the string that best matches the image.
    simple.query(question: str=None)-&gt;str
        Returns the answer to a basic question asked about the image. If no question is provided, returns the answer
        to "What is this?".
    compute.depth()-&gt;float
        Returns the median depth of the image crop.
    crop(left: int, lower: int, right: int, upper: int)-&gt;ImagePatch
        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing a crop of the image at the given coordinates.

For the examples in Figure 1 we use the same API as the one used for the benchmarks, and the usage examples are taken from the benchmark APIs, combining them to have more generality. We do not add any other example, ViperGPT generalizes to the complex cases shown in Figure 1 just based on the provided API.</li>
