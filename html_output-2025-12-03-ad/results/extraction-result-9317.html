                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The metrics of general relativity generally fall into two categories: those which are solutions of the Einstein equations for a given source energy-momentum tensor and the “reverse engineered” metrics—metrics bespoke for a certain purpose. Their energy-momentum tensors are then calculated by inserting these into the Einstein equations. This latter approach has found frequent use when confronted with creative input from fiction, wormholes and warp drives being the most famous examples. In this paper, we again take inspiration from fiction and see what general relativity can tell us about the possibility of a gravitationally induced tractor beam. We base our construction on warp drives and show how versatile this ansatz alone proves to be. Not only can we easily find tractor beams (attracting objects), but repulsor/pressor beams are just as attainable, and a generalization to “stressor” beams is seen to present itself quite naturally. We show that all of these metrics would violate various energy conditions. This provides an opportunity to ruminate on the meaning of energy conditions as such and what we can learn about whether an arbitrarily advanced civilization might have access to such beams.</p>

<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<p>The metrics of general relativity generally fall into two categories: Those which are solutions of the Einstein equations for a given source energy-momentum tensor, and the "reverse engineered" metrics - metrics bespoke for a certain purpose. Their energymomentum tensors are then calculated by inserting these into the Einstein equations. This latter approach has found frequent use when confronted with creative input from fiction, wormholes and warp drives being the most famous examples. In this paper, we shall again take inspiration from fiction, and see what general relativity can tell us about the possibility of a gravitationally induced tractor beam. We will base our construction on warp drives and show how versatile this ansatz alone proves to be. Not only can we easily find tractor beams (attracting objects); repulsor/pressor beams are just as attainable, and a generalization to "stressor" beams is seen to present itself quite naturally. We show that all of these metrics would violate various energy conditions. This will provide an opportunity to ruminate on the meaning of energy conditions as such, and what we can learn about whether an arbitrarily advanced civilization might have access to such beams.</p>

<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>Within the context of standard general relativity, there has now been over 33 years of serious theoretical work on the possibility of "traversable wormholes" [1-5], 29 years of recent work on "time machines" [6-12], and over 27 years of work on the theoretical possibility of "warp drives" [13-18]. These analyses, and their subsequent refinements, are based on "reverse engineering" the space-time metric to encapsulate some potentially interesting physics, and then using the Einstein equations to deduce what the stress-energy tensor must be to support these space-times [1, 5, 19, 20].</p>
<p>A distinct century-old trope within science fiction is the tractor/pressor beam [21-23]. To the best of our knowledge, no really focussed work has been carried out on putting tractor/pressor beams into a coherent general relativistic context. (Acoustic tractor beams [24-27], matter wave tractor beams [28], or optical tweezers [29], seem to be the closest one gets in the current scientific literature.)</p>
<p>Herein we shall analyze tractor/pressor/stressor beams from a general relativistic perspective. The basic idea is to significantly modify and adapt the "warp drive" spacetimes [13-18] in a suitable manner, giving them a "beam like" profile, and analysing the induced stresses and forces. Instead of a spaceship riding inside a warp bubble, we will assume that the warp field is in the form of a "beam" generated to pull/repel a target. The mechanisms by which this field is generated is beyond the scope of this article. We will assume that some arbitrarily advanced civilisation [30,31] might have developed the appropriate beam generation technology.</p>
<p>Specifically, we shall assume for convenience that the modified warp drive space-times are oriented in the $z$ direction and give them a uniform transverse profile in the $x$ and $y$ directions, typically of the form $f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$. Doing so, one obtains a "beam" rather than a "warp bubble". Note that in this work we will let the $(t, z)$ dependence remain arbitrary.</p>
<p>As always, when working in this area of speculative physics, including wormholes, and warp drives, and now tractor/pressor/stressor beams, a major justification for undertaking this exercise is to push general relativity to the breaking point; in the hope that the resulting wreckage will tell us something interesting - possibly even about quantum gravity $[5,16]$.</p>
<p>After first analysing Natário's generic warp drive case [14], we will consider three special cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>We modify the Alcubierre fixed-flow-direction warp field.</li>
<li>We modify the Natário zero-expansion warp field.</li>
<li>We modify the zero-vorticity warp field.</li>
</ol>
<p>We shall also illustrate each of these three cases with some specific examples based on beams with a Gaussian profile.</p>
<p>A recurring theme in the analysis will be the use of the classical point-wise energy conditions (null, weak, strong, and dominant; abbreviated NEC, WEC, SEC, and DEC, respectively) [32-35]. They can be considered as an attempt to remain as agnostic as possible about underlying equations of state. While the energy conditions do not seem to be fundamental physics, they are at the very least a very good sanity check on just how weird the physics is getting [33, 36, 37]. We already know of examples of violations at microscopic scales (e.g., Hawking radiation) and mesoscopic scales (e.g., Casimir effect). No macroscopic violations of the energy conditions are known up to this point, except at truly cosmological scales - and they violate only some of the energy conditions (the accelerated expansion of the universe violates the strong and dominant energy conditions, but not the null and weak energy conditions [38-41]). Therefore, besides the violation of the energy conditions not being an absolute prohibition, it is an indication that one should look very carefully at the underlying physics [36, 37]. For more background on the energy conditions see [42-69].</p>
<p>For the sake of full transparency, we should also mention that our interest in these topics was rekindled and inspired by three recent papers [70-72]. Unfortunately, significant parts of those three papers are incorrect, misguided, and/or misleading. See reference [18] for details.</p>
<h1>2 When things need to be moved</h1>
<p>One of Wheeler's adages that became standard general relativity folklore is the famous saying that "space-time tells matter how to move; matter tells space-time how to curve". From many a practical point of view, questions regarding objects' movement are less about the how and more about the ought - things are wanted elsewhere from where they are now. It is this logistical perspective that we shall address in the following: How can we ensure that general relativity does the job of moving an object (like a cow, [preferably a spherical cow, in vacuum], or a Corellian CR90 corvette) for us?</p>
<p>The key ingredient will be to limit ourselves to test field cases, where we neglect the mass of the objects we want to move, how they interact with space-time and with the matter we put in space-time to move them. This reduces the core physics question to one of forces: We want to use the pressures encoded in the stress-energy tensor of a beam-like field to move target test masses.</p>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Forces (above) and energy densities (below) for Gaussian beam profiles. The field is assumed to be sourced by someone on the left at negative $z$, the target - a flat cow in the tractor field space-time - on the right at positive $z$. Choosing the source and target provides for a distinction between tractor and pressor (or repulsor) fields. Details concerning this particular beam configuration can be found in section 6.2.1. The parameters of equation (6.37) that we have chosen are: $A=0.5, B=C=1.0$. The purple line in the density plot for the zero-vorticity beam indicates the location where the energy density is zero.</p>
<p>The primary force-related calculation we shall undertake is this: If the beam is pointed in the $z$ direction, then one calculates the stress-energy component $T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)$, and integrates it over the entire transverse $x-y$ plane to find the net force:</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)= \pm \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{z z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y
$$</p>
<p>Here the + sign corresponds to a beam impinging on the target from the left, whereas the - sign corresponds to a beam impinging on the target from the right. There is an approximation being made here, that the beam is narrow with respect to the target, so that it is a good approximation to integrate over the entire transverse $x-y$ plane. If the beam is instead wide compared to the size of the target then one should instead use the approximation</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)= \pm T_{z z}(t, 0,0, z) A
$$</p>
<p>Here $T_{z z}(t, 0,0, z)$ is the on-axis stress, and $A$ is the cross sectional area of the target. For a beam of intermediate widths, (comparable to the size of the target), one would in principle need to calculate</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)= \pm \int_{A} T_{z z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y
$$</p>
<p>but this is unnecessarily complicated for the primary issues we wish to address.
The quantity $F(t, z)$ is the net force the beam exerts on some target located at some position $z$ at time $t$. For convenience we shall henceforth assume that the field is generated by someone positioned on the left, and that the target be positioned to the right of the generator, (see Figure 1), thus allowing us to restrict attention to the plus sign in equations (2.1) - (2.3). We shall furthermore assume that the target will move under the influence of the field, while the "generator" will not, and-as mentioned above-both behave as test fields. This setup provides for a simple characterization of the effect of the field: If $F(t, z)&lt;0$, corresponding to attraction, we call this a tractor beam. If $F(t, z)&gt;0$, corresponding to repulsion, we call this a pressor beam ${ }^{1}$. On the other hand, the definition of a stressor beam can be a little trickier. The reason for this being that, independent of the overall sign of $F(t, z)$, one can quite generally define a beam which has significantly varying pressure across the cross-sectional area of the target. In this way, there might be a certain ambiguity about when a specific beam would be considered to be a tractor/pressor or a stressor beam, since this would depend on the properties of the target material - such as its elasticity and ultimate yield strength, and so on.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>However, for most "applications", we expect the $T_{z z}$ component for a tractor (pressor) beam to not vary too greatly over its region of influence on the target. A quick measure of when a beam would behave as a stressor beam is given by:</p>
<p>$$
\max <em z="z">{A}\left(T</em>\right)-\min <em z="z">{A}\left(T</em>
$$}\right) \gg \sigma_{\text {material }</p>
<p>Here $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the target exposed to the beam, and $\sigma_{\text {material }}$ is the ultimate yield stress of the material making up the target.</p>
<p>While equations (2.1)-(2.3) are universally valid, both for standard general relativity, and for modified theories of gravity, we will focus mainly on standard general relativity. Therefore, using the Einstein equations, we have for a narrow beam in terms of the Einstein tensor:</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} G_{z z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y
$$</p>
<p>while for a wide beam</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi} G_{z z}(t, 0,0, z) A
$$</p>
<p>These are the key equations we will be using in the following sections.
As usual, we are using geometrodynamic units, where $G_{\text {Newton }} \rightarrow 1$ and $c \rightarrow 1$. If one wishes to reinstate SI units, then in terms of the Stoney force $F_{*}=c^{4} / G_{\text {Newton }}[73-77]^{2}$ one has</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=\frac{F_{*}}{8 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} G_{z z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=\frac{F_{*}}{8 \pi} G_{z z}(t, 0,0, z) A
$$</p>
<p>It is worthwhile mentioning that the magnitude of the Stoney force is truly enormous - some $1.2 \times 10^{44}$ Newtons. Accordingly, relatively small spacetime curvatures (weakfield gravity) can still lead to significant human-scale forces and stresses. It is beyond the scope of the present article to consider just how weak the weak fields can be before the test field approximations for the target mass break down.</p>

<h1>3 Natário's generic warp field</h1>
<h3>3.1 Kinematics</h3>
<p>Our tractor/pressor/stressor beams will be based on modifications of Natário style generic warp drives [14-18]. The generic form of the space-time metric line element is</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{d} s^{2}=-\mathrm{d} t^{2}+\delta_{i j}\left(\mathrm{~d} x^{i}-v^{i}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} t\right)\left(\mathrm{d} x^{j}-v^{j}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} t\right)
$$</p>
<p>Note that the lapse is unity, $N \rightarrow 1$, the spatial slices are flat, $g_{i j} \rightarrow \delta_{i j}$, and the "flow" vector $v^{i}(t, x, y, z)$ is the negative of what is (in the ADM decomposition) usually called the "shift" vector [78-81].</p>
<p>A kinematically useful quantity is the vorticity of the flow field,</p>
<p>$$
\vec{\omega}=\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \vec{v}
$$</p>
<p>and its square, $\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}$.
The constant- $t$ spatial slices have covariant normal $n_{a}=\partial_{a} t=(-1,0,0,0)_{a}$, whose contravariant components are the future-pointing 4 -velocity $n^{a}=\left(1, v^{i}\right)$. Observers that "go with the flow", moving with 4 -velocity $n^{a}$, are geodesics, and are often called Eulerian.</p>
<p>The intrinsic geometry of the spatial slices is flat, whereas the extrinsic geometry is characterized by the second fundamental form $K_{i j}=v_{(i, j)}$. The components of the Riemann tensor can then be evaluated in terms of the extrinsic curvature and the normal. For details see, for instance, [18, 78-81]. For even more additional background on "warp field" space-times see references [82-97].</p>
<h3>3.2 Stress-energy tensor</h3>
<p>For current purposes, adopting the unit-lapse and flat-spatial-slices conditions, key results for the components of the stress-energy tensor are [18, 78-80]:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gauss-Codazzi equations yield the Eulerian energy density:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{G_{a n}}{8 \pi}=\frac{G_{a b} n^{a} n^{b}}{8 \pi}=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left(K^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $K=K_{i j} \delta^{i j}=\operatorname{tr}(K)$ and $\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)=\left(K^{2}\right)<em i="i" k="k">{i j} \delta^{i j}=K</em>$.} \delta^{k l} K_{l j} \delta^{i j</p>
<p>In the current context this can be recast as [18]:</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left{\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot{\vec{v} K-(\vec{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}) \vec{v}}-\frac{1}{2}(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega})\right}
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gauss-Mainardi equations yield the Eulerian energy flux:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
f_{i}=\frac{G_{n i}}{8 \pi}=\frac{G_{a i} n^{a}}{8 \pi}=\frac{1}{16 \pi}(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \vec{v}))_{i}
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>The $3 \times 3$ stress tensor is somewhat messier, and can be expressed in terms of the extrinsic curvature and its Lie derivatives [18]:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
T_{i j}=\frac{G_{i j}}{8 \pi}=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left(\mathcal{L}<em i="i" j="j">{n} K</em>\right)}+K K_{i j}-2\left(K^{2<em n="n">{i j}-\left(\mathcal{L}</em>\right)
$$} K+\frac{1}{2} K^{2}+\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right) \delta_{i j</p>
<p>For the various explicit examples we consider below, we shall instead often use $a b$ initio calculations instead of this general (but relatively intractable) result.</p>
<ul>
<li>In contrast, the trace of the $3 \times 3$ stress tensor is somewhat easier to deal with. For the average pressure $\bar{p}$ we have [18]:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\bar{p}=\frac{T_{i j} \delta^{i j}}{3}=-\frac{1}{24 \pi}\left(2 \nabla_{a}\left(K n^{a}\right)-\frac{3}{2} K^{2}+\frac{3}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>This implies</p>
<p>$$
\bar{p}=\rho-\frac{1}{12 \pi} \nabla_{a}\left(K n^{a}\right)
$$</p>
<p>These are the key stress-energy components we need for the current task. For further discussion on these and related issues see references [18, 78-80].</p>
<p>An immediate consequence of these general results is that once appropriate fall-off conditions are imposed at spatial infinity one has</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\int \rho \mathrm{d}^{3} x &amp; =-\frac{1}{32 \pi} \int(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}) \mathrm{d}^{3} x \leq 0 \
\int(\rho+p) \mathrm{d}^{3} x &amp; =-\frac{1}{16 \pi} \int(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}) \mathrm{d}^{3} x \leq 0
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>This implies that violations of the WEC and NEC are unavoidable [18], and we shall see similar results repeatedly recurring in the subsequent discussion.</p>
<h1>4 Beam profile</h1>
<p>In this section, we will discuss the kinematics and general properties of the stress-energy tensor of such beams, including the forces key to our interpretation of them.</p>
<h3>4.1 Beam kinematics</h3>
<p>For our purposes we shall choose a factorized "beam" profile for the flow vector, one that respects axial symmetry around the $z$-axis:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; v_{x}(t, x, y, z)=k(t, z) x h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \
&amp; v_{y}(t, x, y, z)=k(t, z) y h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \
&amp; v_{z}(t, x, y, z)=v(t, z) f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>We shall refer to $f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$ and $h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$ as profile functions, whereas $v(t, z)$ and $k(t, z)$ will be referred to as envelope functions.</p>
<p>Note the explicit presence of $x$ and $y$ in the flow components $v_{x}$ and $v_{y}$, precisely to maintain axial symmetry. Furthermore,</p>
<p>$$
\sqrt{v_{x}(t, x, y, z)^{2}+v_{y}(t, x, y, z)^{2}}=k(t, z) \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}} h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Useful definitions of the average transverse width of the beam are to consider</p>
<p>$$
W_{x y}^{2}=\frac{\int\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\left(v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y}{\int\left(v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y}=\frac{\int\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2} h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y}{\int\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y}
$$</p>
<p>and/or</p>
<p>$$
W_{z}^{2}=\frac{\int\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\left(v_{z}^{2}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y}{\int\left(v_{z}^{2}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y}=\frac{\int\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y}{\int f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)^{2} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y}
$$</p>
<p>Both of these characterizations of average width depend only on the profile functions, not on the envelope functions.</p>
<p>Far away from the beam axis, as $x^{2}+y^{2} \rightarrow \infty$, we will demand that both profile functions tend to zero: $f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \rightarrow 0$ and $h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \rightarrow 0$, in order that the beam asymptotically reduces to flat Minkowski space. All of the $t$ and $z$ dependence is encoded in the two functions $v(t, z)$ and $k(t, z)$. Since one wants the beam to be of finite length, and not stretch all the way across the universe, one should demand both $\lim <em _infty="\infty" _pm="\pm" _rightarrow="\rightarrow" z="z">{z \rightarrow \pm \infty} v(t, z) \rightarrow 0$ and $\lim </em> k(t, z) \rightarrow 0$, again ensuring an asymptotic approach to Minkowski space.</p>
<p>More precisely, we shall demand sufficiently rapid fall-off at spatial infinity, which will then also allow integration by parts unrestricted by boundary terms. We shall also enforce smooth on-axis behaviour by demanding that the profile functions and their derivatives be finite on the beam axis. These structural assumptions for the flow vector is basically our definition of what we mean by a "beam" directed along the $z$-axis.</p>
<p>The previously introduced vorticity (3.2) for our beam geometry reduces to:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \omega_{x}=\partial_{y} v_{z}-\partial_{z} v_{y}=-y\left{\partial_{z} k(t, z) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)-2 v(t, z) f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right} \
&amp; \omega_{y}=-\partial_{x} v_{z}+\partial_{y} v_{y}=x\left{\partial_{z} k(t, z) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)-2 v(t, z) f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right} \
&amp; \omega_{z}=\partial_{x} v_{y}-\partial_{y} v_{x}=0
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The square of the vorticity,</p>
<p>$$
\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}=\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\left{\partial_{z} k(t, z) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)-2 v(t, z) f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right}^{2}
$$</p>
<p>will show up quite often in subsequent calculations.</p>
<h1>4.2 Stress-energy basics</h1>
<p>If we now additionally impose the factorization conditions (4.1)-(4.2)-(4.3) appropriate to a beam geometry, then the axial symmetry imposes additional constraints on the stress-energy tensor. Specifically:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{T_{x x}-T_{y y}}{T_{x y}}=\frac{x^{2}-y^{2}}{x y}
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
\frac{T_{x z}}{T_{y z}}=\frac{T_{n x}}{T_{n y}}=\frac{x}{y}
$$</p>
<p>This implies in particular that</p>
<p>$$
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
T_{x x} &amp; T_{x y} \
T_{x y} &amp; T_{y y}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
x^{2} &amp; x y \
x y &amp; y^{2}
\end{array}\right] \mathcal{F}<em 2="2">{1}(t, x, y, z)+\left[\begin{array}{ll}
1 &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; 1
\end{array}\right] \mathcal{F}</em>(t, x, y, z)
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
T_{x z} &amp; T_{y z}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
x &amp; y
\end{array}\right] \mathcal{F}_{3}(t, x, y, z)
$$</p>
<p>Similarly, for the $x$-directed and $y$-directed fluxes, we have:</p>
<p>$$
\left[\begin{array}{ll}
f_{x} &amp; f_{y}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
T_{n x} &amp; T_{n y}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ll}
x &amp; y
\end{array}\right] \mathcal{F}_{4}(t, z, y, z)
$$</p>
<p>The $\mathcal{F}<em i="i">{i}(t, x, y, z)$ are specific scalar functions that can be explicitly calculated when required. However, the $\mathcal{F}</em>(t, x, y, z)$.}(t, x, y, z)$ are not the most interesting quantities for our purposes. We shall instead be more focussed on the comoving energy density $\rho(t, x, y, z)$, the stress-energy component $T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)$, the flux component $f_{z}(t, x, y, z)$ directed along the beam axis, and the average stress $\bar{p</p>
<p>We now continue our calculations using the generic beam-like flow (4.1)-(4.2)-(4.3). As yet, we impose no extra restriction on the four functions $v(t, z), k(t, z), f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$, and $h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$, apart from the previously mentioned asymptotic conditions. Namely that $f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \rightarrow 0$ and $h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \rightarrow 0$ away from the beam axis and both $\lim <em _infty="\infty" _pm="\pm" _rightarrow="\rightarrow" z="z">{z \rightarrow \pm \infty} v(t, z) \rightarrow 0$ and $\lim </em> k(t, z) \rightarrow 0$.</p>
<h1>4.3 Force</h1>
<p>In order to calculate the force (2.1), let us now investigate $T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)$ for this factorized flow, and integrate this over the $x-y$ plane. For $T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)$ we find:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi}{ &amp; N_{1}(x, y) v(t, z)^{2}+N_{2}(x, y) v(t, z) \partial_{z} k(t, z)+N_{3}(x, y)\left[\partial_{z} k(t, z)\right]^{2} \
&amp; \left.+N_{4}(x, y) \partial_{t} k(t, z)+N_{5}(x, y) k(t, z)^{2}\right}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Here, using the shorthand $u=x^{2}+u^{2}$, we have:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; N_{1}(x, y)=-3 u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \
&amp; N_{2}(x, y)=-2[u f(u) h(u)]^{\prime}+u h(u) f^{\prime}(u) \
&amp; N_{3}(x, y)=\frac{1}{4} u[h(u)]^{2} \
&amp; N_{4}(x, y)=-2[u h(u)]^{\prime} \
&amp; N_{5}(x, y)=-3\left[u h(u)^{2}\right]^{\prime}-4\left[u^{2} h(u) h^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Without detailed calculation we can immediately deduce:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{1}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&lt;0, \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{2}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\text { indefinite } \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{3}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&gt;0, \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{4}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{5}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>It is worth noting that</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{1}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y &amp; =-3 \pi \int_{0}^{\infty} u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{2}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y &amp; =\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} u h(u) f^{\prime}(u) \mathrm{d} u
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} N_{3}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4} u[h(u)]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u
$$</p>
<p>Using this, we find that in the narrow beam approximation</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
F(t, z) &amp; =\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{z z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \
&amp; =-\frac{1}{2} v(t, z)^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u+\frac{1}{8} \int_{0}^{\infty} u\left[v(t, z) f^{\prime}(u)+\frac{1}{2} \partial_{z} k(t, z) h(u)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>This is a sum of negative definite and positive definite terms, thus allowing the generic beam to potentially be fine-tuned as either a tractor or a pressor (or even a stressor).</p>
<p>In contrast, in the wide beam approximation we need to evaluate $T_{z z}(t, 0,0, z)$. Note</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
N_{1}(0,0)=0, \quad N_{2}(0,0)=-2 f(0) h(0), \quad N_{3}(0,0)=0 \
N_{4}(0,0)=-2 h(0), \quad N_{5}(0,0)=-3 h(0)^{2}
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>Consequently</p>
<p>$$
T_{z z}(t, 0,0, z)=-\frac{h(0)}{8 \pi}\left{2 f(0) v(t, z) \partial_{z} k(t, z)+2 \partial_{t} k(t, z)+3 h(0) k(t, z)^{2}\right}
$$</p>
<p>So in the wide-beam approximation the force exerted on the target is</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=-\frac{h(0)}{8 \pi}\left{2 f(0) v(t, z) \partial_{z} k(t, z)+2 \partial_{t} k(t, z)+3 h(0) k(t, z)^{2}\right} A
$$</p>
<p>This is of indefinite sign, depending delicately on the envelope functions, potentially allowing either tractor/pressor behaviour.</p>
<h1>4.4 Flux</h1>
<p>The flux in the $z$-direction, as defined in equation (3.5), is given by:</p>
<p>$$
f_{z}(t, x, y, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left{-\partial_{z} k(t, z)[u h(u)]^{\prime}+2 v(t, z)\left[u f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime}\right}
$$</p>
<p>Thence,</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} f_{z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\frac{1}{8} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left{-\partial_{z} k(t, z)[u h(u)]^{\prime}+2 v(t, z)\left[u f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime}\right} \mathrm{d} u=0
$$</p>
<p>For the $x$-direction</p>
<p>$$
f_{x}(t, x, y, z)=-\frac{x}{8 \pi}\left{\partial_{z} v(t, z) f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)-\frac{1}{2} \partial_{z}^{2} k(t, z) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right}
$$</p>
<p>Anti-symmetry under $x \longleftrightarrow-x$ now yields</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} f_{x}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
$$</p>
<p>Similarly, for the $y$-direction</p>
<p>$$
f_{y}(t, x, y, z)=-\frac{y}{8 \pi}\left{\partial_{z} v(t, z) f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)-\frac{1}{2} \partial_{z}^{2} k(t, z) y h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right}
$$</p>
<p>and again by appealing to anti-symmetry,</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} f_{y}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
$$</p>
<p>Consequently, for the general tractor/pressor/stressor beam we always have the net flux integrating to zero:</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} f_{i}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
$$</p>
<p>Thence, at least in the narrow-beam approximation, we never need to worry about the net fluxes impinging on the target, they always quietly cancel. However, even if the net fluxes seen by Eulerian observers cancel, there might be significant fluctuations around zero over the cross-sectional area of the target. For instance, on axis we have</p>
<p>$$
\vec{f}(t, 0,0, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left{-\partial_{z} k(t, z) h(0)+2 v(t, z) f^{\prime}(0)\right} \hat{z}
$$</p>
<p>It is now the envelope functions $v(t, z)$ and $k(t, z)$ that primarily drive the localized on-axis fluxes in the wide-beam approximation.</p>
<h1>4.5 Off-diagonal stress components</h1>
<p>Similar steps can be applied to equation (4.14) concerning the $T_{x z}$ and $T_{y z}$ components:</p>
<p>$$
T_{x z}(t, x, y, z)=x \mathcal{F}<em y="y" z="z">{3}(t, x, y, z), \quad T</em>(t, x, y, z)
$$}(t, x, y, z)=y \mathcal{F}_{3</p>
<p>implying (using anti-symmetry under $x \longleftrightarrow-x$ and $y \longleftrightarrow-y$ respectively)</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{x z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{y z}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
$$</p>
<p>Finally, from equation (4.13) we get:</p>
<p>$$
T_{x y}(t, x, y, z)=x y \mathcal{F}_{1}(t, x, y, z)
$$</p>
<p>implying (now using either anti-symmetry under $x \longleftrightarrow-x$, or anti-symmetry under $y \longleftrightarrow-y)$</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{x y}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
$$</p>
<p>Combining all the above, the integral $\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{\hat{a} \hat{b}} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y$ is purely diagonal, all off-diagonal elements vanish:</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{\hat{a} \hat{b}} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} \rho \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{x x} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{x x} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} T_{z z} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y
\end{array}\right]
$$</p>
<p>This really is just a consequence of the assumed axial symmetry of our beam. These observations have the effect of focussing our attention on the diagonal components of the (integrated) stress-energy.</p>
<h3>4.6 Eulerian energy density</h3>
<p>For the Eulerian comoving energy density in this generic beam we find:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho(t, x, y, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi}{ &amp; R_{1}(x, y) v(t, z)^{2}+R_{2}(x, y) v(t, z) \partial_{z} k(t, z)+R_{3}(x, y) k(t, z) \partial_{z} v(t, z) \
&amp; \left.+R_{4}(x, y)\left[\partial_{z} k(t, z)\right]^{2}+R_{5}(x, y) k(t, z)^{2}\right}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; R_{1}(x, y)=-u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \
&amp; R_{2}(x, y)=-u h(u) f^{\prime}(u) \
&amp; R_{3}(x, y)=2 f(u)[u h(u)]^{\prime} \
&amp; R_{4}(x, y)=-u h(u)^{2} / 4 \
&amp; R_{5}(x, y)=\left[u h(u)^{2}\right]^{\prime}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Then, after an integration by parts,</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} R_{3}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=2 \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} R_{2}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=-2 \pi \int_{0}^{\infty} u h(u) f^{\prime}(u)
$$</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} R_{5}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0
$$</p>
<p>Thence,</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} \rho(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y= &amp; \frac{1}{8}\left{\partial_{z}[v(t, z) k(t, z)] \int_{0}^{\infty} u h(u) f^{\prime}(u)\right. \
&amp; -\left[v(t, z)^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u+k(t, z) \partial_{z} v(t, z) \int_{0}^{\infty} u f^{\prime}(u) h(u) \mathrm{d} u\right. \
&amp; \left.\left.+\frac{1}{4}\left[\partial_{z} k(t, z)^{2}\right] \int_{0}^{\infty} u h(u)^{2} \mathrm{~d} u\right]\right}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Now we also integrate over $z$ and apply appropriate boundary conditions at $z= \pm \infty$ (where the beam has to switch off by definition) to discard the first term, which is a total derivative. Then,</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \rho(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z=-\frac{1}{8} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} &amp; \left{v(t, z)^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u\right. \
&amp; +k(t, z) \partial_{z} v(t, z) \int_{0}^{\infty} u f^{\prime}(u) h(u) \mathrm{d} u \
&amp; \left.+\frac{1}{4}\left[\partial_{z} k(t, z)^{2}\right] \int_{0}^{\infty} u h(u)^{2} \mathrm{~d} u\right} \mathrm{d} z
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<h1>4.7 Weak energy condition</h1>
<p>This puts us into a good position to have a first look at an energy condition, this time the WEC. Let us do another integration by parts, again invoking suitable boundary conditions, to replace $\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} k(t, z) \partial_{z} v(t, z) \mathrm{d} z \rightarrow-\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} v(t, z) \partial_{z} k(t, z) \mathrm{d} z$.</p>
<p>But this is now actually a perfect square:</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \rho(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z=-\frac{1}{8} \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} u\left[f^{\prime}(u) v(t, z)-\frac{1}{2} h(u) \partial_{z} k(t, z)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} z \mathrm{~d} u \leq 0
$$</p>
<p>The integrand appearing above is just $\frac{1}{4}$ of the square of the vorticity $(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega})$, see equation (4.10), so that this is equivalent to</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \rho(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z=-\frac{1}{32} \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}) \mathrm{d} z \mathrm{~d} u \leq 0
$$</p>
<p>This should not come as a surprise, given it is just equation (3.9).
Accordingly, in this generic tractor/pressor/stressor beam configuration, if the Eulerian comoving energy density is positive anywhere, then it must be negative somewhere else - so the WEC is certainly violated.</p>
<h1>4.8 Null energy condition</h1>
<p>Now consider the NEC: Take equation (3.8) and integrate over all space. Note</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \nabla_{a}\left(K n^{a}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z &amp; =\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\left{\partial_{t} K+\partial_{i}\left(K v^{i}\right)\right} \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z \
&amp; =\partial_{t} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} K \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z+\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \partial_{i}\left(K v^{i}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z \
&amp; =\partial_{t} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \partial_{i} v^{i} \mathrm{~d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z+\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \partial_{i}\left(K v^{i}\right) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z \
&amp; =\partial_{t} 0+0 \
&amp; =0
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Thence,</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \bar{p}(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \rho(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z
$$</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}{\rho(t, x, y, z)+\bar{p}(t, x, y, z)} \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z=2 \int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}} \rho(t, x, y, z) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y \mathrm{~d} z \leq 0
$$</p>
<p>(We have already seen in the previous subsection that this last quantity is nonpositive.)
Accordingly, in this generic tractor/pressor/stressor beam configuration, if the quantity $(\rho+\bar{p})$ is positive anywhere, then it must be negative somewhere else - so the NEC is certainly violated.</p>
<p>Now, given that the NEC is the weakest of all standard, classical, point-wise energy conditions, we have that all the other energy conditions will also be violated. This has to hold for all tractor/pressor/stressor configurations based on modifications of the generic Natário warp drive. Furthermore, this is completely in accord with what we saw happen for generic warp drive space-times [18].</p>
<h1>5 Special Cases</h1>
<p>We now consider three special cases that link our tractor/pressor/stressor discussion back to various previous warp drive analyses [13-18]. The connections between the envelope and profile functions of the generic Natário case described by equations (4.1)(4.3) and those appearing in these special cases is summarised in table 1.</p>

<p>Table 1: A summary of the connection between the generic Natário metric, its envelope functions $k$ and $v$, and its profile functions $h$ and $f$ on the one hand, and the various functions appearing in the special cases considered section 5.</p>
<h3>5.1 Modified Alcubierre warp flow</h3>
<p>For this particular special case we will assume the field to be oriented along a fixed direction, for convenience taken to be the $z$ direction. This corresponds to taking the flow field to be:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; v_{x}(t, x, y, z)=0 \
&amp; v_{y}(t, x, y, z)=0 \
&amp; v_{z}(t, x, y, z)=v(t, z) f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>For this modified Alcubierre flow field the vorticity is</p>
<p>$$
\vec{\omega}=\left(\partial_{y} v_{z},-\partial_{x} v_{z}, 0\right)=(y,-x, 0) 2 v(t, z) f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>and hence</p>
<p>$$
\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}=4 v(t, z)^{2}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\left[f^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right]^{2}
$$</p>
<p>Now, using the result that for the Alcubierre warp field $T_{z z}=3 \rho$, obtained in [17], a standard computation yields $[13,16-18]$ :</p>
<p>$$
T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)=3 \rho(t, x, y, z)=-\frac{3}{32 \pi}\left{\left(\partial_{x} v_{z}\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y} v_{z}\right)^{2}\right}=-\frac{3}{8 \pi}(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}) \leq 0
$$</p>
<p>This is already enough to guarantee that both the weak energy condition (WEC) and null energy condition (NEC) are violated in this space-time [17, 18]. Calculating the net force we obtain for a narrow beam:</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=-\frac{3}{32 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\left[\left(\partial_{x} v_{z}\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y} v_{z}\right)^{2}\right] \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&lt;0
$$</p>
<p>But, given our factorization assumption, the stress reduces to</p>
<p>$$
T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)=-\frac{3}{32 \pi} v(t, z)^{2}\left{\left(\partial_{x} f\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y} f\right)^{2}\right}&lt;0
$$</p>
<p>Under this assumption the force factorizes to</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=-\frac{3}{32 \pi} v(t, z)^{2} \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}\left[\left(\partial_{x} f\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y} f\right)^{2}\right] \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&lt;0
$$</p>
<p>That is, using $u=x^{2}+y^{2}$,</p>
<p>$$
F(t, z)=-\frac{3}{8} v(t, z)^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} u\left[f^{\prime}(u)\right]^{2} \mathrm{~d} u&lt;0
$$</p>
<p>This is always a tractor beam. The $x-y$ integral is just some positive dimensionless number characterizing the shape of the beam. (Recall that our convention was to always put the target to the right of the generator. If we flip target and generator, so that the target is now on the left and the beam impinges on the target from the right, then there is a sign flip for the force $F(t, z)$, and with $F(t, z)&gt;0$ the target is still attracted to the generator.)</p>
<p>If we instead assume a wide beam, one can immediately deduce that in this case equation (4.31) will always reduce to zero, as either $k$ or $h$ is zero.</p>
<h1>5.2 Zero-expansion beam</h1>
<p>Now consider a zero-expansion flow field subject to $\partial_{i} v^{i}=0$. Starting with the generic flow field appropriate to an axisymmetric beam, we have:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
v_{x}(t, x, y, z) &amp; =k(t, z) x h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \
v_{y}(t, x, y, z) &amp; =k(t, z) y h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \
v_{z}(t, x, y, z) &amp; =v(t, z) f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Then, in order to ensure zero expansion, we must enforce</p>
<p>$$
\partial_{i} v^{i}=\partial_{z} v(t, z) f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)+2 k(t, z)\left{h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)+\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) h^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right}=0
$$</p>
<p>Separating variables, one finds</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\partial_{z} v(t, z)}{k(t, z)}=-\frac{2\left[h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)+\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) h^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right]}{f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}=C
$$</p>
<p>for some separation constant $C$.
Then, without loss of generality, we can enforce:</p>
<p>$$
k(t, z)=-\partial_{z} v(t, z), \quad f\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)=2\left[h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)+\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) h^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right]
$$</p>
<p>Therefore, the zero-expansion flow field can be rewritten in terms of only two free functions $v(t, z)$ and $h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)$ :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; v_{x}(t, x, y, z)=-x \partial_{z} v(t, z) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \
&amp; v_{y}(t, x, y, z)=-y \partial_{z} v(t, z) h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) \
&amp; v_{z}(t, x, y, z)=2 v(t, z)\left{h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)+\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right) h^{\prime}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)\right}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>This flow field automatically satisfies axial symmetry, a beam-like profile, and zero expansion. So this is indeed suitable for describing a zero expansion "beam". The vorticity for this beam is easily evaluated as</p>
<p>$$
\vec{\omega}=(y,-x, 0)\left{\partial_{z}^{2} v(t, z) h(u)+4 v(t, z)\left[u^{2} h^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime} / u\right}
$$</p>
<p>Thence,</p>
<p>$$
\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega}=u\left{\partial_{z}^{2} v(t, z) h(u)+4 v(t, z)\left[u^{2} h^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime} / u\right}^{2}
$$</p>
<h1>5.2.1 Force</h1>
<p>Let us now calculate $T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)$ for this flow field, and then integrate over the $x-y$ plane in order to obtain the net force. For $T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)$ we find:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{z z}(t, x, y, z)=\frac{1}{8 \pi}{ &amp; Z_{1}(x, y) v(t, z) \partial_{z}^{2} v(t, z)+Z_{2}(x, y)\left[\partial_{z}^{2} v(t, z)\right]^{2}+Z_{3}(x, y)\left[\partial_{z} v(t, z)\right]^{2} \
&amp; \left.+Z_{4}(x, y) \partial_{t} \partial_{z} v(t, z)+Z_{5}(x, y) v(t, z)^{2}\right}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Again using the shorthand $u=x^{2}+y^{2}$, we can explicitly calculate:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
Z_{1}(x, y) &amp; =\left[u^{2} h(u)^{2}\right]^{\prime \prime}+2\left([u h(u)]^{\prime}\right)^{2} \
Z_{2}(x, y) &amp; =\frac{1}{4} u h(u)^{2} \
Z_{3}(x, y) &amp; =-2\left[u^{2} h(u)^{2}\right]^{\prime \prime}+\left[u h(u)^{2}\right]^{\prime} \
Z_{4}(x, y) &amp; =2[u h(u)]^{\prime} \
Z_{5}(x, y) &amp; =-\frac{12}{u}\left(\left[u^{2} h^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime}\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Now consider the integrals over the $x-y$ plane. But first note that</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} Z_{i}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=\pi \int_{0}^{\infty} Z_{i}(u) \mathrm{d} u
$$</p>
<p>Because you want the beam to die off far away from the beam axis, you want $h\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)=$ $h(u) \rightarrow 0$ as $x^{2}+y^{2}=u \rightarrow \infty$. So we can already extract some limited information regarding the integrals:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} Z_{1}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&gt;0, \quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} Z_{2}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&gt;0 \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} Z_{3}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0 \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} Z_{4}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y=0 \
\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}} Z_{5}(x, y) \mathrm{d} x \mathrm{~d} y&lt;0
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>Overall, for the zero-expansion narrow beam we now have</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
F(t, z)=\frac{1}{8}\left{2 v(t, z) \partial_{z}^{2} v(t, z) \int_{0}^{\infty}\left([u h(u)]^{\prime}\right)^{2} d u+\frac{1}{4}\left[\partial_{z}^{2} v(t, z)\right]^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} u h(u)^{2} d u\right. \
\left.-12 v(t, z)^{2} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\left[u^{2} h^{\prime}(u)\right]^{\prime}\right)^{2} \mathrm{~d} u\right}
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>The first term is indefinite (even though the coefficient is positive), the second term is positive semi-definite, and the third term is negative semi-definite. So the zeroexpansion narrow beam can be tuned to be either a tractor or a pressor, (or even a stressor). One cannot say more about the force $F(t, z)$ without making a specific choice for the profile $h(u)$, and the envelope function $v(t, z)$.</p>
<p>If we now consider a wide beam, then we should look on axis and evaluate $T_{z z}(t, 0,0, z)$.</p>
