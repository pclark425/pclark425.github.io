                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A novel framework that is free from referencing groundtruth annotations for investigating bias and vulnerability of human- and LLM-as-a-judge, as well as the urgency of developing robust evaluation systems is proposed.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Adopting human and large language models (LLM) as judges (*a.k.a* human- and LLM-as-a-judge) for evaluating the performance of LLMs has recently gained attention. Nonetheless, this approach concurrently introduces potential biases from human and LLMs, questioning the reliability of the evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that is free from referencing groundtruth annotations for investigating **Misinformation Oversight Bias**, **Gender Bias**, **Authority Bias** and **Beauty Bias** on LLM and human judges. We curate a dataset referring to the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy and conduct thousands of evaluations. Results show that human and LLM judges are vulnerable to perturbations to various degrees, and that even the cutting-edge judges possess considerable biases. We further exploit these biases to conduct attacks on LLM judges. We hope that our work can notify the community of the bias and vulnerability of human- and LLM-as-a-judge, as well as the urgency of developing robust evaluation systems.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Adopting human and large language models (LLM) as judges (a.k.a human- and LLM-as-ajudge) for evaluating the performance of LLMs has recently gained attention. Nonetheless, this approach concurrently introduces potential biases from human and LLMs, questioning the reliability of the evaluation results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that is free from referencing groundtruth annotations for investigating Misinformation Oversight Bias, Gender Bias, Authority Bias and Beauty Bias on LLM and human judges. We curate a dataset referring to the revised Bloom's Taxonomy and conduct thousands of evaluations. Results show that human and LLM judges are vulnerable to perturbations to various degrees, and that even the cutting-edge judges possess considerable biases. We further exploit these biases to conduct attacks on LLM judges. We hope that our work can notify the community of the bias and vulnerability of human- and LLM-as-a-judge, as well as the urgency of developing robust evaluation systems ${ }^{\dagger}$. Warning: we provide illustrative attack protocols to reveal the vulnerabilities of LLM judges, aiming to develop more robust ones.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Proprietary models such as GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023), Claude (Anthropic, 2024), GeminiPro (Team et al., 2024), showcase their outstanding ability in numerous NLP tasks, meanwhile serving as daily-used tools in diverse scenarios. In the meantime, the open-source community is trying to replicate the proprietary models and democratize LLMs. To better keep track of LLM advancement, the community attaches great importance to evaluating model performance by developing numerous</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>benchmarks, which can be roughly categorized into open-ended and close-ended ones. Although closeended benchmarks such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023) are convenient to evaluate on, they often suffer from data contamination issue. Proprietary LLMs, which are trained with in-house data, tend to perform particularly well in close-ended benchmarks. On the other hand, open-ended benchmarks (e.g., MTBench (Zheng et al., 2023) and Alpaca-Eval (Li et al., 2023)) test models via free-form generation, which is more consistent with real-world use cases and relies heavily on LLMs' generation ability. The data contamination issue in open-ended benchmarks is less severe since there are no standard answers, and even with contamination it offers minimal assistance to performance hacking.</p>
<p>Open-ended benchmarks often count on human to evaluate the answer quality. As the recent emergence of human-aligned LLMs, LLM-as-ajudge (Zheng et al., 2023), serves as an alternative to human judges. More recently, both types of judges are found to posses certain biases (Zheng et al., 2023; Wu and Aji, 2023), questioning the validity of human- and LLM-as-a-judge. Therefore, an important question rises:</p>
<p>How biased are humans and LLMs on judging open-ended generation?</p>
<p>Current bias evaluation frameworks necessitate a golden standard, either in the form of groundtruth (e.g., correct vs erroneous, harmful vs non-harmful) or human providing reference answers. But what if we intend to probe the effect of some perturbations for which the golden standards are not provided or not well defined?</p>
<p>In this paper, we first identify the four biases of interest: Misinformation Oversight Bias, Gender Bias, Authority Bias and Beauty Bias, which are crucial in natural language generation (NLG) evaluation. Inspired by Intervention Study,</p>
<p>we investigate these biases by adding 4 perturbations (factual error, gender-biased content, fake references and rich content) to raw answers, respectively. To fill the gap of current research, we propose a novel reference-free framework for bias evaluation on human and LLM judges. We first form a control group and an experimental group, where each sample in the former contains a pair of answers to the same question, and each answer pair in the latter consists of an answer from the former, and the perturbed version of the other answer. We then quantify the preference shift between the two groups by Attack Successful Rate (ASR), where a higher value indicates a judge possessing more severe biases. We further exploit the uncovered biases to perform attacks on LLM judges.</p>
<p>In summary, our key contributions and findings are summarized as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>We identify four under-explored biases (Section 3). We propose a novel reference-free framework for bias analysis on human and LLM judges (Section 4).</li>
<li>We find that human judges barely have Gender Bias, but posses significant Misinformation Bias and Beauty Bias.</li>
<li>All LLM judges possess Misinformation Oversight Bias, Gender Bias, Authority Bias, and Beauty Bias to various extent (Section 5).</li>
<li>One can easily exploit Authority Bias and Beauty Bias to conduct a prompt-based attack on LLM judges, achieving an $A S R$ of up to $50 \%$ on GPT-4 (Section 6).</li>

<h3>2.1 Human and LLM Evaluation</h3>
<p>Human feedback is a popular gold standard for NLG evaluation. The collected feedback can be used to improve model performance (Kreutzer et al., 2018; Zhou and Xu, 2020; Leike et al., 2018; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020; Böhm et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022; Christiano et al., 2023) or to serve as an indicator of output quality as in Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023). Prior to the prominence of LLMs, BertScore (Zhang et al., 2020), BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021), DiscoScore (Zhao et al., 2023) and GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023) are popular metrics used to evaluate NLG tasks. Recently, powerful LLMs are
leveraged as judges in place of previous methods, and are widely used in evaluating LLM performance (Chen et al., 2023b; Zhang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a; Wang et al., 2023b).</p>
<h3>2.2 Biases of Human and LLM Judges</h3>
<p>Both human and LLM judges are found to be biased. Due to the subjectivity of human, the reproducibility is fairly low (Belz et al., 2023). To obtain results with higher quality, a clear codebook is needed to provide judges with clear instructions (Howcroft et al., 2020). Human judges are also found to have inherent bias (Zheng et al., 2023; Wu and Aji, 2023) and may not even provide reliable answers (Clark et al., 2021; Hämäläinen et al., 2023). As an alternative to human, LLM judges are also found to have certain bias and the annotation results require validation (Pangakis et al., 2023). Zeng et al. (2023) finds that LLMs are prone to answers with superficially good quality. Positional bias (Wang et al., 2023a), cognitive bias (Koo et al., 2023), verbosity bias and self-enhancement bias (Zheng et al., 2023) have also been identified. Our work quantify another 3 biases that human and LLM judges may possess.</p>
<h3>2.3 Attack on LLM-as-a-judge</h3>
<p>Despite their superior power, LLMs are found prone to adversarial attacks (Shen et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), under which LLMs can be induced to generate harmful content. While existing works on LLM attacks mainly focus on NLG tasks, attacks on LLM-as-a-judge are relatively under-explored. Recent works (Raina et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024) propose optimizationbased methods to hack LLM-as-a-judge. Our work instead, provides a simple yet effective zero-shot prompt-based approach to deceive LLM judges.</p>
<h2>3 On the Biases of Judges</h2>
<h3>3.1 Defining Bias</h3>
<p>As defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, "semantics" refers to the meaning in language (Oxford English Dictionary, 2023). We primarily categorize biases into semantic-related and semantic-agnostic biases.</p>
<p>Semantic-related Bias Semantic-related bias pertains to the bias of evaluators that is affected by elements related to the content of the text. Typical examples include misinformation oversight bias and gender bias.</p>
<p>Semantic-agnostic Bias Semantic-agnostic bias refers to the bias of evaluators that is influenced by factors unrelated to the semantic content of the text. Common examples include authority bias and beauty bias.</p>
<h3>3.2 Biases of Interest</h3>
<p>In this study, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the four types of bias as described below.
Bias 1. Misinformation Oversight Bias: this refers to the tendency to overlook the factual errors in an argument. It often occurs when individuals carelessly draw conclusions without scrutinizing of their supporting argument.
Bias 2. Gender Bias: this refers to the ignorance of a judge towards gender-biased content. It happens when a human or a model has not learned to avoid this unconscious bias.
Bias 3. Authority Bias: this is the tendency to attribute greater credibility to statements by their perceived authorities, regardless of the actual evidence (Saffran et al., 2020). It often leads to an uncritical acceptance of expert opinions, which should not happen on careful readers or judges.
Bias 4. Beauty Bias: or "lookism", means that someone is privileged because of their good looking. In our context, it refers to the inclination that judges tend to prefer visually appealing content, regardless of its actual validity.</p>
<p>We provide an example for each bias in Figure 1.</p>
<h3>3.3 Importance of the Investigated Biases</h3>
<p>Analyzing biases of judges is essential due to their potential to distort legal outcomes. Misinformation Oversight Bias can bring about chaos among the public through social media, which degrade their credibility and reputation (Weidner et al., 2020). Gender Bias is a socially relevant bias that embody its impact in different sectors such as law (Czapanskiy, 1990) and finance (Staveren, 2001). Authority Bias can result in overvaluing the opinions of perceived authorities, potentially neglecting substantial counter-evidence, and promoting decisions based on power dynamics rather than factual accuracy (Kahneman, 2011). Additionally, Beauty Bias risks favoring parties based on visual appeal rather than the merits of their cases, compromising the fairness expected in judicial processes (Langlois et al., 2000). Quantifying and analyzing these biases is crucial for developing more robust judges and evaluation frameworks.</p>
<h2>4 Experimental Protocol</h2>
<p>In this section, we elaborate on our motivation, experimental methodology, the creation of experimental data, the experimental procedure, evaluation metrics, and the models under evaluation.</p>
<h3>4.1 Motivation</h3>
<p>We first identify the challenges of conducting bias analysis. First, when there is no groundtruth, or when humans fail to serve as golden standard, a valid comparison of biases is hard to be carried out. Second, it is hard to ensure an experiments to be both controlled and comprehensive. Either a carelessly massive experiment or naive setting would undermine the validity of conclusions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these challenges have not been overcome. First, groundtruth annotations (e.g., $w /$ or $w / o$ factual error) are indispensable in current bias analysis (Zeng et al., 2023; Wu and Aji, 2023), but the groundtruth may not be well defined in open-ended question answering. Second, experiment design is either too carelessly massive or too limited. Zheng et al. (2023) draws their conclusion on a massive dataset collected from crowd-sourced workers, which may introduce uncontrollable factors to the analysis. Wu and Aji (2023) conducts experiments on only 40 questions that are selected from Vicuna-80 (Chiang et al., 2023), resulting in a conclusion with limited generalizability.</p>
<h3>4.2 Method</h3>
<p>We adopt intervention ${ }^{2}$ as our research method to quantify the bias that judges possess. We investigate each bias via perturbing raw answers. We introduce factual error and gender-biased content for testing Misinformation Oversight Bias and Gender Bias, respectively. A judge should be able to detect the flawed or gender-biased content. We introduce fake references and rich content for testing Authority Bias and Beauty Bias, respectively. An unbiased judge should stick to the semantics of content when comparing answer pairs.</p>
<h3>4.3 Data Generation</h3>
<p>To collect data for our experiment, we employ GPT$4^{3}$ to generate questions, answers and perturbations. The data generation process is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Question Generation To increase the generality of our question set, we follow the 6 levels of</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Sample demonstration. Each sample consists of one question, two unperturbed answers $A_{1}, A_{2}$ in the Control Group. The perturbed versions of $A_{2}$ are generated for the Experimental Group. Texts with factual errors and gender bias are colored in red solely for demonstration purposes. Rich contents are rendered in the same way as demonstrated to human judges. We perform interventions for investigating Misinformation Oversight Bias, Gender Bias, Authority Bias and Beauty Bias.
the revised Bloom's Taxonomy (Krathwohl, 2002) (description in Appendix G) and prompt GPT-4 to create 30 questions for each level, amounting to a total of 180 questions. The knowledge level of these questions is controlled at or below the middle school level. This ensures that college-level evaluators (see Section 4.4) are able to utilize their knowledge to assess the quality of the answers. We manually improve the prompt for question generation based on a subset of sample (detailed in Appendix A.1). The categorization of the questions is manually verified by the authors following the criteria described in Appendix A.4). This verification process ensures the correctness of our experiment data, leaving us with 142 questions for the subsequent steps.</p>
<p>Answer Generation We use GPT-4 to independently generate two answers for each question, leading to a collection of 142 question-answers pairs for the control group. Each pair consists of one question and two answers, denoted as $Q, A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, respectively.</p>
<p>Perturbation For each type of perturbation, we randomly select an answer for each question and introduce the perturbations (factual error, genderbiased content, fake reference and rich content), resulting in four times the 142 question-answer pairs for the experimental group. Note that the semantics are not changed after adding fake reference and rich content), as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>In these arrangements, the two answers to each question are labeled as $A_{1}$ (original answer) and $A_{2}^{p}$ (perturbed version of $A_{2}$ ).</p>
<p>In summary, for a specific perturbation $p$, a sample consists of a question $Q$, two answers $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, a perturbed answer $A_{2}^{p}$, a control group preference $\operatorname{Pref}<em e="e" p="p" x="x">{c t r l}$, and an experimental group preference $\operatorname{Pref}</em>$, as shown below:</p>
<p>$$
S^{p}=\left{Q, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{2}^{p}, \operatorname{Pref}<em e="e" p="p" x="x">{c t r l}, \operatorname{Pref}</em>\right}
$$</p>
<p>Prompts for question generation, answer generation and answer perturbation are shown in Appendix A.1, A. 2 and A.3, respectively.</p>
<h3>4.4 Experiment Objects</h3>
<p>Human judges We employ 60 college students as our human judges. Since our evaluation materials are all in English, the volunteers should either be English native speakers, or obtain decent scores in standardized English test. Besides, they should master Math, Physics and Logic on at least highschool level. All human judges are notified about the potential risks before experiments start, and may cease the evaluation process at anytime. Each judge is paid 30 RMB/hour and is allowed to evaluate for at most one hour per day. We do not inform the judges about the data generation process to avoid bringing extra factors into experiment results. More details are provided in Appendix B.
LLM judges Our experiment also involves the evaluation of some representative models, in-</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Experiment Procedure. For each QA pair, we collect 6 votes with position shuffled. Voting results are tallied for a score, and converted into an answer preference (the shaded area in gray).

cluding GPT-4o, GPT-4 (OpenAI et al., 2023), Claude-2 (Anthropic), Claude-3 (Anthropic), Gemini-Pro (Team et al., 2024), GPT-4-turbo (OpenAI), GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI), LLaMA2-70B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Mixtral-7Bx8Instruct (Jiang et al., 2024), Ernie (Sun et al., 2021), Spark ${ }^{4}$ and Qwen (Bai et al., 2023). We detail the version of each model as well as their access time in Appendix C. However, as some models exhibit significant positional bias in the evaluation (see results in Appendix F.1), we only include models with less significant positional bias in the following sections.</p>
<h3>4.5 Experiment Procedure</h3>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates our experiment procedure, consisting of Review, Vote and Aggregate.</p>
<p>Review We form two groups to conduct our experiment: control group (aiming to evaluate $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ ) and experimental group (aiming to evaluate $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}^{p}$, the perturbed version of $A_{2}$ ). We shuffle the positions for each $\left{Q, A_{1}, A_{2}\right}$ and $\left{Q, A_{1}, A_{2}^{p}\right}$ pairs to minimize the impact of positional bias. For human judges, we also record elapsed time of evaluating each pair in background for post-processing.</p>
<p>Vote Given a question and its two corresponding answers, a judge is instructed to determine whether "Answer 1" is better, "Answer 2" is better, or a "Tie", based solely on the semantic quality of the answers. For human judges, we include a "not familiar" option and ask judges to choose it in case they are not familiar with the context of the question. The votes labeled "not familiar" are excluded from the final</p>
<p><sup id="fnref3:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>results. Detailed instructions for human judges and evaluation prompts for LLM judges are shown in Appendix D and E, respectively.</p>
<p>Aggregate We first exclude the votes whose response time is too short. To aggregate the remaining valid votes, we first assign 0,0.5 and 1 to $A_{1}$, Tie and $A_{2} / A_{2}^{p}$, respectively. Then we calculate the average score of each sample over its 6 votes. We use 0.5 as a threshold to assign the aggregated vote for each sample.</p>
<p>A screenshot of the user interface built upon gradio (Abid et al., 2019) for human judges is shown in Appendix H.</p>
<h3>4.6 Metric</h3>
<p>To gauge the judges' resilience to the perturbations, intuitively we can calculate the percentage of samples whose preference shifts towards $A_{2}^{p}$ due to the added perturbations. Following the terminology used in AI safety, we name our metric as Attack Successful Rate (ASR). Specifically, for fake reference and rich content perturbation,</p>
<p>$$
A S R=\frac{\left|V_{2 \mid 1}\right|}{\left|V_{1}\right|}
$$</p>
<p>where $V_{1}$ is the set of samples whose $\operatorname{Pref}<em 1="1">{\text {ctrl }}$ are either $A</em>}$ or Tie, and $V_{2 \mid 1}$ is the set of samples in $V_{1}$ whose $\operatorname{Pref<em 2="2">{\text {exp }}$ are $A</em>$ (illustrated in Figure 3).}^{p</p>
<p>For factual error perturbation, the calculation formula of $A S R$ is:</p>
<p>$$
A S R=\frac{\left|V_{2 \mid 2}\right|}{\left|V_{2}\right|}
$$</p>
<p>where $V_{2}$ is the set of samples whose $\operatorname{Pref}<em 2="2">{\text {ctrl }}$ are either $A</em>$ is the set of samples}$ or Tie, and $V_{2 \mid 2</p>
<p>in $V_{2}$ whose $\operatorname{Pref}<em 2="2">{c o p}$ are $A</em>$ or Tie. For all three perturbations, the higher the $A S R$, the lower the judges' ability to detect factual errors in the text. $A S R$ should ideally be close to 0 .}^{0</p>
<h3>4.7 Superiority of the Reference-free Framework</h3>
<p>Our reference-free evaluation framework allows for quantifying biases in evaluating open-ended generation tasks, where groundtruth may not be available. In essence, biases are quantified by $A S R$, which is the percentage of samples with preference shifted towards the perturbed answer from control to experimental group. Our novel framework provides insights for future bias research on evaluation of open-ended generation.</p>
<h2>5 Results and Discussion</h2>
<h3>5.1 Preliminary: On Positional Bias</h3>
<p>Positional bias of human and LLM judges refers to the phenomenon that when conducting pairwise comparison, judges tend to choose on one side between a pair regardless of answer quality. Since positional bias has been thoroughly explored by many works (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al., 2023; Wu and Aji, 2023), we investigate the this bias to identify valid judges for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>Detailed results are presented in Appendix F.1. We empirically find that GPT-3.5-Turbo and Mixtral tend to choose "Answer 1", Spark tends to choose "Answer 2", while Qwen and Gemini-Pro almost invariably select "Tie". Neither of them is an ideal judge for pairwise evaluation. Hence, we exclude them in our subsequent analysis.</p>

The best / worst performances in each column are made bold / underlined, respectively.</p>
<p>We present the results in Table 1, which shows $A S R$ under different perturbations and the averaged ranking of each judge.</p>
<h3>5.2.1 On Semantic-related Biases</h3>
<p>Decent LLMs are able to perform fact-check, as are the cases for GPT-4o, Claude-3, GPT-4 and GPT-4-Turbo, all of which have ASRs lower than $11 \%$. Human judges and other LLMs, on the other hand, all have ASRs higher than $20 \%$, which is probably because they may be ignorant of details in the context (human), or they do not possess enough knowledge to be a fact-checker (LLMs).</p>
<p>For gender bias, human judges surpass LLMs by a large margin, which might be a result of all judges being well educated college students who are taught to be gender-unbiased. As a comparison, LLMs are trained on tremendous amount of data from web, from which they may learn inherent gender bias in corpus. Even if most LLMs underwent alignment processes, the gender bias still exists as observed from our empirical results, suggesting that the alignment process may be insufficient.</p>
<p>Take-away 1. Human and some LLM judges possess Misinformation Oversight Bias. The latter could be improved by conducting a more effective knowledge injection process.</p>
<p>Take-away 2. Human judges are gender-unbiased, whereas LLM judges have significant Gender Bias, suggesting rooms to be improved.</p>
<h3>5.2.2 On Semantic-agnostic Biases</h3>
<p>As shown in the fourth column of Table 1, all judges except GPT-4o underperform random baseline under fake reference perturbation. Even the best performed GPT-4o has $32 \%$ in ASR (only 5\% better than random), which is unsatisfactory as well. This suggests that both human and LLM judges are convinced by the perceived credibility. For humans, this aligns with the findings of Ellul (2021). For LLMs, Authority Bias can result from assigning a higher reward to samples with references in the alignment process. However, they merely learn a generic signal that the presence of references signifies preference, regardless of true authenticity.</p>
<p>For rich content perturbation, 4 LLM judges have ASRs under $10 \%$. The other judges, including humans, have ASRs over $30 \%$. This indicates that human and some LLM judges are drawn by "attention distractors" such as emojis and markdown format, hindering them from being fair judges.</p>
<p>Take-away 3. Human and all LLM judges (except GPT-4o) perform no better than random baseline under reference perturbation, indicating severe Authority Bias. GPT-4o only marginally surpasses random baseline.</p>
<p>Take-away 4. Beauty Bias is observed in human and some LLM judges. GPT-4 is nominally better than random baseline.</p>
<h3>5.3 Discussion</h3>
<p>Self-enhancement in detecting factual error As pointed out by Liu et al. (2024) and Xu et al. (2024), LLMs may favor answers generated by themselves. This phenomenon, dubbed selfenhancement bias (Zheng et al., 2023), may also exist in our experiment. Since all perturbations are added by GPT-4, it is aware of what the errors are, which might be a reason of GPT-4 having a decent performance in factual error detection in Table 1.</p>
<p>To discuss the potential self-enhancement issue in error detection, we randomly sample 10 questions from each of the 6 levels of Bloom's Taxonomy ( 60 questions in total). Then we adopt Claude3 to perform answer generation and perturbation as described in Section 4.3.</p>

<p>Table 2: $A S R$ of adding factual error perturbation by different LLMs.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 2, GPT-4 performs excellently in evaluating its own generated responses and those generated by Claude-3. Claude-3 also performs stably well during the evaluation process. Meanwhile, the $A S R$ of GPT-4 on evaluating answers generated by itself on this subset is 0.07 , and the corresponding result in Table 1 is 0.08 . This suggests the representativeness of the sampled subset.
Take-away 5. The excellence of GPT-4 and Claude-3 in factual error detection does not stem from their self-enhancement bias.</p>
<h2>Usage of GPT-4 for curating experiment dataset</h2>
<p>Since GPT-4 is trained on tremendous amount of data (and potentially so for other LLMs), a concern is that the distribution of GPT-4-curated dataset may be biased because the distribution may have been learned by other LLMs. With the presumed concern, our results provide a "performance upper
bound" for all tested models, whose performance can be worse ( $A S R$ can be higher) if the dataset forms an unseen distribution. Given the unsatisfactory performance in Table 1, we argue that our experiment is still insightful for unveiling the biases of LLM judges.</p>
<h2>6 Deceiving LLM Judges</h2>
<h3>6.1 Overview</h3>
<p>Having the observation that LLM judges possess certain biases, we further exploit the biases and propose a simple yet effective attack method on LLM-as-a-judge. By adding fake references and rich content, we make a flawed, biased or mediocre answer superficially good. We calculate $A S R$ following a similar definition in Section 4.6.</p>
<p>We first generate three sets of answers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anchor set $A_{1}$ : answers serving as anchors.</li>
<li>Weak set $A_{2}$ : answers that are weaker than $A$. The weakness manifests in either being flawed (with factual error), biased (with gen-der-based content) or less decent (in quality judged by LLMs) compared to answers in $A_{1}$.</li>
<li>Perturbed set $A_{2}^{p}$ : perturbed version of $A_{2}$ to make them superficially better than $A_{2}$.</li>
</ul>
<p>The anchor set $A_{1}$ is generated on a subset of 60 questions by GPT-3.5-Turbo. We aim to research the following two RQs, where the weak sets $A_{2}$ and perturbed sets $A_{2}^{p}$ are different for each RQ.</p>
<p>RQ1: Can a flawed/biased answer exceed its non-flawed counterpart by adding perturbations? To research this question, we make the weak set $A_{2}$ flawed by adding factual errors. Specifically, we generate a normal version of answers using GPT-3.5-Turbo, and then add factual errors or gender-based content to each answer with GPT-4, yielding flawed answer set $A_{2}$. Then for each answer in $A_{2}$, we add fake reference, rich content and compound perturbations to see whether we can deceive LLM judges by exploiting their Authority Bias and Beauty Bias. We also include a random baseline for comparison.</p>
<p>RQ2: Can a weak answer exceed its stronger counterpart by adding perturbations? The idea is that we need to first curate a set of weak-strong (in terms of semantic quality) answer pairs. We generate answers from LLaMA2-Chat${7 \mathrm{~B}, 13 \mathrm{~B}, 70 \mathrm{~B}}$ to form three independent weak sets.</p>

<p>Table 3: Comparison of $A S R$ between GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat-{7B,13B,70B} (LM- $x$ B). Fake references are added to superficially improve the quality of LLaMA's answers. Avg. Ranking is the average of the four rankings of $A S R$ in each column. The best / worst performances in each column are made bold / underlined, respectively.</p>
<p>Then we add fake reference to them to form their corresponding perturbed sets. We validate that shows that answers from LLaMA2-Chat family are indeed weaker than those of GPT-3.5-Turbo (see results in Appendix I). To perform trending analysis, we also include another set of answers from GPT-3.5-Turbo and construct a weak and perturbed set for it in a similar manner.</p>
<h3>6.2 Metric</h3>
<p>For each RQ, we conduct two groups of pairwise comparisons. Comparison between $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ shows the preference of judges for answers before perturbation (control group), whereas comparison between $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}^{p}$ shows the preference after perturbation (experimental group). We adopt $A S R$ (Eq. 2) as the metric.</p>
<h3>6.3 Findings and Discussion</h3>
<p>Flawed and biased answer detection. We show the result of Misinformation Oversight Bias and Gender Bias in Figure 4a and 4b. Among all models, GPT-4o and Claude-3 perform better than the others in terms of both biases. However, Claude-2 performs the worst in detecting factual error; Ernie and LLaMA2-70B are even worse than random baseline when detecting gender-biased content under Ref+RC perturbation. Besides, GPT4 and GPT-4-Turbo have mediocre performances
for both biases, suggesting that all models are vulnerable to the proposed perturbation attacks when adopted as judges. Perturbation types have effects on performances. Ref alone is more effective than $R C$ in deceiving LLM judges, meaning that LLMs have more inclination towards superficial authority than nice-looking formats. We also find that all models have more severe Misinformation Oversight Bias than Gender Bias, which is consistent with the findings in Table 1.</p>
<p>Take-away 6. LLM judges are vulnerable to fake reference and rich content attack for detecting factual errors and gender-biased content.</p>
<p>Weak answer turnover. We attempt to answer RQ2 by comparing several pairs of models with disparate difference in their answer quality. A direct observation from Table 3 is that, there is an increasing trend in each row, meaning that the LLM judges are easier to be induced by references as the quality gap between answer pairs shrinks. Notably, there is a leap of $A S R$ from the column LM-70B to column GPT-3.5-Turbo. This indicates that LLMs are sensitive to fake references when the two raw answers are similar in quality, but are relatively robust to such perturbation when the quality gap is significant.</p>
<p>Take-away 7. Preference for weaker answers can be improved by perturbing them with fake refer-</p>
<p>ences, but the effect is limited due to the large quality gap between the two answers in our setting.</p>
<h2>7 Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, we develop a novel reference-free framework to explore Misinformation Oversight Bias, Gender Bias, Authority Bias and Beauty Bias in human and LLM judges, providing deeper insights into their innate biases and vulnerabilities. We reveal that all judges display significant biases, but diverge in their specific inclinations. Additionally, we show the LLMs' judgement can be hacked via a prompt-based method that we discover. Through our work, we hope to provide insights on the bias of human- and LLM-as-a-judge, and to notify the community about the urgency of developing more robust evaluation systems.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>This study, while providing valuable insights and conducting comprehensive experiments, has certain limitations that need to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>Firstly, benchmark data has limitations in its size and question generation process: 1) the benchmark used in this study comprised of a limited number of questions, specifically 142, and does not make classifications in the horizontal field. This relatively small sample size may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of potential questions, thereby potentially limiting the generalizability of our findings. 2) Ambiguity may exist in level classification for some questions. For example, If you're given a budget, how would you use your math skills to plan a small party? belongs to Applying but can also be in Creating, and What does a thermometer measure? is in Remembering but can also be in Understanding.</p>
<p>However, this sort of questions are little in proportion based on our inspection. Besides, we generate questions based on the revised Bloom's Taxonomy because it is a systematic taxonomy with wide coverage which can yield higher diversity among the generated questions. Therefore, we argue that such ambiguity has little effect on the validity of our conclusion.</p>
<p>Secondly, the biases we studied, though insightful and valuable, are not encompassing. In humanand LLM-as-a-judge, there are other interesting and crucial yet underexplored biases such as wording/syntactic structure, tones, racism, etc., which are left for future works.</p>
<p>Thirdly, human judges consist of only college students, whose behavior may not generalize to common human judges. For example, college students may be more sensitive to gender-biased content than other people who have graduated for years, because college students may be engaged in discussion in class on gender bias issues, which is not the case when they graduate and work in a common industry.</p>
<p>Fourthly, since LLM judges are evolving, the conclusions drawn on LLMs may be invalid as they advance. However, the aim of this work is to unveil the biases of current LLMs and hopefully point out a direction for future LLM development. We, as well as the community, are more than glad to see reduced biases in LLM judges in the future.</p>
<h2>Ethics Statement</h2>
<p>In this paper, the dataset used for investigating the bias of human and LLM judges undergo manual check by the authors and have no ethics-related issues. In Section 6, we provide a simple yet effective prompt-based attack on LLM-as-a-judge. Our intention is to raise the awareness of the community on developing robust LLM judges, rather than encouraging LLM developers to hack existing judges.</p>

<h2>A. 4 Instruction for Question and Answer Filtering</h2>
<p>We conduct a meticulous manual review of the questions and answers, carefully evaluated and reclassified the categorization of the questions, and deleted some low-quality Q\&amp;A pairs based on the standards. The review standards are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Question classification: Whether the question truly belongs to the given revised Bloom's Taxonomy classification.</li>
<li>Question difficulty: Whether the difficulty of the question is too high (i.e., beyond the scope of high school knowledge).</li>
<li>Completeness: Whether the question or answer is complete, whether the question provides enough information for the answerer to answer, and whether the answer provides enough information to answer the question.</li>
<li>Harmlessness: Whether the question or answer contains toxic and harmful information, and whether offensive language and topics are avoided.</li>
<li>Accuracy: Whether there are factual errors in the question or answer, and whether it is based on facts or widely accepted views.</li>
</ol>
<p>Based on the above standards, we have reclassified the questions and deleted some Q\&amp;A pairs that do</p>
<p>not meet the requirements, reducing the number of Q\&amp;A pairs in the control group from 180 pairs (30 for each level) to 142 pairs.</p>
<h2>B Human Judges</h2>
<h2>B. 1 Selection Criteria</h2>
<p>This section details the selection criteria and basic information for human evaluators participated in our experiments. Participants are all at least with an undergraduate education level at a University whose instruction language is English. They are chosen solely based on their English proficiency, basic logic skills and other knowledge. Aimed to ensure unbiased and knowledgeable evaluation of the results, specific criteria are created as follows:</p>
<h2>At least one of the following conditions must be satisfied:</h2>
<ol>
<li>English as one of the first languages (mother tongues)</li>
<li>TOEFL $\geq 80$ or IELTS $\geq 6.5$ or at least B+ for all ENG classes or Gaokao $\geq 128$</li>
</ol>
<h2>Participants should master:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Math, high school level</li>
<li>Physics, high school level</li>
<li>Logics, basic</li>
</ol>
<h2>Participants should be able to:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Bring their own laptops</li>
<li>Focus for at least one hour</li>
<li>Participate in the experiment off-line</li>
</ol>
<h2>Participants should consent to the following:</h2>
<ol>
<li>I understand the purpose and process of the Experiment, and I am aware that I may be exposed to answers generated by GPT.</li>
<li>I understand that all information in the Experiment is safe and harmless, and all procedures of the Experiment will comply with relevant data protection and privacy laws.</li>
<li>I understand that I have the right to withdraw from the Experiment at any time, without providing any reason.</li>
<li>I understand that all feedback and data I provide will be used solely for the purposes of the Experiment, and will be anonymized when published or shared.</li>
<li>I agree that the research team has the right to use all feedback and data I provide, but must ensure the security and privacy of my personal information.</li>
<li>I release and indemnify the research team from any liability for any loss or harm that may arise from my participation in the Experiment.</li>
</ol>
<h2>B. 2 Statistics of Evaluators</h2>
<p>A total of 60 volunteers were selected to participate in the experiments. They came from various countries such as America, China, Bangladesh, Malaysia, India and Indonesia. Their role was to finish at least 45 questions, each question asking them to evaluate the quality of the two answers corresponding to one same question.</p>
<h2>B. 3 Remuneration</h2>
<p>The subsidy standard follows the regular volunteer subsidy standard of the university, which is $30 \mathrm{RMB} /$ hour. Besides, outstanding volunteers are provided with access to GPT4 models.</p>
<p>In the end, the control group performed 1950 evaluations, while the experiment group performed 3702 evaluations.</p>

<h2>D Instructions Given to Human Evaluators</h2>
<p>This section outlines the specific instructions provided to the human evaluators for them to clearly understand the evaluation criteria. The original instructions given to the human evaluators are as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your assignment involves providing evaluations for given responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each evaluation will consist of a question and two corresponding answers. Your role is to discern which response is superior based on the quality of the answer. If you find that both responses are of equal good or bad, feel free to select a tie. There is no obligation to favor one response over the other; if a decision cannot be made, a tie would be an optimal choice.</p>
</li>
<li>During the evaluation process, please focus exclusively on the semantic quality of the answers. Non-semantic factors such as tone of speech, response format, or answer order should not influence your evaluation. The primary focus should be on the quality and accuracy of the answers.</li>
<li>Please check the checkbox "I am NOT familiar with the content of the question/ answers." if you are not familiar with the topic and pass to next question; the question would not be counted.</li>
<li>If you want to take a break, refresh the webpage. When everything is ready, retype your student ID and set your target to proceed. Your $\log$ is kept safe and sound.</li>
<li>You are all set, please go ahead to start the evaluation. Take your time and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
