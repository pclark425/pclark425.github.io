                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> LLaMP is introduced, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and often biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data from the Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool-usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning interatomic potentials. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and paves the way for future agentic scientific workflows and knowledge-grounded LLMs. Code and live demo are available at https://github.com/chiang-yuan/llamp.</p>

<p>The generation of convincing yet unreliable information poses a pressing challenge to large language model (LLMs), particularly to their application in the sciences. LLMs are prone to hallucinationproviding outright false information with high confidence [1, 39]. This issue is particularly concerning for knowledge-intensive tasks, where users rely on chatbots and other AI systems to provide accurate guidance [16]. LLMs often lack up-to-date factual knowledge on topics outside their training data, requiring rigorous verification against trusted external sources [22]. In the scientific community, where the integration of insights and data accuracy is already complex, the proliferation of generative models may exacerbate the risk of misinformation. This trend accentuates the importance of scrutinizing and ensuring the reliability of information sources.</p>
<p>Current approaches to enhance LLM accuracy in domain-specific knowledge often involve finetuning pre-trained models [6, 10] or tailored prompt engineering techniques [41, 45]. While these</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>models are easy to deploy, they suffer from diminished reproducibility and data adherence due to the absence of a memory base, untraceable fine-tuning history, or opaque extraction processes. Even though fine-tuning can encode a certain amount of domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, it is constrained by scalability and intrinsic memory capacity. Fine-tuned LLMs struggle to retain in the long term the knowledge they were trained on as the training progresses, nor can they be aware of the up-to-date events and data beyond pre-training. Prompt engineering, while effective, also compromise the generalizability, thus limiting the overall power and flexibility of LLMs. Therefore, a more sensible approach involves equipping LLMs with external data sources, allowing them to generate holistic responses via few-shot adaptation to factual information [17] that can reliably support real-world scientific research and decision-making.</p>
<p>In this work, we propose LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework leveraging hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents to interact with Materials Project (MP), arXiv, Wikipedia, and atomistic simulation tools. The framework serves as a safeguard against LLM hallucination and grounds them on high-fidelity material informatics derived from various sources, including computational data from quantum-mechanical first-principles calculations and expert-curated material synthesis recipes [14], and further enables the possibility of language-driven simulations. Through hierarchical planning of multiple ReAct agents [42], we demonstrate that LLaMP not only can correctly retrieve higher-order materials data such as tensors and 3D crystal structures but also can combine different modalities to perform complex, knowledge-intensive inferences and operations essential for real-world research applications.</p>
<p>Our contributions are as follows: (1) we introduce a multimodal RAG framework employing hierarchical ReAct agents that dynamically interact with the Materials Project, enabling LLMs to access high-fidelity materials informatics; (2) we propose a statistical metric to assess the self-consistency of LLM responses in high-precision, reproducibility-critical settings; (3) we evaluate the performance of LLaMP and standard LLMs in predicting key material properties, including bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, formation energies, and magnetic orderings; (4) we showcase real-world applications in materials science, such as inorganic synthesis and crystal structure generation and editing; (5) we enhance LLaMP with high-throughput atomistic simulation workflows and pre-trained universal ML force fields, lowering the entry barriers to computational materials and chemistry.</p>
<h1>2 Background</h1>
<p>Materials Project (MP) The Materials Project is a multi-institution effort to explore and compute the properties of all known inorganic materials [13] and molecules [31]. The initiative leverages high-throughput electronic structure calculations [15, 30] based on density functional theory (DFT), providing large-scale open-source database and analysis algorithms, with the ultimate goal to drastically reduce the time and cost required for materials discovery by focusing experiments on the promising candidates from computational screening. Most of the atomic structures are selected from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) [43] and undergo standardized relaxation procedures, followed by post-processing or additional calculations for higher-order material properties such as electron and phonon bandgaps, elastic tensors, dielectric tensors, and more. MP provides these calculated material properties through API endpoints.
Natural language processing (NLP) in science NLP has found extensive application in extracting valuable information from scientific publications, with notable instances involving text-to-text or more recent image-to-text summarization techniques [10, 29, 34]. For summarizing crystal structures in textual form, Ganose and Jain [8] introduced the robocrystallographer, a toolkit designed for the analysis and generation of descriptions for crystalline materials. Their method condenses atomic structures into descriptive JSON representations that encompass coordination statistics, connectivity motifs, geometric features, and dimensionality. MP leverages robocrystallographer to generate human-level descriptions for 130 K compounds which are accessible through MP website and API.</p>
<h2>3 Related Work</h2>
<p>Prompting and fine-tuning in domain science Prompt-based methods have been used as effective tools for automating data extraction process from the literature. Polak and Morgan [28] employ a prompt workflow to extract the cooling rates of metallic glasses and yield strengths of high entropy</p>
<p>alloys. Zheng et al. [45] implement a ChatGPT metal-organic framework (MOF) synthesis assistant through embedding and searching on preselected papers. StructChem [26] leverages step-by-step reasoning, and iteratively refines results to solve college-level chemistry questions. Yang et al. [41] use GPT-4 to extract experimentally measured bandgaps to train a graph neural network for accurate bandgap prediction from crystal structures. Despite the success in the specific data extraction tasks, prompt-based methods face challenges in reproducibility when the used prompts are fine-grained to work for specific edge cases. They are also still prone to hallucination and less generalizable to combine different data sources due to the deliberately designed prompt.
Several other knowledge-grounded, domain-specific language models lean on the fine-tuning approach against pre-selected data and literature. For instance, ChemGPT [7] involves fine-tuning GPT-neo on self-referencing embedded strings (SELFIES) representations of small molecules. Jablonka et al. [12] demonstrated GPT-3 fine-tuned against online corpora could outperform purpose-trained models on classification, regression, and inverse design of high-entropy alloys and molecules. Dagdelen et al. [6] fine-tuned GPT-3 on $\sim 500$ prompt-completion pairs to enhance LLM's capability to extract useful information on materials chemistry from text paragraphs. However, the fine-tuned models without augmentation inherently lack awareness of the up-to-date results and any data only available after their training. Moreover, fine-tuned LLMs still suffer from limited memory retention and are prone to forget during continual training [35].
LLM function calling and tool usage An emerging class of LLM applications, including this work, take advantage of LLM text completion and instruction following capability for function calling. This approach extends LLMs with expert-curated tools to improve the quality of control for downstream applications. Coscientist [3] combines tools such as search engines, Python, and document index for autonomous chemical research. ChemCrow [21] gathers multiple molecule and safety tools to enhance organic chemistry experiment and molecule design.
However, most prior works adopt flat planning strategy, where a single agent accesses all the available tools, resulting in a lack of self-correcting tool usage capabilities. This often leads to premature reasoning stop and summarization when the agent encounters tool usage errors. We mitigate this through hierarchical planning of multiple ReAct agents (see Section 4.1).</p>
<h1>4 Method</h1>
<h3>4.1 Hierarchical orchestration</h3>
<p>Overviews To manage heterogeneous data sources and diverse types of queries, we introduce hierarchical planning, featuring the supervisor ReAct agent overseeing assistant ReAct agents (Figure 1). This design offers three major advantages over flat planning commonly implemented in previous works [3, 21]. (1) modularity of the system ensures that each assistant agent can focus on domain-specific queries while the supervisor agent handles higher-level reasoning and task allocation; (2) the hierarchical structure improves the overall accuracy and efficiency by reducing the cognitive load on any individual agent; (3) by offloading specific functions to specialized agents, we minimize the context window consumption and schema parsing.
Supervisor agent The supervisor agent acts as a router and decision-maker, handling abstract logic between user requests and assistant agents. Here, we adopt ReAct on GPT-4 [42] to augment the agent's action space $\mathcal{A}$ with a language space $\mathcal{L}$ to create an expanded action space of $\mathcal{A}=$ $\mathcal{A} \cup \mathcal{L}$. This expanded action space empowers the agent to take action $\tilde{a}_{t} \in \mathcal{L}$ in language space that facilitate the collaboration with assistant agents to retrieve domain specific information and achieve complex downstream tasks such as molecular dynamics simulations.
Assistant agent The efficient function calling in LLMs is often hindered by the need to process complex API schemas, which can consume a significant portion of the context window. To address this, we assign a specialized ReAct agent for each specific tool or API endpoint. It reduces context window consumption, as each agent handles only the relevant schema for its task, avoiding unnecessary schema parsing. Additionally, the use of ReAct agents enables them to refine their API calls based on feedback, significantly improving task completion rates through ReAct's iterative self-correcting mechanism.</p>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Hierarchical ReAct agent planning in LLaMP. Two levels of agents are deployed using a standardized LangChain interface. Supervisor ReAct agent oversees assistant ReAct agents at the bottom-level, each equipped with distinct toolkits and data/document stores to accomplish various tasks, including high-fidelity materials information retrieval, atomistic modeling and simulations, and literature search. For a detailed example, refer to Figure A.1.</p>
<p>The full list of agents are defined in A.1. Each MP assistant agent employs a self-correcting mechanism, enabling agents to refine their API calls and improve task completion rates. The framework's modularity enable a seamless integration of new assistant agents, allowing for extensibility to various materials discovery methods and experimental techniques [20, 27, 36, 37, 44].</p>
<h1>4.2 Self-consistency of response (SCoR)</h1>
<p>When LLMs are integrated in scientific workflows and deployed in high-stakes settings (i.e. selfdriving labs), it is important for these models to have consistent and predictable behaviors [19]. For numeric knowledge retrieval tasks, we define the following metrics:
Precision measures the uncertainty in the model's responses where $n$ is the number valid responses from $N$ trials and $\hat{\sigma}$ is the standard deviation of valid response:</p>
<p>$$
\text { Precision }=\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n}} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Coefficient of Precision (CoP) maps the precision to $(0,1]$ :</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{CoP}=\exp (-\text { Precision })=\exp \left(-\frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \in(0,1]
$$</p>
<p>Confidence measures the ratio of generating $n$ valid responses in $N$ trials:</p>
<p>$$
\text { Confidence }=\frac{n}{N}
$$</p>
<p>Self-consistency of Response (SCoR) is then defined as</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{SCoR}=\mathrm{CoP} \times \text { Confidence } \in[0,1]
$$</p>
<p>The limit of $\mathrm{SCoR}=1$ is reached when the model yields the same response to a given query every time. At the limit of $\mathrm{SCoR}=0$, the model is either very inconsistent (with large variance across the responses) or very reluctant (with low confidence) to answer the query. Despite the simplicity in definition, SCoR effectively reflects the reproducibility and practical usability of the method, which is important when the method is incorporated into broader systems where the stable and expected behaviors are prioritized.</p>

<h2>5 Experiments</h2>
<h3>5.1 Multimodal ReAct Augmentation</h3>
<p>Materials design often involves multi-objective property optimization. These properties span a Pareto front where optimizing one factor incurs deterioration in others. To succeed in such tasks, combining different modalities of materials properties is necessary. LLaMP achieves this through the hierarchical orchestration of multiple ReAct agents [42]. For the example question "<em>What's the stiffest material with the lowest formation energy in Si-O system?</em>" (Figure A.1), when a query requires multimodal information and compound logic, the supervisor agent decomposes the query into multiple subtasks, delegates them to assistant agents (MPThermoExpert and MPElasticityExpert) for information retrieval, and in the final stage of reasoning integrates information from both modalities, drawing on the context in episodic memory retrieved from the assistant agents (Figure 1). This enables LLaMP to achieve various tasks step-by-step by combining multiple data sources from the Materials Project (MP) (e.g. 3D crystal structures, thermodynamic, mechanical, magnetic properties, and more listed in and Appendix A.1) in a single query. In fact, we found that flat planning implementation struggles to accomplish tool usages and RAG because the single agent sees too much information at once and often fails to follow the API schema (see Section 4.1 for details).</p>
<h3>5.2 Performance Benchmarks</h3>
<p><strong>Response quality and consistency</strong> We evaluate the performance of LLaMP, StructChem [26], Darwin [38], and vanilla LLMs (gpt-4, llama3-8b, gemini-1.0-pro) on material properties such as bulk modulus, formation energy, and bandgap (Figure 2, Table 1). Performance is assessed through Precision, CoP, SCoR, and MAE metrics, as defined in Section 4.2. We argue that any useful LLM agents to be included in the scientific workflow should have high SCoR and low error on the materials properties. Notably, LLaMP consistently outperforms other models, achieving the highest SCoR and the lowest errors across material properties, making it highly suitable for scientific</p>

The metrics from left to right are precision (sample standard deviation), coefficient of precision (CoP), confidence, self-consistency of response (SCoR), and mean absolute error (MAE), where Materials Project are taken as the ground truth. All the tabulated values are the average metrics over five runs and the sampled materials. All LLaMP and StructChem results use GPT-4 as backend language provider.</p>

<p>High-fidelity and higher-order data retrieval The challenge for LLMs in excelling at knowledge- and data-intensive tasks is well-documented [5, 11, 19]. Figure 3 shows the prediction of LLaMP, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on the magnetic orderings and total magnetization of 800 materials randomly selected from all unary, binary, and ternary compounds in MP. Our result indicates that without RAG, vanilla LLMs suffer from hallucinations and misclassify the magnetic orderings of materials. LLaMP with GPT-4 as backend can counteract the intrinsic bias of GPT models, increasing the classification accuracy to 0.98 and $R^{2}$ of magnetization prediction to 0.992 (Table 2). We note that GPT-3.5 as backend, while effective for classification and other information retrieval tasks, struggles to distinguish total_magnetization from magnetization_per_formula_unit in magnetism API schema and often requests the wrong field and forgets to normalize the values. In the magnetic orderings queries, LLaMP with GPT-3.5 as backend fails to distinguish ferromagnetic (FM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) orderings, while LLaMP with GPT-4 as backend gracefully separates the two classes (Figure 3a, d).</p>
<p>We further test the capability of LLaMP and LLMs for higher-order data (such as tensors, 3D crystal structures, curves). As shown in Table B5.2, GPT-3.5 hallucinates the values for the components in the elastic tensor of NaCl , with serious erroneous values such as $C_{11}=$ 289.2 GPa-a significant deviation from DFTcalculated values ( 76 GPa ). It also omits the values for $C_{22}, C_{33}, C_{55}, C_{66}$ and fails to represent the full elastic tensor in a matrix format, despite the query explicitly requesting the full elastic tensor. This hightlights the limitation of</p>

<h1>5.3 Real-world Applications</h1>
<p>Inorganic synthesis recipes Empowered by the MP synthesis endpoint, LLaMP can extract synthesis recipes and summarize detailed step-by-step procedures grounded on real experimental papers with associated DOI references, as demonstrated in the example queries (Table B5.9 and B5.10). Vanilla GPT-3.5 gives a seemingly correct and verbose synthesis procedure for $\mathrm{YMnO}<em 2="2">{3}$ in Table B5.9, inferring possible reaction pathways from two common oxides as precursors $\left(\mathrm{Y}</em>} \mathrm{O<em 2="2">{3}\right.$ and $\mathrm{MnO}</em>}$ ). However, it pulls irrelevant lithium compounds $\left(\mathrm{Li<em 3="3">{2} \mathrm{CO}</em>\right.$ and LiOH$)$ into the recipe and overlooks the fact that metathesis reactions $[18,33]$ require less applied energy than high-temperature sintering, which relies on solid-state diffusion [23]. Vanilla GPT-3.5 also exhibits uncertainty about specific synthesis details, such as heating temperature, duration, cooling rate, etc.
Consider the example of $\mathrm{LiFePO}<em 4="4">{4}$ presented in Table B5.10. Explicit instruction is provided: "Please provide a detailed step-by-step procedure and reference." While GPT-3.5 does offer both a procedure and reference as asked, and the reference is indeed associated with a real paper, the paper itself contains no information about the synthesis procedure of $\mathrm{LiFePO}</em>$. The procedure listed in Table B5.10 is dissociated from the title and is hallucinated from the pre-training corpus.

<p>RAG-assisted crystal generation and editing Fine-tuned LLMs for text-encoded atomistic information have shown the capability to generate stable crystals under the constraints of atomic positions and charges [9]. In this context, we delve into the examination and comparison of the crystal generation capabilities between LLaMP and GPT-3.5, without resorting to fine-tuning or tailored prompt messages in previous work. Figure 4 showcases the structures generated by LLaMP and vanilla GPT-3.5 without RAG, both instructed to insert one lithium atom at the tetrahedral site of the diamond cubic silicon structure (Table B5.11). Notably, both LLaMP and GPT-3.5 place an additional Li atom at fractional coordinate $(0.5,0.5,0.5)$. However, the Si structure retrieved by LLaMP adheres to the MP convention, positioning two Si bases at $(0.125,0.125,0.125)$ and $(0.875,0.875,0.875)$. This causes the inserted Li atom to be hexagonal interstitial instead of tetrahedral interstitial.
GPT-3.5 locates the Li atom at the tetrahedral site given the "luckily chosen" Si bases at $(0,0,0)$ and $(0.25,0.25,0.25)$; however, the resulting cell volume and shape are highly distorted, and the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{Si}$</p>
<p>bond length and $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{Si}$ angle deviate significantly from the ground truth (Table 3), highlighting the limitations in the intrinsic encoding of LLMs for atomistic information and the challenges associated with zero-shot generation of crystal structures. In contrast, the LLaMP-retrieved MP structure serves as a robust prior, anchoring the lattice parameters of the generated structure to the correct values.</p>
<p>Language-driven simulation LLaMP equipped with Python REPL and atomistic simulation workflow package atomate2 performs well out of the box for complex multi-step simulations using pre-trained universal machine learning interatomic potential MACE-MP-0 [2] through language instruction. As demonstrated in Appendix C.1 and Appendix C.2, LLaMP is able to follow multi-step instruction to fetch stable crystal structure from MP, generate a supercell of atomic structure, and run annealing molecular dynamics simulation with varying temperature from 300 K to 800 K and back to 300 K . After the simulation is finished, LLaMP can read the simulation trajectories and plot the temperature profile over time (Appendix C.1).</p>
<h1>6 Discussion</h1>
<p>Robustness The hierarchical ReAct framework implemented here is essentially a graph of agents, or language graph, with one central node (supervisor) in connection with many satellite nodes (assistants). The implementation of ReAct for the assistant agents enables self-correcting tool usages and fortifies the robustness of data retrieval. As presented in Figure A.1c, MPThermoExpert initially misunderstood the schema at the first trial and filled in the formula field with $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$, an invalid input but a valid one for chemical system (chemsys) field. The observation step (step 4) allows MPThermoExpert to handle exceptions and to refine the correct input fields after adaptation (step 6). Storing (Retrieving) question-answer and query-argument pairs to (from) vector databases could further reduce the number of trial-and-error steps, and the stored pairs can be used to refine foundation LLMs to improve function calling quality.
Limitation We recognize the effectiveness of LLaMP's framework relies on backbone LLM's function calling and reasoning capabilities. Sometimes LLMs misunderstand the description of schemas and therefore yield unexpected behaviors. For example, sort_fields argument allows sorting the returned documents in ascending order or descending order if the field is prefixed with - , but LLMs sometimes mistake the sign and sort in the opposite order. The correctness of LLaMP is also subject to the quality of theoretical prediction and the comprehensiveness of the data in MP. Other than the underpredicted bandgaps by GGA functional, MP's ongoing effort to search all possible magnetic configurations is also not complete. Most of the existing calculations in MP start from high-spin ferromagnetic configurations, which may overlook many antiferromagnetic ground states below the current energy convex hull. While MP is one of the most comprehensive materials databases, the available crystal structures on MP are not exhaustive but continuously expanding [24]. Furthermore, Kohn-Sham DFT theory is insufficient in some cases, and a higher level of theory is needed. Currently LLaMP only supports a few atomate2 workflows with machine learning force fields and VASP calculations. More diverse electronic calculation methods and workflows will be supported in the future work.</p>
<p>Summary We present a hierarchical agentic framework, LLaMP, based on ReAct to extract and manipulate material informatics through few-shot generalization. By grounding thoughts and actions with high-fidelity information, LLaMP showcases the ability to integrate various modalities of material properties and perform logical inferences to accomplish assigned tasks, all without the need for fine-tuning. In essence, the proposed LangChain framework holds the potential to expand its applicability to multiple data sources, encompassing both theoretical computations and experimental data, and real-world laboratories by incorporating additional assistant agents for data retrieval and robot control. LLaMP functions as a knowledge-aware agent, empowering users to navigate and manipulate complex materials informatics. In the context of self-driving labs [3, 32], LLM agents with multimodal data sources, sensors, and actors may improve their decision making and operation [25]. As new tools continue to emerge, there is an exciting avenue for further exploration to ascertain if this framework can effectively facilitate scientific hypothesis generation and guide data-driven experiments.</p>

<h1>A. 2 Prompt Template</h1>
<p>We use the ReAct template hwchase17/react-multi-input-json from LangChain Hub (https://smith.langchain.com/hub/hwchase17/react-json) as follows:</p>
<p>Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:
{tools}
The way you use the tools is by specifying a JSON blob.
Specifically, this JSON should have an 'action' key (with the name of the tool to use) and an 'action_input' key (with the input to the tool going here).</p>
<p>The only values that should be in the "action" field are: {tool_names}
The \$JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid \$JSON_BLOB:
・・
{{
"action": \$TOOL_NAME,
"action_input": \$INPUT
}}
・・
ALWAYS use the following format:
Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
・・
\$JSON_BLOB
・・
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters 'Final Answer' when responding.</p>
<p>The above system prompt message is prepended with the following solicitation to guide the supervisor agent:</p>
<p>You name is LLaMP and you are a helpful agent that can consult materials-related data through Materials Project (MP) database, arXiv, Wikipedia, and run calculations/simulations via a python REPL and MP atomate2 computational workflow.</p>
<p>If you get an error, debug your code and try again. Only use the output of your code to answer the question. Ask user to clarify their queries if needed. Please note that you don't have direct control over MP but through multiple assistant agents to help you. You need to provide complete context in the input for assistants to do their job. REFINE and CRITQUE the output of the assistants if needed. You can end the conversation by saying "Bye".</p>

<td>What is the full elastic tensor of NaCl ?</td>
<td>The elastic tensor for NaCl is available for two different entries on Materials Project. For material 'id 'mp-22851', the elastic tensor in IEEE format is $[[76.0,1.0$, $1.0,-0.0,0.0,-0.0],[1.0,76.0,1.0$, $-0.0,-0.0,0.0],[1.0,1.0,76.0,0.0$, $-0.0,-0.0],[-0.0,-0.0,0.0,-3.0$, $-0.0,-0.0],[0.0,-0.0,-0.0,-0.0$, $-3.0,0.0],[-0.0,0.0,-0.0,-0.0,0.0$, $-3.0]]$. For material 'id 'mp-22862', the elastic tensor in IEEE format is $[[47.0,12.0,12.0,0.0,-0.0,-0.0]$, $[12.0,47.0,12.0,0.0,-0.0,-0.0]$, $[12.0,12.0,47.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0]$, $[0.0,0.0,0.0,12.0,-0.0,-0.0],[-0.0$, $-0.0,0.0,-0.0,12.0,0.0],[-0.0,-0.0$, $-0.0,-0.0,0.0,12.0]]$.</td>
