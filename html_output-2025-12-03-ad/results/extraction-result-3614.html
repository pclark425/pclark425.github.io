                <p><strong>Paper Venue:</strong> Philosophia Scientiæ</p>
                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is argued that a growing body of evidence suggests that concepts do not constitute a natural kind, and the notion of concept is inappropriate, if one aims at formulating scientifically relevant inductive generalizations about the human mind.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In cognitive psychology, concepts are those data structures that are stored in long-term memory and are used by default in human beings' higher cognitive processes (categorization, inductive and deductive reasoning...). Most psychologists of concepts assume that these mental representations share many scientifically important properties, and the psychology of concepts is expected to describe those properties. Psychologists assume thereby that concepts constitute a natural kind. I call this assumption the Natural Kind Assumption. This article challenges the Natural Kind Assumption. It is argued that a growing body of evidence suggests that concepts do not constitute a natural kind. Hence, the notion of concept is inappropriate to carve human beings' mental representations at their joints, if one aims at formulating scientifically relevant inductive generalizations about the human mind.</p>
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>In cognitive science, concepts are the data structures that are stored in long-term memory and are used by default in the higher cognitive processes (categorization, inductive and deductive reasoning, analogy making, language understanding...). ${ }^{1}$ Cognitive scientists assume typically that they constitute a homogenous class of mental representations. Of course, everybody recognizes that there are plenty of differences between concepts and also between kinds of concepts: DOG and CAT have different properties and so do folk biological concepts and concepts of artifacts. But it is assumed that over and above these differences, the mental representations that are used in our higher cognitive processes share a large number of properties. The goal of a psychological theory of concepts is to capture those properties. Since it is assumed that their properties explain many properties of the higher cognitive processes, developing an adequate theory of concepts is a prerequisite for a good cognitive theory.</p>
<p>Such a view is nicely put by the psychologist Gregory Murphy in his recent survey of the psychology of concepts:</p>
<p>The psychology of concepts cannot by itself provide a full explanation of the concepts of all the different domains that psychologists are interested in. This book will not explore the psychology of concepts of persons, musical forms, numbers, physical motions, and political systems. The details of each of these must be discovered by the specific disciplines that study them (...). Nonetheless, the general processes of concept learning and representation may well be found in each of these domains. For example, I would be quite surprised if concepts of musical</p>
<p>forms did not follow a prototype structure (chapter 2), did not have a preferred level of categorization (chapter 7), and did not show differences depending on expertise or knowledge (chapter 6). (2002, 2-3, my emphasis)</p>
<p>This view of concepts says essentially that concepts constitute a natural kind, that is, a class of entities about which many inductive generalizations can be formulated. I call the view that concepts constitute a natural kind the natural kind assumption or, for short, the NK assumption.</p>
<p>The NK assumption is widely accepted (sometimes explicitly, e.g., Medin et al. 2000, 123; Prinz 2002) by psychologists, philosophers of psychology and, more generally, cognitive scientists. Arguably, it has been part and parcel of the psychology of concepts. Psychologists believe that with the notion of concept, they have identified one of the important classes for a scientific psychology - one of those classes that support the formulation of many inductive generalizations. For more than thirty years, they have been looking for generalizations about members of this class. ${ }^{2}$ In effect, they have been assuming the NK assumption.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread endorsement of the NK assumption, this paper sets out to challenge it. Indeed, I make a case for the following claim:</p>
<p>A growing amount of evidence suggests that concepts do not constitute a natural kind.</p>
<p>I am claiming that, contrary to what has been assumed in cognitive science for thirty years, the data structures that are used by default in our higher cognitive processes do not constitute a homogenous kind about which many inductive generalizations can be formulated. Thus, the notion of concept is not an adequate way of carving human beings' mental representations at their joints, if one aims at formulating scientifically relevant inductive generalizations about the human mind.</p>
<p>Before going any further, I should discard a possible misunderstanding. In this paper, I am not addressing the usual questions raised about concepts by philosophers of mind. I take for granted the notion of concept that prevails in cognitive psychology - data structures that are used by default in our higher cognitive processes. The issue is then the following: psychologists believe that the class of concepts is important for a scientific psychology, because it supports many inductive generalizations. This is the NK assumption: concepts are a natural kind. In this paper, I set out to reject this assumption.</p>
<p>In the first section, I cast some light on the NK assumption, spelling out what properties the class of concepts should possess in order to be a natural kind. On this basis, I present in the second section the argument from explanatory necessity, which shows that the class of concepts does not possess these properties. It claims that psychologists have to posit several kinds of concepts that have little in common in order to explain our higher cognitive processes. In the last two sections, I defend two premises of this argument. In the third section, I show that the main psychological theories of concepts have posited three</p>
<p>theoretical entities that have little in common. In the last section, I present some empirical evidence, drawn from the psychological research on concept combination, that we are justified in positing all these entities. I conclude that the NK assumption is misconceived.</p>
<h1>2. The Natural Kind Assumption</h1>
<h3>2.1. Natural Kind and Induction</h3>
<p>The notion of natural kind is essentially enmeshed with the problem of induction (Mill 1905; Quine 1969; Boyd 1990, 1991; Hacking 1991). For, the notion of natural kind singles out those classes about which non accidental, scientifically relevant inductive generalizations can be formulated. It assumes that there are two kinds of classes: those about which inductive generalizations can be formulated, e.g., atoms, and those about which no or few generalizations can be formulated, e.g., things that weigh more than 124 kilos. Thus, the members of a natural kind are supposed to share non accidentally a large number of (logically unrelated), scientifically important properties (or relations) beside the properties (or relations) that are used to identify them.</p>
<p>Since members of natural kinds have many properties in common, natural kinds are the building blocks of scientific generalizations. Many empirical sciences purport to identify the natural kinds in their domain in order to develop adequate empirical theories. Psychology is no exception. Psychologists look for classes of entities about which scientifically relevant generalizations could be made. They introduce new notions to pick out kinds that are believed to be natural (e.g., the notion of basic emotion) and they reject notions that turn out to pick out kinds that are not natural (Griffiths 1997).</p>
<h1>2.2. Two Red Herrings: Essences and Laws</h1>
<p>Now this core idea has been cashed out in many ways. Which account is best suited for my present purpose? Clearly, this account has to be both applicable to psychological kinds and to be broad. Otherwise, the denial of the NK assumption would simply be trivial.</p>
<p>Two accounts are thus inadequate. According to a common account, natural kinds are characterized by the possession of an essence, that is, a set of intrinsic, causally explanatory properties that are necessary and jointly sufficient to belong to the kind (Putnam 1975). However, it is unlikely that psychological kinds possess essences - at least, if the functionalist view is true. And this notion is excessively restrictive: for example, species wouldn't be natural kinds according to this account (Hull 1978). One might want to broaden the notion of essence, by including relational properties alongside intrinsic ones. However, this notion of natural kind would remain unsatisfactory. For, it does not distinguish the conditions of membership in the kind from the possession of causally explanatory properties. However, in some natural kinds, the properties that are causally explanatory are not necessary conditions of membership, for not all members possess these properties. The class of political parties in democratic societies illustrates this point. The conditions of membership in this class are arguably different from the causal properties that explain why most democratic political parties share many properties.</p>
<p>According to another account, natural kind terms feature in laws, that is, in generalizations that are temporally and spatially unrestricted and that support counterfactuals (Collier 1996). Now, psychological kinds feature in ceteris paribus</p>
<p>generalizations - not in laws (Fodor 1974). And, again, this notion is too restrictive: few kind terms feature in laws. One could propose to replace the notion of law by the notion of ceteris paribus generalization. This is a step in the right direction, as we shall see below. However, an important element is missing from this account, namely the idea that there is at least one causal mechanism that accounts for these generalizations. This is an important aspect of the kinds scientists are interested in for inductive purposes.</p>
<h1>2.3. The Causal Notion of Natural Kind</h1>
<p>A broader notion has been developed by Richard Boyd (1990, 1991; Griffiths 1997).
A class C of entities is a natural kind if and only if there is a large set of scientifically relevant properties such that C is the maximal class whose members tend to share these properties because of some causal mechanism.</p>
<p>The core idea of this definition is the following. A natural kind is a class about which many generalizations can be formulated: its members tend to have many properties in common. These generalizations are not accidental: there is at least one causal mechanism that explains why its members tend to have those properties. Finally, this class is not a subset of a larger class about which the same generalizations could be formulated.</p>
<p>One might object that "large" is too vague. However, this complaint is unfounded. For the notion of natural kind, like the notion of heap, is vague. Even if there is no way to sharpen the idea of "a large set of properties", it remains that the number of properties that can be projected from one subset of the class to the whole class is one dimension that distinguishes natural kinds from other classes.</p>
<p>Inversely, one might object that a class of entities that would share only few scientifically important properties would be a natural kind. First, one can question whether such classes really exist. These fundamental properties would plausibly cause the members of this class to possess other properties. Moreover, if there were such classes, I would stick to my guns: they would not be natural kinds. For, they would be noticeably different from the paradigmatic natural kinds. Instead of stretching the notion of natural kind in order to include them, it would arguably be better to distinguish two types of scientific kinds: the natural kinds whose members share many properties and, say, the fundamental kinds, whose members share few fundamental properties.</p>
<p>In the present context, two points are important. First, the properties that characterize a natural kind are not necessarily possessed by all its members. It is only required that members of a natural kind tend to have these properties. Hence, natural kind terms don't have to feature in laws. It is only required that they feature in ceteris paribus generalizations.</p>
<p>Second, essences are only one of the possible causal mechanisms that explain why members of a natural kind share or tend to share many properties. Boyd has insisted upon the homeostasis of properties (1990): in some natural kinds, the occurrence of a property causes the occurrence of other properties and is caused by their occurrence. Other mechanisms are possible, including common descent and social causes (Griffiths 1997).</p>
<h1>2.4. The NK Assumption</h1>
<p>The causal notion of natural kind is relevant for my present purpose. It allows psychological kinds to be natural kinds, since natural kinds do not have to possess essences nor to feature in laws. Moreover, this notion has a large extension: substances, e.g., gold, physical entities, e.g., atoms, species, e.g., dogs, and artifacts do qualify as natural kinds. However, the causal notion of natural kind is not vacuous. It implies that nominal kinds, for instance, the class of physical objects that weigh more than 30 kilos, are not natural kinds. For their members don't share many (scientifically relevant) properties. Moreover, it implies that many subsets of natural kinds, e.g., white dogs, are not natural kinds either. For the properties that are true of white dogs are true of all dogs (except being white).</p>
<p>In what follows, I use exclusively the causal notion of natural kind. Hence, the NK assumption says that the class of data structures that are used by default in our higher cognitive processes possesses three properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a large set $S$ of properties that these data structures tend to possess.</li>
<li>They possess these properties because of some causal mechanism.</li>
<li>This set of properties is specific to this class of data structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, psychologists who endorse the NK assumption are not committed to deny the existence of differences between concepts or kinds of concepts (Medin et al. 2000). For despite these differences, concepts may share a large set of properties.</p>
<h1>2.5. The Received View</h1>
<p>For more than thirty years, the cognitive psychology of concepts has been built on the view that concepts constitute a homogenous class about which specific, scientifically relevant generalizations can be formulated. Although some psychologists have recently endorsed the heterogeneity hypothesis (e.g., Ashby et al. 1998; Hahn and Chater 1998; Smith et al. 1998), many still endorse this view, particularly prototype theorists (e.g., Hampton 2001; Smith 2002), exemplar theorists (e.g., Juslin and Persson 2002; Zaki and Nosofky 2004), and theory theorists (e.g., Carey 2000). Barsalou and colleagues assume that most concepts, if not all, are perceptual symbols (Barsalou 1999). The recent search for hybrid models of concepts (see Section 5.6) suggests similarly that psychologists have not renounced the belief that concepts constitute a homogeneous class of representations. Several philosophers of psychology share this commitment. For instance, Prinz (2002) proposes that most concepts, if not all, are proxytypes. Moreover, the received view has driven the methodology of the psychology of concepts and of the higher cognitive functions. In substance, psychologists have tried to find data that were easily accounted for by their pet theory of concepts, but that were problematic for rival theories. Rival theories could account for these data only with ad hoc assumptions. Now, this methodology assumes that the class of concepts is homogenous and, therefore, that all the data about concepts have to be accounted for by a unique theory. This is tantamount to assume the NK assumption.</p>
<h1>3. The Argument From Explanatory Necessity</h1>
<h3>3.1. The Heterogeneity Hypothesis</h3>
<p>Given the causal notion of natural kind, there are three options to rebut the NK assumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>It could not be the case that the data structures that are used by default in the higher cognitive processes have many properties in common.</li>
<li>These mental representations could have many properties in common by accident.</li>
<li>They could have those properties because they are a subset of a larger set of representations: no empirical generalization could be made specifically about them. I propose that the available empirical evidence about our concepts supports strongly the first option: it is not the case that concepts have in common a large set of properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed, I will argue that the class of concepts is divided into several kinds of representations that have little in common. I call this claim the heterogeneity hypothesis. There are several readings of this hypothesis. One could claim that different types of categories, say the folk biological categories and the artifact categories, are represented by different kinds of concepts and that these kinds have little in common. For example, there could be few properties common to DOG and TABLE, because in general, concepts of biological kinds and concepts of artifacts could have little in common. One could also claim that different cognitive processes are defined over different kinds of concepts and that these kinds have little in common. For example, a concept of dogs used in the categorization process could have little in common with a concept of dogs used in induction, because in general, concepts that are used in the categorization process and concepts that are used in the induction process could have little in common. I reject both readings.</p>
<p>Instead, I claim that most categories are represented by several concepts that belong to kinds that have little in common. For example, we have several concepts of dogs, each of which belongs to a different kind of concepts. There are few properties common to these concepts because in general, the corresponding kinds of concepts have little in common. I call these kinds "the basic kinds of concepts". Each of these concepts of dogs can be used in our various higher cognitive processes. We can use $\mathrm{DOG}<em 2="2">{1}, \mathrm{DOG}</em>$ etc. to categorize, to reason inductively, to reason deductively etc. They qualify as concepts because they are poised to be used in our higher cognitive processes. They are data structures that are used by default in cognitive processes. Safe for specific circumstances, we rely on these data structures, when we decide whether something is a dog, when we reason about dogs... Beliefs about dogs that are not part of these data structures can be used in our cognitive processes as well. However, they are not poised to be used in them. They are retrieved from long-term memory merely occasionally. This idea is summarized by the following figure.}, \mathrm{DOG}_{3</p>
<p>Put Figure 1 about here.</p>
<p>This view of our higher cognition stands in sharp contrast with the received view. Our higher conceptual processes are not defined over a homogenous class of mental representations. Thus, the class of concepts is not useful to draw scientifically relevant generalizations about our mental representations. Instead of trying unproductively to characterize the properties that are generally possessed by concepts, psychologists and</p>
<p>other cognitive scientists' explicit goal should be to characterize each basic kind of concepts. I submit that the properties that are characteristic of each of them are not characteristic of the others. This is the right grain for theorizing about our mental representations.</p>
<p>Some might object that we knew all along that we use different kinds of knowledge in our higher cognitive processes. Isn't it obvious that we can use any kind of knowledge to decide whether something is a dog? Granted. But this is beside the point. For the claim is (i) that we have specific data structures in our mind that are poised for being used in our cognitive processes and (ii) that these structures divide into different kinds that have little in common. That we may use any kind of information in our higher cognitive processes does not say anything about the class of data structures that are used by default in our higher cognitive processes. Psychologists and some philosophers of psychology aim at formulating generalizations about them, assuming thereby that they are homogeneous. I deny this claim.</p>
<h1>3.2. The Argument From Explanatory Necessity</h1>
<p>It is now possible to state the following argument against the NK assumption:</p>
<h2>The Argument from Explanatory Necessity</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Concepts, that is, data structures used by default in our higher cognitive processes, are posited in order to explain the properties of these processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theoretical constructs posited by the main theories of concepts have little in common.</p>
</li>
<li>In order to explain the properties of the higher cognitive processes, we need to assume that these theoretical constructs are used by default in our higher cognitive processes.</li>
<li>Hence, these processes use several kinds of representations that do not share a large set of properties.</li>
<li>Hence, concepts are not a natural kind.</li>
</ol>
<p>The core idea of this argument is straightforward. Concepts are theoretical entities that are posited in order to explain the properties of our higher cognitive processes. In order to provide a satisfactory explanation, we have to posit several kinds of concepts that have little in common. Which ones? At least those that have been assumed by the main paradigms of concepts in the recent psychological literature.</p>
<p>Clearly, this argument is empirical. The truth of premise 3 is a matter of fact. Thus, the whole argument claims that the available empirical evidence about concepts and about the higher cognitive processes supports the denial of the NK assumption. Since this argument is empirical, new empirical data could support a different conclusion.</p>
<p>I will take premise 1 for granted. Almost all psychologists and many philosophers of psychology (e.g., Prinz 2002) assume it. Concepts are those data structures that we use by default in our higher cognitive processes. Their properties explain how we reason, how we categorize etc. In what follows, I argue for premises 2 and 3.</p>
<h1>4. Three Kinds of Representations that Have Little in Common</h1>
<p>In this section, I defend the second premise of the argument from explanatory necessity. I first present the three main paradigms of concepts in the contemporary literature on concepts. Then, I show that they posit three theoretical constructs that have little in common.</p>
<h3>4.1. Three Theoretical Entities: Prototypes, Exemplars, Theories</h3>
<p>Since the rejection of the classical view of concepts in the 1970's, cognitive psychology has produced three main views, the prototype view of concepts, the exemplar view of concepts, and the theory view of concepts. ${ }^{3}$</p>
<p>The prototype view of concepts is built around the idea that concepts are prototypes (e.g., Rosch and Mervis 1975; Smith et al. 1988; Smith and Minda 2002) ${ }^{4}$ :</p>
<p>A concept of a class of objects is a prototype, i.e., a data structure that encodes some statistical information about the properties possessed by the members of this class, particularly, about the properties possessed by most members of this class. Prototypes single out the properties of the members of the denoted category in statistical terms. In most prototype models (but not in all), prototypes are assumed to encode some information about the typical properties of the denoted category, that is, the properties that are judged to be possessed by most members of the category. Importantly, these properties are not judged to be necessary. For example, to have a concept of dogs is to think by</p>
<p>default of dogs as having generally, but not necessarily, such form, as having generally a tail etc. ${ }^{5}$</p>
<p>According to the exemplar view of concepts, our higher cognitive processes are defined over representations of specific category members, which stand for the whole category (e.g., Medin and Shaffer 1978; Nosofsky 1988; Juslin and Persson 2002).</p>
<p>A concept of a class of objects consists of a set of exemplars, i.e., of representations of particular members of this class. ${ }^{6}$</p>
<p>For example, to have a concept of dogs is to think by default of dogs as being the class of entities that are similar to Fido, Pluto, and Spot and to use these individual representations to reason about dogs in general.</p>
<p>According to the theory view of concepts, our mental representations are similar to scientific theories and the cognitive processes are similar to scientific forms of reasoning (Murphy and Medin 1985; Carey 1985; Keil 1989; Gopnik and Meltzoff 1997; Keil and Wilson 2000). ${ }^{7}$</p>
<p>A concept of a class of entities is a theory about this class, that is, a data structure that encodes some nomological, causal, modal and functional generalizations about this class</p>
<p>To possess a concept of dogs is to think by default of dogs as being the class of entities that satisfy some kind of theory, i.e., some nomological, modal, causal and functional</p>
<p>generalizations (e.g., a theoretical concept of dogs may say of dogs that they necessarily engender individuals that belong to the same species).</p>
<h1>4.2. Prototypes, Exemplars and Theories have Little in Common</h1>
<p>The claim is that these three theoretical constructs have little in common. Now, how does one evaluate how different various kinds of mental representations are? Clearly, exemplars, theories and prototypes have plenty of irrelevant properties in common, for example not being cups of tea. What matters, however, are those properties that psychologists take to be important when they aim at characterizing mental representations. Psychologists focus on the representational properties of mental representations and on their functional properties, i.e., what mental representations represent and how they are used in cognitive processes. Hence, if exemplars, prototypes and theories have different representational and functional properties, this would suggest that they have little in common. ${ }^{8}$
$&gt;$ Prototypes, exemplars and theories are assumed to encode three different types of knowledge</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>According to exemplar theorists, applying a concept to an individual is tantamount to think that this individual is similar to some specific individuals, which are themselves described as having such and such properties. Thus, the mind stores some information about the properties of specific individuals, for example, some descriptions of Fido and Spot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to prototype theorists ${ }^{9}$, applying a concept to an individual is tantamount to think that this individual possesses to a sufficient degree a sufficient number of typical properties. Thus, the mind stores some statistical information about the properties that characterize classes of individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>According to theory theorists, applying a concept to an individual is tantamount to think that this individual possesses some properties either with some modal force, or because of some nomological relation, or for some causal or functional reason. Thus, the mind is storing some modal, nomological, causal and functional information about classes of individuals.</li>
</ul>
<p>For most categories, it is possible to encode some information about the typical properties of their members, some modal, nomological and causal information about them and some information about the properties possessed by some of them. Hence, most categories could be represented by a prototype, a theory and a set of exemplars.
$&gt;$ Prototypes, exemplars and theories are assumed to be used in three different kinds of cognitive processes ${ }^{10}$</p>
<ul>
<li>Exemplar theorists and prototype theorists suppose that the higher cognitive processes involve the computation of the similarity between some representations and, respectively, sets of exemplars and prototypes.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this a bit more concrete, consider how a prototype theorist might explain the categorization process. Peter sees a dog. He forms a representation that attributes some properties to the dog. The properties that are attributed are matched with the properties that</p>
<p>are represented by several prototypes, including the prototype of dogs. The similarity between the dog and each prototype is computed. Since the similarity between the dog and the prototype of dogs is higher than the similarity between the dog and the other prototypes, Peter concludes that he is seeing a dog. Various properties of our other higher cognitive processes are explained in similar terms (see Osherson et al. 1990 on induction; see Hampton 1982, 1988 and Sloman 1998 on deduction; see Osherson and Smith 1989 on probabilistic reasoning).</p>
<p>Advocates of the exemplar view would provide a similar explanation of the categorization process, except that the dog would be compared to sets of exemplars, instead of prototypes (Nosofsky 1988). Many properties of the other higher cognitive processes could be explained in the same terms (e.g., Juslin and Persson 2002).</p>
<ul>
<li>Advocates of the exemplar view and of the prototype view assume different ways of computing the similarity between a represented object and, respectively, sets of exemplars and prototypes. In brief, prototype theorists assume that the similarity measure is linear, while exemplar theorists take it to be non linear.</li>
<li>The theory view of concepts assumes that our higher cognitive processes do not rely on similarity. On the contrary, they are supposed to be similar to the reasoning processes that are used in science. Since theory theorists are less concerned with our cognitive processes than prototype and exemplar theorists, their views on our cognitive processes are less developed. Theory theorists often compare our reasoning processes to explanations (Keil and Wilson 2000) or to inferences to the best explanation (Murphy and Medin 1985). They</li>
