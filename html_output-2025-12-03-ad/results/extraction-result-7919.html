                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The role of the Alzheimer's Association in the genesis of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract Here we highlight the Alzheimer's Association's role since its inception, as a strategic collaborator with National Institutes of Health–National Institute on Aging in the development of the modern era of the Alzheimer's Movement and in making Alzheimer's disease (AD) a national priority in the United States by developing several initiatives to advance knowledge about the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of dementia. Among these collaborative undertakings, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an exemplary case, launched with groundwork by the Neuroimaging Working Group sponsored by the Association's Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute on AD. The unique contribution of the Association to the development of ADNI includes participation as a member of ADNI's Private Partner Scientific Board and involvement in developing an AD biomarker standardization and validation subproject, which has led to a conceptual shift in the field to define AD based on its underlying biology. Furthermore, the creation of Worldwide ADNI (WW‐ADNI) is highlighted, underscoring the global impact of these efforts. Highlights The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a keystone undertaking in the evolving landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, and is now in its fourth iteration. The Alzheimer's Association has partnered with ADNI since its inception. ADNI 4 and the Association continue to collaborate, ensuring representation within the study population.</p>

Here we highlight the Alzheimer's Association's role since its inception, as a strategic collaborator with National Institutes of Health-National Institute on Aging in the development of the modern era of the Alzheimer's Movement and in making Alzheimer's disease (AD) a national priority in the United States by developing several initiatives to advance knowledge about the cause, diagnosis, and treatment of dementia.Among these collaborative undertakings, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is an exemplary case, launched with groundwork by the Neuroimaging Working Group sponsored by the Association's Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute on AD.The unique contribution of the Association to the development of ADNI includes participation as a member of ADNI's Private Partner Scientific Board and involvement in developing an AD biomarker standardization and validation subproject, which has led to a conceptual shift in the field to define AD based on its underlying biology.Furthermore, the creation of Worldwide ADNI (WW-ADNI) is highlighted, underscoring the global impact of these efforts.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a keystone undertaking in the evolving landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD)</p>
<p>research.The Alzheimer's Association has been a critical partner since the inception of ADNI, by early support of a workgroup that prepared the essential features and groundwork for the launch of ADNI and subsequent steadfast support of the project throughout its various iterations.</p>
<p>As a vital part of the longstanding strategic collaborations with federal funding agencies, the Alzheimer's Association over the years</p>
<p>ROLE OF THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION DURING THE EARLY INCUBATION PERIOD OF ADNI</p>
<p>Establishment of the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute on AD</p>
<p>The Alzheimer's Association's contribution to the founding and the maturation of ADNI was seeded through a series of events, including the public announcement of the White House disclosing President Ronald Reagan's diagnosis of AD and re-envisioning of the Association's research arm as the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute (Reagan Institute).</p>
<p>The Reagan Institute embarked on several major projects, essentially to create a working partnership with NIA in developing new program initiatives to promote further research on dementia, including AD.In short order, during the period of 1996 to 2014, many research planning activities were launched in the private sector to formulate policy options that outlined a comprehensive scientific agenda for a national plan to attack the challenges of dementia. 1</p>
<p>Leveraging neuroimaging to advance AD research</p>
<p>At the Alzheimer's Association, the 1996 "business plan" to establish the Ronald &amp; Nancy Reagan Research Institute called for the launching of several programs to build up the national standing of the Association's scientific program and its visibility as a major patron of the scientific front to combat AD.These forward-looking plans of the Reagan Institute included:</p>
<p>• Convening a strong scientific advisory committee.</p>
<p>• Refurbishing and streamlining an electronic peer-review system and grants management operation.Initially, neuroimaging was used primarily to "rule out" other probable causes of cognitive impairment rather than as a "surrogate marker or positive index" of neurodegenerative processes associated with clinical symptoms of the disease.The NWG's efforts shifted this perspective toward using neuroimaging as a valuable tool to provide additional diagnostic information, especially when the clinical facts are uncertain.</p>
<p>It was also the start of some consensus on the increasing importance of "diagnostic neuroimaging" in dementia research and clinical trials and its potential value as a (validated) surrogate marker of disease progression in future efficacy studies of prevention or disease-modifying agents.However, the rigor of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) review required additional data and information to be collected, including standardization of instruments, measurements, methods, and procedures and validation of these measures in well-controlled, well-powered longitudinal multi-site studies.</p>
<p>Thus, the ultimate objectives of the NWG were to initiate a process for standardizing neuroimaging approaches, one modality at a time (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] as the first target), to allow multi-site data gathering, and to support longitudinal studies.Some of the immediate aims of the NWG were to define:</p>
<p>1.The standards for evaluating available technologies, algorithms, and protocols;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What must be done to move neuroimaging from the arena of research to the arena of practical application where it is readily available to the primary care physician;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What can be done to accelerate the process of testing/demonstrating the "efficacy" (i.e., reliability, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the "added value") of neuroimaging as a diagnostic tool in the hands of clinicians; 4. The advantages and limitations of the different imaging modalities (MRI, positron emission tomography [PET], single photon emission computed tomography, etc.), and how are they determined; 5. Guidelines for standardization and the procedure for evaluating future developments in imaging technologies, modalities, or approaches against current "standards"; and 6.The "standard criteria" against which these are tested.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the main challenges in the implementation of the NWG priorities was the diversity of the methods used for the acquisition and processing of data obtained from various patients by different investigators.This diversity of methods made it difficult to compare findings, interpret conclusions, and generalize the results of studies.To address this, there was a clear need for clinical studies to align with standardized acquisition and processing methods.As a result, the NWG</p>
<p>CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP OF ADNI AND THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION</p>
<p>Building off these initial collaborations during the early incubation and nurturing of ADNI, the Association has remained a strong collaborator of the initiative.In this section, we recount the Alzheimer's Association's related activities in supporting ADNI as a public-private venture.</p>
<p>ADNI's PPSB</p>
<p>Role of the Alzheimer's Association in advancements of AD biomarkers through ADNI</p>
<p>One of the most notable achievements of ADNI has been the standardization and validation of amyloid and tau PET imaging, as well as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD diagnosis.During ADNI's inception, ante mortem diagnosing AD was virtually impossible, necessitating autopsy confirmation.This reliance on post mortem examination underscored the critical need for ante mortem diagnostic tools.Comprehensive data on MRI and fluorodeoxyglucose PET collected during ADNI-1 highlighted the baseline differences and longitudinal rates of change in these biomarkers at different stages of the disease progression. 5,6Supported by add-on funding from the Association during ADNI-1, one of the key contributions of ADNI to the field was the inclusion of amyloid PET imaging using 11C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B (PiB). 7,8Similarly, the Association's Global Biomarker Standardization Consortium (GBSC) collaborates with ADNI's Biofluids Biomarker Working Group and moves forward work to standardize and validate biomarker tests for AD and related dementias for use in global clinical practices.ADNI's contributions in the biomarker field have provided substantial data on early AD biomarkers, setting the stage for defining AD based on its underlying biology rather than clinical symptomatology.</p>
<p>The PET data demonstrated that control and MCI individuals with amyloid accumulation in their brains have a substantially higher risk of future cognitive decline and progression to dementia.Further data across biomarker domains confirmed that pathological changes occur early in the preclinical stages of the disease. 9Adding to the biomarker work, ADNI genetic studies have confirmed known AD genetic risk factors and discovered novel susceptibility loci, shedding light on the biological links among genetics, pathology, biomarkers, and clinical presentation.The whole genome sequencing (WGS) work of the ADNI-1 was funded by both the Brin-Wojcicki Foundation and the Alzheimer's Association. 4Together, these data contributed to the larger discussion on the field's understanding of early AD biomarkers and were a key contribution to the discussions at the Association's Research Roundtable in 2009 10</p>
<p>evolved from an essential patient advocacy organization into what it has become: a major international research support-funding entity.Now an important element of the Association's mission is to support research to advance knowledge on AD dementia.ADNI exemplifies a unique data-sharing platform recognized by the Alzheimer's Association as pivotal for advancing scientific understanding and therapeutic development.Through robust data-sharing mechanisms, ADNI has not only accelerated scientific progress but has also informed critical milestones in the field, such as the formulation of diagnostic and staging criteria for AD, emphasizing the integration of biomarkers.Moreover, the involvement of diverse constituencies in ADNI, spanning academic institutions, for-profit entities, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies, represents a unique model for collaborative research, differing from traditional approaches.This is illustrated through the Private Partner Scientific Board (PPSB), which has enabled ADNI to accelerate biomarker validation and improve the speed and success rate of AD clinical trials and is described in greater detail below.Today, the Alzheimer's Association leads the convening of ADNI-PPSB, which serves as a pre-competitive space in which researchers share scientific progress and findings.In this commentary, we aim to highlight the longstanding strategic partnership of the Alzheimer's Association with ADNI as well as with the National Institute on Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to chronicle the start of an ever-evolving strategic interaction among these collaborators as the background for their mutual interest in promoting research in early AD and related dementias detection.</p>

and the subsequent formation of the NIA-AA collaboration to publish the 2011 recommendations for the diagnosis and staging of AD as a continuum, integrating biomarkers alongside clinical symptoms.[11][12][13][14]With partnership and input among an international group of researchers, including ADNI leadership, the Alzheimer's Association convened the Worldwide ADNI (WW-ADNI) in 2006 to serve as a central hub uniting ADNI initiatives around the world.Its main objective is to facilitate the exchange of data and information among ADNI researchers, aiming to standardize protocols and results.This standardization ensures that individuals undergoing biomarker testing in different regions receive consistent results when assessed using ADNI protocols.WW-ADNI also focuses on harmonizing data management practices and promoting open access to globally comparable data. 9,15Over the years, the WW-ADNI network has engaged various teams and initiatives, including North American ADNI (NA-ADNI); European ADNI (E-ADNI); Australian Imaging, Biomarker &amp; Lifestyle (AIBL); Japan ADNI (J-ADNI), Korea ADNI; Argentina ADNI; China ADNI; and India ADNI.Several WW-ADNI-affiliated studies launched initiatives that collectively have made significant contributions to AD research and interventional trial design by studying biomarker profiles and risk factors across various cognitive stages.Importantly, they have enhanced collaborative efforts by sharing data.The Alzheimer's Association has played an important role in shaping ADNI through its strategic collaborations with NIA/NIH since its very beginning.From the early establishment of the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute to the formation of the NWG, and through its ongoing support of specific projects through ADNI as well as via the PPSB and WW-ADNI, the Association's involvement in ADNI's mission has been multi-faceted and included activities such as financial support, advocacy, scientific collaboration, research prioritization, and community engagement.Moreover, WW-ADNI facilitated data sharing and harmonization across a global network of researchers by creating a platform for academic, government, and industry scientists to collaborate across geographical regions.While ADNI has achieved remarkable progress, challenges remain, particularly regarding diversity, and generalizability in research participation.ADNI continues to evolve and address these limitations, with ADNI-4 aiming toward greater inclusivity and equitable representation of research participants.Central to this effort is the formation of ADNI's Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion workgroup, which is dedicated to addressing the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion by recruiting a more diverse and representative group of participants in ADNI-4.</p>
