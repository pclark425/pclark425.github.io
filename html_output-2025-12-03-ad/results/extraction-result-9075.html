                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> <a href="https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0009013v1.pdf" target="_blank">The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity</a></p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> It is shown how, within the framework of general relativity and without the introduction of wormholes, it is possible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to travel with an arbitrarily large speed. By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it, motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible. The resulting distortion is reminiscent of the ``warp drive'' of science fiction. However, just as it happens with wormholes, exotic matter will be needed in order to generate a distortion of spacetime like the one discussed here.</p>

It i s then easy to see that for the spaceshi p' s trajectory we w i l lhave:d = dt :(13)T hi s i m pl i es not onl y that the spaceshi p m oves on a ti m el i ke curve, but al so that i ts properti m e i sequalto coordi nate ti m e. Si nce coordi nate ti m e i sal so equalto the proper ti m e ofdi stantobserversi n the atregi on,we concl ude thatthe spaceshi p su ersno ti m e di l ati on as i t m oves. It i s al so strai ghtforward to prove that the spaceshi p m oves on a geodesi c. T hi s m eans that even though the coordi nate accel erati on can be an arbi trary functi on ofti m e,the proper accel erati on al ong the spaceshi p' s path w i l lal ways be zero.

To see how one can use thi s m etri c to m ake a round tri p to a di stant star i n an arbi trary sm al l ti m e, l et us consi der the fol l ow i ng si tuati on: T wo stars A and B are separated by a di stance D i n atspaceti m e.

T he m etri c I have just descri bed has one i m portant draw back,however: i t vi ol ates al l three energy condi ti ons (weak, dom i nant and strong [ 3] ).

he factthatthi s expressi on i severyw here negati ve i m pl i es thatthe weak and dom i nant energy condi ti ons are vi ol ated. In a si m i l ar way one can show that the strong energy condi ti on i s al so vi ol ated. W e see then that, just as i t happens w i th worm hol es, one needs exoti c m atter to travelfaster than the speed ofl i ght. H owever,even i fone bel i eves that exoti c m atter i s forbi dden cl assi cal l y,i t i s wel lknow n that quantum el d theory perm i ts the exi stence of regi ons w i th negati ve energy densi ti es i n som e speci alci rcum stances (as,for exam pl e,i n the C asi m i r e ect [ 4] ).

A s a nal com m ent, I w i l l just m enti on the fact that even though the spaceti m e descri bed by the m etri c (8) i s gl obal l y hyperbol i c,and hence contai ns no cl osed causal curves,i t i s probabl y not very di cul t to construct a spaceti m e that does contai n such curves usi ng a si m i l ar i dea to the one presented here.
