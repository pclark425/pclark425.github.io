                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Logical reasoning of text requires identifying critical logical structures in the text and performing inference over them. Existing methods for logical reasoning mainly focus on contextual semantics of text while struggling to explicitly model the logical inference process. In this paper, we not only put forward a logic-driven context extension framework but also propose a logic-driven data augmentation algorithm. The former follows a three-step reasoning paradigm, and each step is respectively to extract logical expressions as elementary reasoning units, symbolically infer the implicit expressions following equivalence laws and extend the context to validate the options. The latter augments literally similar but logically different instances and incorporates contrastive learning to better capture logical information, especially logical negative and conditional relationships. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, ReClor and LogiQA. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, and even surpasses human performance on the ReClor dataset.</p>

<p>Logic-Driven Context Extension and Data Augmentation for Logical Reasoning of Text</p>
<p>Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2022
May 22-27, 2022
Logical reasoning of text requires identifying critical logical structures in the text and performing inference over them. Existing methods for logical reasoning mainly focus on contextual semantics of text while struggling to explicitly model the logical inference process. In this paper, we not only put forward a logic-driven context extension framework but also propose a logic-driven data augmentation algorithm. The former follows a three-step reasoning paradigm, and each step is respectively to extract logical expressions as elementary reasoning units, symbolically infer the implicit expressions following equivalence laws and extend the context to validate the options. The latter augments literally similar but logically different instances and incorporates contrastive learning to better capture logical information, especially logical negative and conditional relationships. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, ReClor and LogiQA. The results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, and even surpasses human performance on the ReClor dataset. 1</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in logical reasoning of text, which learns to understand a given text in logical level and perform logical inference to deduce implications from asserted ones (McCarthy, 1989;Nilsson, 1991). As a significant component of human reading comprehension, it is essential in many application scenarios, such as negotiation and debate. And several datasets have been proposed as benchmarks for this task (Williams et al., 2017;Habernal et al., 2017;Yu et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2020).</p>

<p>If you have no keyboarding skills at all, you will not be able to use a computer. And if you are not able to use a computer, you will not be able to write your essays using a word processing program. Question： If above statements are true, which one of the following must be true? Options： A. If you are not able to write your essays using a word processing program, you have no keyboarding skills. B. If you are able to write your essays using a word processing program, you have at least some keyboarding skills. C.

The underlined phrases represent logical symbols. The colored rectangles are corresponding logical expressions of each option.</p>
<p>tion, a question and four options as the input, and aims to identify the option that logically follows the context. The main challenge to solve such a problem is to uncover the logical propositional structure among the text and perform logical inference over them, which are beyond the capability of contextual pre-trained models Yang et al., 2019;Lan et al., 2020) without such logical annotations. They usually treat logical reasoning as a traditional reading comprehension task and match the given context with candidate answers, without modeling the discrete logical inference process explicitly (Yu et al., 2020). Recently, Huang et al. (2021) utilizes discourse information to unwrap the logical structure and propose a discourse-aware graph network to learn discourse-based contextual embeddings for logical reasoning. However, it is still entangled in enhancing contextual representation while ignoring explicit logical inference.</p>
<p>In responding to these issues, we propose a threestep paradigm for logical reasoning based on symbolic logic information. Firstly, we identify the elementary components for reasoning from the context as the logical expressions, like (¬α → ¬β), to uncover the logical relationships between logical symbols. Then we perform logical inference following equivalence laws to extend the implicit ones from these identified logical expressions. Thirdly, candidate options can be validated by comparing themselves with all obtained logical expressions.</p>
<p>We propose a logic-driven context extension framework to integrate these three reasoning steps, namely logic identification to parse the context into logical expressions, logic extension to infer implicit logical expressions and logic verbalization for answer prediction. To combine the interpretability of symbolic inference with anti-noise of continuous representation, we follow a neuralsymbolic paradigm (Besold et al., 2017;Garcez et al., 2019) which conducts logic identification and extension in a symbolic manner and utilizes the pre-trained model as the backbone of logic verbalization. In practice, we verbalize implicit logical expressions into natural language and feed them as an extended context into a pre-trained model to match the answer. Moreover, to encourage the pretrained model to better capture logical information, we further propose a logic-driven data augmentation algorithm. Specifically, it constructs challenging instances with literally similar but logically different contexts by modifying logical expressions. Contrastive learning  is used for encouraging our model to distinguish different contexts to better capture negative and conditional relationships in logical expressions.</p>
<p>The experiments are conducted on two challenging logical reasoning datasets, ReClor (Yu et al., 2020) and LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020). Results show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets, and even surpasses human performance on ReClor. Further results also show the effectiveness of both logic-driven context extension framework and data augmentation algorithm, and demonstrate the generalizability of our system.</p>
<p>Task and Background</p>
<p>Task Definition</p>
<p>We study the problem of logical reasoning of text on a multiple-choice question answering task. The task is described as following: given a context c, a question q, and four associated options {o 1 , o 2 , o 3 , o 4 }, we aim to select the most appropriate option as the answer o a .</p>
<p>Base Model</p>
<p>In this paper, we follow the leading methods on the leaderboards to take pre-trained models as our base model, e.g., RoBERTa . It concatenates the context, the question and each option as an input and encodes the sequence for calculating its score. Given four options, four concatenated sequences are constructed to calculate four scores, and the one with the highest score is chosen as the answer. Specifically, the concatenated sequence is formulated as
[CLS] c [SEP ] q || o [SEP ]
, where c is the context and q || o is the concatenation of the question and each option. The representations of special token [CLS] in four sequences are fed into a linear layer with a softmax function to get the probability distribution of options as P ({o 1 , o 2 , o 3 , o 4 }|c, q). The cross entropy loss is calculated as Eq. 1, where o a is the correct option.
L A = − log P (o a |c, q)(1)
Although promising results have been reported (Yu et al., 2020), pre-trained models for logical reasoning directly encode the triplet of context, question and options, which mainly leverage contextual semantics but struggle to model the symbolic inference process explicitly. Thus we propose a framework on top of a pre-trained model to extract logical expressions in the text and symbolically perform logical inference to predict the answer.</p>
<p>Logic-Driven Context Extension</p>
<p>In this section, we present a logic-driven context extension framework for logical reasoning of text, which is illustrated in Figure 2. The framework is divided into three steps as follows. It first identifies the logical symbols and expressions explicitly mentioned in the context and options ( § 3.1). Then it performs interpretable logical inference over them to extend the logical expressions implicit in the context ( § 3.2). Finally, it verbalizes the extended logical expressions related to each option as an</p>

<p>Logic Identification</p>
<p>In order to perform logical reasoning, we first need to identify the elementary reasoning components as logical expressions to uncover the logical relationships between logical symbols. We identify the existing logical expressions for each sentence in the context and each option. To show the format of the logical expression, we introduce some notations:</p>
<p>(1) {α, β, γ, ...}: the logical symbols, which are the basic constituents in the context to constitute the logical expressions, such as the "have keyboarding skills" in Figure 2.</p>
<p>(2) {¬, →}: the logical connective set. ¬ means the negation operation upon a specific logical symbol and → acts as a conditional relationship between two logical symbols. To ensure the generalizability of our framework without annotated logic forms, we design a fairly simple logical identification approach using an offthe-shelf constituency parser (Joshi et al., 2018) and several common keywords of logical semantics. We first employ the constituency parser to extract constituents including noun phrases and gerundial phrases as basic symbols. The logical symbols in each sentence are combined by logical connectives to constitute logical expressions as follow-up. If any negative word (e.g., "not", "unable") is in or immediately before a logical symbol α, we add the negation connective ¬ before α as a new symbol ¬ α. Then if there is a conditional relationship between two symbols α and β in a sentence, we construct the corresponding logical expression as (α → β). We simply recognize the conditional relationship between α and β as (α → β) according to conditional indicators (e.g., "if α, then β", "β since α") and whether an active voice occurs between α and β. The detailed negative and conditional keywords are listed in Appendix A with the whole identification procedure summarized as an algorithm. As shown in Figure 2, given the context with two sentences, we can extract three logical symbols {α, β, γ} and identify two existing logical expressions as (¬α → ¬β) and (¬β → ¬γ).</p>
<p>Logic Extension</p>
<p>In addition to the logical expressions explicitly mentioned in the context, there are still some other implicit ones that we need to logically infer and extend. We combine the identified logical expressions existing in all sentences of the context as a logical expression set S, and perform logical inference over them to further extend the implicit expressions according to logical equivalence laws. Here we follow two most applicable logical equivalence laws involving implication and negation in propositional logic, including contraposition (Russel et al., 2013) and transitive law (Zhao et al., 1997):
Contraposition : (α → β) =⇒ (¬β → ¬α)(2)
Transitive Law :
(α → β) ∧ (β → γ) =⇒ (α → γ) (3)
Then the extended implicit logical expressions form an extension set of the current logical expression set S as S E . As in Figure 2, the set of existing logical expressions is S = {(¬α → ¬β), (¬β → ¬γ)} and the logic extension set is
S E = {(β → α), (γ → β), (¬α → ¬γ), (γ → α)}.</p>
<p>Logic Verbalization</p>
<p>After inferring the extended logical expression set S E , we verbalize them into natural language for better utilization of the pre-trained model considering that symbolic logic is more difficult to be encoded. We first select the related expressions from S E for each option. A logical expression is regarded as related to an option if it has the same logical symbols with the option judged by the text overlapping and whether a negation connective exists. For example, (¬α → ¬γ) in Figure 2 is related to option C because they both contain ¬γ. Then we transform all logical expressions related to the option at symbolic space into natural language by filling them into a template and concatenate them into a sentence. We take such a sentence as an extended context for this option. For simplicity, we only adopt the If-Then statements as the verbalization template, which is one of the most common patterns of logical reasoning, but we make some adjustments according to the tense and singular/plural. Specifically, the template is designed as shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>Logic (¬α → ¬γ) Template If do not α, then will not γ.</p>
<p>Extended context</p>
<p>If you do not have keyboarding skills, then you will not be able to write your essays using a word processing program. We feed extended contexts into the pre-trained model to match the options and predict the answer. We take an extended context as the sentence e, and introduce a special token [EXT ] to represent context extension. Then we reformulate the input sequence as
[CLS] c [SEP ] q || o [EXT ] e [SEP ]
for encoding and feed the [CLS] representation into a classification layer to get each option's score and find the most appropriate answer.</p>
<p>Logic-Driven Data Augmentation</p>
<p>In order to make the pre-trained model put more focus on logical information in the context, especially logical negative and conditional relationships, we further introduce a logic-driven data augmentation algorithm. Inspired by SimCLR , we augment challenging instances with literally similar but logically different contexts built by modifying logical expressions. It then adopts contrastive learning and encourages our model to distinguish logically correct context supporting the answer. We first introduce the background of Sim-CLR and then describe our logic-driven contrastive learning.</p>
<p>SimCLR As a paradigm of self-supervised representation learning by comparing different samples, contrastive learning (Wu et al., 2018;He et al., 2020a) aims to make the representations of similar samples be mapped close together, while that of dissimilar samples be further away in the encoding space. The goal can be described as following.
s(f (x), f (x + )) ≫ s(f (x), f (x − ))(4)
x + is a positive sample similar to the data point x while x − is a negative sample dissimilar to x. f (·) is an encoder to learn a representation and the s(·) is a similarity function of two representations. Over this, SimCLR  builds a classifier to distinguish positive from negative samples and learns to capture what makes two samples different.</p>
<p>Logic-Driven Contrastive Learning</p>
<p>In our question answering setting, we alter the score function from measuring the similarity between two representations towards calculating the score that the question can be solved by the correct answer under a given context:
s ′ (c + , q, o a ) ≫ s ′ (c − , q, o a )(5)
where (c + , q, o a ) and (c − , q, o a ) are the positive and negative sample, c + and c − are the positive and negative context, respectively, and s ′ is the score function. The contrastive loss can be formulated as a classification loss for predicting the most plausible context that supports the answer:
L C = − log exp(s ′ (+)) exp(s ′ (+)) + exp(s ′ (−))(6)
where s ′ (+) and s ′ (−) are short for s ′ (c + , q, o a ) and s ′ (c − , q, o a ) respectively.</p>
<p>Aware of symbolic logical expressions, we can construct logical negative samples including negative contexts that are literally similar but logical dissimilar to the positive one. We take the original context to construct the positive sample. Then we generate a negative sample by modifying the existing logical expressions in the context and verbalizing the modified logical expressions into a negative context as § 3.3. During the modification operations, we randomly choose a logical expression and randomly delete, reverse or negate such an expression. The delete, reverse or negate operations are respectively to delete a logical expression in the context, reverse the conditional order of a logical expression and negate a logical symbol in a logical expression. The constructing procedure of a logical negative sample is illustrated in Figure 3. Then the model can be trained to better capture logical information, especially negative and conditional relationships in logical expressions. Figure 3: Procedure to construct a logical negative sample.

<p>Logic Verbalization</p>
<p>In the logic-driven data augmentation algorithm, our framework is trained with a combined loss as L = L A + L C . And the classification of positive and negative context for the correct answer is also implemented in the logic-driven context extension framework.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Experimental Dataset</p>
<p>Our experiments are conducted on two challenging datasets ReClor (Yu et al., 2020) and LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020) that cover diverse and complicated logical reasoning skills, to investigate the general effectiveness of our system. ReClor is built upon standardized exams including GMAT and LSAT. As there are some biased instances that can be solved without knowing contexts and questions, ReClor splits the unbiased instances from the test data as the HARD set to fully assess the logical reasoning ability. The other biased ones are taken as the EASY set. LogiQA comes from the National Civil Servants Examination of China and is professionally translated into an English version.</p>
<p>ReClor consists of 6, 138 questions and is divided into training, validation and test sets with 4, 638, 500 and 1, 000 data points. The test set is further split into EASY set and HARD set with 440 and 560 data points. LogiQA contains 8, 678 questions and is split into 7, 376/651/651 samples for training, validation and testing. Each question is collected with a context and four answer options, in which only one is correct. The implementation details of experiments are given in Appendix B.</p>
<p>Overall Performance</p>
<p>We compare our systems with several baseline models and human performance. Baseline Models The compared baseline pretrained models include BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), RoBERTa , ALBERT (Lan et al., 2020) and DeBERTa (He et al., 2020b). We also compare our model with DAGN (Huang et al., 2021), an available state-of-the-art method on the leaderboard which proposes a discourseaware graph network for logical reasoning taking RoBERTa-large as the backbone. Our Systems LReasoner RoBERTa is our proposed logic-driven reasoner taking RoBERTa as the backbone model, which utilizes both logic-driven context extension framework and data augmentation algorithm. We also build our LReasoner on top of two more powerful pre-trained models ALBERT and DeBERTa as LReasoner ALBERT and LReasoner DeBERTa , respectively. Besides, LReasoner Ensemble is an ensemble of DeBERTa, LReasoner ALBERT and LReasoner DeBERTa . Human Performance Yu et al. (2020) and Liu et al. (2020) report human performance as the average scores of graduate or post-graduate students over randomly chosen test samples.</p>
<p>The evaluation results are shown in   (Yu et al., 2020) and (Liu et al., 2020).</p>
<p>LReasoner DeBERTa consistently perform better. It demonstrates that our method is robust to be effective for logical reasoning based on different pre-trained models, even the most recent state-ofthe-art ones. -Our models generate large improvement on both HARD and EASY sets of ReClor compared with baseline models. This observation verifies that our model is capable of improving logical reasoning ability on both biased and unbiased data.</p>
<p>Further Analysis</p>
<p>Ablation Study To dive into the effectiveness of different components in our logic-driven reasoner, we conduct an ablation study which takes RoBERTa as our backbone model on ReClor validation and test sets. As shown in Table 3, RoBERTa+CE and RoBERTa+DA both outperform the baseline model RoBERTa and perform worse than our final system RoBERTa+CE+DA. It indicates that both logicdriven context extension framework and data augmentation algorithm can boost the performance of question answering involving logical reasoning.  Table 3: Ablation study of our system. CE and DA are respectively our logic-driven context extension framework and data augmentation algorithm. RoBERTa+CE+DA is our proposed LReasoner RoBERTa .</p>
<p>Comparison of Negative Sample Construction</p>
<p>Strategies To further analyze the effectiveness of our logical negative samples in logic-driven contrastive learning, we compare several different negative sample construction strategies in contrastive learning on top of RoBERTa for ReClor.</p>
<p>Model</p>
<p>Test EASY HARD  Table 4: Comparison of different negative sample construction approaches. CLR represents contrastive learning. RS means randomly selecting a context from inbatch data while RD means randomly deleting a sentence from the original context. L denotes our logical negative sample construction method in logic-driven contrastive learning.</p>
<p>From Table 4, we can find that all models with contrastive learning outperform the model without it, which demonstrates that contrastive learning can help to better predict the answer. Our logic-driven contrastive learning RoBERTa(w/ CLR-L) performs best. It reveals that logical negative samples are more effective than negative samples constructed by other methods which make the model better capture the logical negative and conditional relationships in the context for logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Logic Identification</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of our symbolic logic identification method, we randomly sample 50 instances from the validation set and manually annotate the logical symbols and expressions as labels. We re-Context : Everyone sitting in the clubhouse of the golf course today at ten o' clock had just registered for a beginner' s golf lesson. Gerald, Robert, and Shirley were sitting in the clubhouse this morning at ten o' clock. No accomplished golfer would register for a beginner' s golf lesson.

Gerald, Robert, and Shirley were the only people who registered for a beginner's golf lesson this morning. ( ® Others ) B. None of the people sitting in the clubhouse this morning at ten o' clock had ever played golf. ( α ® ¬ Others ) C. Neither Gerald nor Shirley is an accomplished golfer. ( ® ¬ ) D. Everyone sitting in the clubhouse this morning at ten o' clock registered only for a beginner's golf lesson. ( α ® Others )</p>

Extending the Implicit Logical Expressions port the recall of logical symbol and logical expression identification as 65.9% and 48.9%, respectively. We can see that our generic logic parsing method which operates in an unsupervised manner achieves relatively reliable performance. Unsupervised and generic logic parsing is an essential future direction that is expected to be further studied to enhance the performance of the overall system. Figure 4 to show the reasoning process of our system. At first, the logical symbols are correctly extracted from the context and the logical expressions are identified based on them considering logical negative and conditional relationships. Then we extend the logical expressions by inferring implicit ones in the context. For each option, we recognize its logical expression and find the related extended expressions. We verbalize them into the text to feed into the pre-trained model as an extended context to compute a matching score. Finally, we take option C which exactly matches an extended implicit logical expression as the most plausible answer.

<p>Case Study A ReClor case is presented in</p>
<p>Detailed Analysis of Different Reasoning Types</p>
<p>As ReClor integrates various types of logical reasoning skills, we can detailedly investigate the performance of our system LReasoner ALBERT on different logical reasoning types compared to the baseline model ALBERT. We analyze the improvements brought by our system, and point out challenges to shed a light on future directions. As shown in  Strongly Supported. These questions emphasize the ability of inference over logical units. Specifically, Implication needs to infer the conclusion that logically follows a set of premises while Most Strongly Supported aims to find the statement that is most strongly supported by a stimulus. This observation verifies the effectiveness of our system to model logical deduction. Besides, Implication is precisely the reasoning ability investigated by NLI tasks, which reveals that our model would also be effective in NLI. However, there still exists some reasoning types that are challenging for our system, such as Match flaws and Weaken. Weaken aims to find the opposite statement that weakens the argument.</p>
<p>Match flaws is even more challenging as it requires analyzing the flaw that conflicts with the complete logical chain in the context, and finding an option exhibiting the same flaw. Therefore, how to model the different degrees of a logical statement, and abstract the complete logical chain for flaw identification, are interesting future directions.</p>
<p>Generalizability Discussion</p>
<p>Our logic-driven reasoner not only embodies its superiority in ReClor and LogiQA, but also can be generalized to other datasets and task formats. To demonstrate this, we evaluate our framework on a widely studied extractive QA task SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), which covers diverse skills instead of just explicit logical reasoning, such as reasoning of lexical variation, commonsense and causal relations (Sugawara and Aizawa, 2016). As shown in Table 6, our framework is effective on SQuAD compared to both RoBERTa-base and RoBERTa-large, which manifests the generalizability of our logic-driven reasoner.</p>

<p>Related Work</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a surge in NLP research towards complex reasoning, such as reasoning for commonsense knowledge (Huang et al., 2019), numerical calculation (Dua et al., 2019) or multi-hop aggregation (Yang et al., 2018). Compare to these widely studied reasoning tasks, logical reasoning is also an essential and challenging capability but is relatively unexplored. Natural Language Inference (NLI) (Dagan et al., 2005;Bowman et al., 2015;Williams et al., 2018;Khot et al., 2018) is a typical task requiring logical reasoning, which aims to determine whether a hypothesis can be reasonably entailed from a premise. However, these NLI datasets mainly handle the task at sentence-level and are limited to only a few logical reasoning types, such as entailment, contradiction, and neutral. To promote a deeper passage-level logical reasoning ability, several QA datasets have been proposed. LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020) is collected from the National Civil Servants Examination of China covering 5 logical reasoning types. Yu et al. (2020) propose ReClor dataset from the GMAT and LSAT tests which examines 17 types of logical reasoning. In this paper, we take both ReClor and LogiQA as the testbed to investigate diverse and complicated logical reasoning skills.</p>
<p>Pre-trained language models (Devlin et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2019;Lan et al., 2020) have been widely adopted for various reasoning tasks and achieve promising performance. However, they directly encode the given texts to predict the output while failing to identify the symbolic logical structure and perform explicit logical inference for logical reasoning of text. Semantic parsers (Reddy et al., 2016;Singh et al., 2020) are usually employed for converting texts to logical forms, and graph neural networks (Fang et al., 2019;Huang et al., 2021) and neural module networks (Gupta et al., 2019) also have been attempted to partly imitate the human reasoning process. But these neural methods may not be easily generalized to our desired propositional logical schema without annotations and still perform an implicit inference. To circumvent these limitations and utilize the superior performance of neural models, we take inspiration from neuro-symbolic reasoning (Wang et al., 2018;Arabshahi et al., 2020) to integrate symbolic inference and neural representation. We design an explicit three-step logical reasoning paradigm and propose a logic-driven reasoning system to generically identify the logical structure and perform interpretable logical inference in a symbolic module while taking a pre-trained model as the backbone.</p>
<p>Conclusion and Future Work</p>
<p>In this paper, we focus on the task of logical reasoning of text. Following a three-step logical reasoning paradigm, we first propose a neuro-symbolic logicdriven context extension framework. It identifies logical expressions as elementary units of logical inference and symbolically deduces the implicitly mentioned expressions, and verbalizes them as an extended context into a pre-trained model to match the answer. We also introduce a logic-driven data augmentation algorithm, which augments literally similar but logically different instances and employs contrastive learning to help our model better capture logical information. Experimental results confirm the general effectiveness of our LReasoner, and it even surpasses human performance on the ReClor dataset. In the future, we will explore to model different logical reasoning types and directly incorporate symbolic logic into the model structure.</p>

<p>B Implementation Details</p>
<p>We take RoBERTa-large , ALBERT-xxlarge-v2 (Lan et al., 2020) and DeBERTa-xlarge (He et al., 2020b) as our backbones and implement them using Huggingface (Wolf et al., 2019). We use a batch size of 8 and fine-tune for 10 epochs. The AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) with β1 = 0.9 and β2 = 0.98 is taken as the optimizer and the learning rate is 1e-5. We use a linear learning rate scheduler with 10% warmup proportion. We automatically evaluate our model on validation set to choose parameters that achieve the highest accuracy. We select at most two extended logical expressions related to each option to construct the extended context for ReClor and select at most three for LogiQA. We train our proposed systems and other comparison models on two NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs.</p>

We employ the constituency parser to extract constituents as basic symbols. We regard literally similar constituents with an overlap rate over 60% as the same symbol if they also have consistent degree modifiers, such as "only", "most", "least", etc.We define a set of negative words for identifying logical negation, including {"not", "n't", "unable", "no", "few", "little", "neither", "none of "}. And the full set of conditional indicators for recognizing the logical conditional relationship between α and β as (α → β) is {"if α, then β", "α in order for β", "α thus β", "β due to α", "β owing to α", "β since α", "¬β unless α"}. The detailed parsing procedure is illustrated in Algorithm 1.
