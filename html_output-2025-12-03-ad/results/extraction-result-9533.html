                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The exponential growth of scientific articles has presented challenges in information organization and extraction. Automation is urgently needed to streamline literature reviews and enhance insight extraction. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in key-insights extraction from scientific articles, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.0, MistralAI’s Mixtral 8 × 7B, 01AI’s Yi, and InternLM’s InternLM2. We have developed an article-level key-insight extraction system based on LLMs, calling it ArticleLLM. After evaluating the LLMs against manual benchmarks, we have enhanced their performance through fine-tuning. We propose a multi-actor LLM approach, merging the strengths of multiple fine-tuned LLMs to improve overall key-insight extraction performance. This work demonstrates not only the feasibility of LLMs in key-insight extraction, but also the effectiveness of cooperation of multiple fine-tuned LLMs, leading to efficient academic literature survey and knowledge discovery.</p>

Automation is urgently needed to streamline literature reviews and enhance insight extraction. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in key-insights extraction from scientific articles, including OpenAI’s GPT-4.0, MistralAI’s Mixtral 8 × 7B, 01AI’s Yi, and InternLM’s InternLM2. We have developed an article-level key-insight extraction system based on LLMs, calling it ArticleLLM. After evaluating the LLMs against manual benchmarks, we have enhanced their performance through fine-tuning. We propose a multi-actor LLM approach, merging the strengths of multiple fine-tuned LLMs to improve overall key-insight extraction performance. This work demonstrates not only the feasibility of LLMs in key-insight extraction, but also the effectiveness of cooperation of multiple fine-tuned LLMs, leading to efficient academic literature survey and knowledge discovery.</p></div></div></section>

According to the investigation by Bornmann et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Bornmann, L., Haunschild, R. &amp; Mutz, R.

The immediate increase of scientific articles has accelerated information overload, hindered the discovery of new insights, and contributed to the potential spread of false information. Although most scientific articles are published in a structured text format to speed up understanding of knowledge, the basic content of these articles remains unstructured text. This means that the literature review is still a time-consuming task that requires manual involvement<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Borah, R., Brown, A.

Therefore, it is necessary to assist the literature review process by automatically extracting key information from scientific articles.</p><p>The automation of key information extraction can be categorized into two classes: metadata extraction and key-insights extraction<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 3" title="Nasar, Z., Jaffry, S.

Metadata extraction encompasses retrieving fundamental attributes from scientific articles, including title, author names, publication year, publishing entity, abstract, and other pertinent foundational details. Researchers and digital repositories use metadata to determine the relevance of specific articles to their fields of interest or to facilitate search and filtering tasks. The key-insight extraction is a summary of the content of the article, such as the problem to solve, the methodology used, evaluation methods, results, limitations, and the future work. Automatic retrieval of those insights will provide researchers with clear and concise concepts of research articles and increase the efficiency of literature reviews.</p><p>Compared with metadata extraction, key-insight extraction is more challenging. The scholarly domain has reported a high degree of accuracy in metadata extraction<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Boukhers, Z. &amp; Bouabdallah, A.

Those approaches have limitations as is that the model struggles to capture complex contexts and semantics at the phrase or sentence level, leading to poor performance in capturing insight. Therefore, another key-insight extraction system is needed to extract key-insights at the section or article level than at the phrase or sentence level. Moreover, the scarcity of annotated training data, the variations among different domains, and the ongoing evolution of research paradigms impede the effectiveness of those models. To our knowledge, there is no effective solution for automatic extraction of key-insights from scientific articles.</p><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4.0 provide possibilities to solve this challenge. LLMs represent a pioneering advancement in the field of natural language processing, characterized by their colossal neural network architectures, comprising billions to trillions of parameters. These LLMs have emerged as a forefront technology in contemporary artificial intelligence research and application, bearing transformative capabilities in text generation, comprehension, and processing.

This opens new opportunities to deeply understand article contents and extract key-insights from them. With their powerful contextual understanding and generation capabilities, LLMs may be able to better capture the details of article contents, enabling more accurate extraction of key-insights. However, there are no studies evaluating the ability of LLMs in key-insights extraction.</p><p>This study aims to develop and evaluate an LLM-based system for extracting key insights from scientific articles. We explore the effectiveness of various state-of-the-art LLMs and enhance their performance through fine-tuning with high-quality datasets. Additionally, we advance their capabilities by constructing a multi-actor system to further improve performance. Specifically, we first employ OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4.0, MistralAI’s Mixtral 8 × 7B, 01AI’s Yi, and InternLM’s InternLM2 respectively as a candidate LLM for extracting key-insights from scientific articles. As the next step, we evaluate the performance of each LLM on key-insight extraction tasks through the manual evaluation. We find that the performance of GPT-4.0 is close to human level. However, it is too expensive to use GPT-4.0 for key-insights extraction on a large scale. Therefore, we use the output of GPT-4 as a label for fine-tuning other open-source LLMs so as to improve their performance. However, the performance of the fine-tuned LLMs still has not reached the peak. Therefore, instead of relying on a single LLM, we present a multi-actor method to merge all the key-insights extracted by multiple fine-tuned open-source LLMs, demonstrating an advancement in the quality of key-insights. As a result, it is shown that we can extract key-insights at article level only using the multiple fine-tuned open-source LLMs.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Related works"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec2-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec2">Related works</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec2-content"><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec3">Key-insight extraction</h3><p>Key-insight extraction refers to identifying valuable information for research contained in scientific articles.

By harnessing the power of Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA enables more nuanced and targeted adjustments to LLMs without the substantial increase in parameters typically associated with such refinements.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Multi-actor approaches in LLM</h3><p>The introduction of multi-actors in LLM systems for improving the performance of LLMs leverages the concept of ensemble learning by coordinating the efforts of multiple AI actors, each embodying an instance of LLM like GPT-4, to act in concert. Through such harmonious interaction, the actors combine their varied knowledge and contextual understanding, addressing intricate challenges with a level of efficiency and inventiveness that exceeds the scope of any single LLM. This transition from individual to collective AI endeavors symbolizes the notion that the aggregate output of an ensemble of actors far exceeds what they could achieve independently.</p><p>Extensive research has been conducted to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) for specialized tasks using multi-actor approaches, yet there is no consensus on the optimal way for these actors to collaborate.

We use manual evaluation to measure the performance of the LLM in a small article dataset. Because the key-insight extraction task involves explicit goals and objectives, we use a relevance score to assess how accurately the LLM extracts key-insights. The relevance score ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates ‘completely irrelevant’ and 1, ‘completely relevant’. Specifically, human researchers assess whether the key-insights extracted by the LLM comprehensively capture all critical information points identified in manually annotated references, evaluating the presence or absence of essential details or elements. To reduce the subjective errors caused by humans, two researchers independently assessed the results and re-evaluated the contradictory parts.</p>

With respect to the GPT-4 score after fine-tuning, both Yi FT and Mixtral FT exhibited slight improvements, with their average scores increasing from 68.5 to 71.4 and from 49.4 to 51.6, respectively. InternLM2 and its fine-tuned counterpart, InternLM2 FT, stood out for their exceptional performance, with InternLM2 FT achieving the highest average score of 77.8. Unlike GPT-4 scores, the vector similarity scores show less variation, suggesting this metric evaluates a different aspect. Specifically, after fine-tuning, Yi FT and Mixtral FT showed marginal improvements in their scores, shifting from 64.2 to 65.8 and from 63.5 to 63.9 respectively, showcasing slight but noticeable progress. InternLM2 and its fine-tuned version, InternLM2 FT, delivered the highest scores among the individual models at 68.8, indicating a stronger semantic alignment.</p><p>On the other hand, the underperformance of all open-source LLMs in extracting “Evaluation metrics” and “Limitations” can be principally attributed to two specific challenges. First, the task of extracting “Evaluation metrics” often involves identifying multiple distinct indicators such as accuracy, precision, and recall, which may be intricately described within the text. Open-source LLMs may struggle with this multifaceted extraction, leading to the omission of certain indicators that are critical for a comprehensive evaluation. Second, the extraction of “Limitations” presents its unique set of difficulties, as not all authors explicitly mention limitations within their articles. This situation forces open-source LLMs to attempt the synthesis of plausible yet not entirely accurate limitations, which can deviate significantly from the article’s intended messages. These challenges highlight the nuanced understanding and contextual interpretation required for accurately extracting such sophisticated elements from scientific texts, thereby suggesting the need for LLMs to be specifically fine-tuned or trained with a focus on recognizing and handling the diverse and complex nature of “Evaluation metrics” and “Limitations” in scientific literature.</p><p>The multi-actor approach consistently outperforms other models in both metrics, though the margin is narrower in vector similarity, suggesting its overall superior linguistic and cognitive capabilities. Specifically, the multi-actor approach effectively leverages the combined strengths of three fine-tuned LLMs (InternLM2 FT, Yi FT, and Mixtral FT). This collaborative strategy significantly enhances its ability to extract key-insights from scientific articles, as illustrated in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41598-025-85715-7#Fig1">1</a> which summarizes performance across nine essential categories. This underscores the synergistic effect of leveraging multiple fine-tuned LLMs, which collectively enhance the precision and breadth of extracted key-insights, surpassing the capabilities of individual LLMs. Moreover, the lower score of “Limitations” compared to other categories suggests that while multi-actor approach significantly improves performance, identifying areas requiring further refinement remains critical. Collectively, these results solidify the position of multi-actor LLMs as a powerful tool in comprehensively understanding and analyzing the complexities of scientific literature, outperforming singular fine-tuned LLMs in both depth and accuracy of extracted information.</p><div class="c-article-section__figure js-c-reading-companion-figures-item" data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1" data-title="Fig. 1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" class="c-article-section__figure-caption" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1</b></figcaption><div class="c-article-section__figure-content"><div class="c-article-section__figure-item"><a class="c-article-section__figure-link" data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="/articles/s41598-025-85715-7/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-85715-7/MediaObjects/41598_2025_85715_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig1" src="//media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-85715-7/MediaObjects/41598_2025_85715_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="figure 1" loading="lazy" width="685" height="345"></picture></a></div><div class="c-article-section__figure-description" data-test="bottom-caption" id="figure-1-desc"><p>(<b>a</b>) LLM performance evaluated by GPT-4.

Our null hypothesis states that there would be no significant difference in GPT-4 score or vector similarity, whereas the alternative hypothesis anticipates a noticeable difference. Supplementary Table 1 presents the results of the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test for all LLMs. Within the realm of GPT-4 scores, all fine-tuned models exhibit significant differences in certain key-insights (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). InternLM2 FT shows significance in aim, methods, question addressed, evaluation metrics, findings, limitations, and future work; Yi FT in aim, question addressed, and findings; Mixtral FT in aim, motivation, question addressed, and contribution. In particular, the multi-actor approach shows significance in all key-insights.</p><p>However, the results of vector similarity differ from those of GPT-4, with no significant statistical differences observed across all key-insights for Mixtral FT and InternLM2 FT. Yi FT shows significance only in aim, methods, and findings. This may be due to the fact that vector similarity is less sensitive to semantic variations.

Our approach addresses this by fine-tuning a specialized actor tasked with integrating and summarizing information from other actors. While this method may not achieve the execution efficiency of expert routing techniques, it significantly enhances the accuracy of key-insights extraction, ensuring maximal fidelity to the source article.</p><p>The results of this study also suggest an insight: the inherent abilities of the original LLMs are more important than the enhancements brought about by fine-tuning. Despite the tangible improvements observed by post-fine-tuning, the baseline performance of an LLM such as InternLM2 sets a precedential standard for excellence in the domain of key-insight extraction. This denotes that the foundational architecture and pre-training of these LLMs may be more pivotal in determining their effectiveness in complex academic tasks, overshadowing the incremental gains achieved through fine-tuning. Specifically, the fact that GPT-4 and InternLM2 demonstrated superior efficacy across various dimensions before fine-tuning, highlights the critical importance of the LLM’s original design and training corpus in grasping intricate academic content. Therefore, while fine-tuning serves as a valuable tool for LLM optimization, the selection of the base LLM is crucial for success in such specialized applications as key-insights extraction.</p><p>An advantage of ArticleLLM is its capability for local deployment, which facilitates the construction of a private large-scale literature management system. This feature is particularly crucial for applications that emphasize data confidentiality and security. Another benefit of ArticleLLM is its cost-effectiveness. Extracting key-insights from an article of approximately 10,000 words using GPT-4 costs about $0.15. This expense can prove substantial for building an extensive private literature management system. In contrast, a locally deployed ArticleLLM eliminates those concerns. By the way, the approach of multi-actor of LLMs proposed in this study requires about 10 min to extract key-insights from an article under our hardware setup. However, the server used in this research does not employ NVLink technology but rather relies on PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) for data transmission, indicating significant room for improvement in system performance efficiency<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 53" title="Li, A. et al.

ArticleLLM could revolutionize the way academic databases curate and present information, allowing for a more nuanced and efficient retrieval process. Researchers could benefit from contextually relevant summaries, thereby significantly enhancing their research productivity and knowledge discovery.</p><p>There are some limitations worth mentioning. Although the multi-actor system based on multiple fine-tuned LLMs has achieved excellent performance, the restriction to articles under 7,000 words due to GPU memory limits and the focus on healthcare-related articles from arXiv may affect the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, the execution efficiency of the system is still a concern due to the collaboration of multiple LLMs involved. The extraction of key-insights such as “limitations” that may not exist in the article or appear in an ambiguous form requires further research. Compared to the arXiv papers used in this study, more rigorous peer-reviewed papers may avoid this problem. On the other hand, due to the hardware limitations, this study employed 4-bit quantization to fine-tune the LLMs, inevitably leading to a performance loss.</p></div></div></section><section data-title="Conclusion"><div class="c-article-section" id="Sec19-section"><h2 class="c-article-section__title js-section-title js-c-reading-companion-sections-item" id="Sec19">Conclusion</h2><div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec19-content"><p>In this paper, it is shown that we can extract key-insights from scientific articles only using open-source LLMs. Our findings affirm the critical role of fine-tuning in enhancing the proficiency of LLMs for extracting key-insights, with InternLM2 FT showcasing remarkable improvements after fine-tuning. In addition, the multi-actor of LLMs, incorporating diverse perspectives from individually fine-tuned LLMs, significantly broadens the scope and accuracy of resulting key-insights. However, the inherent architecture and pre-training of LLMs seem to be more influential than fine-tuning in determining their efficacy for extracting key-insights Looking forward, ArticleLLM can present a promising avenue for enhancing academic research productivity, though such challenges as execution efficiency of ensemble systems warrant further exploration to optimize the utilization of LLMs in scholarly applications.</p></div></div></section>
