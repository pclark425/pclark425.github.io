                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> The human connectome in Alzheimer disease — relationship to biomarkers and genetics</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) damages structural and functional brain networks, resulting in cognitive impairment. The results of recent connectomics studies have now linked changes in structural and functional network organization in AD to the patterns of amyloid-β and tau accumulation and spread, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of the disease. In addition, the detection of gene-related connectome changes might aid in the early diagnosis of AD and facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies that are effective at earlier stages of the disease spectrum. In this article, we review studies of the associations between connectome changes and amyloid-β and tau pathologies as well as molecular genetics in different subtypes and stages of AD. We also highlight the utility of connectome-derived computational models for replicating empirical findings and for tracking and predicting the progression of biomarker-indicated AD pathophysiology. In this Review, the authors discuss the alterations to structural and functional brain networks that occur in Alzheimer disease, with a particular focus on the influence of amyloid and tau pathology and genetic factors. Amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology is associated with decreased hub connectivity in the default-mode network (DMN) during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD) and the association extends to other brain networks as the disease progresses. Selective hub vulnerability might explain the preferential accumulation of Aβ in the medial hubs of the DMN, and of tau in medial temporal lobe hubs, in preclinical AD. Tau pathology spreads from the medial temporal lobe hubs — along structural connections — to other brain regions, supporting the pathogenic spread hypothesis. Aβ pathology has a common role in driving DMN hypo-connectivity in late-onset AD, autosomal-dominant AD and early-onset AD; however, the association between Aβ pathology and DMN hypoconnectivity is regulated by different genetic variants across AD subtypes. Spatial gene expression profiles might contribute to the relationships between the patterns of Aβ and tau accumulation and patterns of structural and functional connectome changes in AD. Computational modelling studies will be important for understanding the role of the connectome in relation to progression of Aβ, tau and other pathogenic features of AD.

<p>The human connectome in Alzheimer disease -relationship to biomarkers and genetics</p>
<p>0123456789();:Alzheimer disease (AD) is a prevalent and disabling neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive neuronal and synaptic loss and concomitant decline in neuronal connectivity. These pathological features damage structural and functional brain networks, leading to severe disturbances of cognition and behaviour. Clinically, early-stage AD is typically characterized by memory disturbances that result from neurodegeneration in the medial temporal lobe 1,2 . As the disease progresses, this neurodegeneration gradually spreads to the temporal and parietal cortices and, eventually, to most of the cortex. AD-associated disturbances are also observed in other cognitive domains, such as language, visuospatial ability, attention and executive functions. For example, patients might become less able to remember the names of people or objects, navigate while driving, or make financial or other important decisions. Biologically, AD is defined by two principal neuropathological hallmarks: the abnormal accumulation of extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ)-containing plaques and intracellular tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles. Converging evidence indicates that Aβ initially accumulates in the medial frontal cortex and medial parietal cortex 3,4 , which are both elements of the default-mode network (DMN) 5 . In contrast, tau is initially deposited in the medial temporal lobe memory system 6,7 , spreading from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex, and then to other brain regions.Aβ and tau can be examined in vivo in humans using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays or PET. In addition, promising blood-based assays for AD pathophysiology have now been developed; these assays are less invasive and less costly than the CSF and PET alternatives 8 . Biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury are detected with a range of techniques, including PET (glucose metabolism), MRI (structural, functional and diffusion), EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Of note, changes in AD biomarkers follow a series of stages 9,10 , with Aβ and tau starting to accumulate in individuals without cognitive impairment decades before AD symptom onset (preclinical AD). Prodromal AD is defined by the onset of initial mild cognitive symptoms that are typically accompanied by changes in biomarkers, including those indicating neurodegeneration. Last, AD dementia is defined by the presence of cognitive impairment coupled with a decline in the ability to perform instrumental activities of daily living. The A/T(N) framework is a practical research-analytic scheme based on specific biomarkers 11,12 (Box 1) that provides a well-defined biological basis for mechanistic brain-network studies in AD.AD can be categorized on the basis of genetic variants, age of onset and clinical phenotype into familial (or autosomal-dominant) AD and sporadic AD 13 . Among individuals with sporadic AD, late-onset AD (onset ≥65 years) is typical but a small percentage of individuals have early-onset AD (onset &lt;65 years). Autosomaldominant AD 14,15 is characterized by the presence of a monogenic mutation in one of three genes: APP, which encodes amyloid precursor protein, and PSEN1 and PSEN2, which encode presenilin 1 and 2, respectively 15 .Abstract | The pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) damages structural and functional brain networks, resulting in cognitive impairment.

<p>The human connectome in Alzheimer disease -relationship to biomarkers and genetics Meichen Yu 1,2,3 , Olaf Sporns 1,2,3,4 and Andrew J. Saykin 1,2,3 ✉ Abstract | The pathology of Alzheimer disease (AD) damages structural and functional brain networks, resulting in cognitive impairment. The results of recent connectomics studies have now linked changes in structural and functional network organization in AD to the patterns of amyloidβ and tau accumulation and spread, providing insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of the disease. In addition, the detection of gene-related connectome changes might aid in the early diagnosis of AD and facilitate the development of personalized therapeutic strategies that are effective at earlier stages of the disease spectrum. In this article, we review studies of the associations between connectome changes and amyloidβ and tau pathologies as well as molecular genetics in different subtypes and stages of AD. We also highlight the utility of connectome-derived computational models for replicating empirical findings and for tracking and predicting the progression of biomarker-indicated AD pathophysiology. 1 In contrast to autosomal-dominant AD, sporadic late-onset AD, the most common form of AD, is considered a polygenic disorder and is associated with variants in at least 50 genes [16][17][18] , among which the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the strongest risk factor 19,20 . Patients with late-onset AD typically present with onset of episodic memory impairment 21,22 . In contrast, patients with early-onset AD progress more rapidly and present with a higher Aβ and tau burden 23,24 , greater glucose hypometabolism 23 , and more diverse cognitive phenotypes 25,26 (for example, impairment of language, visuospatial ability, attention, executive functions and apraxia). The three different subtypes of AD share common attributes with regards to Aβ and tau pathologies 27 as well as neurodegeneration; however, the other underlying neurobiological mechanisms might differ.</p>
<p>Normal cognitive functioning requires the efficient transfer of information among distributed neuronal popu lations in functionally specialized brain areas 28,29 ; the disturbance of this information transfer leads to cognitive dysfunction in multiple neurological disorders [30][31][32] , including AD 33 . The neuropathology of Aβ plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles causes progressive neuronal loss and shrinkage together with synaptic impairment in specific cortical and subcortical brain regions, suggesting that AD can be described as a 'disconnection syndrome' 34,35 . Recent human connectome studies have provided a theoretical framework, novel quantitative analytic tools and computational network models directed towards a better understanding of the structure and function of brain networks 36,37 . Here, we survey empirical and modelling studies of the human connectome in AD and examine how such studies can further elucidate the relationship between the connectome and AD pathologies (Aβ and tau), subtypes (autosomal-dominant AD, late-onset AD and early-onset AD), and genetic variation (APOE ε4 and other genes) and might eventually lead to network-level diagnostic biomarkers.</p>
<p>Construction of the human connectome</p>
<p>Large-scale brain networks representing the human connectome can be constructed using several neuroimaging and neurophysiological techniques. This Review focuses on the functional connectome derived from functional MRI (fMRI), EEG, and MEG and the structural connectome extracted from structural and diffusion MRI. The networks within the connectome are composed of nodes (or edges) and links (or connections). EEG and MEG measure oscillatory neuronal activity and, with these techniques, a single source produces a signal at multiple recording sites (EEG electrodes or MEG sensors), an effect known as spatial leakage. This spatial leakage might lead to erroneous estimations of functional connectivity between brain regions. Therefore, EEG and MEG connectivity and network studies usually project the sensor-space neuronal activity back to the underlying sources, the so-called source space. Thus, network nodes can be defined as EEG or MEG electrodes in the sensor space and source-reconstructed brain regions in the source space 30 .</p>
<p>In MRI studies, nodes are defined by brain parcellations that are based on cytoarchitectonics, anatomical landmarks or connectivity patterns. Links can be defined by four types of brain connectivity: structural connectivity, structural co-variance, functional connectivity and effective connectivity (or directed information flow). Structural connectivity is studied with diffusion (or diffusion tensor) MRI, which uses the diffusion properties of water molecules to assess the local brain tissue microstructure and reflects the physical connection of regions by white matter tracts. Structural co-variance is measured by the co-variance or correlation of morphological measurements, such as brain volume, cortical thickness and surface area, in two or more brain regions. Functional connectivity denotes symmetrical statistical dependencies in the recorded time series of neuronal activity in different brain regions and is established indirectly from fMRI or directly from EEG and MEG 38 . Effective connectivity 29,39,40 , defined as a directed causal influence from one brain region on another, is not covered here.</p>
<p>The structural or functional connectome can be represented as a connectivity matrix 41 . In this matrix, each row or column corresponds to a node (or a brain region in a structural or functional connectome) and the matrix entry or element corresponds to the link (structural or functional connectivity) between two nodes. In this Review, we focus on connectomes constructed from neuroimaging data, which contain links that are generally undirected or symmetrical. Depending on the scientific questions of interest, the connectivity matrices can be analysed as weighted graphs 42 or further binarized to unweighted matrices 43 , where each element is either 1 (if there is a link between two nodes) or 0 (if there is no link). Then, the topological properties of a connectome can be characterized by computing a series of graph theoretical metrics, such as clustering coefficient, path length-based metrics, centrality and modularity (Box 2), on the weighted or binarized connectivity matrix.</p>
<p>• Amyloidβ (Aβ) pathology is associated with decreased hub connectivity in the default-mode network (DmN) during the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease (AD) and the association extends to other brain networks as the disease progresses. • Selective hub vulnerability might explain the preferential accumulation of Aβ in the medial hubs of the DmN, and of tau in medial temporal lobe hubs, in preclinical AD. • tau pathology spreads from the medial temporal lobe hubs -along structural connections -to other brain regions, supporting the pathogenic spread hypothesis. • Aβ pathology has a common role in driving DmN hypo-connectivity in late-onset AD, autosomal-dominant AD and early-onset AD; however, the association between Aβ pathology and DmN hypoconnectivity is regulated by different genetic variants across AD subtypes. • Spatial gene expression profiles might contribute to the relationships between the patterns of Aβ and tau accumulation and patterns of structural and functional connectome changes in AD. • Computational modelling studies will be important for understanding the role of the connectome in relation to progression of Aβ, tau and other pathogenic features of AD.</p>

<p>precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) are two of the largest network hubs to be consistently identified in MEG 53 , fMRI 54,55 and DTI 56,57 studies. Evidence also indicates that the hippocampus is a critical hub in the human connectome 58 and that it supports memory formation and consolidation 59 . Similarly, the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices in the medial temporal lobe form putative hubs in the network topology of the connectome across several species 60 . The human brain connectome consists of multiple subnetworks, called modules or communities. Brain network modules promote the segregation of neural information and hubs promote the integration of such information 51,61 ; both processes are essential for the operation of the distributed networks that underlie cognitive function 29 . In particular, resting-state fMRI 62,63 , task-based fMRI 64,65 and structural MRI 66 studies have identified a number of similar subnetworks in the human brain, including the DMN, frontoparietal, salience, dorsal/ventral attention, cingulo-opercular, sensorimotor, visual, auditory and subcortical networks (Fig. 1). These subnetworks are connected by hubs and each has important roles in specific sensorimotor and cognitive domains 67 . Importantly, these network properties, particularly network hubs 68,69 , have been associated with genetic variation 70 and transcriptomic 71 factors in healthy individuals.</p>
<p>The connectome in AD Both structural and functional network studies have shown that, compared with ageing individuals without cognitive impairment, brain networks in individuals with AD are characterized by a loss of small-world features (trending towards random and/or regular network topology) 30 , disturbed modular structure [72][73][74] and changes in hub regions -particularly those located in the DMN 53,75,76 and medial temporal lobe 53,77 . Of note, the precuneus/PCC (part of the DMN) and entorhinal cortex (located in the medial temporal lobe) are initial deposition sites of the Aβ and tau 78 proteins, respectively (Fig. 2). Many summaries of human connectome studies in individuals without cognitive impairment 28,36,41,79 and in individuals with AD dementia 80,81 are available. Here, we specifically discuss studies that provide information on the effects of Aβ pathology, tau pathology and genetic variation on functional and structural network organization in different subtypes and stages of AD.</p>

<p>Box 1 | The AT(N) research framework</p>
<p>the National Institute on Ageing and the Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) published a biomarker-based research framework for Alzheimer disease (AD), often referred to as the At(N) framework, to categorize research participants who might have AD or a related disorder. Specifically, in vivo neuroimaging 233,234 (pet and mrI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biological markers are grouped into three categories. the first group, or 'A', consists of markers of amyloidβ (Aβ) plaques, that is, amyloid-pet and CSF Aβ 42 . the second group, or 't', consists of markers of tau neurofibrillary tangles, that is, taupet and CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau). the last group, 'N', consists of markers of neurodegeneration, that is, FDG-pet, diffusion mrI, structural mrI, functional mrI, eeG and magnetoencephalography (meG). According to the At(N) system, the Aβ and tau biomarkers are used to define AD and related disorders in vivo and the neurodegeneration biomarkers are used to clinically stage the disease on a continuum from no cognitive impairment (preclinical 235,236 ) to subjective cognitive decline (SCD) 237 (preclinical), to mild cognitive impairment (mCI) 238 (prodromal) and probable AD dementia 239 .</p>
<p>Clinically, individuals with SCD have self-reported experience of cognitive decline, which has not been detected objectively through standardized neuropsychological tests. mCI is considered the first clinical stage of AD; individuals with mCI show deficits in performance in one or multiple cognitive domains on standardized psychometric tests. Individuals with mCI owing to typical AD dementia, termed amnestic mCI, typically have memory impairments, although changes in other domains can begin during this prodromal period. the At(N) classification scheme has been applied in recent studies of SCD 240 , mCI 241 and AD 242 . Importantly, age-associated brain pathologies are not limited to plaques, tangles and atrophy. other processes, for example cerebrovascular factors, can also contribute to white-matter lesions, cerebral hypoperfusion and cognitive dysfunction 243,244 . NAture revIewS | NEuroloGy constructed from structural MRI data 82 shows an association with the overall degree of Aβ pathology in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD; Box 1) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI; Box 1). In particular, several grey-matter network 83,84 studies have shown that, in individuals with SCD who are positive for Aβ, a greater severity of Aβ pathology measured by CSF Aβ 42 (reF. 85 ) and PET imaging 86 is not associated with global or local grey matter volume but is associated with a lower degree of grey-matter network small-worldness, especially at the medial temporal lobe and hub areas (precuneus and orbitofrontal cortex) in the DMN. These studies involved the construction of one grey-matter network per participant (single-participant connectome) in contrast to the more common practice of constructing grey-matter networks at a group level. The results of other single-participant grey-matter network studies indicate that a grey-matter network topology in individuals who are positive for Aβ is associated with the risk of clinical progression from SCD to MCI or AD dementia 87 , enabling the prediction of future hippocampal atrophy and cognitive impairment 88 . Of note, this association was not observed in age-matched individuals who were negative for Aβ, indicating that the relationship between grey-matter network topology and hippocampal atrophy is specific to individuals with Aβ pathology at the preclinical stage of AD. Consistent with the findings in grey-matter networks, cortical-thickness networks in individuals without cognitive impairment who were positive for Aβ showed no significant regional cortical atrophy but did have lower global efficiency, modularity and hubness than individuals without cognitive impairment who were negative for Aβ 89 . These structural network changes preceded detectable cortical thinning and suggest that metrics derived from structural covariance networks are associated with biomarkers of Aβ pathology.</p>
<p>The reported associations between Aβ pathology and DTI-derived structural network metrics are inconsistent across studies. One study reported that local structural connectivity -quantified by several weighted structural connectome metrics, including the nodal strength, weighted local efficiency and weighted clustering coefficient -decreased as a function of disease stage (without cognitive impairment &gt; MCI &gt; AD), particularly in the bilateral frontal and temporal regions 90 . Of note, these weighted structural connectome metrics were negatively correlated with cortical Aβ burden, independent of brain region. Another DTI study 91 investigated the association between the cortical Aβ burden and post-mortem structural connectome topology in individuals without dementia. In this study, Aβ burden was negatively correlated with several global (global efficiency, degree and clustering coefficient) and local (nodal degree in PCC and clustering coefficient in precuneus) connectivity metrics but positively correlated with local efficiency in the highly connected PCC. The inconsistency regarding local efficiency might be a result of the use of different graph metrics (applied to weighted or unweighted networks) and differences in DTI data acquisition (in vivo or in situ) as well as differences in processing between the two studies.</p>
<p>The DTI studies described above provided evidence that the progression of Aβ pathology along the AD continuum gives rise to a shift towards a more regular network topology and the diffuse loss of local structural connectivity. Notably, in a diffusion MRI study, reduced structural connectivity in the posteromedial hubs of the DMN was observed in individuals with MCI and AD compared with older individuals without cognitive impairment; however, the degeneration of white matter fibre tracts was observed in individuals who are negative for Aβ, indicating that the neurodegenerative changes are not specifically related to Aβ pathology 92 . DTI-derived measures of white matter integrity, for example, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, are useful markers for the prediction of longitudinal cognitive decline in preclinical AD [93][94][95] . However, evidence suggests that Aβ pathology does not influence white matter integrity at early stages of AD 93,94,96 . One possible interpretation of these findings is that global and local structural brain connectome metrics are more sensitive than measures of white matter integrity to Aβ-related changes 97,98 . Further study of the possible link between Aβ pathology and abnormalities in the DTI-derived structural brain connectome could provide more information on the effects of Aβ pathology on network-level neurodegeneration and its relationship to cognitive dysfunction. Of note, a study published in 2018 reported that the integrity of white matter connections along the uncinate fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus and cingulum bundle was altered in individuals with AD who were positive for Aβ compared with individuals without cognitive impairment with a mixed Aβ positivity (27% individuals who were positive for Aβ); however, no significant difference in structural connectome organization was observed between the</p>

<p>Box 2 | Hubs and community structure</p>
<p>Hubs</p>
<p>Hubs can be defined by many different aspects of networks and thus many different ways of measuring centrality have been proposed, including degree (or strength in weighted networks), betweenness, closeness, eigenvector and pagerank centrality 47 . of note, centrality measures that are defined by path length, such as betweenness and closeness, are less straightforward to interpret in functional networks than in structural networks 43 . In some real networks, including brain networks, hubs are more densely interconnected than expected, forming a rich-club organization 47 .</p>
<p>Community structure or modules</p>
<p>Complex networks often consist of a few relatively distinct and yet interconnected clusters, called communities or modules 245 . many algorithms 246 have been developed for the identification of communities in real-world networks and have been applied in the field of network neuroscience 49 . A family of the most widely used methods for the detection of brain communities are known as modularity maximization methods 247,248 . these methods partition nodes of a network into multiple non-overlapping modules by maximizing a modularity quality function. However, modularity maximization often encounters a resolution limit: relatively small, but very dense modules may be undetectable in the presence of relatively large modules 249 . A few studies have used multi-resolution techniques to avoid the resolution limit issue 246 .</p>
<p>once a network has been partitioned into modules, nodes in this network can be classified on the basis of their connections to other nodes within and between modules, which are quantified by within-module degree and participation coefficient 250 . For example, hubs can be classified into provincial (high within-module degree) and connector (high participation coefficient) hubs: provincial hubs mostly connect to nodes in the same module; connector hubs link nodes from multiple modules. In functional brain networks, the participation coefficient is thought to be a more meaningful index of hubs than the node degree 54 and it can enable the identification of nodes that play important roles in the integration of neural information.</p>
<p>www.nature.com/nrneurol two groups 99 . This inconsistency could be a result of network thresholding issues (Box 3). Furthermore, the results of DTI-derived structural brain connectome studies should be interpreted with caution as the anatomical accuracy of structural connectivity measures 100 and the reliability of tractography estimations 101,102 continue to be subject to methodological investigation and refinement.</p>
<p>Functional connectome. Functional connectome studies generally involve fMRI or electromagnetic recording of resting brain activity. The results of these studies suggest that, in individuals with AD, Aβ accumulation and abnormal brain network connectivity are spatially colocalized in highly connected hub areas. In early AD, including preclinical and prodromal AD, studies using different neuroimaging modalities, such as MEG 53 and fMRI 103 , have shown that the degree of abnormality in functional brain network connectivity is associated with the degree of Aβ pathology (CSF and PET) but not tau pathology (CSF). These findings suggest that Aβ pathology, as opposed to tau pathology, drives functional connectome changes at the early stages of AD. Indeed, a seminal fMRI-based connectome study found that, in individuals with AD, Aβ tends to accumulate at cortical hubs located in the DMN, including the PCC/precuneus, lateral parietal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, and medial and lateral prefrontal cortices 75 . Furthermore, a striking colocalization of Aβ accumulation and abnormal hub connectivity was observed, accompanied by a strong positive correlation between the level of Aβ deposition and degree centrality. Several subsequent studies have found evidence that the association between Aβ pathology and decreased DMN (in particular, the posteromedial components of DMN) connectivity is also identifiable in preclinical AD 3,104,105 , prodromal AD 106,107,174,175 and earlyonset AD 108 . Evidence also indicates that the reduction in DMN connectivity mediates the association between Aβ pathology and cognitive impairment in prodromal AD 106 .</p>
<p>The results of a longitudinal study showed that, in individuals with normal levels of CSF Aβ 42 and Aβ-PET who subsequently converted to having abnormal CSF Aβ 42 , Aβ initially accumulated in the DMN and parts of the frontoparietal network; the sensorimotor and visual networks showed the least Aβ accumulation at these early stages 4 (Fig. 3). Of note, when CSF Aβ 42 levels became abnormal, individuals had hypoconnectivity within the DMN and between the DMN and the frontoparietal network but without brain atrophy or glucose hypometabolism. This finding suggests that Aβ-associated network hypoconnectivity in preclinical AD precedes other biomarkers of neurodegeneration such as brain atrophy and glucose hypometabolism. In another fMRI study, DMN connectivity was examined at different stages along the AD continuum: without cognitive impairment, SCD, early-stage MCI, late-stage MCI and AD 109 . The results support the hypothesis that the network failure associated with AD starts in the posterior components of the DMN before amyloid plaques can be identified by PET imaging and spread to other brain areas through network hubs.

<p>The results of several studies indicate that Aβ-associated abnormalities in functional network connectivity are not confined to the DMN but also involve other brain networks at both early stages of AD as well as later in the disease. In a MEG study, several hub regions -located in the left hippocampus, posterior parts of the DMN and occipital regions -had altered connectivity in young (age 60.6 ± 5.4 years) individuals with AD compared with healthy controls 53 . In the individuals with AD, the degree of abnormality in the connectivity of these hubs correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment and with Aβ pathology (CSF Aβ 42 ). Several fMRI studies have identified Aβ-related connectivity changes in multiple resting-state networks. For example, an fMRI study reported negative correlations between regional severity of Aβ pathology and longitudinal changes in functional connectivity between the DMN, the frontoparietal network and the temporal cortex in individuals without cognitive impairment. A densely sampled (five observations over 3 years) fMRI study 110 reported a similar (in effect size) influence of Aβ pathology on longitudinal change in DMN and salience network connectivity as well as on longitudinal changes in cognitive performance and hippocampal volume in individuals with preclinical AD. However, the change in network connectivity was independent of the changes in cognitive performance and hippocampal volume, suggesting that functional network connectivity in the DMN and salience network can be used to track aspects of AD progression that are not captured by cognitive and structural measurements.</p>
<p>The human medial temporal lobe, consisting of hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, entorhinal cortex and perirhinal cortex, plays an important role in supporting episodic memory, which is typically disturbed in individuals with AD. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that AD pathology (Aβ and/or tau) causes decreased functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and the anterior and posterior components of DMN, resulting in cognitive dysfunction in early AD. In line with this notion, a longitudinal multimodal MRI (fMRI and DTI) study reported Aβ-related changes in functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and DMN in individuals without cognitive impairment who were positive for Aβ and in individuals with MCI 111 . In particular, in comparison with individuals without cognitive impairment who were negative for Aβ, individuals without cognitive impairment who were positive for Aβ had decreased functional connectivity between the anterior parts of the medial temporal lobe and the anterior DMN and individuals with MCI who were positive for Aβ had decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the posteromedial DMN. Of note, in individuals without cognitive impairment who were positive for Aβ, the degree of functional hypoconnectivity between the medial temporal lobe and anterior DMN was correlated with tau pathology (measured by CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau)) and baseline memory impairment; the relationship between functional hypoconnectivity and memory impairment was present at baseline as well as during the 8 years of follow-up. The degree of functional hypoconnectivity between the medial temporal lobe and posterior DMN in individuals with MCI who were positive for Aβ correlated with entorhinal atrophy and reduced white matter integrity of the parahippocampal cingulum. These findings not only support the theory that functional network abnormalities and/or cognitive dysfunction in preclinical AD is were negative for Aβ but to a greater degree. In addition, in the individuals who were positive for Aβ, tau accumulation was observed in the parietal regions such as the precuneus. In the individuals with AD, tau accumulation in the temporal and parietal regions was significantly higher than in the other groups of older adults; tau accumulation was also observed in broader parietal regions and in frontal and visual cortices in individuals with AD.

<p>www.nature.com/nrneurol driven by Aβ pathology and precedes structural changes but also suggest that subsequent structural changes in prodromal AD are related to increased tau pathology, with disease progression facilitated by Aβ pathology.</p>
<p>In summary, the studies discussed in this section provide converging evidence that Aβ pathology is preferentially associated with decreased network connectivity in the DMN and medial temporal lobe in early stages of AD and that the association extends to other brain networks with progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Tau-associated changes</p>
<p>Structural connectome. One hypothesis regarding the progression of tau pathology in AD is that tau protein spreads from the medial temporal lobe to other network hubs, in particular the posteromedial DMN 112 . Ongoing research is attempting to determine the cellular mechanisms of tau pathology progression, which might include cell-to-cell 'prion-like' spreading; however, this level of detail cannot be resolved using current neuroimaging techniques. The results of a landmark multi-modal (Aβ-PET, tau-PET, and structural and diffusion MRI) longitudinal imaging study in individuals with preclinical AD showed that tau indeed spreads from the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe to the posteromedial DMN, particularly the PCC, through the hippocampal cingulum bundle 113 . The study reported an association between hippocampal cingulum bundle diffusivity and tau accumulation in the PCC and this association was stronger in the presence of higher levels of amyloid accumulation, providing evidence that Aβ pathology facilitates tau spreading. In addition, hippocampal cingulum bundle diffusivity predicted progressive memory dysfunction in individuals who were positive for Aβ with high levels of tau accumulation in the PCC, providing evidence that Aβ and tau pathologies facilitate memory dysfunction.</p>
<p>In another multi-modal study, the relationship between levels of tau accumulation and structural connectivity differed on the basis of Aβ status in individuals with amnestic MCI or mild AD 114 . For example, in individuals who were negative for Aβ without cognitive impairment, levels of tau deposition in the medial temporal lobe and across the entire cerebrum showed a positive correlation with structural connectivity. Conversely, in individuals who were positive for Aβ and with amnestic MCI or mild AD, tau deposition negatively correlated with structural connectivity in the same medial temporal lobe areas and in the cerebrum as a whole as well as in some DMN hubs, including the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and precuneus. These results suggest that the relationship between tau and structural connectivity changes in an Aβ-dependent manner as AD progresses.</p>
<p>Data on the effects of tau pathology on the organization of the structural connectome as estimated by conventional structural MRI-based measurements, such as grey matter volumes and cortical thickness values, are not yet available. However, quite a few studies have detected prospective and retrospective relationships between elevated tau burden and cortical atrophy [115][116][117] as well as grey matter lesions [118][119][120] at different stages of the AD continuum. As structural covariance network metrics have shown superior sensitivity to conventional structural measurements for capturing the effects of Aβ pathology on the progression of AD (see section on Aβ-associated structural connectome changes), future studies will be required to probe whether tau has an additional or distinctive role in shaping the changes in structural covariance network organization that occur in AD.</p>
<p>Functional connectome. Tau pathology has been hypothesized to have specific effects on the human functional connectome, depending on and/or independent of Aβ pathology. Early studies investigated the relationships between functional network connectivity and tau pathology (CSF levels of p-tau) 121,122 . For example, in MEG 122 and fMRI 121 studies, higher levels of CSF p-tau and lower levels of CSF Aβ 42 in preclinical AD (without cognitive impairment and/or with MCI) were independently correlated with reduced functional connectivity involving the anterior and posterior (PCC) hubs of the DMN and medial temporal areas.</p>
<p>With the development of in vivo tau-PET tracers, more recent studies have focused on examining spatial associations between tau pathology and the organization of the functional brain connectome. To date, most of these studies used data from individuals who were positive for Aβ or groups of individuals with mixed Aβ status (positive and negative for Aβ). A resting-state fMRI study provided evidence that, in individuals who are positive for Aβ without cognitive impairment, higher tau accumulation in the inferior temporal cortex is associated with lower functional connectivity in the DMN and the salience network, where the Aβ preferentially deposits 123 . This result suggests that the associations Box 3 | Graph theoretical analysis: methodological considerations to characterize network topology, a threshold is often applied to structural or functional connectivity matrices to remove spurious links that result from low and, thus, potentially less reliable (noisy) correlations and to generate sparsely connected adjacency matrices 41,251,252 . As different thresholds will generate networks with different numbers of links (or link density) from the same data, a range of thresholds are often used to explore the topological properties of the network. the results of multiple studies [253][254][255][256] indicate that most network characteristics are dependent on link density; therefore, the estimated network topology is biased by the arbitrary choice of the threshold or range of thresholds. of note, performing weighted network analysis without applying a threshold to the connectivity matrix does solve the link density issue; however, network comparison is still biased owing to the differences in overall connectivity strength between patient and control groups 253,257 . For example, networks with lower overall connectivity strength will have a lower clustering coefficient than other networks 253 . As a result, statistical differences in network metrics between patient and control groups might simply be a result of differences in overall connectivity strength and not directly linked to disease-related differences in network organization. the use of normalized network metrics reduces but does not completely remove the bias in both unweighted and weighted network analyses 253 . Several novel network construction approaches (for example, the minimum spanning tree 73,258 and consistencybased thresholding 259 ) and statistical approaches (for example, the multi-threshold permutation correction 260 and mixture modelling 261 methods) have been proposed. However, to date, no single approach completely solves the aforementioned methodological issues, which might hamper the reliable and reproducible comparison of network topology between patient and control groups 262 . therefore, results of graph theoretical analyses of such group differences should be interpreted with caution 257 .</p>
<p>between tau and functional connectivity in individuals who are positive for Aβ at early AD stages might be modulated by the Aβ pathology. In addition, the results of a recent task-based fMRI study 124 in individuals without cognitive impairment with mixed Aβ status indicate that the abnormal accumulation of tau burden in the medial temporal lobe memory system is associated with increased neural activation in both the medial temporal lobe and the posteromedial hubs of the DMN. Of note, it seems that initial deposits of both tau and Aβ, although they accumulated at different locations in the brain, negatively correlated with cognitive performance at the preclinical stage of AD 124 . Indeed, the results of an fMRI study in older adults and young adults without cognitive impairment indicated that tau pathology has a key role in disconnecting the hippocampus from other components of the medial temporal lobe in healthy ageing, leading to worse memory performance 125 .</p>
<p>By the time prodromal AD progresses to AD dementia, Aβ pathology is diffusely distributed across the cerebral cortex 126,127 . Therefore, if Aβ pathology facilitates the association between tau pathology and functional connectivity in Aβ-positive AD dementia, tau pathology would be expected to affect multiple brain networks and global network properties at this stage of the disease. Indeed, recent resting-state studies 128,129 have reported that, in Aβ-positive AD dementia, the association between tau burden and functional connectivity does not seem to be specific to the DMN but also affects other resting-state networks. In particular, the results of a resting-state fMRI study showed that, in Aβ-positive AD dementia, covariance in tau accumulation was positively associated with functional connectivity within and/or between multiple resting-state networks, including the DMN, frontoparietal network, limbic network, dorsal/ ventral attention networks, and visual and sensorimotor networks 129 (Fig. 4). This study also found that the functional network connectivity, together with levels of tau accumulation at baseline, could accurately predict future tau accumulation, further supporting the hypothesis that tau spreads via functional connections in AD 130,131 . In addition, the results of an fMRI study in individuals with AD dementia indicated that hub areas from multiple resting-state networks show more tau accumulation than non-hubs 132 . This accumulation of tau at hubs was associated with a reduction in local connectivity, as quantified by weighted degree and local efficiency (degree and local efficiency can be computed in weighted brain networks without thresholding; Box 3), supporting the hypothesis that tau pathology affects network hubs in AD dementia.</p>
<p>One hypothesis is that Aβ and tau pathology affect different resting-state networks 133,134 . This hypothesis also states that -at the late stage of AD -it is tau pathology, not Aβ pathology, that is correlated with cognitive decline and changes in other AD biomarkers 133,134 . In agreement with this notion, several studies 125,131,135,136 have reported that patterns of Aβ accumulation predominantly overlap with the DMN, whereas patterns of tau accumulation overlap with other resting-state networks such as the limbic network, the anterior-temporal network and the visual network. In these studies, the degree of tau accumulation also correlated with several downstream biomarkers, including glucose hypometabolism, white matter integrity and grey matter volume, as well as with multiple cognitive functions. Therefore, integrating Aβ and tau imaging data in the same studies might help us identify specific contributors to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the associations between tau pathology and functional connectivity in the above studies might be affected by the presence of Aβ pathology. Indeed, several recent studies have reported interactive effects of Aβ and tau on functional connectivity 123,137 . For example, a multi-modal neuroimaging study measured fMRI, Aβ-PET and tau-PET in older adults without cognitive impairment. Participants who were positive for Aβ and with low neocortical tau levels had higher levels of DMN and salience network connectivity than participants who are negative for Aβ, and connectivity in these networks decreased as tau levels increased in these individuals over time 123 . However, another fMRI-PET study found that, in older adults without cognitive impairment, tau accumulation in the inferior temporal www.nature.com/nrneurol cortex was associated with increased hippocampal activity but not with Aβ accumulation 137 . Therefore, to isolate the effects of Aβ pathology on the association between tau and functional connectivity, studies will need to be conducted in individuals who are negative for Aβ.</p>
<p>In support of this notion, an fMRI-PET study reported that higher functional connectivity between any given pair of brain regions is associated with stronger tau covariance, particularly in the inferior temporal cortex and medial temporal lobe 130 . Importantly, this association between tau and functional connectivity was present in the absence of detectable Aβ pathology: it was observed in both individuals without cognitive impairment who are either positive or negative for Aβ and in individuals with a diagnosis of MCI or AD. Indeed, in another fMRI-PET study, entorhinal cortex seed-based connectivity analysis confirmed that stronger connectivity between the entorhinal seed and other brain regions was associated with higher levels of tau accumulation 138 . Moreover, although this relationship between tau and functional connectivity was enhanced by Aβ accumulation, it was also present in individuals who were negative for Aβ.</p>
<p>The connectome in subtypes of AD Late-onset AD Functional connectome. Different subtypes of AD, such as late-onset AD, autosomal-dominant AD and earlyonset AD, are associated with distinctive genetic variants, which raises the question of whether these subtypes alter the connectome in different ways. APOE ε4 has a dominant effect on neuropathology 139,140 and cognitive dysfunction 141 in late-onset AD. Therefore, connectome studies in this subtype of AD have focused on comparing APOE ε4 carriers and APOE ε4 non-carriers 13,142 . Convergent evidence from several fMRI studies suggests that APOE ε4 has an important role in modulating network connectivity changes, particularly in the DMN, at different stages of AD. An early fMRI study reported that, in the absence of abnormal Aβ accumulation, APOE ε4 carriers had lower levels of functional connectivity in the DMN than APOE ε4 non-carriers 143 . The results of subsequent fMRI studies supported this finding [144][145][146] and identified APOE ε4-related changes in functional network connectivity and network topology in multiple resting-state networks, including the salience 147,148 , temporal 146 , visual 149 , frontoparietal and sensorimotor networks 145 , at the preclinical stages of AD. Of note, in a longitudinal fMRI study, the effects of APOE ε4 on DMN connectivity in individuals with SCD persisted with the progression of the disease, regardless of the level of Aβ accumulation 144 .</p>
<p>The relationship between family history and functional network connectivity has also been studied in APOE ε4 non-carriers with late-onset AD [150][151][152] . Even in the absence of APOE ε4, individuals without cognitive impairment with a family history of late-onset AD had lower resting-state DMN connectivity than individuals without a family history of the disease 150 . In individuals with a family history of late-onset AD, SCD was associated with higher resting-state DMN connectivity 151 ; in these individuals with memory decline, a higher connectivity was associated with better memory, attention and global cognition at baseline but was associated with a greater degree of memory decline over time. One hypothesis is that, as functional network connectivity measurements seem to be closely related to cognitive and clinical phenotypes, they might be useful for predicting disease progression in individuals with late-onset AD and a known family history of the disease. Indeed, in a machine-learning study, functional network connectivity in the DMN, salience network and limbic network, together with grey matter volumes, accurately predicted age of symptom onset in individuals with late-onset AD and a family history of the disease 152 .</p>
<p>Structural connectome. APOE ε4-associated alterations to the structural brain connectome are similar to those observed in the functional brain connectome, that is, they involve the DMN and medial temporal lobe. In particular, DTI studies have reported that APOE ε4 carriers with preclinical late-onset AD have an age-related loss of local connectivity, which is characterized by a reduction in clustering coefficient 153 , local efficiency 154 and betweenness centrality 155 compared with non-carrier controls without cognitive impairment. This reduction affects both the posterior and frontal hubs of the DMN, including the precuneus, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. In these DTI studies, the degree of DMN connectivity abnormality was associated with the degree of episodic memory impairment as well as with attentional and executive dysfunction. In addition, substantial APOE ε4-associated disruption of structural connectivity in the medial temporal lobe regions, for example, lower efficiency in the right hippocampus 156 and parahippocampal gyrus 157 , has been reported in individuals without cognitive impairment and in individuals with MCI. Of note, a restingstate DTI-fMRI study found that APOE ε4-associated network changes were already detectable in APOE ε4 carriers during middle age 158 . This observation suggests that connectome organization is affected by APOE ε4 decades before the onset of symptoms and might be a promising biomarker for the early detection of AD.</p>
<p>Going beyond the APOE genotype, two genome-wide association studies reported specific associations between changes in the organization of the structural connectome and multiple AD-associated genetic variants 159,160 . One of these studies, a novel cross-sectional genome-wide association study in healthy adult twins, identified a connectome-wide, genome-wide association between DTI-based structural connectivity and a variant in SPON1 (reF. 160 ). Of note, SPON1 encodes Spondin 1 (also known as F-spondin), which is expressed in the hippocampus and facilitates outgrowth of hippocampal embryonic neurons 161 . SPON1 also interacts with APOE to regulate Aβ accumulation 162,163 . Importantly, individuals with the SPON1 variant had less severe dementia than individuals without the variant, independent of APOE genotype, indicating protective effects of the SPON1 variant in preclinical, late-onset AD. Taken together, these findings indirectly suggest a role for SPON1 in the structural connectivity changes that occur in late-onset AD, indicating that structural brain network changes in this type of AD are related to variants in multiple genes and not to the APOE genotype alone.</p>
<p>Autosomal-dominant AD</p>
<p>In contrast to late-onset AD and sporadic early-onset AD, autosomal-dominant AD is caused by monogenic, deterministic mutations in one of three genes: APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2. In addition, individuals with autosomal-dominant AD often show a consistent temporal pattern of biomarker changes 126,127 : first, an increase in Aβ (CSF Aβ 42 and Aβ-PET); second, an increase in tau (CSF p-tau and tau-PET); third, hypometabolism; fourth, cortical atrophy; and last, clinical decline. The age at onset of autosomal-dominant AD is also consistent within families 14,15 . Therefore, studying brain connectome changes in individuals with autosomal-dominant AD, in whom biomarker changes and symptom onset are predictable, could enable a more precise assessment of the effects of known genetic mutations and disease progression than is possible in individuals with other AD subtypes.</p>
<p>Structural connectome.</p>
<p>Quite a few studies have reported evidence of grey mater atrophy 126,127 and altered diffusion properties of white matter 164,165 in individuals at the preclinical stages of autosomal-dominant AD; however, published work on the structural brain connectome in this subtype of the disease remains scarce. In a comprehensive longitudinal study, structural greymatter networks were constructed for 269 autosomaldominant AD mutation carriers and 170 non-carriers; both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed 166 . In the cross-sectional analysis, the earliest difference between carriers and non-carriers was a lower normalized path length -particularly in the precuneus -in carriers ~12 years before estimated symptom onset. In the longitudinal analysis, the earliest difference between the two groups of participants was a reduction in normalized clustering coefficient, connection density and degree in the mutation carriers 6 years before symptom onset. In the cross-sectional analysis, greater Aβ accumulation, higher levels of neurodegeneration biomarkers (glucose hypometabolism and precuneus cortical thinning) and greater cognitive decline were associated with a lower small-world coefficient at baseline. In the longitudinal analysis, faster changes in Aβ accumulation, neurodegeneration biomarker levels and cognitive decline were related to the concurrent decrease in the small-world coefficient over time. The study also found that global network connectivity was lower in PSEN1 mutation carriers than in APP or PSEN2 mutation carriers, suggesting that mutations in the different autosomal-dominant AD genes do not result in the same connectivity changes.</p>
<p>Functional connectome.</p>
<p>To date, functional connectome changes in autosomal-dominant AD have been assessed with fMRI only. In one such fMRI study, Chhatwal et al. assessed DMN functional connectivity in asymptomatic autosomal-dominant AD mutation carriers (APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2) and non-carriers from the same families and found that the mutation carriers had a lower connectivity, particularly in the PCC/precuneus and right parietal cortex 167 . Of note, the disruption of DMN connectivity in mutation carriers worsened as the disease progressed. In a more recent fMRI study, both autosomal-dominant AD and late-onset AD were associated with reduced functional connectivity in multiple resting-state networks, including the DMN, dorsal www.nature.com/nrneurol 0123456789();: attention network and cingulo-opercular network (also referred to as the salience network) 168 . Consistent with the findings of Chhatwal et al. 167 , autosomal-dominant AD mutation carriers showed a lower functional connectivity in these multiple resting-state networks than non-carriers, slightly preceding their predicted age of symptom onset. The most recent of this series of fMRI connectivity studies, published in 2018, also reported specific effects of autosomal-dominant AD mutations on the degradation of the DMN and dorsal attention network in the preclinical stage of the disease 169 . The results of these three fMRI studies suggest that mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 influence the rate of network-level neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>The relationship between functional connectome organization, tau accumulation and cognitive decline in the various subtypes of AD has also been studied using fMRI techniques. In particular, one study reported an association between higher functional connectivity in frontal hub areas and slower impairment of memory and global cognition in individuals with late-onset AD and in autosomal-dominant AD mutation carriers 170 . This higher connectivity was also associated with smaller effects of tau on cognitive decline in individuals with preclinical, Aβ-positive late-onset AD.</p>
<p>Early-onset AD</p>
<p>Compared with late-onset and autosomal-dominant AD, fewer brain connectome studies have been performed in sporadic early-onset AD, which comprises about 4-6% of all AD 171,172 . In one fMRI study, compared with individuals without cognitive impairment, individuals with early-onset AD had alterations in global and local network connectivity, characterized by a lower clustering coefficient in sensorimotor regions and a longer path length in the temporal lobe 173 .</p>
<p>A few DTI studies reported that early-onset AD is associated with impaired structural connectivity 176,177 and rich-club attributes 178 in posterior brain regions. As discussed in the previous section, typical late-onset AD is characterized by the disruption of functional and structural network connectivity involving the DMN and hippocampus, which are likely to play prominent roles in memory processing. Therefore, the connectivity changes in posterior brain regions associated with early-onset AD might explain why individuals with early-onset AD usually show cognitive dysfunction in diverse cognitive domains, including the visuo-spatial, attention and executive domains, in contrast to the loss of episodic memory that is observed in late-onset AD.</p>
<p>Pathological protein spread Converging evidence from both human studies and transgenic mouse models (Box 4) have shown that the misfolded proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases -such as Aβ and tau in AD and α-synuclein in Parkinson disease -exhibit stereotypical spatiotemporal patterns of accumulation. One hypothesis is that these patterns reflect prion-like transneuronal spread along structural connections [179][180][181][182] . This hypothesis is supported by the findings of many studies in transgenic mouse models. These studies reported that misfolded tau can spread via neuronal pathways following a prion-like process, which seems to be facilitated by Aβ pathology 183,184 . The tau spreading hypothesis is also supported by studies in humans that combine tau-PET with functional and/or diffusion MRI 113,129,130 .</p>
<p>The other main hypothesis 185 is that these patterns reflect a selective neuronal abnormality (or vulnerability) of specific brain regions [186][187][188][189] . This hypothesis originates from the observation that some neurons become structurally and functionally abnormal earlier in the course of AD than others 186,187 . The initial patterns of Aβ and tau accumulation detected with PET seem to support this hypothesis as Aβ is initially deposited in the medial hubs (medial prefrontal cortex and PCC/precuneus) of the DMN and tau is initially deposited in the entorhinal cortex, providing evidence that specific hub regions are selectively vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathologies in AD. In addition, the hubs that show early Aβ accumulation are also areas of high metabolic demand 190 . Thus, the selective abnormality of network hubs in AD could be interpreted in terms of metabolism. Specifically, studies have demonstrated that highly connected hub regions demand high metabolic energy by means of oxidative glucose metabolism 191,192 . In addition, a mouse connectome study 68 found that hub connectivity is driven by gene pathways that regulate the oxidative synthesis and metabolism of ATP. Therefore, these high-cost hubs will be prone to showing abnormal connectivity when under metabolic stress 193 . Indeed, growing evidence indicates that higher Aβ accumulation in the DMN is related to stronger regional hypometabolism in the DMN and other functionally connected brain regions 107,190 . In other studies, the spatial location of hypometabolism was strongly associated with patterns of tau accumulation in different subtypes of AD (late-onset AD 194,195 , early-onset AD 196 and autosomal-dominant AD 27 ). However, the relationship between tau-associated hypometabolism and connectome changes has not yet been investigated</p>
<p>Box 4 | Mechanistic insights from animal models</p>
<p>Although this review focuses on human studies 134,263 , studies in animal models have also produced evidence of a relationship between the connectome and amyloidβ (Aβ) and tau pathology 33,182,228,264 . For example, evidence from transgenic mouse models indicates that neuronal activity can regulate Aβ accumulation 265 in specific brain areas and can facilitate the release and cell-tocell spread of tau 266 . one study used a mouse model of tauopathy and reported that regional tau accumulation was mainly driven by anatomical connectivity rather than by cell-intrinsic factors (gene expression profiles) 184 . In another study, injections of human tau preformed fibrils into the hippocampus of transgenic mice induced tau spreading, which affected the caudal entorhinal cortex and contralateral hippocampus first 267 , further supporting a relationship between tau spreading and the connectome [268][269][270] . moreover, the hypothesis of Aβ-facilitated tau spreading via neuronal connections has also been tested in mouse models 183,271 . therefore, although it is still challenging to directly translate animal models to humans [272][273][274] , findings from animal models can provide important mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of AD-associated connectome changes.</p>
<p>NAture revIewS | NEuroloGy in AD. In the future, studies integrating connectome (measured by MRI or MEG) with multi-modal (tau, Aβ and FDG) PET might facilitate the identification of interactive associations among the connectome, tau, Aβ and glucose hypometabolism.</p>
<p>Connectome-based computational models</p>
<p>Computational models (Box 5) provide a complementary method to test theoretical hypotheses -model findings can then be compared with empirical data. In particular, computational models can be used to simulate and replicate patterns of Aβ and tau pathologies identified by PET imaging data, testing the selective vulnerability hypothesis and the pathogenic spreading hypothesis discussed above. Going beyond replicating empirical findings, computational models could also be used to track and predict the trajectories of Aβ and tau progression, uncovering the dynamic relationships between connectome changes and AD pathologies. Indeed, the selective abnormality of hubs to misfolded protein is supported by the results of studies that simulated network changes with neural mass models, which are typically built on an anatomical network estimated from DTI data and generate EEG and MEG-like data (Box 5). In particular, a computational model of AD found that abnormal hub connectivity was caused by excessive neuronal activity, which resulted in the degeneration of networks 197 .</p>
<p>In a more recent computational study, the disruption of functional network hubs by pathological increases in neuronal activity 198 could be opposed by the targeted adjustment of neuronal excitability levels 199 . An Aβ-PET and FDG-PET study reported that Aβ accumulation propagates through hubs in the human DMN, leading to hypometabolism in spatially distant but functionally connected brain regions, contributing to the evidence that distant Aβ accumulation can induce regional metabolic abnormalities 190,200,201 . This observation was reproduced in transgenic rats that form Aβ pathology but do not form neurofibrillary tangles (tau pathology), indicating that the Aβ-induced abnormal connectivity of hubs is independent of tau pathology. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of network hubs in maintaining an optimal balance between the segregation and integration of information transfer and also suggest that hubs can facilitate the early spreading of AD pathology.</p>
<p>In a few studies, epidemic spreading models (ESM) (Box 5) successfully replicated the Aβ accumulation and tau spreading patterns identified in empirical data. In particular, one simulation study used an ESM to test the tau spread hypothesis 202 . Using the entorhinal cortex as the epicentre, the ESM was applied to the DTI-based structural connectome of young individuals without cognitive impairment and explained &lt;70% of the variance in the spatial pattern of tau-PET signal in individuals along the AD continuum (Fig. 5). The ESM was also fitted over the functional connectome and a euclidean distance matrix, but the ESM fitted over the structural connectome outperformed both, suggesting that tau proteins mainly spread through structural connectome pathways rather than through functional connectivity 203 or simply between neighbouring brain regions 184 . The results of this study also support the hypothesis that, although tau accumulation occurs independent of Aβ pathology, tau spreading is facilitated by a greater Aβ burden. A more recent tau-PET study identified four subtypes of tau spreading patterns, each of which spatially overlaps with a different brain subnetwork, that is, the limbic network, the medial temporal lobe network, the visual network or the lateral temporal network 204 . Of note, in this study, ESMs with different preselected epicentres (Box 5) were used to simulate the four tau spreading subtypes, indicating that tau spreads through different subnetworks in different subtypes.</p>
<p>Network diffusion models (NDNs; Box 5) have also been used to investigate the patterns of pathology in AD. These models indicated that AD pathology spreads diffusively and predicted future patterns of cortical atrophy and glucose hypometabolism patterns [205][206][207][208] . Specifically, one study reported that the abnormal connectivity of network hubs in AD can be predicted by a linear model based on the regional expression of a few candidate AD genes (APP, MAPT, PRNP) in healthy brains 207 . Moreover, combining NDN and regional gene expression patterns in the linear prediction model and selecting the entorhinal cortex as the seed improved the ability of the model to predict regional atrophy and hypometabolism patterns. These results support a role for brain connectivity patterns in the spreading of Epidemic spreading models (eSM).

<p>In general, computational models in the field of network neuroscience use a set of differential equations that describe the dynamic evolution of variables of interest, which are usually associated with neuronal populations 275 . the equations are computed on a structural connectivity matrix that describes large-scale anatomical networks. Here, we define three variants of such models that have been applied in the context of dementia.</p>
<p>Neural mass models</p>
<p>Neural mass models consist of interconnected nodes, each of which represents the average neural activity in a large population (a 'neural mass') of connected excitatory and inhibitory neurons 276 . the neural mass model is characterized by average membrane potentials (for example, simulated eeG or magnetoencephalography signals) and spike density (or firing rates) of the neuronal populations. the local dynamics of the model are influenced by structural couplings (anatomical pathways) that link spatially remote neuronal populations and brain regions. the couplings may be reciprocal or directed, depending on the anatomical data used to define the coupling matrix, and they generally incorporate both connection weights as well as distance-dependent time delays.</p>
<p>Network diffusion models</p>
<p>Network diffusion models simulate patterns of spread via structural networks 205 . For example, these models can simulate the cell-to-cell spread of proteins across structural connectivity networks by use of a network heat equation, which provides an analytical, closed-form solution for trans-neuronal spread. the model assumes that the average activation signal over all neurons in a brain region is proportional to the number of firing neurons.</p>
<p>Epidemic spreading models epidemic spreading models simulate the epidemic diffusion processing of a signal, such as toxic amyloidβ and tau proteins, from a preselected epicentre to different brain regions over time 277 . the spreading pattern is simulated on a structural connectivity network and several model parameters, denoting individual-specific global production rate, global clearance rate and onset time, can be fitted for each individual. these parameters, in combination with regional structural connectivity patterns, determine the spreading speed. In contrast to network diffusion models, epidemic spreading models require production and/or clearance terms to be specified and are implemented via stochastic differential as opposed to analytical equations. www.nature.com/nrneurol AD pathology 97 and the importance of network models in terms of predicting disease progression, going beyond their utility as descriptive tools for the characterization of brain structure and function 36,209 . Of note, both the NDN and ESM have been used for the prediction of disease progression but the performance of the two models has not been directly compared using identical connectome data, which could be an interesting future direction.</p>
<p>Challenges and opportunities</p>
<p>Despite the substantial progress that has been made in the analysis of brain networks in AD, two major questions remain unanswered. First, in preclinical AD, Aβ initially accumulates in the frontal and posterior hubs in the DMN midline, whereas tau first accumulates in the medial temporal lobe hubs -the reason why Aβ and tau pathologies affect different brain networks at this stage of the disease is not yet clear. Second, how Aβ and tau interact and how they interactively and/or independently affect the organization of the connectome in AD are not yet known. Therefore, we need to develop a better understanding of the connection between these AD pathologies and associated brain network changes as well as the underlying cause and temporal order of the changes in AD biomarkers observed in different AD subtypes.</p>
<p>One hypothesis, known as the molecular hypothesis, states that genetic risk factors for AD modulate Aβ and tau pathology 18,210 as well as downstream connectome changes in AD 13,142 . Therefore, examining the gene expression profiles of the brain regions most affected by Aβ and tau pathology could provide partial answers to both of the above questions. Regional gene expression profiles for 20,736 protein-coding genes in healthy brains were derived from brain-wide microarray-based transcriptome data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) 211 and used in two studies of Aβ and tau accumulation patterns. In the first study, which had a cross-sectional design, the Aβ-PET signal in individuals with AD was associated with regional expression levels of APP from the AHBA 212 . Neurodegeneration characterized by cortical atrophy in individuals with AD was associated with regional expression levels of MAPT from the AHBA. In a follow-up study, the longitudinal pattern of Aβ accumulation, characterized by PET, was associated with regional expression levels of CLU and an 'axon-related' genetic profile, whereas the tau spreading pattern was related to the regional expression levels of MAPT and a 'dendrite-related' genetic profile 213 . Of note, both Aβ and tau propagation patterns were also related to a common genetic profile of 'lipid metabolism' , in which the APOE gene played a crucial role. These spatial gene-protein associations might explain the discordance between the localization of Aβ and tau deposits and their presumed downstream patterns of neurodegeneration. In support of this notion, a study in transgenic mice reported that LRP1 is a master regulator of tau accumulation and spread 214 . Of note, the protein product of LRP1 (LRP1) is involved in the regulation of cholesterol (a type of lipid) metabolism, which is one of the biological pathways causing Aβ accumulation [215][216][217] . The observation that LRP1 regulates tau pathology in transgenic mice raises the question of whether regional LRP1 expression is linked to patterns of tau accumulation and spread in the human connectome. In the future, multi-modal neuroimaging (PET, fMRI and DTI) studies that integrate spatial gene expression profiles with information on the organization of the brain structural and functional connectome as well as Aβ and tau propagation patterns at different stages of AD might further our understanding of the distinctive but related patterns of Aβ and tau pathology (Fig. 6).</p>
<p>Several limitations could influence the interpretation of the findings discussed in this Review. First, neuronal and vascular factors change differently with age and both factors contribute to the blood oxygenation level-dependent signals measured by fMRI 218 . In addition, dysfunction of cerebrovascular haemodynamics is associated with white matter hyperintensities in aging 219 . Therefore, age-related changes in the neuro-vascular interaction could influence the interpretation of fMRI and diffusion MRI results. A set of methods aiming to dissociate the age-related neuronal and vascular effects on MRI measurements have now been developed and are recommended for future studies 218 . The second limitation is that most datasets discussed in this Review are heavily weighted towards individuals with European ancestry. Future studies should include a broader and more diverse sample of the global population, including African, Asian, Hispanic and admixed subpopulations.</p>
<p>Conclusions and future directions</p>
<p>Here, we reviewed recent data that relate the human connectome organization to molecular and neuropathological markers in different types and stages of AD. The existing data suggest that selective hub vulnerability is In the brain, evidence indicates that regional expression levels of CLU 213 and APP 212 modulate amyloidβ (Aβ) accumulation, whereas the regional expression levels of MAPT 213 and LRP1 (reF. 214 ) regulate tau accumulation and spread. In addition, regional APOE expression plays a central role in regulating both the Aβ and tau accumulation patterns 213 . Human connectomes consist of five subnetworks: the medial temporal lobe network, the salience network, the visual network, the default-mode network and the sensorimotor network. These networks are interconnected via hubs: anterior cingulated cortex (ACC), entorhinal cortex (EN), hippocampus (HIPP), middle occipital gyrus (MOG), medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOF), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus (PCUN) and</p>
<p>supplementary motor area (SMA). The characteristics of the human connectome in Alzheimer disease (AD) are a result of the, as yet unclear, interactions between Aβ and tau pathologies as well as APOE expression. The gene expression mappings were created using publicly available microarray-based regional gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas as described in reF. 211 . Warmer colours represent higher gene expression levels; the same colour in different gene expression maps might denote different gene expression values as the expression values were not normalized across the different genes. The maps of the Aβ and tau accumulation patterns were manually created according PET data from reF. 4 and reF. 78 , respectively. Warmer colours in the brain maps of Aβ and tau represent earlier and higher levels of Aβ and tau accumulation.</p>
<p>www.nature.com/nrneurol responsible for the preferential accumulation of Aβ in the medial hubs of the DMN and the preferential accumulation of tau in medial temporal lobe hubs in preclinical AD. The data also suggest that the pathogenic spread hypothesis is the most likely explanation for the transcellular spreading of tau from the medial temporal lobe to the posterior hubs of the DMN in prodromal AD. It seems the molecular hypothesis is the most likely explanation for the APOE ε4-derived changes in the brain connectome and Aβ and tau pathologies. Of note, these hypotheses need to be more directly investigated using a multi-omic research framework that integrates empirical multi-modal neuroimaging and gene expression data with computational brain-network models 18 . The higher-order relationships among the Aβ and tau pathologies, genetic variants, markers of neurodegeneration (including at a network level), and cognitive impairment along the AD continuum remain largely unknown 134,220 . Research on specific subtypes of AD can help to address the challenges presented by heterogeneity in pathology, genetic architecture and clinical phenotypes. Longitudinal studies 221 , machine learning 222 and multivariate data analysis 223 (for example, canonical correlation analysis [224][225][226] ) could elucidate the associations among different classes of AD biomarkers and identify clinical and biological subtypes 227 , thus aiding the development of effective treatments 228 . In addition, the use of multi-site neuroimaging and genetic data generally improves statistical power and the generalizability of results; however, multi-site data also contain considerable non-biological variability owing to the use of scanners from different manufacturers and different acquisition protocols. Therefore, the use of a statistical harmonization technique 229 is required to eliminate site effects while preserving biological variability. Emerging study designs and methods that are capable of addressing the complexity of AD -for example, a multilayer network framework 230,231 that spans cognitive functioning, the connectome, gene networks and pathophysiologyare critically needed to enable precision medicine for AD and related disorders.</p>

2Patterns of tau accumulation in AD. Tau accumulation patterns in 5 young healthy adults, 17 older adults negative for amyloidβ (Aβ), 16 older adults positive for Aβ and 15 individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD). Tau accumulation was measured by 18 F-AV-1451 PET imaging; Aβ status was defined based on Pittsburgh compound B PET signal. No tau accumulation was observed in the cortical areas of the young healthy adults. The older adults who were negative for Aβ had tau accumulation in some medial temporal lobe regions, such as the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus, and in some inferior and lateral temporal regions. The older adults positive for Aβ had tau accumulation in the same regions as individuals who</p>

3Early Aβ accumulation in resting-state functional brain networks. Brain regions of early amyloidβ (Aβ) accumulation (red) and the regions comprising six key resting-state functional brain networks (blue) are superimposed upon a 3D rendering of the brain surface. At the preclinical stage of Alzheimer disease, Aβ mainly accumulates in the regions of the default-mode network and, to a lesser degree, the frontoparietal network, the ventral and dorsal attention networks, and the frontotemporal network. The sensorimotor network and the visual network showed the least Aβ accumulation at the preclinical stage. Reprinted from reF.4 , CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).</p>

The functional connectivity analysis used a resting-state connectome template derived from the functional MRI data of 500 participants from the Human Connectome Project. Functional connectivity was significantly associated with tau accumulation pattern, both at the whole-brain level and at the level of each of the resting-state networks.

5Hypothesized, empirical and predicted tau spreading patterns. a | Hypothetical patterns of tau pathology, according to Braak staging6,78 . Tau initially deposits in the entorhinal cortex at Stage I, spreads to the hippocampus and parahippocampus at Stage II, spreads to the inferior and middle temporal and the cingulate (for example, the posterior cingulate cortex) cortices at Stage III, and finally extends to the frontal, visual and parietal (for example, the precuneus) regions at Stage IV. b | Patterns of tau pathology at different stages of AD from empirical tau-PET data. c | Patterns of tau pathology predicted by an epidemic spreading model (ESM) built on a structural connectome derived from diffusion tensor imaging data. d | Patterns of tau pathology predicted by an ESM built on a functional connectome derived from resting-state functional MRI data. The ESM-predicted tau spreading patterns simulated by the structural connectome (part c) are more similar to the hypothetical (part a) and empirical (part b) tau spreading patterns than those simulated by the functional connectome (part d). Note that warmer colours in the empirical and predicted tau spreading patterns represent higher levels of tau accumulation.
