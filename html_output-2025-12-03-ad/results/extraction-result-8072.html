                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> FreeEval is introduced, a modular framework not only for conducting trustworthy and efficient automatic evaluations of LLMs but also serving as a platform to develop and validate new evaluation methodologies.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The rapid growth of evaluation methodologies and datasets for large language models (LLMs) has created a pressing need for their unified integration. Meanwhile, concerns about data contamination and bias compromise the trustworthiness of evaluation findings, while the efficiency of evaluation processes remains a bottleneck due to the significant computational costs associated with LLM inference.In response to these challenges, we introduce FreeEval, a modular framework not only for conducting trustworthy and efficient automatic evaluations of LLMs but also serving as a platform to develop and validate new evaluation methodologies. FreeEval addresses key challenges through: (1) unified abstractions that simplify the integration of diverse evaluation methods, including dynamic evaluations requiring complex LLM interactions; (2) built-in meta-evaluation techniques such as data contamination detection and human evaluation to enhance result fairness; (3) a high-performance infrastructure with distributed computation and caching strategies for efficient large-scale evaluations; and (4) an interactive Visualizer for result analysis and interpretation to support innovation of evaluation techniques. We open-source all our code at https://github.com/WisdomShell/FreeEval and our demostration video, live demo, installation guides are available at: https://freeeval.zhuohao.me/.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The rapid growth of evaluation methodologies and datasets for large language models (LLMs) has created a pressing need for their unified integration. Meanwhile, concerns about data contamination and bias compromise the trustworthiness of evaluation findings, while the efficiency of evaluation processes remains a bottleneck due to the significant computational costs associated with LLM inference. In response to these challenges, we introduce FreeEval, a modular framework not only for conducting trustworthy and efficient automatic evaluations of LLMs but also serving as a platform to develop and validate new evaluation methodologies. FreeEval addresses key challenges through: (1) unified abstractions that simplify the integration of diverse evaluation methods, including dynamic evaluations requiring complex LLM interactions; (2) built-in meta-evaluation techniques such as data contamination detection and human evaluation to enhance result fairness; (3) a high-performance infrastructure with distributed computation and caching strategies for efficient large-scale evaluations; and (4) an interactive Visualizer for result analysis and interpretation to support innovation of evaluation techniques. We opensource all our code at https://github.com/ WisdomShell/FreeEval ${ }^{1}$.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their impressive performance across various tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023). As LLMs play a critical role in academia and industry, evaluating their capabilities has become essential (Guo et al., 2023). Consequently, researchers have proposed</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>automatic evaluation methodologies using benchmark datasets (Clark et al., 2018; Zellers et al., 2019; Cobbe et al., 2021; Bang et al., 2023) for objective assessments, and LLM-based subjective evaluation tools (Wang et al., 2023c; Zheng et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2023b; Chan et al., 2023).</p>
<p>The rapid emergence of evaluation data and methods has intensified the challenge of incorporating cutting-edge techniques cost-effectively and conducting reliable evaluations. In response, several open-source evaluation platforms for LLMs have been proposed, each with unique features. Table 1 provides a comprehensive comparison. Specifically, Eval-Harness (Gao et al., 2021) evaluates LLMs using various benchmark datasets. HELM (Liang et al., 2022) offers metrics beyond accuracy on custom datasets and models. OpenAI Evals (Contributors, 2023) implements interfaces for LLM-based judges and their meta-evaluation. OpenCompass (Contributors, 2023b) introduces distributed inference with SLURM (Yoo et al., 2003) on clusters. PromptBench (Zhu et al., 2023b) incorporates prompt attacks and DyVal (Zhu et al., 2023a) in its framework.</p>
<p>Despite these promising efforts, current evaluation platforms still face three bottlenecks.</p>
<p>First, a unified and extensible framework is required to integrate evaluation methods seamlessly. This consequently affects the flexibility, transparency, and interpretability of the evaluation. The evaluation results are highly dependent on the deployment settings and prompting techniques, as LLMs are not robust enough for these intricate settings (Zheng et al., 2023a). For example, Table 2 shows that these settings can significantly influence results, confirming the need for standardized implementation of evaluation methods to assure consistent assessment.</p>
<p>Second, the reliability of results from these platforms cannot always be guaranteed. Automatic evaluation of LLMs remains a challenging</p>

<p>task (Chang et al., 2023) due to their open-ended nature and the presence of data contamination, which lead to inflated performance metrics (Schaeffer, 2023; Sainz et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2024). Moreover, the lack of tools for in-depth analysis and visualization of evaluation results makes it difficult for researchers to interpret the performance of LLMs across different tasks and scenarios.</p>
<p>Third, the efficiency of previous evaluation toolkits has significant room for improvement. LLM inference could be a substantial challenge for both industry and researchers, since it requires strong GPUs or paid APIs, especially for large-scale evaluations (Wang et al., 2023c). Optimizing inference computation is crucial for reducing the costs of LLM evaluation and supporting rapid iteration in both evaluation and development.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we propose FreeEval, a modular and extensible framework for trustworthy and efficient automatic evaluation of LLMs, as well as a platform for developing new evaluation methodologies. The main features of FreeEval are:</p>
<p>Unified abstraction and modular implementation of various evaluation methods. We introduce concepts of step, dataset, and config to uniformly describe dataset-based, classic referencebased, and LLM-based evaluators. Dataset-based evaluators include task-specific datasets along with
dataset operations such as custom prompting, data augmenting and generation. LLM-based evaluators, such as MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023b), AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023b), PandaLM (Wang et al., 2023c) and KIEval (Yu et al., 2024), are also integrated to provide subjective assessment. Classic Judges, which utilize reference-based evaluation metrics like ROUGE (Lin, 2004) and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) to examine model output. FreeEval's modular design allows for easy implementation of new evaluation protocols and supports evaluating both open-source and proprietary models. The abstractions also bring transparency to the evaluation process since all the evaluation settings are open to users.</p>
<p>Practical meta-evaluation modules for trustworthiness. FreeEval incorporates contamination detection, human judgment, case analysis, and bias evaluation. These features mitigate overfitting risks, enhance interpretability, and support the development and validation of new evaluation methods. A user-friendly interface for human annotation further improves explainability and reliability of results.</p>
<p>Optimized distributed and concurrent inference with load balancing and caching mechanisms. Leveraging cutting-edge inference engines with concurrency and caching strategies, FreeEval efficiently handles large-scale evaluations on multinode multi-GPU clusters. This infrastructure supports both open-source models and proprietary APIs, ensuring scalability and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Intuitive Visualizer for result analysis and interpretation. This component provides interactive tools for exploring results, conducting case studies, and identifying patterns. It enhances interpretability and supports the development of new evaluation methods through visual feedback.</p>
<p>By combining these features, FreeEval addresses key challenges in LLM evaluation while serving as a powerful platform for researchers to build new evaluation methods.</p>
<h2>2 Background</h2>
<p>In this section, we provide an overview of the current landscape of LLM evaluation methods, the challenges posed by data contamination, and the importance of meta-evaluation in assessing the reliability and validity of evaluation protocols.</p>
<h3>2.1 Automatic Evaluation Methods for LLMs</h3>
<p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the emergence of various evaluation methods, each aiming to assess different aspects of model performance. These methods can be broadly categorized into three groups: classic reference-based evaluation, dataset-based benchmarks, and LLM-based evaluators.
Reference-Based Evaluation methods, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ROUGE (Lin, 2004), and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019), assess the quality of generated text by comparing it against human-written references. While straightforward, they may not fully capture the open-ended nature of LLM-generated outputs and can be sensitive to reference quality and diversity (Wang et al., 2023c).
Dataset-Based Benchmarks, such as ARC (Clark et al., 2018), HellaSwag (Zellers et al., 2019), MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), and CEval (Huang et al., 2023), evaluate LLMs using carefully curated datasets that test specific skills or knowledge. However, they may not fully capture the open-ended nature of LLMs and can be vulnerable to data contamination (Schaeffer, 2023; Wei et al., 2023).
LLM-Based Evaluators leverage strong LLMs, such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), to assess the performance of other models. Examples include PandaLM (Wang et al., 2023c), MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023b), GPTScore (Fu et al., 2023), PRD (Li et al., 2023a), and KIEval (Yu et al., 2024). These evaluators can capture nuanced aspects of language understanding and generation, but their performance is influenced by the evaluator LLM and prompting strategies. Biases present in the evaluator LLM may propagate to the evaluation process (Zeng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b), requiring careful meta-evaluation. Additionally, the inference cost of LLMs necessitates optimization for large-scale evaluation.</p>
<h3>2.2 Meta-Evaluation of LLMs</h3>
<p>Meta-evaluation refers to the process of evaluating the fairness, reliability, and validity of evaluation protocols themselves. We incorporate several metaevaluation methods into FreeEval.
Data Contamination occurs when an LLM is exposed to test data during training, leading to inflated performance scores and an inaccurate assessment of the model's true capabilities (Schaeffer, 2023; Sainz et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023a). This issue is particularly important due to its impact on evaluation fairness, and should be considered. We implement data contamination detection methods like Min-K prob (Shi et al., 2023) and average loss (Wei et al., 2023) in FreeEval as modules, to make contamination detection a fundamental process in evaluating LLMs or creating a new evaluation protocol.
Human Evaluation is the gold standard for metaevaluation (Chang et al., 2023), as it directly reflects human preferences on generated texts. This is particularly important for LLM-based evaluators, which subjectively evaluate output quality like human experts. However, the lack of standardized platforms or guidelines for human annotation can lead to biased, inconsistent, and unfair judgments. To address this, we incorporate meta-evaluation protocols from Wang et al. (2023c); Zeng et al. (2023); Zheng et al. (2023b), as they reflect preferences from human experts in different scenarios. Additionally, we create a user-friendly interface for human experts to create new preference datasets, facilitating the collection of high-quality human evaluations for meta-evaluation purposes.</p>
<h2>3 Design and Implementation</h2>
<p>In this section, we present the design and implementation of FreeEval, we discuss the framework's architecture, its key components, and how they address the challenges identified previously.</p>
<h3>3.1 Design Principles</h3>
<p>To build a flexible, efficient research tool for LLM evaluation we make sure the architecture of FreeEval follows the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modular: Enables easy integration of new evaluation methods, datasets, and protocols. Ensures transparency by making all evaluation settings and details openly accessible to users.</li>
<li>Trustworthy: Promotes fair and effective evaluation processes. Supports meta-evaluation for validating evaluation methods and ensures result interpretability.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Overall architecture of FreeEval.</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient: Minimizes computational costs for LLM inference, enabling large-scale evaluations and rapid prototyping of new methodologies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 FreeEval Architecture Overview</h3>
<p>FreeEval's architecture, illustrated in Figure 1, features a modular design that could be separated into Evaluation Methods, Meta-Evaluation and LLM Inference Backends. Evaluation Methods contain different datasets and implementation for evaluation methods. The Meta-Evaluation module ensures the integrity and fairness of assessments by providing data contamination detection methods and popular meta-evaluation method implementation. LLM Inference Backends form the computational backbone, as it provide distributed and concurrent inference of LLMs featuring performance optimization techniques.</p>
<h3>3.3 Extensible Modular Design</h3>
<p>FreeEval's modular architecture is designed to accommodate the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM evaluation. To help users implement evaluation methods without complexity, FreeEval is implemented around the concept of step, dataset and config, which serve as the building blocks for creating flexible and extensible evaluation pipelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>step: A step encapsulates a specific evaluation method, data augmentation technique, or metric calculation. Each step contain three phases: preprocess handles initializing the required dataset or models; run handles the execution; postprocess parse the outputs, collects evaluation results and free up the resources.</li>
<li>dataset: Data used by the evaluators are defined as dataset. Each dataset handles the preprocessing required to load data, few-shot settings, prompting, augmentation of instances, and postprocessing of inference results.</li>
<li>config: A config file is used to compose evaluation pipelines with steps and datasets. The config file contains all the details and settings. steps defined in the config are executed sequentially, and they share the same context which stores intermediate results.</li>
</ul>
<p>These abstractions improve transparency in evaluations by providing users with full access to the configuration details for each evaluation pipeline. The config file also serves as a complete record of the evaluation process, including all necessary hyperparameters and settings. The modular design also allow data to be re-used in different scenarios without effort. For example, GSM8K (Cobbe</p>
<p>et al., 2021) is a evaluation dataset, we could simply calculate perplexity of models on this dataset, or we could use a data generation step to generate new data with GPT-4 in the same distribution to detect data contamination following Wei et al. (2023). The modular approach allows researchers to easily add new evaluation methods or modify existing ones without disrupting the overall structure of the framework. By defining each evaluator as a self-contained unit, FreeEval promotes code reusability and maintainability.</p>
<p>This configuration-driven approach eliminates the need for users to write Python code when defining and running an evaluation pipeline. All settings and parameters for each step and dataset are specified within the config, making the evaluation process highly customizable and accessible to researchers with varying levels of programming expertise. Figure 2 shows an example config for a pipeline evaluating LLaMA-2 70B (Touvron et al., 2023b) on ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018) dataset with a fixed seed for sampling 25 shot examples and custom prompt. The model can be deployed locally or on a remote machine. The pipeline also include detecting data contamination with Min-K\% Prob (Shi et al., 2023).</p>
<h3>3.4 Trustworthy Evaluation</h3>
<p>FreeEval prioritizes trustworthiness and fairness in evaluations by incorporating a range of metaevaluation modules that validates the evaluation results and processes. As human preference remain the gold standard for measuring the effectiveness of evaluation protocols, FreeEval model human preference into two types: pairwise comparison and direct scoring. We incorporate existing meta-evaluation datasets from PandaLM (Wang et al., 2023c), MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023b), LLMBar (Guo et al., 2023), AlpacaEval (Li et al., 2023b), and provide a user-friendly interface for annotating and curating human evaluation datasets.</p>
<p>To ensure the trustworthiness of the evaluation results, we also implement data contamination detection methods, as introduced in subsection 2.2, into our toolkit as steps. Understanding whether the tested dataset appear in the training phase of the evaluated models would help users assess the validity and reliability of evaluation results. We also provide bias evaluation modules and visualization tools specifically for LLM-based evaluators, as previous studies have reported they exhibit position bias and length bias (Zheng et al., 2023b;</p>

<h3>3.5 Efficient Inference Backends</h3>
<p>FreeEval's high-performance inference backends are designed to efficiently handle the computational demands of large-scale LLM evaluations.</p>
<p>The inference backends in FreeEval support both open-source models and proprietary models with APIs. For all models, FreeEval support concurrent inference given a fixed number of workers. We implement a caching mechanism for queries based on hash values of the request. We hash the request prompt and inference config, and store locally the request content and response for each individual request. By checking the cache before making a query, FreeEval skips cached requests, enabling quick recovery from exceptions and saving inference costs. This is particularly beneficial when implementing and debugging new evaluation methods. Caching also ensures reproducibility, as all requests, settings, and responses are saved and can</p>
<p>from freeeval.models import load_inference_function

openai_inference = load_inference_function("openai")
huggingface_inference = load_inference_function("remote_hf")

}

be inspected using FreeEval's visualization tools.
For open-source models, we leverage Huggingface's text-generation-inference (TGI, Contributors (2023a)) package which is a productionready high-performance inference toolkit. We implement a load-balancing technique in conjunction with the continuous batching feature provided by TGI to maximize GPU utilization on multi-node multi-GPU clusters. For proprietary models, we have a rate-limiting mechanism to avoid causing too much stress on API providers.</p>
<p>We evaluate FreeEval's performance by comparing the execution times (excluding downloading times) for llama-2-7b-chat-hf model on 3 common datasets using different toolkits. Our experiments are done on the same Ubuntu machine with a single NVIDIA A800 80GB PCIe GPU. As shown in Table 3, even on a single GPU, FreeEval exhibit significant advantage on all benchmark datasets.</p>
<p>The inference backends in FreeEval are designed to seamlessly integrate with the evaluation methods of the framework. As illustrated in Figure 3, initializing the inference backends and running parallel inference is straightforward and user-friendly. This simplicity allows developers of new evaluation methods to focus on prompting or interactions between models, using the backends sequentially. As a result, implementing interactive evaluation methods, such as those proposed by Li et al. (2023a); Chan et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2024), becomes much easier and more accessible to researchers.</p>
