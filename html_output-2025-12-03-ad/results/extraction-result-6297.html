                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Neuronal loss correlates with but exceeds neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> To assess the relationship between dementia, neuronal loss, and neuropathological findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we counted the number of neurons, senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in a high‐order association cortex. We studied the superior temporal sulcus of 34 individuals with AD and 17 nondemented control subjects, using statistically unbiased, stereological counting techniques. The number of superior temporal sulcus neurons in nondemented control subjects was stable across the sixth to ninth decades. In AD, more than 50% of the neurons were lost. Both neuronal loss and neurofibrillary tangles increased in parallel with the duration and severity of illness, but the amount of neuronal loss exceeded by manyfold the amount of neurofibrillary tangles accumulated. In contrast to the correlation between neurofibrillary tangels and neuronal loss, the number of senile plaques and the percentage of the superior temporal sulcus that was covered by Aβ (amyloid burden) were not related to neuronal loss, number of neurofibrillary tangles, or duration of disease. Neither the amount nor the rate of neuronal loss in the superior temporal sulcus in AD correlated with apolipoprotein E genotype. These data suggest that neuronal loss in association areas such as the superior temporal sulcus contributes directly to cognitive impairment in AD.</p>

Neurond Loss Correlates with but Exceeds Newofibriiary T a n g l e s in Alzheimer's Disease
Received Apr 12, 1996, and in revised form Jul 5. Accepted for publication Jul 10, 1996.Address correspondence to Dr Hyman, Neurology Service, 149 13th Street, Room 6405, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charles-town, MA 02123.
To assess the relationship between dementia, neuronal loss, and neuropathological findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we counted the number of neurons, senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in a high-order association cortex. We studied the superior temporal sulcus of 34 individuals with AD and 17 nondemented control subjects, using statistically unbiased, stereological counting techniques. The number of superior temporal sulcus neurons in nondemented control subjects was stable across the sixth to ninth decades. In AD, more than 50% of the neurons were lost. Both neuronal loss and neurofibrillary tangles increased in parallel with the duration and severity of illness, but the amount of neuronal loss exceeded by manyfold the amount of neurofibrillary tangles accumulated. In contrast to the correlation between neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss, the number of senile plaques and the percentage of the superior temporal sulcus that was covered by AP (amyloid burden) were not related to neuronal loss, number of neurofibrillary tangles, or duration of disease. Neither the amount nor the rate of neuronal loss in the superior temporal sulcus in AD correlated with apolipoprotein E genotype. These data suggest that neuronal loss in association areas such as the superior temporal sulcus contributes directly to cognitive impairment in AD. loss correlates with but exceeds neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease. Ann Neurol 1997;4 1 : 17-24Neuropathological study of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain highlights the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and senile plaques (SPs), as well as the loss of neurons and synapses. NFTs occur primarily in projection neurons of limbic and association cortices and it is believed that their presence disrupts the flow of information along axons linking association cortices and the limbic cortical areas in the medial temporal lobe [I-71. NFTs specifically affect neurons in layers 11, 111, and V in association cortex, corresponding to feedforward and feedback projections [3, 8, 31. SPs have a broader and more varied distribution than NFTs. Although they affect association cortices, SPs may be present in primary motor and sensory cortices that remain clinically silent, even at the very late stages of the disease [3, 51. Previous studies suggested that the number of SPs in the cerebral cortex tends to remain stable independently of duration of illness, while the number of NFTs correlates more closely with the severity of dementia [5, 7,. From this perspective, the presence of NFTs qualitatively and quantitatively matches the clinical deficits of the disease better than the number or distribution of SPs.By contrast to NFTs and SPs, neuronal loss, as a negative phenomenon, cannot be easily quantitated but only calculated from normative data on age-matched control populations. Moreover, the cause of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative processes is unknown, and there are no biochemical markers to examine neurons at risk for death. As a consequence, no topographic map has been established to evaluate whether or not there are consistent patterns of neuronal loss. Therefore, our first goal was to determine whether neuronal loss correlates with NFTs or SPs.Recent studies suggested that inheritance of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ~4 gene is a risk factor for AD [13, 141. Therefore, our second goal was to test the hypothesis that APOE4 is associated with faster or a greater extent of neuronal loss. The recent application of stereological counting techniques for counting neurons has provided a powerful tool to address these questions, overcoming the problems of correcting for cortical atrophy and adjusting appropriately for cell shrinkage and different sizes of cells that lead to potential errors in traditional two-dimensional counting schemes [ 15, 161.   We chose to study the region that configures the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for several reasons. First, it is a high-order association cortex that receives input from multiple modalities. It is one of only three From the</p>

Moreover, the cause of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative processes is unknown, and there are no biochemical markers to examine neurons at risk for death. As a consequence, no topographic map has been established to evaluate whether or not there are consistent patterns of neuronal loss. Therefore, our first goal was to determine whether neuronal loss correlates with NFTs or SPs.</p>
<p>Recent studies suggested that inheritance of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ~4 gene is a risk factor for AD [13, 141. Therefore, our second goal was to test the hypothesis that APOE4 is associated with faster or a greater extent of neuronal loss. The recent application of stereological counting techniques for counting neurons has provided a powerful tool to address these questions, overcoming the problems of correcting for cortical atrophy and adjusting appropriately for cell shrinkage and different sizes of cells that lead to potential errors in traditional two-dimensional counting schemes [ 15, 161. We chose to study the region that configures the superior temporal sulcus (STS) for several reasons. First, it is a high-order association cortex that receives input from multiple modalities. It is one of only three association areas i n the nonhuman primate brain that receives input from each sensory modality [G, 171. Second, it is well demarcated anatomically a n d shows little brain-to-brain variability, making the task of defining a region of interest in different brains easier. Third, it is known to be consistently affected by both NFTs and SPs in AD [3, 5, 12, 181.</p>

<p>Patient Selection</p>
<p>The 34 cases of AD selected for study met the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: The patients had been exam- ). T o test whether neuropathological changes and neuronal loss were correlated with severity of dementia, we charted measures of cognitive impairment derived from the information, memory, and concentration (ICM) subtest of the Blessed Dementia Scale (BDS) [20]. BDS scores within 18 months before death were available for 9 patients. There were 17 control subjects with an age range (sixth decade to the tenth decade) chat matched that of the AD group. Of the 17 control brains, 14 were from the Massachusetts Alzheimer's Disease Research Center brain bank. These control subjects were believed to be cognitively normal based on retrospective clinical assessment using previously published criteria 1211. Three control brains and 1 AD brain were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center. All 4 of these subjects had participated in several community-based studies on cognitive function [22-251 and all had been examined clinically within 1 year of death. None of the control brains met neuropathological criteria for AD [ 191. Tissue Processing All brains were fixed in 10% buffered formalin or 4% paraformaldehyde, within 24 hours after death. Two to 7 days later, blocks were placed in a cryoprotection solution containing 4% buffered formalin, 10%) glycerol, and 10% sucrose. We alternated between using right and left hemispheres of the AD brains, freezing the other half for biochemical assays. Fifty-micrometer-thick sections were obtained from blocks containing the STS region by using a freezing sledge microtome. Sections were stained using the Nissl procedure to determine neuronal counts, monoclonal antibodies against paired helical filaments (PHF-1, courtesy of Dr Peter Davies, Bronx, New York) to count NFTs, and P-amyloid (10D5, courtesy of Dr Dale Schenk, Athena Neurosciences, South Sail Francisco, CA) to count SPs. Quantitation was previously described [ l o , 121. Sections were pretreated with 70% formic acid for 10 minutes for AP </p>
<p>Quantitation of Neurons, Neurojbrillary Tangles, and Senile Plaques</p>
<p>Counts were performed following the stereological optical dissector procedure described by West [16]. Data were recorded by a Bioquant Image Analysis System (Nashville, TN). The region counted was located in the inferior bank of the STS, approximarely 1 cm medial to the crown of the gyrus (Fig 1). Volume density was assessed in an area 700 p m wide by the full width of the cortex. The entire width of the cortex in each STS region was sampled to avoid the possibility of a relative overrepresentation of the more densely packed lamina, layers I1 and IV, in AD brains. The total number of STS neurons per section was calculated for each brain by multiplying the volume density obtained from the optical dissector counts by volume of STS measured on each cross section ("reference volume"). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that this estimate was equivalent to counting five 150-pm-wide strips spaced equally throughout the inferior lip, depth, and superior lip of the STS. This estimate of neuronal number accounts for shrinkage in the width of the cortex but might underestimate loss in AD because atrophy in the anterior-posterior direction is not accounted for. Ideally, one would measure the anterior-posterior direction length of the STS in each brain and derive an estimate of total number. Unfortunately, both the anterior and posterior boundaries of the STS are somewhat variable in humans, making this approach untenable. Therefore, we chose the conservative approach of counting neurons at a single well-described level. Approximately 1,000 neurons in each brain were counted, and the percent of neuronal loss in AD brains was calculated by subtracting the number of neurons in an individual AD brain from the average number obtained in the control group. immunostaining. Pdeuronal density in the STS was 28% less than that in control brains. The values represent the average 5 standard error.

N F T counts were obtained using the same stereological methods and following identical sampling schemes, but using I'HF-1 immunostaining [26] in adjacent sections to identify both intraneuronal and extraneuronal NFTs. The percentage of cortex covered by SPs (burden amyloid) were assessed in the same region by using an anti-AP monoclonal antibody, 10D5 [27]. The video images were captured and an optical density threshold able to discriminate the immunostaining was obtained. In each field manual editing eliminated artificts and the staining associated with blood vessels. The number of SPs and the percentage of cortex covered by plaques were calculated.</p>
<p>APOE genotypes were carried out as previously described [14]. APOE genotype, N F T number, and amyloid burden for many of these cases have been reported elsewhere [I21 and are included here for comparison to neuronal counts.</p>
<p>Statistical Analysis</p>
<p>A linear regression analysis was used to compare neuron number in the STS between AD and control brains and to correlate neuron number with duration of illness and number of NFTs and SPs in AD brains. The total number of neurons, neuronal density, and volume of STS between the AD and the control group were compared by the t test at p &lt; 0.05 level.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The average values for reference volumes, total number of neurons and NFTs, and amyloid burden per 50lm-thick section estimated in the STS of AD and control groups are shown in Table 1. The number of neurons in the STS volume assessed in the control brains remained unchanged over the four decades sampled. The absolute number of neurons per cross section in this group ranged from 8.02 X l o 4 to 11.44 X lo4, with an average value of 9.70 * 0.87 X lo4 (Fig 2). No significant differences were observed even between the subjects at the extremes of the ages analyzed. Among the oldest subjects were the 3 from the Mayo Clinic Patient Registry (ages 80, 80, and 84) who had had normal findings on neurological and neuropsychological evaluations prior to death.</p>
<p>The total number of STS neurons was reduced by 53% in AD brains when compared to control brains (4.57 +-1.77 X l o 4 vs 9.70 +-0.87 X lo4, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) (Fig 3). The amount of neuronal loss in AD brains was correlared strongly with the duration of illness ( Y = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001), ranging from no measurable loss in the patients with clinical symptoms for the shortest duration (1 year) to more than 75% reduction of STS neurons in several with more advanced AD (Fig 4A). In the 9 AD patients with a BDS score obtained within 18 months before death, neuronal loss had in addition a strong correlation with severity of cognitive impairment ( r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.02) ( Fig 4B). The loss of neurons in the AD group was accompanied by a reduction of the volume of the region, which was estimated at 38% compared to the non-AD brains  'The comparison of rate of neuronal loss in AD brains among different genotypes showed no statistically significant differences. The infrequent cases with genotypes 2/3 (n = 1) and 2 / 4 (n = 1) were excluded in these analyses.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Clarifying  [35]. There is overall consensus, however, that neuronal loss occurs selectively in vulnerable areas of AD brains when compared to age-matched normal specimens 1341. There is more controversy than consensus regarding the issue of neuronal depletion as a common concomitant of aging not associated with cognitive decline 130, 31,[35][36][37]. Our findings clearly address this question in the STS: Across the four decades of life assessed in this study there was no measurable neuronal loss in the STS region. The total number of neurons estimated per cross section was stable across age in nondemented subjects. This finding coincides with our previous report of neuronal stability in the entorhinal cortex of nondemented individuals of about the same age range [38], and supports the conclusion that neuronal loss in these regions is not inevitable in normal aging. Even though the complexity of the human brain does not allow us to extrapolate these findings to every brain region, we believe that these data support the notion that a dramatic loss of cortical neurons does not occur in normal healthy elderly subjects.</p>
<p>Assuming that individuals who ultimately develop AD start with about the same number of neurons as those who do not, out analysis of neuronal counts in the STS of AD brains reveals that more than half of the original STS neuronal population is lost during the course of the disease. This concurs with other reports of major neuronal losses in specific cell populations of the limbic and association cortices in AD [12, 16,391. A single report [40] failed to find neuronal loss in AD, but did not directly examine limbic and association regions that are known to be selectively affected by AD.</p>
<p>Neuronal loss in the STS region is not apparent early in the disease process, despite the presence of many SPs and occasional NFTs. This result contrasts with our observation that there is marked (&gt;50%) loss of layer I1 entorhinal cortex neurons in AD individuals wit$ very mild cognitive impairment [38]. These observations support the hypothesis that there is a topographical hierarchy of neuronal loss that closely parallels that described for the development of NFTs. These data are consistent with the idea that memory loss (usually impairment of delayed recall), which is often the earliest symptom in AD, stems from neuronal depopulation in the entorhinal cortex and other medial temporal lobe structures. During this early stage of dementia, association cortices are relatively preserved in terms of neuronal numbers. As the clinical illness evolves from barely detectable memory loss to widespread cognitive failure with language impairment, there is a progressive loss of STS neurons. The strong correlation between neuronal loss in the STS and severity of cognitive impairment assessed by the BDS (see Fig 4B) supports this observation.</p>
<p>From a theoretical standpoint, loss of neurons and the anatomical connections that make the STS a highorder association cortex would contribute to AD dementia. There is substantial evidence from experimental studies that lesions in the STS would be expected to impair complex cognitive processes. Based on anatomical studies, the polysensory nature of the STS region is well known [41-431. The STS receives connections from auditory, somatosensory, and visual association areas [41,441. Along these lines, single cell recordings in macaque brain have shown that a population of cells located in the STS is involved in visual processing concerned with faces, with separate functional subsystems sensitive to face and head orientation, eye gaze direction, facial expression, and facial identity [45, 461. The dramatic neuronal loss found here in the STS of AD brains could underly similar damage in visual and auditory processing systems during the course of the disease.</p>
<p>The contribution of NFT and AP deposits to neuronal loss and to the clinical evolution of AD remains controversial. Early studies emphasized a prime role of amyloid accumulation in the progression and severity of dementia [20,[47][48][49]. Other studies, including our own, found a closer correlation between NFT accumulation and clinical evolution of the disease than with amyloid [5, 7, 10, 11, 50, 511. Based on our previous observations, we had anticipated that the correlation between the magnitude of neuronal loss and the degree of neuropathological changes in AD may be better for NFTs than SPs. The data confirmed our prediction: The number of NFTs in the STS of AD brains increased in close relation with the number of neurons lost and with the progression of dementia. However, when absolute numbers of neurons and NFTs ate compared, neuronal loss in the STS exceeded by far the number of NFTs. Taking into account the fact that the majority of NFTs in the STS (&gt;90%) are intracellular, only about 1 to 2% of neuronal loss in the STS can be attributed to neurons for which an extracellular "tombstone" remains. This observation suggests one of two possibilities: (1) NFTs might be formed, be involved in the death of neurons, and then be cleared leaving no trace; or (2) the majority of neuronal loss in advanced AD occurs through a non-NFT mechanism. The first possibility cannot be excluded, but the relatively insoluble nature of NFTs qualifies them more as permanent markers of neuronal loss than as indices of a transient stage in cell death. The second possibility suggests that stereological techniques demonstrate an underappreciated alteration in AD brain than numerically is of substantially greater impact than NFTs. The observations of a laminar disparity between N F T distribution and losses of large projection neurons in visual cortices of AD brains [9], and earlier observations by Terry and colleagues [52] support this view.</p>
<p>By contrast with the parallel between neuronal loss and N F T development, AP deposition does not correlate with neuronal loss, number of NFTs, or duration or severity of illness. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that the number of AP deposits remains stable despite progression of dementia [5, 10-121. Our data do not rule out the possibility that there is a relationship between neuronal loss and specific subsets of SPs (e.g., neuritic plaques, cored plaques, or SPs containing specific forms of A@), but argue against a local direct toxic effect of AD on neurons.</p>
<p>APOE genotype influences the clinical and neuropathological phenotype of AD [12, 14, 531. APOE4 is associated with increased AP deposition [14] but has no effect on rate of NFT accumulation [la]. Recent data suggest that APOES (more than APOE4) might have a trophic effect on neurons by supporting neurite outgrowth [54, 551. In this context, APOE genotype --. _ was correlated with the magnitude of neuronal loss, but no differences in rates of neuronal loss among genotype groups were found. This finding is internally consistent with previous studies [12, 561 showing that APOE genotype does not influence rates of cognitive decline in AD.</p>

A few scattered SPs in the STS were observed in two of the control brains. The amyloid burden in these latter brains was less than 1%.

<p>the relationship among loss of neurons, development of NFTs and SPs, and measures of dementia is a central goal in defining the pathophysiological basis of AD. The results of this study support four main conclusions: (I) In nondemented individuals, the number of neurons in the STS region remains stable between the sixth and tenth decades of life. (2) In AD, neuronal loss is dramatic in the STS and parallels the chronological evolution of dementia. (3) NFT formation correlates significantly with duration of illness and with number of neurons lost in the STS, but the amount of neuronal loss in the STS is severalfold greater than the number of NFTs. (4) Amyloid deposition does not correlate with neuronal loss, NFT formation, or severity of illness. Each of these points is discussed in turn. Studies on neuronal loss in different neurodegenerative diseases and the aging process first began a hun-dred years ago [28, 291. More recently, studies have been directed at assessing the occurrence, extent, topographical distribution, and role of neuronal loss in AD and normal aging [30-351. Unfortunately, data from these studies are frequently contradictory and difficult to compare, because the populations selected and the sampling schemes and counting techniques used varied widely</p>
