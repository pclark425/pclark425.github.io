                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Spatial reasoning based on natural language expressions is essential for everyday human tasks. This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p>

Spatial reasoning based on natural language expressions is essential for everyday human tasks.This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner.However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions.This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability.To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering.Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains.We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks.Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Spatial language conveys information about the location and translocation of objects/entities in space.Reasoning over spatial language is required for natural language processing systems to answer "Where" questions and identify the relative spatial relations between objects explained in the text, such as left and right.Figure 1, demonstrates a spatial language comprehension and questionanswering problem.Understanding spatial language turns out to be crucial for many AI applications, including question-answering systems, grounding language into visual modality (Zhang et al., 2021;Zhang and Kordjamshidi, 2022;Liu et al., 2023), navigating robots (Sisbot et al., 2007;Yadollahi et al., 2023) and even in more specific</p>
<p>SpartQA-Human</p>
<p>Context: There are three blocks called A, B, and C. A is to the left of B and B is to the left of C. In A, there is a small yellow square near and to the left of a large yellow circle.The large circle is near and to the left of a large blue triangle.In B, there is a small yellow square near and below a large blue triangle.There is a medium black triangle near and above the large blue triangle.In C, there is a small black square far to the left and above a small blue circle.The blue circle is near and to the left of a large yellow square.YN Question: Is the small black thing to the right of medium black thing?Answer: Yes FR Question: What is the position of small black thing relative to medium black thing?Answer: Right ReSQ Context: A tourist group is visiting a school.The school kids are sitting at their desks, singing a song and clapping their hands, with their teacher clapping as well.Six of the tourists are standing behind them and are watching them, one tourist is taking a photo.YN Question: Are the tourists in the school?Answer: Yes  fields such as medical domain (Atif et al., 2007;Datta et al., 2020;Gong et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Despite the high performance of Large Language models (LLMs) in many NLP and vision problems (Brown et al., 2020;OpenAI, 2023), recent studies highlight the shortcomings in complex spatial reasoning over text (Bang et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2023;Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2023;Liu et al., 2023;Chen et al., 2024).This paper focuses on complex, that is, multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.However, our research findings can advance complex reasoning over text in general.Our main idea is to exploit spatial logical rules of reasoning in training language models.</p>
<p>Explicit logic, in combination with LLMs, has been used in some related works.In particular, Yang et al. 2023 integrated explicit symbolic reasoning with LLMs in a pipeline.The LLMs map natural language to symbolic representation, and this formal representation is passed to an Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver to conduct logical reasoning.Similarly, Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi 2023 passed formal representations obtained from LLMs to Prolog to conduct logical reasoning and answer spatial questions.These approaches rely on external reasoning tools and require accurate formal representations generated at inference time.Obtaining such formal representations for realistic domain natural language is hard and, as shown in (Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2023), limits their effectiveness only to synthetic benchmarks.</p>
<p>Here, we aim to address the limitations of utilizing spatial logic in realistic domains.In our proposed technique, we fine-tune language models using spatial logical rules to guide them in capturing the level of abstraction needed for general spatial reasoning.In particular, we train the models to minimize both cross-entropy loss and violation from logical constraints.We hypothesize that incorporating logical knowledge as a source of supervision, even using synthetic data, enriches the models' abstract reasoning over spatial concepts, further enhancing their generalizability.A key advantage of our approach is that it does not require full coverage of logical knowledge.Any partially available logical knowledge can be utilized during training.Additionally, formal knowledge representation is not needed at inference time, which is crucial because generating formal representations during inference is a challenging task in itself.Our technique also avoids reliance on external reasoning tools, which can add computational complexity in real-time applications.</p>
<p>We use the available three benchmarks for spatial question answering, SpartQA-Human (Mirzaee et al., 2021), ReSQ (Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2022), and StepGame (Shi et al., 2022) to evaluate our proposed method.Our improved results confirm our hypothesis about the impact of neurosymbolic training on generalizability.The contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows1 , (1) We exploit the available logical spatial knowledge in tuning language models to improve their spatial reasoning.(2) We provide extensive experimental results and analysis on the existing benchmarks.Our results consistently confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in both encoderbased and generative language models and their generalizability for transferring knowledge to different domains; (3) We show that tuning smaller models with our proposed method generalizes better on out-of-domain and complex reasoning compared to using prompt-engineered, very large language models.</p>
<p>Investigating the reasoning capability of NLP models has become an important research topic given the instability in the performance of LLMs (Gendron et al., 2024;Valmeekam et al., 2022;Feng et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024;Bang et al., 2023).Typically, this ability is assessed through questionanswering (QA) benchmarks (Weston et al., 2016;Zhou et al., 2020;Tan et al., 2023).However, fewer studies are focused on spatial reasoning over text.Recent benchmarks, such as SpaRTUN (Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2022) and StepGame (Shi et al., 2022;Li et al., 2024), have been developed to address this issue by providing comprehensive evaluation resources for spatial question answering.The current results using the existing benchmarks indicate that LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning over text, even on synthetic datasets (Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2022;Yang et al., 2023;Bang et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Several works have attempted to improve LLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi 2022 fine-tunes LLMs with synthetic data, which improves their multi-hop reasoning abilities, even when applied to realistic domains.Another approach in (Shi et al., 2022) designed a specialized memory network based on a recurrent neural network for deep reasoning tasks, but it was less effective than tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs).Some papers focus on enhancing spatial reasoning by in-context learning.For instance, Sharma 2023 proposed a prompting technique that decomposes the target spatial question into simpler questions and infers the answer to the final query based on the information gained from them.Another approach, proposed by Hu et al. 2024, replaced textual explanations in the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by symbolic representations.While this method improved spatial understanding in simple environments, it was less applicable to diverse and complex spatial relations settings.Lastly, some studies employ neuro-symbolic modeling that involves LLMs in the pipeline (Yang et al., 2023;Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2023).These approaches extract relations and obtain formal representations using LLMs.Then, the formal representation is passed to an external solver that includes engineered rules of reasoning to conduct logical reasoning and answer spatial questions.While this method significantly improved multihop reasoning, it required formal representations at inference time, which posed a challenge.Furthermore, formalizing commonsense reasoning is difficult, if not impossible, for realistic domains.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous studies, we exploit available spatial logical knowledge as a set of constraints in fine-tuning language models.Compared to hard pipelines, this approach has the advantage that logical knowledge does not need to be complete and cover all possible situations.Our approach utilizes synthetic data and logical representations during training only.Numerous research studies have highlighted the utility of logical knowledge in solving question-answering tasks.For instance, Prager et al. 2004 demonstrates that answering sets of questions jointly using their logical relationships enhances the performance in reasoning tasks.Amizadeh et al. 2020 directly used the logical formalization of the question as input to the model to improve the logical reasoning of vision and language models.Sun et al. 2022 proposed framework with two main components.The first component is for encoding logical knowledge, and the second is for entailment of that knowledge.Lastly, Kamali et al. 2024 proposed a framework that integrates logical reasoning with generalizable grounding interpretation to enhance both grounding and reasoning in vision and language models.</p>
<p>Utilizing logical knowledge has been proven effective in solving many other NLP problems.For example, Lu et al. 2022 uses a heuristic function inspired by the A* algorithm to restrict the output of generative language models with a set of constraints, while Qin et al. 2022 uses a sampling method looking for the most optimal solution that satisfies the constraints.Both of these techniques apply the constraints during inference, which differs from our proposed method for using them during the training.Lastly, Rajaby Faghihi et al. 2023 provided a benchmark to evaluate the benefits of logical constraints in several NLP problems under the DomiKnowS framework (Rajaby Faghihi et al., 2021).In this paper, we propose a novel approach for formulating spatial reasoning knowledge as logical constraints and exploit the existing techniques for the actual integration.We utilize constraints solely during training, eliminating the need for access to logical constraints during inference where using them might be problematic for realistic domains and real-time applications.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Problem Definition</p>
<p>For the spatial QA task, the input includes a textual context C that describes a scene and a question Q about the spatial relations between objects in the scene.The output is the answer(s) to the question, denoted as A. There are two types of questions/answers: Yes/No (YN) and find-relation (FR).The answer domain is restricted to A = {Y es, N o} for YN questions.The answers to FR questions depend on the dataset and the types of relations covered.For example, the answer domain for FR can be A = {lef t, right, above, below,. . .}.</p>
<p>Backbone Language Models</p>
<p>We use both encoder-based models from the BERT family (Devlin et al., 2019) as well as generative models like Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2024) to assess the effectiveness of our proposed fine-tuning approach.We used other LLMs, such as GPT family and Llama3-8B, as comparison baselines without fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Encoder-based Language Models</p>
<p>We utilize BERT as the backbone architecture to consistently build on top of previous results in Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi (2022).We fine-tune BERT by adding classification layers for QA tasks.We employ a binary classification layer for the YN domain while using multiple binary classification layers for the FR domain.The motivation behind using multiple binary classification layers instead of one multi-label classification layer is that one question can have multiple labels as responses.The number of binary classification layers in the FR domain depends on the number of possible answers, |A|, in the problem setting.The input to the BERT model is constructed by concatenating the question, Q, separator token, [SEP ], and the context C.After feeding the input to BERT, we use the [CLS] token from the last layer as the input to the classification layer(s) for final answer prediction.</p>
<p>Generative Language Models</p>
<p>We select Flan-T5 (Chung et al., 2024) as the opensource generative baseline for fine-tuning.In the YN setting, processing the output is straightforward, as the first token can represent the response directly generated by the model.We compare the probability of the Yes and No tokens and select the one with the highest probability as the answer.Obtaining consistency constraints from spatial logical rules and answers inferred from questions generated using intermediate facts in Q-Chain.3. Incorporating obtained consistency constraints into the loss function using differentiable soft logic during tuning.For more details, refer to Section 3.3.</p>
<p>However, this approach is not feasible in the FR setting due to the multi-label questions requiring multiple answers.The input prompt to the Flan-T5 model is structured as follows: "Answer based on the context: C Q."</p>
<p>For In-context Learning, we select Llama3-8B (AI@Meta, 2024), GPT3.5 (Brown et al., 2020), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) as the baseline LLMs using Zero-shot, and Few-shot settings.Zero-shot.We prompt the LLMs to provide answers based on the scene description and the question without including any examples.Few-shot.We randomly sample four pairs of questions and answers from the training dataset and concatenate them to the context and target question to form the few-shot setting.</p>

<p>To address the challenge of multi-hop spatial reasoning, we employ symbolic knowledge during training.We assume a formal knowledge base (KB) of rules, referred to as spatial logic, is given during training time.This spatial logic does not need to be exhaustive or cover all reasoning aspects; any available knowledge can be used to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the language model.This work uses 79 reasoning rules taken from Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi (2022).These rules are divided into four categories: converse, inverse, transitive, and transitive + topological.The KB covers rules between 15 spatial relations, including directional and topological relations, such as "If x is above y, then y below x." denoted formally as Above(x, y) ⇒ Below(y, x).</p>
<p>Our main hypothesis is that supervision from high-level logical knowledge allows the model to capture more abstract patterns, thereby improving generalization to other domains.To exploit the spatial logic in the training phase, we follow three steps: (1) Creating the chain of reasoning for each training example.(2) Obtaining consistency constraints from the chain of reasoning.(3) Incorporating constraints in the loss function.Please note that we will need the reasoning chain annotations for fine-tuning with spatial logic.SpaRTUN is the only synthetic dataset that provides such annotated formal representations, making it a suitable source of supervision for our tuning purpose.Creating example-specific rules.We exploit Spatial Logic by automatically augmenting each training example with a chain of questions, denoted as Q-Chain.This process is illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<p>We infer the answer to the final query from the input context using the logical resolution tree, which outlines the logical steps for implication.Our synthetic training data (i.e., SpaRTUN) provides logi-cal representations of the initial facts expressed in the context.We build the resolution tree using the forward chaining algorithm to infer a specific target fact given a set of initial facts.In our example, the initial facts are "The white is above the orange", denoted as q 1 , and "The red is above the white", denoted as q 2 .The target fact is "The orange below the red," denoted as t.The forward chaining approach is a reasoning method that starts with the initial facts in the knowledge base.It performs an exhaustive search for all applicable inference rules and applies them to the current facts to iteratively infer new ones until the target fact is reached or no new facts are inferred (Nickerson, 1994).In the example of Figure 2, we apply the spatial converse rules to the initial fact q 1 and q 2 .This approach yields the intermediate inferred facts, q 3 , "The orange is below the white," from q 1 , and q 4 , "The white is below the red," from q 2 .Finally, we search for the applicable spatial rule to combine q 3 and q 4 , resulting in the target fact, t, "The orange is below the red."Obtaining consistency constraints.In this step, we obtain a set of consistency constraints based on the given resolution tree.We denote the truth value of a fact q i in the Q-Chain as T ruth(q i ), which will be True if the fact is True and otherwise is False.We create a consistency constraint for each step of the Q-Chain.For example, in Figure 2, step R 1 is applied to q 1 to infer q 3 .This step implies that the T ruth(q 1 ) should be consistent with the T ruth(q 3 ).In other words, q 1 , "white above orange," implies q 3 : "orange below white,".The corresponding formal constraint for this example will be T ruth(q 1 ) ⇒ T ruth(q 3 ).Incorporating Constraints.Our fine-tuning objective is to minimize the violation from the set of logical consistency constraints given for each training example.However, the logical expressions are not differentiable.To form a differentiable loss function, we use a soft logical surrogate of the constraints in the loss.There are various types of conversions for mapping logical constraints into differentiable soft logic, including t-norm Product, t-norm Łukasiewicz, and t-norm Gödel (Li et al., 2019).We use the t-norm Product to convert, which means, ¬A becomes 1 − a, A ∧ B becomes ab, A ∨ B becomes a + b − ab, and A ⇒ B becomes min(1, b a ), where A and B are concepts with probabilities a and b respectively.During the training, the probability of the truth of the facts (T ruth(q i )) involved in the constraints is obtained from the model prediction for computing the loss.We build on previous studies of optimizing an objective that combines the task performance and soft constraints (Li et al., 2019;Asai and Hajishirzi, 2020;Bamas et al., 2020) and form the following objective,
∇ w L(w) = ∇ w L(w) + K k=1 λ k ∇ w h k (w), (1)
where L(w) is the task-performance loss function, i.e., Cross-Entropy loss, K is the number of logical constraints related to the current Q-Chain, h k measures the violation from a given logical constraint in soft logic differentiable form, and λ k is a learning parameter indicating the importance of obeying k th rule.We set the λ k to 1 for all constraints to ensure equal importance.</p>
<p>In fact, in this work, we utilize the implementation in the DomiKnowS framework (Rajaby Faghihi et al., 2021) to integrate the logical constraints.This framework provides a declarative language for incorporating symbolic knowledge as logical constraints.We present the original logical forms in the program, and DomiKnowS automatically converts them into a differentiable form for inclusion in the loss function.We employ an optimization technique referred to as the Primal-Dual (PD) program that uses a dual formulation of the original objective (Bamas et al., 2020) for fine-tuning.Programming for building a model in DomiKnowS requires defining a graph of concepts and relationships, along with logical rules between concepts.The program for our problem setting is provided in Appendix E.</p>
<p>In-context Learning with Spatial Logic</p>
<p>We design a set of experiments to analyze and compare the LLMs' performance against our proposed fine-tuning method.We utilize spatial logical reasoning to manually create the rationale of few-shot examples for our in-context learning settings, including Chain-of-Thoughts (Wei et al., 2022), Logical Representation, and Chain-of-Symbols (Hu et al., 2024).Chain-of-Thought (CoT).To enable CoT, we provide instructions that require an explanation before answering the question.For each example response, we include a manually crafted rationale based on spatial logical rules.We provide these examples with instructions and target questions as input to the model to generate the answer.Multiple examples of this CoT setting are demonstrated in Appendix C.2. Logical Representation (LR).In this setting, we follow the same prompt structure as CoT but use logical representations instead of natural language.We obtain the first order logical representations (predicate-argument structures) by manually converting the CoT explanations.The predicateargument structure R(obj i , obj j ) represents the relation R between obj i and obj j , where obj i and obj j denote object i and object j, respectively.An example of the LR counterpart of the CoT phrase is in Table 1.Chain of Symbol (CoS).This symbolic representation was introduced by Hu et al. (2024).We explicitly follow the proposed process in Hu et al. (2024)  Step-by-Step Prompting.From the SpartQA-Human dataset, we observed that scene descriptions are often complex and lengthy.To deal with this issue, we introduce an additional prompting step using LLMs to break down the context before answering the question.Each generated line of context contains a simple spatial description.For example, given the original context, "There exists a big red square and a medium red square in a block called A.  Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi (2022).</p>
<p>SpartQA-Human (Ver.2) We follow the methodologies from (Mirzaee et al., 2021) to increase the size of the human annotated dataset.The objective is to enrich the SpartQA-Human with a more extensive test using diverse patterns and questions.</p>
<p>Annotators included authors and an undergraduate student who was paid as a research assistant.We extended both types of YN and FR questions.</p>
<p>ReSQ (Kordjamshidi et al., 2017;Mirzaee and Kordjamshidi, 2022) is a small realistic SQA dataset with multi-hop reasoning.The depth of reasoning is smaller than other synthetic datasets, but it usually requires commonsense knowledge to infer the answer.The annotations include the depth of reasoning denoted as k, which can be 1 or 2. The questions that required complex reasoning and commonsense knowledge are annotated as unclassified depth.12.30% of the test examples fall under the k=1 split, 23.93% fall under the k=2 split, and the rest are unclassified.This dataset only has YN questions.We use this dataset to evaluate the performance of our models in realistic domains.</p>
<p>StepGame (Shi et al., 2022) is a synthetic SQA dataset that contains a diverse set of multi-hop reasoning questions involving spatial relations, with annotated reasoning depth denoted as k .The questions in this dataset include up to 10 hops of reasoning, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of models' reasoning capability at varying depths.This dataset contains only FR questions.</p>
<p>The domain of answer is a = {lef t, right, above, below, overlap, lower-lef t, lower-right, upperlef t, upper-right}.</p>
<p>Experimental Models for Tuning</p>
<p>BERT-family.We use bert-based-uncased as the initial checkpoint, referred to as BERT.This model is only fine-tuned with the target dataset in each experiment.In some of the initial experiments we used RoBERTa as well.However, due to insignificance of the differences, we continued other model variations with BERT.The results of RoBERTa can be found in Appendix B. BERT-T.We fine-tune the model with SpaRTUN first.Then, we further fine-tune with the target dataset of each experiment.</p>
<p>BERT-T + Q-Chain.We adhere to the methodology explained in Section 3.3 to integrate logical knowledge into the BERT-T model via finetuning with constraints using the DomiKnowS framework (Rajaby Faghihi et al., 2021).Flan-T5.We follow the methodology described in Section 3.2.2.We selected the flan-t5-base in this experiment as the starting checkpoint.To reduce computational costs by decreasing the number of training parameters, we employ the LoRA adapter (Hu et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Flan-T5-T.We utilize the same setting as the Flan-T5 model.We fine-tune the model first with SpaR-TUN and then with the target dataset.</p>
<p>Flan-T5-T + Q-Chain.We integrate the logical knowledge into Flan-T5-T model using proposed method in section 3.3.The backbone is the same as the baseline model without any changes.</p>
<p>Experimental Setup.We used the same hyperparameters across all experiments.The learning rate was selected from {1e −5 , 8e −6 , 1e −6 }.For SpartQA-Human and ReSQ, the number of epochs was 100, while for StepGame, it was 30.For fine-tuning with SpaRTUN, we used 12 epochs for BERT and 8 epochs for Flan-T5.The final hyperparameters were chosen using the development set of the target dataset.In all experiments, we used Cross-Entropy Loss as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer, with the amsgrad parameter set to True.The experiments were run on 8 A6000 GPUs, requiring approximately 100 GPU hours.</p>
<p>Experimental Models for In-context</p>
<p>We evaluate the performance of three selected LLMs for in-context learning setting including GPT3.5, GPT-4, and Llama3-8B, using ReSQ and SpartQA-Human to compare with our fine-tuning approach.</p>
<p>The selected examples and prompts for each in-context learning method can be found in the Appendix C. Zero-shot.We directly ask LLMs to answer the question given the corresponding context.Few-shot.We provide LLMs with four randomly selected examples from the training data.</p>
<p>CoT.We augment the few-shot setting with reasoning explanations along with the CoT examples.</p>
<p>LR.We provide the few-shot examples with the reasoning explanation in the logical format described in Section 3.4.</p>
<p>CoS.We further alter the few-shot examples with the CoS symbolic forms explained in Section 3.4.</p>
<p>Results and Discussion</p>
<p>Realistic Domain.ReSQ serves as a realistic SQA domain.Table 2 shows that using the Q-chain is effective for both BERT and Flan-T5, with notable improvement on Flan-T5.To better understand these results, we analyzed the performance across different splits of ReSQ based on the manually annotated depth of reasoning required to answer the questions.The first two splits include questions requiring one or two hops of reasoning, denoted as k = 1 and k = 2.The unclassified split covers questions where reasoning depth is hard to determine and rely more on commonsense knowledge.An example of each case is provided in Figure 3.Our observation from Table 2 reveals that our model consistently improves performance on k = 2 but negatively impacts BERT on k = 1 and the unclassified categories.This suggests that our finetuning approach is more effective when deeper reasoning is needed but is less effective for questions requiring commonsense knowledge.On the other hand, LLMs outperform fine-tuning approaches on ReSQ, specifically in the unclassified subset.They consistently show 2-13% higher performance than Flan-T5+T+Q-chain (lines 7-13).These results indicate that one of LLMs' superior performances is due to their commonsense knowledge while our approach performs better in multi-hop reasoning.Nevertheless, we observe that logicbased fine-tuning enhances Flan-T5 more significantly than BERT on the unclassified subset.This    PLMs and LLMs is much smaller in this domain compared to the realistic domain (ReSQ).This is expected, as we concluded in the results of the realistic domain in Table 2, that LLMs are better at commonsense reasoning than complex multi-hop spatial reasoning.The hypothesis is further supported when assessing the proposed method on StepGame.As can be observed in Table 3, the finetuning method consistently demonstrates significant positive differences in all reasoning steps compared to LLMs.The struggle of GPT3 on reasoning  over StepGame is also investigated in (Yang et al., 2023).Our proposed method consistently improves by 1-4% on a higher number of reasoning hops (k=6 to k=10), similar to the observation results of ReSQ.These results confirm our primary hypothesis that our proposed method equips the models with a higher level of logical abstraction to conduct more complex logical reasoning.We provide three examples of responses from this dataset to qualitatively demonstrate the improvements in Figure 4. We also included results from GPT-3(d2) + ASP and PistaQ*, both of which demonstrate significant effectiveness in multi-hop reasoning.These models perform relation extraction to obtain a formal logical representation using LLMs, while reasoning is handled separately using external tools with engineered rules of reasoning.However, these pipelines face two key limitations.First, they require formal representations at test time, effective only on synthetic data.Second, they do not fine-tune the language models for better reasoning, relying instead on external tools.This approach contrasts with ours, which focuses on directly improving the language models' reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>In-context Learning.This section focuses only on comparing the variations of in-context learning for spatial reasoning.As shown in Table 2 and Table 4, CoT proved to be the most effective approach for spatial reasoning in both GPT and Llama.We also evaluated the impact of integrating formal representations in in-context learning, referred to as the LR approach.As evident in Table 4 (line 4), using formal representations marginally degraded performance.In most cases, utilizing natural language in the CoT proved to be more effective.Additionally, we evaluate CoS symbolic representations, finding that CoT and LR outperformed CoS using the same examples.This highlights the advantage of natural language reasoning over symbolic reasoning for in-context learning.We further applied step-bystep prompting explained in Section 3.4 to evaluate more sophisticated prompting techniques on LLMs.Table 4 shows that this technique achieves 2-5% better results than zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT using raw context.The results demonstrate that more straightforward and shorter contexts improve LLMs' spatial understanding.This is consistent with previous results on other domains and tasks (Li et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2024).Lastly, we compare open-source Llama and closed-source GPT models.Our results indicate that Llama-3 is competitive with GPT-3.5, showing only minor differences in the YN domain as shown in Table 2. Thus, we plan to prioritize open-source models in future research.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Given the importance of spatial reasoning in many real-world applications, we focus on improving this reasoning skill in language models.We equip LLMs with neuro-symbolic supervision to leverage logical knowledge during fine-tuning.This practice boosts their capability of capturing the necessary level of abstraction for spatial reasoning and enhances the generalizability for transferring knowledge across domains.Our constraint-based training technique achieves higher accuracy than other competitive Spatial Question-answering baselines across various benchmarks.Furthermore, the results indicate that our model performs better in scenarios requiring more reasoning steps.Lastly, we compare our models with state-of-the-art LLMs.Experimental comparisons show that while large LLMs like GPT3.5 perform better in commonsense reasoning, we achieve higher performance in multihop spatial question-answering with tuning comparatively smaller language models like BERT with spatial logic.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>While we improve the reasoning capability of the models, our approach by no means solves the general reasoning problem.The trustworthiness and reliability of the LLMs are still a research challenge.Our models will need GPU resources to run, which might be expensive.Our research is based on open-source data and code, and the results will be reproducible.We do not see any ethical con-cerns in our research approach or the impact of our results.Our data, being limited to the spatial reasoning domain, does not include any specific type of bias that can harm minority people belonging to any particular gender or race.user : There exist a big red square, a big red triangle, a medium red square, and a small green circle in a block called A.
