                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Surprisingly, it is discovered that state-of-the-art agents, both daily scenarios and biomedical ones, have either failed or inferior performance on the authors' benchmark.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Pursuing artificial intelligence for biomedical science, a.k.a. AI Scientist, draws increasing attention, where one common approach is to build a copilot agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, to evaluate such systems, people either rely on direct Question-Answering (QA) to the LLM itself, or in a biomedical experimental manner. How to precisely benchmark biomedical agents from an AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored. To this end, we draw inspiration from one most important abilities of scientists, understanding the literature, and introduce BioKGBench. In contrast to traditional evaluation benchmark that only focuses on factual QA, where the LLMs are known to have hallucination issues, we first disentangle"Understanding Literature"into two atomic abilities, i)"Understanding"the unstructured text from research papers by performing scientific claim verification, and ii) Ability to interact with structured Knowledge-Graph Question-Answering (KGQA) as a form of"Literature"grounding. We then formulate a novel agent task, dubbed KGCheck, using KGQA and domain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify the factual errors of existing large-scale knowledge graph databases. We collect over two thousand data for two atomic tasks and 225 high-quality annotated data for the agent task. Surprisingly, we discover that state-of-the-art agents, both daily scenarios and biomedical ones, have either failed or inferior performance on our benchmark. We then introduce a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed BKGAgent. On the widely used popular knowledge graph, we discover over 90 factual errors which provide scenarios for agents to make discoveries and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Pursuing artificial intelligence for biomedical science, a.k.a. AI Scientist, draws increasing attention, where one common approach is to build a copilot agent driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, to evaluate such systems, people either rely on direct Question-Answering (QA) to the LLM itself, or in a biomedical experimental manner. How to precisely benchmark biomedical agents from an AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored. To this end, we draw inspiration from one most important abilities of scientists, understanding the literature, and introduce BioKGBench. In contrast to traditional evaluation benchmark that only focuses on factual QA, where the LLMs are known to have hallucination issues, we first disentangle "Understanding Literature" into two atomic abilities, i) "Understanding" the unstructured text from research papers by performing scientific claim verification, and ii) Ability to interact with structured Knowledge-Graph Question-Answering (KGQA) as a form of "Literature" grounding. We then formulate a novel agent task, dubbed KGCheck, using KGQA and domain-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to identify the factual errors of existing large-scale knowledge graph databases. We collect over two thousand data for two atomic tasks and 225 high-quality annotated data for the agent task. Surprisingly, we discover that state-of-the-art agents, both daily scenarios and biomedical ones, have either failed or inferior performance on our benchmark. We then introduce a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed BKGAgent. On the widely used popular knowledge graph, we discover over 90 factual errors which provide scenarios for agents to make discoveries and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code and data are available at https://github.com/westlake-autolab/BioKGBench.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are so powerful that they facilitate nearly every aspect of daily life and work right now, even research [1, 2, 3, 4]. Observing their marvelous successes in text generation [5, 6], text summarization [7, 8], and other tasks [9, 10], along with their consistent failures such as hallucinations [11, 12], one can conclude that LLMs are powerful in certain tasks involving large-scale unstructured data like daily text or images, but relatively powerless when dealing with data-hungry scenarios. As such, researchers then construct AI agents [13, 14] assisting LLMs with external tools to extend the capabilities of LLMs. These attempts are fruitful in many fields, including autonomous computer [15], shopping web-agent [16], code developing [17], society simulation [18, 19], etc. A natural subsequent attempt is to develop AI agents to simulate scientists, aiding or even taking over the process of scientific discovery [2].</p>

<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: (Left) Previous benchmarks for domain-specific AI Agents either focus on the low-level tasks like question answering or are embedded in a complicated pipeline as a scientist copilot. (Right) We close the gap by constructing a knowledge graph checking task that consists of two atomic sub-tasks: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) and Scientific Claim Verification (SCV), to provide a better evaluation of AI Agents in biomedical science domain.</p>
<p>As in Figure 1, existing attempts can be grouped into two categories: i) to build an AI agent for a specific task, such as Question Answering (QA) in a specific domain [20]; ii) to encompass multiple AI agents to formulate a multi-agent system as the copilot of scientists, automating certain scientific activities, such as experiment result analysis [21, 22].</p>
<p>Literature review is the most critical ability that a scientist should possess [23, 24]. It does not only involve reading and memorizing, but also requires scientists to understand and critically analyze. Researchers and scientists widely spend a significant amount of time in reading recent works. To save human efforts in scientific discovery, it is necessary for AI scientists to be able to accurately understand and analyze the existing research. Many researchers have dedicated to literature understanding in AI agents [25, 26], while a systematic evaluation system is missing and even underexplored. The current finest evaluation system [25] consists of multiple-choice questions extracted from literature, which cannot fully reveal the underlying reasoning regime of an agent's success or failure, leaving no clue for future advancement nor indicating whether the agent understands the reasoning rationale or merely memorizes data patterns.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another crucial research direction is to help AI agents capture the underlying logic of literature through domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) [27, 28]. KGs store massive knowledge triples in a graph-structured format [29, 30], complementing LLMs with external knowledge while providing frameworks for interpretation and reasoning [31]. However, manually constructing such KGs is both intellectually and physically intensive. These domain-specific KGs require annotators with profound domain-specific knowledge, leading to high costs to create or maintain the knowledge graphs. As such, we observe that the existing and well-known biomedical KGs [32, 33] are not fully reliable due to outdated information. We attribute such discrepancy to the static nature of KGs, which lack mechanisms for dynamic updates to align with the evolution of external knowledge sources.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel agent evaluation benchmark BioKGBench to address both challenges simultaneously. As in Figure 1 (right), the ultimate goal of our benchmark is to verify the correctness of nodes and triples in the knowledge graph based on various information, including papers and well-maintained databases. We dub this task Knowledge Graph Checking (KGCheck). Agents need to first query the information recorded on the KGs as directed, then cross-reference this information with external literature or databases to combat hallucinations. This task evaluates the agents' capacities to both process and understand structured data (like KGs) and unstructured data (like literature). It is worth mentioning that the process of verifying knowledge within KGs closely mirrors the methodology of human scientific research, including database queries and extensive literature reviews. This similarity not only underscores the task's relevance to real-world scientific inquiry but also provides intriguing insights. Furthermore, we decompose this task into two more atomic subtasks: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) and Scientific Claim Verification (SCV), enabling a more detailed evaluation of the agents' capabilities in processing and understanding of structured and unstructured data, respectively.</p>
<p>We extensively analyze existing AI agents on our benchmark and find that none of the existing agents can accomplish our tasks without moderate adaptation. Therefore, we introduce our agent BKGAgent, the first agent framework to interact with external knowledge graphs as well as research papers. Experiments demonstrate fascinating results that our agent is capable of discovering real conflicts in the existing large-scale datasets. Within 225 professional-annotated data in Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG) [33], our agent BKGAgent successfully identified some conflicting or missing pairs. This evidence further supports the academic value of our agent by providing researchers with a tool to update their own knowledge bases, offering substantial potential in both academic and commercial markets.</p>
<h1>2 Related Work</h1>
<p>Science Agent. The swift progression of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed the widespread deployment of intelligent agents across diverse fields, notably within the science domain. Notable examples include ChemCrow [34] and Coscientist [35] in the field of chemistry, DoInstruct [21] in ocean science, and GeneGPT [36], Almanac [37], MedAgents [38] in biomedical domain, etc. Among them, biomedical agents, in particular, have garnered significant attention due to its critical importance. Biomedical agents [39] impact areas ranging from hybrid cell simulation [40], the design of cellular circuits [41] to the development of new therapies [42] and so on. We posit that biomedical agents will emerge as a focal point of research. However, the current benchmark in this field remains inadequate. For instance, MedAgents is evaluated in MedQA [20], MedMCQA [43], PubMedQA [44], relying heavily on inherent knowledge of LLMs, which leads to hallucinations easily. Our proposed BioKGBench is a dynamic benchmark that evaluates the capabilities of agents in utilizing external tools and knowledge retrieval, thereby addressing this gap.
Agent Benchmark. As agents are progressively applied across various domains, the urgency to construct corresponding benchmarks is escalating. Currently, the majority of benchmarks for evaluating agents adopt the approach of evaluating LLM-as-Agent [45], linking LLMs to external frameworks to assess their performance on specific tasks. For instance, AgentBench [45] is a general benchmark for evaluating an agent's reasoning and decision-making capabilities, SWE-bench [46] assesses an agent's proficiency in software engineering, and AgentClinic [47] examines an agent's performance in a simulated clinical environment. However, a benchmark in AI Scientist perspective remains largely unexplored. Our benchmark originates from this perspective, taking the processing and understanding of large-scale data scenarios as the entry point, representing an initial attempt in this direction.</p>
<p>Agent Integrating LLMs and KGs. The collaborative use of LLM and KG has become one of the leading methodologies in contemporary agent design, aimed at alleviating uncertainties stemming from the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs [48, 49, 50]. This paradigm not only capitalizes on the generalization ability of LLMs but also employs KGs as an external, trustworthy, and structured data source, thereby achieving reasoning proficiency that strikingly emulates human intellect[48]. For instance, StructGPT [51] boosts an LLM's performance on general questions by tapping into the information from a supplied KG. Similarly, KG-Agent [52] leverages knowledge from KGs, synthesizing instruction data for fine-tuning an open-sourced LLM, thereby achieving competitive performance on general question-answering tasks. However, to our knowledge, while this paradigm has been widely applied to the general question-answering area, its potential remains untapped in the biomedical field. BKGAgent, hence, is poised to fill this gap.</p>
<h2>3 BioKGBench</h2>
<p>Here, we present our benchmark in detail. As aforementioned, one key ability of "AI Scientists" is to understand domain knowledge. However, current LLM-driven agent systems inevitably suffer from hallucinations as a consequence of the statistical nature of LLMs along with the lack of scientific training data compared to data from daily scenarios. We notice that a recent trend in research is to use AI agents to leverage external tools to address these limitations [34, 21].</p>

<p>Drawing inspiration from this, we design two atomic abilities to evaluate AI scientists, i) Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aiming to address the hallucination issue by grounding the knowledge with structured knowledge graphs; and ii) Scientific Claim Verification (SCV) based on retrieved text from peer-reviewed research papers. In addition, we propose an encompassing task combining these two atomic abilities, to perform Knowledge Graph Checking (KGCheck) as shown in Figure 1. The motivation behind this stems from our interviews with experts from biomedical domains. Their answers to the question "What is the most expected AI agent you would like to use in your daily research?" often included an AI agent that helps in extensive literature review and claim verification. We report the statistics over the scopes of knowledge search, including knowledge graphs and academic literature, in Table 1.</p>
<h1>3.1 Atomic Ability</h1>
<h3>3.1.1 Knowledge Graph Question Answering</h3>
<p>This atomic task in the benchmark is to evaluate the agents' ability to interact with structured Knowledge Graph Question Answering as a grounding of academic literature. Without loss of generality, we choose Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG) [53] as the source of our data, which is one of the most popular large-scale knowledge graph databases in the biomedical domain. CKG is a knowledge graph database with data imported from diverse biomedical databases, aimed at streamlining automated knowledge discovery through the graph's extensive information.
As the original database is unnecessarily large, we focus on a sub-graph to mitigate the chal-

lenge while preserving all relevant information. Starting from the origin of CKG-protein, we select the sub-graph to contain exactly 12 categories of biological entities, as indicated in Figure 2. Thus, the sub-graph consists of 484,955 entities (nodes) across 12 categories (Biologically defined) and 18,959,943 relationships (edges) of 18 types, with each type consisting of relationships between a unique pair of entity categories.
After the sub-graph is ready, we construct the question set for the Question Answering (QA) database in two steps. We first handcraft question templates by selecting biomedical fields and pinpointing entities and relations in the CKG. Natural language questions were constructed in various formats, ensuring their accuracy through peer reviews and expert consultations. We then expand our dataset with autogenerated questions by matching CKG data to constructed QA templates, resulting in the generation of 698 questions across three reasoning types and 16 question categories (refer to Table 2).
In this task, we outfit LLMs with a set of atomic KG-querying tools and ask them to answer biomedical questions by querying the provided KG. The responses will be compared with the gold answers and</p>

<p>evaluated using the F1 score, where the gold answer to the input question is typically characterized by a set of KG entities. It is noteworthy that our KGQA is built upon a biomedical KG rather than a common sense KG, the former being characterized by its highly dense information storage. This compactness greatly increases the complexity for agents to employ tools and perform reasoning on the structured graph to complete QA tasks. This task enables the development of assessing the robustness and tool learning ability of agents built upon various LLMs, and hopefully it would aid in guiding agents to leverage the extensive biomedical knowledge within the KG, thereby propelling scientific discovery.</p>
<h1>3.1.2 Scientific Claim Verification</h1>
<p>This task is designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of unstructured text from research papers in a retrieval-augmented generation manner. Following the definition in [54], the task is to identify evidence related to the claim from the research literature and give a verdict of "Support", "Refute", or "NEI" (Not Enough Information) based on it. We reconstruct two high-quality biomedical datasets, PubMedQA [44] and SciFact [54], into one dataset for SCV, yielding a corpus constituted of abstracts derived from 5,664 scholarly articles, alongside a dataset comprising 1,385 biomedical claims, as shown in Table 3.</p>
<h3>3.2 Agent Task</h3>
<p>Building upon the atomic abilities, we propose a novel and comprehensive task, KGCheck. This task necessitates the initial application of the tool-query functionality to extract information from the KG. Subsequently, it employs the RAG approach or database access to procure evidence pertaining to the queried information, facilitating a determination of either "Support" or "Refute". This methodology enables agents to scrutinize the knowledge encapsulated within a large-scale KG, a venture of particular importance considering the prevalence of inaccuracies within numerous datasets, including prominent ones such as ImageNet [55].</p>

<p>For this task, we collect 225 high-quality annotated data, as illustrated in Table 4. Given the massive data encapsulated within KGs via triples, we delineate the inspection process into two distinct categories: single-node and triple-based. The single-node inspection is divided into node existence and attribute value assessments, while the triple inspection encompasses scenarios with and without edges between two nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Existence: We note that databases may excise entries during updates due to inaccuracies or redundancies, whereas KGs remain static post-construction, similar to LLMs in some respects. If nodes corresponding to obsolete entities persist in the KG, the label is "Refute"; if they are congruent with real-time updated external databases, the label is "Support".</li>
<li>
<p>Attribute: Our KG is characterized by high information density, with each node and edge encapsulating numerous attribute values, which we scrutinize for accuracy and completeness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Existing Relationship: We check whether existing edges contradict information from external, real-time updated databases and literature. If external knowledge corroborates the relationship, the label is "Support"; conversely, it is "Refute".</p>
</li>
<li>Potential Relationship: If a relationship is confirmed by databases or literature but is not represented in the KG, the label is "Refute"; otherwise, it is "Support".</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite utilizing the latest databases (as of May 2024), we identified errors within the KG, evidenced by 96 "Refute" annotations. These data are valuable and provide scenarios for agents to comprehend knowledge from heterogeneous sources and make discoveries.</p>
<h1>3.3 BKGAgent: A Simple Baseline</h1>
<p>We propose a biomedical knowledge-graph agent (BKGAgent), as shown in Figure 3. It's a multiagent framework based on langgraph [56], capable of retrieving information from knowledge graph and cross-validating its correctness with multiple information sources. Our framework is comprised of three agents: the team leader for the progress control, the KG agent for information retrieval from KG, and the validation agent for checking the correctness of the information from KG. This setup simulates the workflow of a human research team, where a leader supervises the assistants' work and makes the final decision based on their feedback. Additionally, the tool executor is solely responsible for executing functions, and is not based on LLMs.
<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Framework of our BKGAgent.
When a user assigns a task, the leader initially breaks down the task and announces the plan. Then the KG agent is activated to retrieve task-related information from the KG. This involves specifying the tool and its arguments to the tool executor, interpreting the tool result, and communicating it back to the leader. After that, the validation agent is called to verify the information with a workflow similar to that of the KG agent. Finally, the leader will draw a conclusion and return it to the user.</p>

<li>Disparity between open-source and commercial API models. Commercial API models like GPT-4 and GLM-4 generally outperform open-source models in several key metrics. GPT-4, for example, consistently achieves higher scores in both KGQA and SCV tasks, highlighting the advantage of proprietary training techniques and larger computational resources.</li>
<li>Strong performance of open-source large models. Some large OSS models, such as Llama-3-70B-Instruct, perform competitively, sometimes surpassing API models in specific metrics. Llama-3-70B-Instruct, in particular, excels in KGQA executability, suggesting that optimized training can enable open-source models to rival or exceed commercial counterparts.</li>
<li>Model parameters do not always correlate with better performance. In the OSS (Medium) and OSS (Small) categories, smaller models like Llama-3-8B-Instruct sometimes outperform larger models like Qwen1.5-32B-Chat in SCV tasks, indicating that model architecture, training data quality, and fine-tuning strategies significantly impact performance. Notably, Qwen1.5-14B-Chat outperforms Qwen1.5-32B-Chat in KGQA, suggesting the latter's pre-training may be insufficient.</li>
<li>Domain-specific models lack transferability. DeepSeek-LLM-67B-Chat excells in mathematical problems [61], but underperforms in biomedical-related tasks, highlighting its lack of cross-domain transferability. This suggests that specialization in one area may compromise generalizability.</li>
<li>Inconsistent performance of MoE models. While Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1 performs well in both KGQA and SCV tasks, other MoE models like Starling-LM-alpha-8x7B-MoE-GPTQ and Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B-Chat show significantly lower scores. This inconsistency suggests that the effectiveness of MoE models heavily depends on the implementation and integration of the expert models. Additionally, Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, though strong in main metrics, struggles with controlling response format, indicating that individual expert models still require improvement.</li>
<li>Biomedical knowledge embedded in model parameters. The new metric "right quote" for SCV assesses the alignment of retrieved quotes with ground truth evidence. Some models, such as GLM4, Qwen1.5-72B-Chat, and Qwen1.5-7B-Chat, exhibit higher accuracy metrics than "right quote" metrics. This suggests these models can accurately assess input claims even without sufficient literature evidence, indicating they possess specialized biomedical knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also conduct an ablation experiment on three scopes of RAG, as shown in Figure 4, where 'all' refers to the abstract of 5,664 articles, 'partial' denotes the 1,888 abstracts containing ground truth evidence of claims, and 'match' corresponds to the abstracts of the ground truth evidence for the claims. Interestingly, we observe an unexpected phenomenon where the model's performance in the 'match' setting only increases in terms of the right quotes metric, while the accuracy metric actually decreases. In the 'all' setting, we initially thought that irrelevant literature would introduce interference, but the accuracy metric, on the contrary, increases.

<h1>4.2 Main Results and Analysis: BKGAgent</h1>
<p>The experiment results including both process and final answer are shown in Table 6, where the executability metric of the assistant agent means whether it is correctly activated. The exact match score of the final result agrees with what we observed in the atomic abilities experiments: GPT-4 surpasses Llama-3-70B-Instruct in the final result, which shows the best performance in the atomic abilities experiments. We discovered some interesting phenomena based on the analysis of BKGAgent chat history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leader agent performance significantly influences the team behavior. While the behavior of the assistant agents like KG agent can be modified by the leader's instruction, the leader itself lacks action-related feedback from others, meaning that a bad decision made by the leader may lead to a catastrophe. We found four common error cases induced by the leader, as shown in Figure 5. Among these cases, the leader either fails to give effective instructions to team members, becomes trapped in repeated self-talks, or attempts to perform the tasks that are meant for the assistants.</li>
<li>Assistant agents can always select the right tool. As shown in the results, assistant agents's executability is almost the same as its right tool selection rate, which means once the agent is correctly woken up, it has a good chance of selecting the right tool.</li>
<li>Good process results do not necessarily mean a good final result. Surprisingly, the agent based on Llama surpasses the one based on GPT in terms of assistant agents' tool selection. However, the final result is far from satisfactory. We watch for the chat history of the Llama-based agent and find out that while the right answer can be found in the history of the agent in many cases, the team starts chatter instead of sending the result to the user thus leading to a final wrong answer.</li>
<li>Balanced abilities of BKGAgent. We classify our tasks into two categories by the way the agent checks the information from KG, namely the web database (UniProt [65] and STRING [66]) check task and the publication database check task. The performance of them is separately evaluated. Considering the exact match score of the final result, both the GPT-based agent and Llama-based agent show similar performance in both types of tasks, indicating BKGAgent does not show any preference for specific tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.3 Capability Analysis</h3>
<p>Biomedical agents are not widely employed, as most tasks rely solely on models (refer to Appendix F). Additionally, most agents are primarily focused on QA tasks. For example, MedAgents[67] employs a Multi-disciplinary Collaboration (MC) framework and was tested on nine QA datasets. General agents such as the multi-agent framework AutoGen and the single-agent framework AutoGPT are capable of performing web searches and database retrieval enhancements through tool calls. However, since accessing knowledge graphs and biomedical information is beyond daily usage, and the information directly gained from the web being unreliable, it is challenging to achieve the same level of biomedical information retrieval and verification effectiveness using existing general agent frameworks.
As presented in Table 7, our framework encompasses the basic abilities, especially for retrieval in the biomedical domain. The range of our information for KG result validation includes the UniProt</p>
<p><img alt="img-4.jpeg" src="img-4.jpeg" /></p>

database, STRING database, and publications selected from PubMed, which surpasses the limited information from a simple web search.</p>
<h1>5 Conclusion</h1>
<p>We present BioKGBench, an interactive benchmark that encompasses the KGCheck task with two atomic capabilities for assessment: KGQA and SCV. KGCheck offers agents a valuable scenario for detecting knowledge hallucination within large-scale data, akin to the experience of researchers making discoveries amidst voluminous literature in the real world. We conduct evaluations of these two atomic capabilities across 13 LLMs and select the topperforming open-source model, Llama-3-70BInstruct, and API-based model, GPT-4, to construct BKGAgent-a multi-agent system serving as the baseline. Comparisons with existing general and biomedical agents revealed their poor performance due to the absence of certain process capabilities, thereby demonstrating the challenging nature of our benchmark. We expect BioKGBench to serve as a valuable endeavor</p>

<h1>A Dataset and Code</h1>
<h2>A. 1 Dataset and Code Access</h2>
<p>Following NeurIPS Dataset and Benchmark Track guidelines, our data and code are available at https://github.com/westlake-autolab/BioKGBench under MIT license. More details are also documented at this address. The Croissant metadata record is available at https://huggingface. co/api/datasets/AutoLab-Westlake/BioKGBench-Dataset/croissant.</p>
<h2>A. 2 Responsibility Statement</h2>
<p>We declare that we assume full responsibility for any violations of rights. We confirm that the data used in this paper is properly licensed and ensure that its use complies with all relevant laws, regulations, and licensing agreements.</p>
<h2>B Datasheet</h2>
<p>Here, we provide a detailed description of our benchmark dataset, following the guidelines of the "Datasheet for Datasets" [75].</p>
<h2>B. 1 Motivation</h2>
<p>Our benchmark dataset was created to address the lack of benchmarks for evaluating biomedical agents from the perspective of an "AI scientists". In [39], it is stated that "AI scientists" can be realized as AI agents supported by humans, LLMs, ML models, and other tools like experimental platforms that cooperate to solve complex tasks. However, the current evaluation methods for biomedical agents remain unexplored, limited to simple question-answering tasks, which not only fail to avoid the hallucination problem inherent in solely relying on LLMs but also do not assess agents' abilities to utilize external tools and knowledge bases. Our proposed benchmark fills this gap by designing tasks ranging from easy to hard, based on two atomic capabilities: tool-query and memory-RAG. These tasks evaluate the agents' ability to leverage external support, including external knowledge and tools, when handling large-scale and multi-modal data. Moreover, Our data collected for KGCheck, the most challenging task, provides scenarios for agents to comprehend knowledge from heterogeneous sources and make discoveries.
The conception and construction of this dataset were jointly completed by the biomedical experts and AI researchers listed in the author list.</p>
<h2>B. 2 Composition</h2>
<p>We provide the necessary data for constructing the knowledge graph, literature for RAG, as well as the development and test data for KGQA, SCV, and KGCheck, where knowledge graph and literature are external knowledge sources provided for agent.
The knowledge graph is derived from a subset of Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG) [32]. We specifically retain twelve key node types to ensure there is no loss of generality: Protein, Biological process (BP), Molecular function (MF), Cellular component (CC), Amino acid sequence, Tissue, Protein structure, Pathway, Modified protein, Modification, Disease, and Gene. The statistics of the triples in our knowledge graph are presented in Table 8. Detailed information stored in our knowledge graph is shown in Table 9.
Besides the knowledge graph, literature also serves as an external source of knowledge. We provide a corpus of 5,664 abstracts (under ODC-By 1.0) for SCV and 51 full papers for KGCheck. The 5,664 abstracts are sourced from existing datasets SciFact [54] (under CC BY 4.0) and PubMedQA [44] (under MIT license), while the 51 full papers, all of which are open access, were selected by experts based on entries in the IntAct [76] database and CKG. Table 10 summarizes the sources of the abstracts, and Figure 6 describes the literature with more details. Table 11 summarizes the sources of the 51 full papers, and Figure 7 provides more details about the literature.
For evaluation, we carefully collected 698, 1385, and 225 instances for KGQA, SCV, and KGCheck respectively. These datasets are split into development (dev) and test sets at an approximate ratio of</p>

Each instance includes both input and output (ground truth answer or label) pairs, with additional information to make the data easier to understand. The dataset for SCV is reconstructed from well-known existing datasets SciFact and PubMedQA, while the rest is self-contained. The dataset represents a carefully selected sample of instances from a larger set, ensuring a comprehensive and representative coverage of the key aspects.</p>
<h1>B. 3 Collection Process</h1>
<p>Biomedical experts and AI researchers listed in the author list were invloved in the data collection process. The collection process for different tasks varies:
KGQA. The collection process can be summarized into two steps: manually constructing question templates and automatically generating questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflow for the Handcrafted Question Templates: The process commenced by selecting specific biomedical research fields and identifying relevant entity types and relationships from our knowledge graph. We defined various types of natural language questions, including one-hop questions, multi-hop questions, and conjunction questions (involving multiple entities). For each question, we created corresponding queries in both human-readable and machine-readable formats. These questions and queries, along with their associated metadata, such as question type and query structure, underwent rigorous peer reviews to ensure syntactic and semantic correctness.</li>
