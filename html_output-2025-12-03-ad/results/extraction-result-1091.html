Bayesian experimental design is investigated for Bayesian analysis of nonlinear mixed-effects models. Existence of the posterior risk for parameter estimation is shown. When the same prior distribution is used for both design and inference, existence of the preposterior risk for design is also proven. If the prior distribution used in design is different from that used for inference, sufficient conditions are established for existence of the preposterior risk for design. A case study of design for an experiment in population HIV dynamics is provided.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Nonlinear mixed-effects models are often used when heterogeneity exists among subjects or units, for example, when population pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, or virus dynamic data are modeled (Yuh et al., 1994;Wu and Ding, 1999). In this article, a scheme of optimal design for nonlinear mixed-effects models is investigated, where the design issue is formulated as a decision of choosing the values of the predictor(s) and a preposterior risk needs to be minimized. It is assumed that once data are available, they will be analyzed in a Bayesian paradigm; in addition, at the design stage, a prior distribution is used, which may or may not be identical to the prior distribution used for data analysis.</p>
<p>Note that it is possible for experimental design and data analysis to be carried out by different researchers, who, before the experiment, may have different evidence on the properties of the unknown parameters. They may therefore hold different prior beliefs about the distribution of the parameters. Designers and analysts will collaborate, but not necessarily change their prior beliefs to be collaborators.</p>
<p>The idea of using different prior distributions for design and estimation was discussed by Tsutakawa (1972). The decision-making process with different prior distributions for design and estimation has been modeled by Woodworth (1976), Jackson, Novick, and DeKeyrel (1980), Lindley and Singpurwalla (1991), Etzioni and Kadane (1993), and Tsai and Chaloner (2001), who all use slightly different approaches.</p>
<p>In addition, even when a prior distribution is used in experimental design, data analysis can be non-Bayesian. Atkinson and Cox (1974, p. 347) state: "The classical Fisherian ap-proach is that prior information (not usually quantitatively expressed) is highly relevant in selecting a design but that the analysis should not depend on this information. We assume that a Bayesian version of this is that experiments should be useful for workers with very different priors from the person designing the experiments." One example of such a situation is the use of locally optimal designs for nonlinear models. Since a best guess of the unknown parameters is used, the designer's prior belief about the parameters is represented by a degenerate (and hence extremely precise) distribution. In the analysis, however, such a prior distribution is not used, for otherwise no estimation would be necessary.</p>
<p>Technical details on Bayesian analysis of nonlinear mixedeffects models (also known as nonlinear population models) can be found in Wakefield et al. (1994) and Wakefield (1996). Han, Chaloner, and Perelson (2002) provide a Bayesian analysis of an HIV dynamic model. This example is used as a case study to demonstrate the methods suggested in this article.</p>
<p>Specifically, consider the following nonlinear mixed-effects model for HIV dynamics under protease inhibitor monotherapy (Perelson et al., 1996;Han et al., 2002):
y ij | V 0i , c i , δ i , σ 2 ind. ∼ N s(V 0i , c i , δ i , t j ), σ 2 ,(1)log V 0i log c i log δ i V 0 , c, δ, Σ i.i.d. ∼ N µ, Σ ,(2)
where
µ = (log V 0 log c log δ) ,(3)25 and s(V 0i , c i , δ i , t j ) = log V 0i + log c 2 i (c i − δ i ) 2 e −δ i t j − c 2 i − (c i − δ i ) 2 (c i − δ i ) 2 e −c i t j − c i δ i c i − δ i t j e −c i t j .
(4) For subject i, y ij is the natural logarithm of the plasma concentration of HIV particles at time t j after the pharmacologic delay of the drug effect; V 0i is the plasma concentration of HIV particles at treatment initiation; c i is the virion clearance rate; and δ i is the rate at which the infected CD4 cells die. The expression s(V 0i , c i , δ i , t j ) is obtained by solving a system of differential equations that describe the transactions among virus particles, target cells, and infected cells. Details of mathematical modeling of HIV dynamics can be found in Nowak and May (2000, Chapter 4) and Perelson and Nelson (1999). The primary interest is in log c and log δ, the population values of the logarithm of the virion clearance rate and rate of disappearance of infected CD4 cells. To investigate the design issue in HIV dynamic experiments, eight different sampling schedules will be compared with regard to the precision of estimating log c and log δ.</p>
<p>Bayesian optimal design for nonlinear mixed-effects models has been studied by Stroud, Müller, and Rosner (2001), who assume that the same prior distribution will be used both for design and for estimation and prediction, and also assume a different loss structure than that used in this article. Palmer and Müller (1998) study Bayesian optimal design for population models of aphereses. Although their model is a nonlinear mixed-effects model, the design problem is very different since different apheresis schedules result in different mean functions in the model.</p>
<p>Model</p>
<p>In general, for a p-vector of unknown parameters θ, let s(θ, t) be a nonlinear function for the mean response at time t with parameters θ. For subjects i = 1, . . . , n, assume the observations for the ith subject give data y i = (y i1 , . . . , y im ) with
y ij | θ i , {θ k , k = i}, µ, Σ, σ 2 ind. ∼ N (s(θ i , t j ) = x ij , σ 2 ), j = 1, . . . , m;
and
θ i | µ, Σ i.i.d. ∼ N (µ, Σ), i = 1, . . . , n.
There are therefore m measurements taken on each of n subjects, at time points t 1 , . . . , t m . The θ i 's are random effects and are assumed to be p-dimensional. In the case study used in this article, p = 3, θ i = (log V 0i log c i log δ i ) , µ = (log V 0 log c log δ) , and s(θ i , t j ) is as in (4).</p>
<p>In data analysis, the following prior distribution, π, is used for the unknown population parameters σ 2 , µ, and Σ:
σ −2 ∼ G(α, β), µ ∼ N (η, Λ), Σ −1 ∼ W (Ω, ν),(5)
where σ 2 , µ, and Σ −1 are mutually independent. It is assumed that Λ and Ω are positive definite, and ν ≥ p, so that the distribution of µ has a density, and Σ −1 is positive definite. It is also assumed that α and β are positive. The parameterization of gamma and Wishart distributions is such that G(α, β) has mean αβ and W (Ω, ν) has mean νΩ (see, e.g., Appendix A of Carlin and Louis, 1996).</p>
<p>A quadratic loss function is used for the estimation of µ, the population mean of the random effects in the mean function: L(µ, a) = (µ − a) (µ − a). Then the Bayes estimator of µ is E π (µ | y), where y = {y i , i = 1, . . . , n}, and the superscript π indicates that the posterior distribution is under the prior distribution π. This gives the posterior risk k V π (µ k | y), where µ k 's are the components of µ.</p>
<p>Suppose that a possibly different prior distribution ω is used for design:
σ −2 ∼ G(γ, δ), µ ∼ N (ζ, K), Σ −1 ∼ W (Ψ, χ).(6)
Let G ξ denote the marginal distribution of y when the prior distribution is ω and the design is ξ. For data y, define the loss to be k V π (µ k | y). Then the goal is to find a design to minimize E G ξ k V π (µ k | y) , among a finite collection of candidate designs.</p>
<p>Note that if the quadratic loss for parameter estimation is (µ − a) D(µ − a), where D = diag(d kk ) is diagonal and positive semidefinite with tr(D) = 1, then E(µ | y) is still a Bayes estimator. The loss for the design problem is
E G ξ [ k d kk V π (µ k | y)]
, a convex combination of the posterior variances.</p>
<p>It needs to be shown that for y almost everywhere in the sample space, V π (µ k | y) &lt; ∞. That is, with probability 1 in the marginal distribution of data, the sum of the posterior variances of the fixed effects is finite. This is the loss for the design problem. When the posterior variances exist, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be used to estimate them. Sufficient conditions are also needed, under which
k V π (µ k | y) dG ξ (y) &lt; ∞.
That is, the loss for the design problem is integrable with respect to the marginal distribution of data. For the design problem, this guarantees a finite preposterior risk. When such integrability holds, any given design can be evaluated by simulation (Monte Carlo integration), where for each simulated data set MCMC is used to obtain posterior variance estimates. This can be described as MCMC within Monte Carlo. Or, following Clyde, Müller, and Parmigiani (1996), MCMC can be used to find the optimal design (this would result in MCMC within MCMC).</p>
<p>Since prior distributions of the form (5) and (6) are commonly used for nonlinear mixed-effects models, the results in this article are specifically developed for such prior distributions. Extension to other forms of prior distributions is discussed in Section 5.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>In this section, existence of the posterior covariance matrix of µ will be established; sufficient conditions on π and ω will be specified, under which the elements of the posterior covariance matrix of µ is integrable with respect to the marginal distribution of data.</p>
<p>Theorem 1: Let µ = (µ 1 · · · µ p ) . For all y in the sample space, E µ 2 k | y &lt; ∞ for k = 1, . . . , p. The proof of Theorem 1 is in Appendix A. Theorem 1 establishes the existence of posterior variance of µ k , whether the prior distribution is π or ω. Conditions on the two prior distributions π and ω are given below, under which
k V π (µ k | y) dG ξ (y) &lt; ∞.
Proposition 1: Let f (µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) and g(µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) be the joint density function for prior distributions π and ω, re-
spectively. If g(µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )/f (µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )
is bounded, then the preposterior risk for design is finite.</p>
<p>The justification of Proposition 1 is in Appendix B. The following theorem states conditions under which
g(µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )/f (µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) is bounded.
Recall that in the Loewner ordering for two symmetric matrices A and B, A &gt; B means A − B is positive definite and A ≥ B means A − B is positive semidefinite (see, e.g., Pukelsheim, 1993, Section 1.10).</p>
<p>Theorem 2: If the following conditions on (5) and (6) 
hold, then g(µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )/f (µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) is bounded: (a) either K −1 ≥ Λ −1 and ζ = η; or K −1 &gt; Λ −1 ; (b) either γ = α and β ≥ δ; or γ &gt; α and β &gt; δ; (c) either χ = ν and Ψ −1 ≥ Ω −1 ; or χ &gt; ν and Ψ −1 &gt; Ω −1 .
The proof of Theorem 2 is in Appendix C. Loosely speaking, these conditions can be interpreted as ω being as informative as, or more informative than π, in the following sense:</p>
<p>(a) N (ζ, K) has a covariance matrix that is no smaller than that of N (η, Λ). Note that K −1 ≥ Λ −1 if and only if Λ ≥ K, and similarly for "&gt;." (b) If G(γ, δ) and G(α, β) have the same mean, αβ = γδ, then β ≥ δ implies αβ 2 ≥ γδ 2 and so the variance of G(α, β) is no smaller than that of G(γ, δ). (c) Let Ω ij and Ψ ij be the (i, j) elements of Ω and Ψ, respectively. If W (Ψ, χ) and W (Ω, ν) have the same 
≥ Ω −1 implies ν(Ω 2 ij + Ω ii Ω jj ) ≥ χ(Ψ 2 ij + Ψ ii Ψ jj ).
The former is the variance of the (i, j) element of a random matrix following a W (Ω, ν) distribution, and the latter, that of the (i, j) element of a random matrix following a W (Ψ, χ).</p>
<p>Note that even though the integrability of the posterior variances with respect to the marginal distribution of data when π and ω are identical can be established without Theorem 2, the conditions specified in Theorem 2 do include the situation where π and ω are identical.</p>
<p>For a finite set of designs, ξ ∈ Ξ, the interest is to find
ξ * = arg min ξ∈Ξ E G ξ [ k V π (µ k | y)], or ξ * * = arg min ξ∈Ξ E G ξ [ k d kk V π (µ k | y)].</p>
<p>Case Study</p>
<p>As an example, consider the nonlinear mixed-effects model for HIV dynamics as defined by (1)-(4). A prior distribution which has the form (5) is constructed based on studies available at the time of the original designed experiment of Perelson et al. (1996). Details of the construction of the prior distribution are given in Han et al. (2002) and the prior distribution represents a meta-analysis combining the results of different studies.</p>
<p>The prior distribution for data analysis π, is specified as π 1 :
σ −2 ∼ G(4.5, 9.0), µ ∼ N ((11.0 1.1 − 1.0) , diag(6.0 0.1 0.01)), Σ −1 ∼ W (diag(0.26 2.5 2.5), 3.0).
The prior distribution for design, ω, has the same prior mean but more precision, satisfying the conditions in Theorem 2: adjusted for a 2-hour pharmacologic delay (Nelson, Mittler, and Perelson, 2001). Schedule 1 is the original schedule used in the experiment of Perelson et al. (1996), in which the planned design took 16 measurements from each of the five participants. Each of the first 7 schedules takes 16 measurements per individual within 6 11 12 days after treatment initiation (that is, within 7 days before adjusting for the 2-hour pharmacologic delay). To fit a nonlinear mixed-effects model, a larger sample size is more desirable and more typical (for example, Ho et al., 1995;Wei et al., 1995). Hence, it is assumed that the experiment will use 15 participants when 16 measurements are taken per subject. For schedule 8, a more sparse schedule is used with eight measurements per individual, allowing for twice as many participants.</p>
<p>The eight candidate designs are examined and compared by simulation. For any design, data sets can be generated. By Theorem 1, for each data set, MCMC can be used to estimate the posterior variances of the components of µ. Then, due to the integrability results, these variances can be averaged over data sets, yielding Monte Carlo estimates of the integrated posterior variances.</p>
<p>For each schedule, 1000 samples are generated. For each generated sample, one chain is run with 10,000 iterations. The first 5000 iterations are treated as burn-in and discarded. The last 5000 iterations are used to calculate the posterior variance of log c and log δ. More specifically, the population parameters σ 2 , µ, and Σ are updated using Gibbs steps; as to the random effects, the log V 0i 's are updated using Gibbs steps, the log c i 's and log δ i 's are updated univariately using Metropolis steps with normal proposals. During the first 5000 iterations, the acceptance rates are monitored and the variances of the univariate normal proposals are adjusted after every 200 iterations so as to achieve an acceptance rate of about 40%. The adaptation discontinues after the 5000th iteration.</p>
<p>The analyses are repeated with the (π 1 −)prior variance for µ 3 changed from 0.01 to 0.1; this prior distribution is called π 2 . The results are summarized in Table 2. The term "relative risk" refers to the ratio between a preposterior risk and the minimum preposterior risk over the eight designs. Table 2 suggests that when the goal is to estimate log c, schedule 2 performs better than the other candidate designs. When the goal is to estimate log δ, schedule 8 is the best  | y)] under π 1 for four of the eight schedules. The shaded band represents pointwise 95% confidence intervals for schedule 1.
Figure 2. Estimates of (1 − )E[V(log c | y)] + E[V(log δ
candidate design. Also, note that schedule 6 is similar to schedule 8 except that it has two measurements per subject at each time point, rather than one, and therefore uses half as many subjects. From Table 2, schedule 8 clearly outperforms schedule 6. The maximum length of 95% confidence intervals for E[V(log c | y)] is 0.00083 under π 1 and 0.00089 under π 2 ; that for E[V(log δ | y)] is 0.000103 under π 1 and 0.00045 under π 2 . There are, therefore, differences between the sampling schedules in preposterior expected losses. When there are only two parameters of interest, log c and log δ, the results can be graphically displayed as in Figure  2. For each design, each point on the line segment connect-ingÊ[V(log c | y)] andÊ[V(log δ | y)] represents an expected loss under a certain matrix D = diag(0 1 − ). This plot suggests that when the goal is to estimate log δ and log c simultaneously, schedule 8 is the best candidate design. For = 0.5 (D = diag(0 0.5 0.5)), the criterion minimizes the average preposterior risk in estimating log c and log δ. Schedule 8 has 91% (under π 1 ) or 81% (under π 2 ) of the preposterior risk of schedule 1, the design used in Perelson et al. (1996).</p>
<p>It should be noted that the prior distributions for data analysis have been constructed using results of similar viral dynamic studies in the scientific literature, and the prior distribution for design has been chosen to reflect the same mean value of the population parameters, but with higher precision. The conclusion regarding the risks and their ordering could potentially change when a different set of prior distributions is used.</p>
<p>Since biological knowledge and previous studies suggest that log c is much larger than log δ, the effect of log c on the expected response is minimal except for the "short" period of time following treatment initiation; the effect of log δ, on the other hand, is persistent throughout the experiment. It is hence natural to expect the designs with many observations taken at the beginning to do well for estimating log c, but not for estimating log δ. The result that schedule 2 is the best for estimating log c and schedule 8 is the best for estimating log δ is consistent with such expectations. Under other prior distributions, however, it is quite possible that, for example, a different schedule that puts many observations taken at the beginning will outperform schedule 2.</p>
<p>Extensions</p>
<p>Several extensions and modifications can be made. First, for a positive semidefinite matrix W with (k, l) element w kl , the loss function for estimating µ can be specified as (µ − a) W(µ − a). This will result in a posterior risk for estimation, k w kk V π (µ k | y) + 2 k =l w kl Cov(µ k , µ l | y), leading to the loss for experimental design,
E G ξ k w kk V π (µ k | y) + 2 k =l w kl Cov(µ k , µ l | y) .
The results of Theorem 2 are readily generalized to this situation.</p>
<p>Second, one can define, for some M ∈ (0, ∞), max{1/ k V π (µ k | y), M} as the utility for data y. The continuity of (B.1) in Appendix B implies that this utility is always integrable with respect to the marginal distribution of y induced by ω. Stroud et al. (2001) use the posterior precision of a real-valued function (area under the curve) as the utility. Under nonlinear mixed-effects models, however, the integrability of this latter utility (i.e., the existence of the preposterior risk) is not obvious.</p>
<p>Third, this article has focused on prior distributions of the form (5) and (6) since they are commonly used. While results regarding such prior distributions are somewhat restrictive, it is possible to establish similar results for other forms of prior distribution. Suppose instead of (5) and (6) the prior distributions π and ω are specified as σ −2 ∼ G(α, β), µ | Σ ∼ N (η, rΣ), Σ −1 ∼ W (Ω, ν), and σ −2 ∼ G(γ, δ), µ | Σ ∼ N (ζ, sΣ), Σ −1 ∼ W (Ψ, χ), respectively. Then, Lemma 1 in Appendix A, Theorem 1, and Proposition 1 hold as before; in Theorem 2, condition (a) should be replaced by (a ): either s ≤ r and ζ = η, or s &lt; r.</p>
<p>Finally, it has been assumed in this article that taking 16 measurements on each of 15 people would incur the same cost as taking eight measurements on each of 30 people. This may be an oversimplification since recruiting more participants will typically involve more costs. It is possible to take into consideration the fact that different designs have different costs; doing so involves specifying a relationship between monetary cost and precision in parameter estimation, but creates little additional technical difficulty regarding the theoretical results and computational burden. It is conceivable that when monetary cost is built into the design problem, schedule 8 will be less favorable. It is also possible, however, that when developing a new assay, such as those measuring HIV-RNA, the overriding cost limitation is the number of kits available for the assay, rather than the number of patients.</p>
<p>It is unclear what other approaches could be used to choose designs for nonlinear mixed-effects models. The linear approximation of Mentré, Mallet, and Baccar (1997) could be used but this approximation is not accurate unless the between-subject variability is small or the response is close to linear (Han, 2002, Chapter 4). See also Fedorov, Gagnon, and Leonov (2002). In theory, exact calculations of optimality criteria such as Bayesian D-optimality (Chaloner and Verdinelli, 1995) could be used, but the Fisher information matrix is itself a matrix of integrals whose integrands are functions of integrals, all of which must be calculated numerically.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>In this article, a pragmatic approach to optimal design for nonlinear mixed-effects models is investigated. At the design stage, a prior distribution is used, which may differ from the prior distribution that will be used for Bayesian data analysis. Under the conventional form of the prior distribution, the existence of the posterior variance of the population mean of the random effects (also referred to as fixed effects) is established. Sufficient conditions are established under which the posterior variances are integrable with respect to the marginal distribution of the data, which is induced by the design prior distribution. Existence of the posterior variances is required to implement MCMC or any other algorithm to estimate them; integrability of the posterior variances, or existence of the preposterior risk for design, is required to implement the Monte Carlo simulation to compare the designs. The case study compares eight candidate designs numerically and provides guidance for how a design might be chosen in practice: schedule 8 is clearly superior to schedule 1 which was used in the original experiment. The case study provides an example of comparing different schedules and different numbers of patients. In general, the total number of assays (i.e., the number of patients times the number of measurements per patient) does not have to be the same for each design considered.</p>

<p>Since E π (µ k | y) and E π (µ 2 k | y) are both continuous, E[V π (µ k | y)] and V[E π (µ k | y)] are well defined. Hence, the identity V(µ k ) = E[V π (µ k | y)] + V[E π (µ k | y)] can be invoked to show E[V π (µ k | y)] ≤ V(µ k ) &lt; ∞, hence for the important special case where π and ω are identical, without further conditions, the finiteness of the preposterior risk is established.</p>
<p>The outer expectation in the aforementioned identity is with respect to the marginal distribution of y induced by prior distribution π, whose density is h(y) in (B.1). Therefore,
1 h(y) µ 2 k f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 h(y) dy = µ 2 k f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 dy &lt; ∞. (B.2)
Define g(y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) = f (y | µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )g(µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ); then, 1 h(y) µ 2 k f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 × g(y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 = µ 2 k f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 × g(y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 f (y, µ, Σ −1 , Σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 is clearly continuous in y. It only remains to establish sufficient conditions under which the above is integrable with respect to dy. Because of (B.2), the integrability of interest would be guaranteed if g(y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 = f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) g(µ,
Σ −1 , σ −2 ) f (µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 f (y, µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) dµ dΣ −1 dσ −2 (B.3)
is bounded. So, any upper bound for g(µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 )/ f (µ, Σ −1 , σ −2 ) is also an upper bound for (B.3). This justifies Proposition 1. and only if u = 0. Therefore, C Σ −1 C is positive definite. Let the eigenvalues of C Σ −1 C be denoted by λ 1 , . . . , λ p &gt; 0. Then, det Σ −1 (χ−ν)/2 e (−1/2)tr[(Ψ −1 −Ω −1 )Σ −1 ] = det C Σ −1 C (χ−ν)/2 (det C) ν−χ e (−1/2)tr(C Σ −1 C) = det Ψ −1 − Ω −1 (ν−χ)/2 p l=1 λ (χ−ν)/2 l e (−1/2)λ l .</p>
<p>For λ l &gt; 0, λ (χ−ν)/2 l e −(1/2)λ l is maximized at λ l = χ − ν, and hence bounded above by (χ − ν) (χ−ν)/2 e (ν−χ)/2 . So, (det Σ −1 ) (χ−ν)/2 e −(1/2)tr[(Ψ −1 −Ω −1 )Σ −1 ] ≤ [det(Ψ −1 − Ω −1 )] (ν−χ)/2 × (χ − ν) (p/2)(χ−ν) e (p/2)(ν−χ) .</p>
