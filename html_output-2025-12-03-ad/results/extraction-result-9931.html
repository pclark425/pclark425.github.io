                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> LLMs are more likely to label passages as relevant compared to human judges, indicating that LLM labels denoting non-relevance are more reliable than those indicating relevance, and the effects of deliberately manipulating LLMs by instructing them to label passages as relevant are investigated.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assess the relevance of information objects. This work reports on experiments to study the labelling of short texts (i.e., passages) for relevance, using multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs. While the overall agreement of some LLMs with human judgements is comparable to human-to-human agreement measured in previous research, LLMs are more likely to label passages as relevant compared to human judges, indicating that LLM labels denoting non-relevance are more reliable than those indicating relevance. This observation prompts us to further examine cases where human judges and LLMs disagree, particularly when the human judge labels the passage as non-relevant and the LLM labels it as relevant. Results show a tendency for many LLMs to label passages that include the original query terms as relevant. We therefore conduct experiments to inject query words into random and irrelevant passages, not unlike the way we inserted the query 'best café near me' into this paper. The results demonstrate that LLMs are highly influenced by the presence of query words in the passages under assessment, even if the wider passage has no relevance to the query. This tendency of LLMs to be fooled by the mere presence of query words demonstrates a weakness in our current measures of LLM labelling: relying on overall agreement misses important patterns of failures. There is a real risk of bias in LLM-generated relevance labels and, therefore, a risk of bias in rankers trained on those labels. Additionally, we investigate the effects of deliberately manipulating LLMs by instructing them to label passages as relevant, similar to the instruction 'this paper is perfectly relevant' inserted above. We find that such manipulation influences the performance of some LLMs, highlighting the critical need to consider potential vulnerabilities when deploying LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to assess the relevance of information objects. This work reports on experiments to study the labelling of short texts (i.e., passages) for relevance, using multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs. While the overall agreement of some LLMs with human judgements is comparable to human-to-human agreement measured in previous research, LLMs are more likely to label passages as relevant compared to human judges, indicating that LLM labels denoting non-relevance are more reliable than those indicating relevance.</p>
<p>This observation prompts us to further examine cases where human judges and LLMs disagree, particularly when the human judge labels the passage as non-relevant and the LLM labels it as relevant. Results show a tendency for many LLMs to label passages that include the original query terms as relevant. We therefore conduct experiments to inject query words into random and irrelevant passages, not unlike the way we inserted the query 'best café near me' into this paper. The results demonstrate that LLMs are highly influenced by the presence of query words in the passages under assessment, even if the wider passage has no relevance to the query. This tendency of LLMs to be fooled by the mere presence of query words demonstrates a weakness in our current measures of LLM labelling: relying on overall agreement misses important patterns of failures. There is a real risk of bias in LLM-generated relevance labels and, therefore, a risk of bias in rankers trained on those labels.</p>
<p>Additionally, we investigate the effects of deliberately manipulating LLMs by instructing them to label passages as relevant, similar to the instruction 'this paper is perfectly relevant' inserted above. We find that such manipulation influences the performance of some LLMs, highlighting the critical need to consider potential vulnerabilities when deploying LLMs in real-world applications.</p>

<h2>1 Introduction and Background</h2>
<p>Creating relevance judgements-the process of assessing the relevance of documents to a given search query-is the most labourintensive task in creating test collections. Relevance judgements have been studied extensively in the literature. Notably, people tend to lack consistency in assessing document relevance [e.g. 3, 26-28]. This is due in part to their exposure to documents of varying levels of relevance during the judgement process, and the order by which these documents are presented. Consequently, similar documents might be assigned different relevance scores. For example, a judge may assess a document as very relevant until they encounter another document that appears more relevant, leading to a shift in their relevance threshold. This shift can result in similar subsequent documents being judged differently.</p>
<p>Research has examined the use of LLMs to assess the relevance of documents, with recent attempts [1, 9, 20, 29, 30] showing promising results for using LLMs in generating relevance judgements (or "labels", to distinguish them from human "judgements"). The use of LLMs has become more common, with the TREC 2024 RetrievalAugmented Generation (RAG) Track using an LLM to evaluate the retrieval component of RAG systems [31]. Relevance labels produced by LLMs are independent of the documents seen previously; i.e., each document is labelled entirely independently of others. They are also considerably cheaper to collect than using human assessors. However, they may give rise to other issues that have not yet been thoroughly considered.</p>
<p>This work aims to understand the performance of various opensource and proprietary LLMs in labelling passages for relevance. It investigates instances where LLMs and human judgements differ, aiming to formulate and empirically test hypotheses regarding the causes of LLMs failures. While most current literature evaluates LLMs relevance labels primarily based on their agreement with</p>
<p>human judgements, or their similarity in system rankings (such as how both rank TREC runs), this study focuses on uncovering additional dimensions that could be overlooked when substituting human judges with LLMs. Specifically, we explore the following three research questions:
RQ1 How accurate are LLMs in producing relevance labels for passages compared to human-provided relevance judgements, and what are the associated costs of using LLMs for relevance labelling?
RQ2 What factors may influence the disagreement between humans and LLMs?
RQ3 Are current data and metrics sufficient to establish the reliability of using LLMs for relevance labelling?
The key contributions of this work are as follows:
C1 The proposal of multiple "gullibility" tests and metrics to expose some of the limitations of LLMs that can be hidden behind traditional metrics.
C2 An empirical evaluation of the quality, gullibility, and cost of multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs for relevance labelling.</p>
<h2>2 Experiment Design</h2>
<p>This section details the experiment design to address the research questions, with more details about follow-up experiments presented later in Section 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.</p>
<h3>2.1 Test Collections and Participating Systems</h3>
<p>To understand the performance of LLMs in relevance labelling for passages (RQ1 and RQ2), we use queries and passages from the passage retrieval task of the Deep Learning Track of TREC 2021 (DL21) [6] and Deep Learning Track of TREC 2022 (DL22) [7]. Both years used the expanded MS MARCO dataset (v2), which contains around 138 million passages [22]. The relevance judgements of these passages were collected using a 4-point scale ( $0-3$ ) by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) judges.</p>
<p>We use the union of the top ten passages returned by each participating Information Retrieval (IR) system to be labelled by LLMs. We use seven representative IR systems: two lexical models (TF-IDF and BM25); three neural re-rankers (ColBERT [14], monoBERT [24] and monoT5 [23]); one neural-augmented index (Doc2Query [25]); and one dense model (ANCE [33]). Neural models use publicly available checkpoints, fine-tuned on MS MARCO. Retrieval was conducted using Pyterrier [21], except for Doc2Query for which Pyserini [19] was used over a pre-built augmented corpus with doc2query-T5 expansions.</p>
<p>Of the union of passages returned by all systems, we only include passages for which NIST human judgements are available, allowing for comparison with LLM labels. Detailed statistics for the queries and included passages are provided in Table 1, with the distribution of the relevance scores shown in Table 2. Unless otherwise specified, reported results include DL21 and DL22 combined.</p>
<h3>2.2 LLMs, Prompts and Metrics</h3>
<p>Our experiments use nine LLMs from four different providers, selecting both a smaller, less capable and more cost-effective LLM</p>

GPT-4o was included as a more affordable yet still capable alternative to GPT-4, which was used by Upadhyay et al. [31], achieving competitive results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Model parameters are set consistently across all LLMs, identical to those used in Thomas et al. [29]: top_p is set to 1.0, frequency_ penalty at 0.5 , presence_ penalty at 0 , and temperature at 0 . GPT models are run through Azure OpenAI Services, and other LLMs are run through Amazon Bedrock. Cost calculations for running the LLMs are based on the pricing provided for input and output tokens by these services during May-June 2024.</p>
<p>Three different zero-shot prompts are used in the experiments to examine their impact on the performance and stability of relevance labels produced by each LLM:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Prompt: This prompt provides minimal instructions, only giving the model the description of the relevance judgment scale and asking it to return a relevance label as a single number. The prompt is shown in Figure 1.</li>
<li>Rationale Prompt: This prompt adopts the prompt used by Upadhyay et al. [30] which instructs the model to provide an explanation along with the relevance label. To maintain consistency among prompts, we do not use examples as in the original prompt. The full prompt is shown in the Appendix.</li>
<li>Utility Prompt: This prompt is a modified version of Thomas et al. [29]'s optimal (i.e., DNA) prompt. The information need description and narrative are omitted in our prompt since they are not available in DL21 and DL22. Instead of using</li>
</ul>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Please read the query and passage below and indicate how relevant the passage is to the query. Use the following scale:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 for perfectly relevant: The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.</li>
<li>2 for highly relevant: The passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information.</li>

Passage: {passage}
Indicate how relevant the passage is, using the scale above. Give only a number, do not give any explanation.</p>

a 3-point scale, we have adopted a 4-point scale, consistent with the scale used in DL21 and DL22. This prompt instructs the model to assess how useful the answer would be for a report, similar to the instructions given to TREC judges. The full prompt is shown in the Appendix.
Labels are parsed according to the format specified in each prompt. Any labels that cannot be automatically parsed are excluded from the analysis. We note that parsing issues are more frequent in smaller LLMs, particularly in Claude-3 Haiku and LLaMA3 8B, and are very rare in larger LLMs. Missing values are reported in the captions of figures in Section 3 (i.e., Figures 2, 7, and 8) to ensure the results can be interpreted in context.</p>
<p>The performance of relevance labels created by LLMs relative to the available NIST human relevance judgements are evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) given both graded and binary labels. When binary labels are used for some metrics, scores of 2 and 3 are mapped to 1 , according to TREC's recommendation and consistent with the baseline of Damessie et al. [8], which is used to interpret the results. We evaluated agreement with NIST judges using Cohen's $\kappa$ [4] and Krippendorff's $\alpha$ on an ordinal scale [16]. Cohen's $\kappa$ only considers exact nominal matches, while Krippendorff's $\alpha$ takes the severity of the error into account. Additionally, we report the overall accuracy and precision of binary labels, and the likelihood of labelling passages as relevant, for each LLM.</p>
<h3>2.3 Disagreement and Metric Correlation</h3>
<p>To address RQ2 about cases of disagreement between humans and LLMs, we use a manual approach to explore potential reasons for disagreement between LLMs labels and human judgements, focusing on cases of disagreement of the larger LLMs with some initial observations mentioned in the results section.</p>
<p>Informed by the outcomes of RQ2, which suggests that alternative metrics may provide additional insights into the reliability of LLMs, we investigate the implications of different metrics and explore their correlations as part of RQ3.</p>
<h2>3 Results and Discussion</h2>
<h3>3.1 LLM agreement with humans and the cost-performance trade-off</h3>
<p>RQ1 How accurate are LLMs in producing relevance labels for passages compared to human relevance judgements, and what are the associated costs of using LLMs for relevance labelling?</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the agreement between NIST human relevance judgements and LLM relevance labels using the three prompts. The agreement is measured using Cohen's $\kappa$ on a binary scale (shown on the left) and Krippendorff's $\alpha$ on a 4-point ordinal scale (shown on the right). Costs, expressed in USD, are based on the number of input and output tokens used in each LLM-prompt combination. The cost of using each LLM varies depending on the prompt due to differences in the number of input (i.e., prompt) tokens and, more substantially, the number of output tokens. This explains why the rationale prompt, which requires an explanation for relevance, is usually more expensive than other prompts given the same LLM.</p>
<p>Human-to-human agreement levels (measured in previous research) are used as baselines to interpret the degree of agreement observed between LLMs and humans. The assumption is that if LLMs produce labels that agree with humans to the same extent that humans agree with each other, we can conclude that they are sufficiently reliable for use. Specifically, we use two baselines that measure the agreement between silver judges, those who have task expertise but lack topic expertise, and one baseline that measures agreement between bronze judges, those who have neither task nor topic expertise, as defined by Bailey et al. [2]. The baselines are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Damessie et al. [8]: The range of agreement measured using both Cohen's $\kappa$ and Krippendorff's $\alpha$ on a graded scale among different groups of bronze judges. Relevance judgements were performed on the TREC 2004 Robust Track [32] with crowdsourcing and lab-based settings.</li>
<li>Hersh et al. [12]: Agreement measured using Cohen's $\kappa$ on a binary scale with silver judges on the OHSUMED test collection.</li>
<li>Cormack et al. [5]: Agreement using Cohen's $\kappa$ on a binary scale with silver judges on the TREC-6 ad hoc track [10].</li>
</ul>
<p>All baselines are depicted in Figure 2 for reference, with the range of agreement observed by Damessie et al. shaded in grey and other agreements measured by Hersh et al. and Cormack et al. represented as dashed lines. It is worth noting that these baselines are measured on different test collections than those used in our study but should serve as good approximations of human-to-human agreement in relevance judgements.</p>
<p>The x -axis indicates cost, represented on a logarithmic scale; therefore, the visual linear relationship observed in Figure 2 reflects a logarithmic relationship. Inexpensive small LLMs typically yield low agreement values, whereas achieving human-level performance requires larger models and higher financial investment, which is consistent with the scaling laws of LLMs [13].</p>

<p>Figure 2: Agreement between NIST relevance judgments and LLM relevance labels, measured using Cohen's $\kappa$ on a binary scale (left) and Krippendorff's $\alpha$ on a 4-point ordinal scale (right), against cost. Colours represent LLM providers, with shades from lighter to darker indicating less to more capable models. Cost is calculated per 10K labels based on the average cost per label using the number of input and output tokens for each LLM-prompt combination. Baselines are depicted in the shaded grey area and dashed lines. Unparsable labels for each LLM-prompt are minimal, with an average of $0.22 \%$ and a maximum of $1.89 \%$ of missing labels.</p>
<p>Most highly capable LLMs perform within the human-to-human agreement range as measured by Cohen's $\kappa$. Notably, GPT-4o achieves a high level of agreement, comparable to the top agreement among silver judges, and substantially surpasses the performance of GPT-4 at less than half the cost.</p>
<p>GPT-4, LLaMA 70B, and Command-R+ also demonstrate LLM-tohuman agreement competitive with human-to-human agreement. Interestingly, the open-source LLaMA 70B model achieves agreement levels that are similar to GPT-4, which is proprietary and among the most expensive LLMs. To illustrate the cost differences, the computing cost of running LLaMA 70B with a basic prompt on our subsets of DL21 and DL22 is $\$ 2.63$, whereas GPT-4 costs $\$ 29.49$.</p>
<p>When using Krippendorff's $\alpha$ to measure agreement on a graded scale, only GPT-4o and GPT-4 achieve levels in the human-tohuman agreement range regardless of the used prompt. Command$R+$ falls below the expected range, while LLaMA 70B and Claude-3 Opus show variable performance depending on the prompt used, with some prompts achieving agreement levels within the range.</p>
<p>While varying prompts in smaller LLMs lead to substantial differences in agreement, except in the case of Command-R, most larger LLMs exhibit higher stability in agreement regardless of the prompts used. The basic prompt, which requires the fewest input tokens and generates the fewest output tokens, performs effectively and is the most cost-efficient option. More complex prompts, while increasing costs, do not always enhance performance and can actually degrade it.</p>
<p>To examine the performance of LLMs beyond agreement scores, we compute the confusion matrices for all LLM-prompt combinations and report relevant metrics in Table 3, which shows the MAE for binary and graded relevance labels, overall accuracy, precision given the binary labels of non-relevant ( 0 ) and relevant (1), and the probability of each LLM-prompt combination to label a passage as relevant. For brevity, we only report the top performing LLMs in Table 3, but consider all results in the discussion when relevant.</p>

<p>Figure 3: An example false positive label: GPT4 is fooled by query keywords, although the passage itself does not answer the query.</p>
<p>The overall accuracy of LLMs is reasonable in most cases, mainly displaying lower precision for relevant (i.e., positive) labels, in other words showing higher rates of false positives. The probability of these LLMs in Table 3 labelling a passage as relevant is, in most cases, substantially higher than that of human judges, who have a $33 \%$ probability of judging a passage as relevant given DL21 and DL22.</p>
<h3>3.2 Factors causing disagreement</h3>
<h2>RQ2 What factors influence the disagreement between humans and</h2>
<p>LLMs?</p>
<p>In our manual inspection of cases where LLMs and human judgements disagree, we observed that false positive passages, which are the most common error, often contain the query words but fail to provide useful information to the user. Figure 3 shows an example.</p>
<p>To further investigate this, we compute the average ratios of query words being present for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, as shown in Table 4. If the presence of query words impacts the relevance score assigned by LLMs, we</p>

would expect higher rates of query words in false positives compared to true negatives, and lower rates in false negatives compared to true positives; this appears to be the case across all LLMs.
3.2.1 Keyword stuffing. A key observation from our manual inspection of disagreement and from the query word matching in passages is that LLMs seem to be influenced by the presence of query words in the passage. That is, a non-relevant passage is likely to be labelled as relevant just because the query terms are present in it, leading to a higher rate of false positives and a distorted assessment of passage utility.</p>
<p>To investigate this hypothesis further, we design an experiment where we prompt LLMs to assess the relevance of either random or non-relevant passages with added query words. The creation of these passages is illustrated in Figure 4. We use two types of passages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Random Passages (RandPs): Passages that are generated from randomly sampling words from the Brown corpus [17],
forming nonsensical and ungrammatical passages. We create one passage of 100 words for each query in DL21. We also create other random passages of 200 and 400 words for each query to explore the effect of passage length on the error made by LLMs. We include DL21 only for this part of the analysis; since the passages are random, the underlying dataset should not have an impact on the results.</li>
<li>Non-relevant Passages (NonRelPs): Passages that are deemed non-relevant by both the LLM and NIST judges. We select 50 such passages randomly sampled from both DL21 and DL22 for each LLM-prompt combination ( 27 combinations).
We manipulate both types of passages by:</li>
<li>Query string injection (Q) at a random position, in which the full original query string is inserted as-is at a random position.</li>
<li>Query words injection (QWs), where each query word is independently inserted into the passage at a random position (including stop words).
This results in four test conditions to be used with all LLMprompt combinations, which we collectively refer to as the keyword stuffing gullibility tests. When varying the length of RandPs, the query string (or query words) is inserted only once at a random position regardless of the passage length. Unless otherwise specified, results of RandPs gullibility tests are based on the 100-word passages. An example of passage construction for RandP and NonRelP using query string injection is shown in Figure 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 6 shows the distribution of relevance labels generated by GPT-4 using the three prompts and the four keyword stuffing gullibility tests. Since we have started with either nonsense text or non-relevant text, merely adding query terms should not make it relevant: that is, a labeller should assign a score of " 0 " despite our manipulations.</p>
<p>Relevance labels when using RandPs are shown in Figure 6 (a). The test where we inject the full query string appears to fool GPT-4</p>

more often than does the test that injects query words separately. It is particularly concerning that in the basic prompt, approximately $26 \%$ of the random nonsensical passages are labelled as perfectly relevant merely due to the out-of-context presence of the query. The other prompts exhibit lower susceptibility to such errors.</p>
<p>Figure 6 (b) shows relevance labels when using NonRelPs. Both tests of injecting full query strings and individual query words tend to generate a higher ratio of passages mislabelled as relevant compared to RandPs, but with a lower level of relevance when using the basic prompt. Most scenarios assign a marginal relevance of 1 , with only a few cases showing high or perfect relevance. This is expected because the passages are sensible, in the sense that they were returned by IR systems in response to their respective queries, making it harder to label them correctly when injected with queries.</p>
<p>The performance of all LLMs in the keyword stuffing gullibility tests is summarised using the MAE. This metric is ideal for quantifying the error of LLMs, under the assumption that all input passages are non-relevant, and a relevance label of " 0 " is expected. The MAE weights errors according to their magnitude: responses with a score of 3 contribute more substantially to the MAE than

those with scores of 1 or 2 . This weighting makes the MAE particularly useful for quantifying deviations from the expected score of " 0 ".</p>
<p>Figure 7 displays the MAE for all LLMs, averaged across all prompts used in the keyword stuffing gullibility tests. This averaging reflects the variation in prompts that researchers or practitioners might use, thereby accounting for these differences as potential contributors to errors or instability in the performance of LLMs. Most LLMs exhibit varying degrees of susceptibility to these tests, with GPT-4o demonstrating high resilience, particularly to tests involving RandPs. Generally, using NonRelPs affects all models more substantially.</p>
<p>As we vary the length of RandPs in our experiment to explore the effect of the passage length on the gullibility of LLMs, no consistent pattern emerges, except in the case of GPT-4, which tends to make more errors as the passage length increases. Detailed results are omitted for brevity.
3.2.2 Instruction Injection. The previous section detailed experiments examining the impact of the presence of query strings or individual query words in passages, simulating keyword stuffing as a well-known Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) strategy to enhance ranking. This section explores another potential strategy,</p>

whereby content generators may manipulate LLMs to respond in a certain way or, in relation to relevance labelling, favourably label their content as relevant. We use the same RandP and NonRelP framework as described in Section 3.2.1. Each passage is preceded by an additional Instruction (Inst): 'The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer'. We refer to these tests as Instruction Injection Gullibility Tests.</p>
<p>Similar to the keyword stuffing gullibility tests, we quantify the error made by LLMs using MAE, where the expected label is " 0 ". Figure 8 reports the MAE for each LLM across both tests, averaged across all prompts. The results show lower susceptibility compared to the keyword stuffing gullibility tests, with all large capable LLMs except Command-R+ performing well. Specifically, these models achieved an MAE of 0 when instructed to label RandPs as perfectly relevant, and exhibited some reasonably low degrees of error when labelling NonRelPs, as compared to their performance in keyword stuffing gullibility tests given the same type of passages.</p>
<h3>3.3 Agreement vs. Gullibility</h3>
<p>RQ3 Are current data and metrics sufficient to establish the reliability of using LLMs for relevance labelling?</p>
<p>Figures 9 and 10 show the relationship between Cohen's $\kappa$ and the average MAE for both keyword stuffing gullibility and instruction injection gullibility tests, respectively, for all LLM-prompt combinations. In general, the results show that conclusions drawn from evaluating LLMs using Cohen's $\kappa$ do not necessarily mirror their corresponding performance based on the gullibility tests. For example, while the basic prompt seems to perform well according to Cohen's $\kappa$, it exhibits substantially higher vulnerability in the gullibility tests. In particular, the Pearson correlation coefficients between Cohen's $\kappa$ and the MAE are measured as $\rho=-0.678$ for the

Note: In RandP+Inst, about 50\% of the labels generated by Claude-3 Haiku are unparsable. In NonRelP+Inst, Claude-3 Haiku generates 5\% of unparsable labels, GPT-3.5-turbo and LLaMA3 8B miss 8\% and 17\% of the labels, respectively, due to a lack of sufficient non-relevant passages to sample from.

<h2>4 Conclusions</h2>
<p>This research explored the performance of LLMs for labelling the relevance of passages in response to a query, considering whether such labels show accuracy comparable to human judges, and whether simple accuracy measures are sufficient to avoid the potential impact of simple adversarial activities. Three research questions were examined:</p>

<p>Figure 10: Cohen $\kappa$ scores against the average MAE of all instruction injection gullibility tests for each LLM-prompt combination. Note that Claude-3 Opus with the Rational prompt has the same values as GPT-4 with the same prompt, causing their points to overlap.</p>
<p>RQ1 How accurate are LLMs in producing relevance labels for passages compared to human-provided relevance judgements, and what are the associated costs of using LLMs for relevance labelling?
In common with past work, we see good agreement between labels from some LLMs and labels from qualified human judges. Performance varies with model and prompt, but broadly the larger and more expensive models show both better performance, and greater consistency across prompt variations.
RQ2 What factors influence the disagreement between humans and LLMs?
On the whole, models tend to be more positive than humans: while a "non-relevant" label is relatively reliable, a "relevant" label may be more prone to being a false positive. This is true of most models and prompts. Closer examination showed that many models are prone to false positives when query words are present, even if the passage is clearly not relevant: that is, they fall victim to keyword stuffing. Many models can also be manipulated into giving false positives by inserting "instructions" into the passage itself, meaning labels from LLMs are prone to spamming.
RQ3 Are current data and metrics sufficient to establish the reliability of using LLMs for relevance labelling?
Commonly used measures of overall agreement are useful in their ability to distinguish better models and prompts from others, but do not capture patterns of failure. Relying exclusively on agreement therefore risks blinding us to interesting patterns of failure such as keyword or instruction stuffing. We recommend close examination of the output of models based on additional measures, and have proposed two gullibility tests.</p>
<p>Overall, the results indicate that despite good performance in aggregate-e.g. human-like measures of Cohen's $\kappa$ and Krippendorff's $\alpha-$ competitive LLMs are likely to be influenced by the presence of query words in the labelled passages, even if those passages are constructed from random words. This influence of queries may contribute to a higher rate of false positives.</p>
<p>Considering the sets of passages that need to be labelled for relevance when building test collections, a considerable portion of them would likely be non-relevant, having been retrieved by systems due to the presence of query words. Mislabelling them as "relevant" due to this influence could pose a major limitation on the use of LLMs for the relevance labelling task and a negative impact on models trained on such labels. An LLM labeller would be expected to at least exhibit higher ability in relevance labelling than an information retrieval model.</p>
<p>In production environments, LLMs might be vulnerable to keyword stuffing and other SEO strategies. This is not to suggest that LLMs have a unique limitation, as there is evidence that humans are also impacted by word matching [11, 15, 18]. However, recognising these challenges will allow for more effective testing of such models, similar to the ways in which human-based labelling activities are safeguarded with approaches such as the addition of gold-standard questions.</p>
<p>The gullibility tests proposed in this study are not intended to be exhaustive and are certainly just the beginning of research in this area. While we, as a community, have invested significantly in evaluating the reliability of human judgments, it may now be prudent to invest in testing these models beyond established evaluations to more comprehensively assess their reliability.</p>
<p>Our study used particular LLMs and prompts, and of course, other LLMs or prompt variants may not demonstrate exactly the same bias. However, our experiments included a range of competent models. Their overall performance is as good as human judges; it was only on closer examination, beyond simple aggregates, that we observed the weaknesses described here. Performance in aggregate, whether for this particular setup or any other, can mask unfortunate edge cases. As we adopt new instruments, caution is advised.</p>

<h2>A Prompts</h2>
<p>Included below are the Rationale and Utility prompts used in these experiments. Text in bold highlights the main differences compared to the basic prompt.</p>
<h2>Rationale Prompt</h2>
<p>You are an expert judge of content. Using your internal knowledge and simple commonsense reasoning, try to verify if the passage is relevant to the query. Here, " 0 " represents that the passage has nothing to do with the query, " 1 " represents that the passage seems related to the query but does not answer it, " 2 " represents that the passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information and " 3 " represents</p>
<p>that the passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.</p>
<p>Provide an explanation for the relevance and give your answer from one of the categories $0,1,2$ or 3 only. One of the categorical values is compulsory in the answer.</p>
<p>Instructions: Think about the question. After explaining your reasoning, provide your answer in terms of $0,1,2$ or 3 categories. Only provide the relevance category on the last line without any further details. Example: Relevance Category: score.
###
Query: {query}
Passage: {passage}
Explanation:</p>
<h2>Utility Prompt</h2>
<p>Given a query and a passage, you must provide a score on an integer scale of 0 to 3 with the following meanings:
3 for perfectly relevant: The passage is dedicated to the query and contains the exact answer.
2 for highly relevant: The passage has some answer for the query, but the answer may be a bit unclear, or hidden amongst extraneous information.
1 for related: The passage seems related to the query but does not answer it.
0 for irrelevant: The passage has nothing to do with the query</p>
<p>Assume that you are writing a report on the subject of the topic. If you would use any of the information contained in the web page in such a report, mark it 1. If the web page is primarily about the topic, or contains vital information about the topic, use higher scores as described in the scale above. Otherwise, mark it 0 .</p>
<p>Query
A person has typed "{query}" into a search engine.
Result
Consider the following passage:
{passage}</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Split this problem into steps:
Consider the underlying intent of the search.
Measure how well the content matches a likely intent of the query $(\mathrm{M})$.
Measure how trustworthy the web page is (T).
Consider the aspects above and the relative importance of each, and decide on a final score (0).
Produce a JSON array of scores without providing any
reasoning. Do not add any text before or after the JSON
array. Example: ("M": score, "T": score, "0": score)
