                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans, and LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna. The MT-bench questions, 3K expert votes, and 30K conversations with human preferences are publicly available at https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over $80 \%$ agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna. The MT-bench questions, 3K expert votes, and 30 K conversations with human preferences are publicly available at https : //github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>There has been a proliferation of LLM-based chat assistants (chatbots) that leverage supervised instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to unlock new instruction following and conversational abilities [31, 2, 30, 8, 52, 48, 14]. Once aligned with humans, these chat models are strongly preferred by human users over the original, unaligned models on which they are built. However, the heightened user preference does not always correspond to improved scores on traditional LLM benchmarks - benchmarks like MMLU [19] and HELM [24] cannot effectively tell the difference between these aligned models and the base models. This phenomenon suggests that there is a fundamental discrepancy between user perceptions of the usefulness of chatbots and the criteria adopted by conventional benchmarks.</p>
<p>We argue that this discrepancy primarily arises due to existing evaluation that only measures LLMs' core capability on a confined set of tasks (e.g., multi-choice knowledge or retrieval questions), without adequately assessing its alignment with human preference in open-ended tasks, such as the ability to accurately adhere to instructions in multi-turn dialogues. As a demonstration, we show</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Question: If the FED buys bonds in the secondary market
(A) the money supply will increase. (B) the money supply will decrease. (C) the money supply will not be affected. (D) the discount rate would be affected. Output the answer only.</p>
<h1>Assistant A:</h1>
<p>The Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market to increase the money supply.</p>
<h2>Assistant A:</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve buys bonds in the secondary market to increase the money supply. This affects your daily life by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increasing the money supply.</li>
<li>Increasing the money supply and lowering the discount rate.</li>
<li>Increasing the money supply and lowering the discount rate and increasing the money supply.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Assistant B:</h2>
<p>(A) the money supply will increase.</p>
<ol>
<li>Interest rates: The Federal Reserve's actions in the bond market can influence interest rates, which in turn can affect the cost of borrowing money. For example, if the Federal Reserve buys bonds and drives up demand for them, interest rates on things like mortgages, car loans, and credit cards may go up, making it more expensive to borrow money.</li>
<li>Inflation: When the money supply increases, it can lead to inflation, which is the general rise in prices of goods and services. This can impact your daily life by making it more expensive to buy things like groceries, gas, and other necessities.</li>
<li>Employment: The Federal Reserve's actions in the bond market can also have an impact on employment. For example, if the Federal Reserve's actions lead to economic growth and increased demand for goods and services, it can create more job opportunities and boost employment.</li>
</ol>
<h2>GPT-4 Judgment:</h2>
<p>Assistant A provided an incorrect response to the user's question about how the Federal Reserve buying bonds in the secondary market affects daily life. The answer given is repetitive and lacks clear examples of how the action impacts daily life.
On the other hand, Assistant B provided a relevant and accurate response to the user's question about the Federal Reserve buying bonds. The answer includes three clear examples of how the action impacts daily life, such as interest rates, inflation, and employment.</p>
<p>Assistant A should improve by providing relevant, clear, and accurate examples to address the user's question. Assistant B's response is more helpful, relevant, and detailed.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Multi-turn dialogues between a user and two AI assistants-LLaMA-13B (Assistant A) and Vicuna-13B (Assistant B)-initiated by a question from the MMLU benchmark and a follow-up instruction. GPT-4 is then presented with the context to determine which assistant answers better.
conversation histories with two models on an MMLU question in Figure 1. The two models are LLaMA-13B [39], a pre-trained base model without fine-tuning, and Vicuna-13B, our fine-tuned model from LLaMA-13B on high-quality conversations (the training details are in Appendix E). Despite the base LLaMA models showing competitive performance on conventional benchmarks (Table 8), its answers to open-ended questions are often not preferred by humans. This misalignment of conventional benchmarks underscores the core problem driving this paper: the need for a robust and scalable automated method to evaluate LLM alignment with human preferences.</p>
<p>To study this, we introduce two benchmarks with human ratings as the primary evaluation metric: MT-bench and Chatbot Arena. MT-bench is a series of open-ended questions that evaluate a chatbot's multi-turn conversational and instruction-following ability - two critical elements for human preference. MT-bench is also carefully constructed to differentiate chatbots based on their core capabilities, such as reasoning and math. In addition, we develop Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced platform featuring anonymous battles between chatbots in real-world scenarios - Users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and rate their responses based on personal preferences.</p>
<p>While human evaluation is the gold standard for assessing human preferences, it is exceptionally slow and costly. To automate the evaluation, we explore the use of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, as a surrogate for humans. Because these models are often trained with RLHF, they already exhibit strong human alignment. We call this approach "LLM-as-a-judge". This approach has been tried in our earlier blog post [8] and other concurrent or follow-up work [5, 29, 14, 12, 52, 18, 33, 40, 7, 43]. However, there has not been a systematic study of this approach.</p>
<p>In this paper, we study the LLM-as-a-judge approach by comparing it to the gold standard of human evaluation. We examine several potential limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge approach including position bias, verbosity bias, self-enhancement bias, and limited reasoning ability. We show that some of the biases are minor or can be mitigated.

<p>human evaluations at an agreement rate exceeding 80%, achieving the same level of human-human agreement (§4.2, Table 4). Consequently, this suggests LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable method to swiftly evaluate human preference, serving as a promising alternative to traditional human evaluations.</p>
<p>This paper makes two contributions: (1) a systematic study of LLM-as-a-judge; and (2) human preference datasets with high-quality questions and diverse user interactions from MT-bench and Chatbot Arena. In addition, we argue for the adoption of a hybrid evaluation framework for future LLM benchmarks: by combining the existing capability-based benchmarks and the new preference-based benchmarks with LLM-as-a-judge, one can swiftly and automatically evaluate both the core capabilities and human alignment of models. We publicly release 80 MT-bench questions, 3K expert votes, and 30K conversations with human preferences for future study.</p>

<h1>2 MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena</h1>
<h3>2.1 Motivation</h3>
<p>With the recent advances of LLMs, LLM-based assistants start to exhibit artificial general intelligence across diverse tasks, from writing and chatting to coding [5, 30, 1, 37]. However, evaluating their broad capabilities also becomes more challenging. Despite the availability of numerous benchmarks for language models, they primarily focus on evaluating models on closed-ended questions with short responses. Given that these chat assistants can now precisely follow user instructions in multi-turn dialogues and answer open-ended questions in a zero-shot manner, current benchmarks are inadequate for assessing such capabilities. Existing benchmarks mostly fall into the following three categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Core-knowledge benchmarks, including MMLU [19], HellaSwag [50], ARC [9], WinoGrande [36], HumanEval [6], GSM-8K [10], and AGIEval [51], evaluate the core capabilities of pre-trained LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot benchmark sets. They typically require LLMs to generate a short, specific answer to benchmark questions that can be automatically validated.</li>
<li>Instruction-following benchmarks, such as Flan [27, 46], Self-instruct [44], NaturalInstructions [28], Super-NaturalInstructions [45], expand to slightly more open-ended questions and more diverse tasks and are used to evaluate LLMs after instruction fine-tuning.</li>
<li>Conversational benchmarks, like CoQA [35], MMDialog [15] and OpenAssistant [23], are closest to our intended use cases. However, the diversity and complexity of their questions often fall short in challenging the capabilities of the latest chatbots.</li>
</ul>
<p>While largely overlooked by existing LLM benchmarks, human preferences serve as a direct measure of a chatbot's utility in open-ended, multi-turn human-AI interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce two novel benchmarks expressly tailored to assess human preferences. Simultaneously, these benchmarks are designed to distinguish the core capabilities of state-of-the-art models.</p>
<h3>2.2 MT-Bench</h3>
<p>We create MT-bench, a benchmark consisting of 80 high-quality multi-turn questions. MT-bench is designed to test multi-turn conversation and instruction-following ability, covering common use cases and focusing on challenging questions to differentiate models. We identify 8 common categories of user prompts to guide its construction: writing, roleplay, extraction, reasoning, math, coding,</p>
<p>knowledge I (STEM), and knowledge II (humanities/social science). For each category, we then manually designed 10 multi-turn questions. Table 1 lists several sample questions.</p>
<h1>2.3 Chatbot Arena</h1>
<p>Our second approach is Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourcing benchmark platform featuring anonymous battles. On this platform, users can interact with two anonymous models simultaneously, posing the same question to both. They vote for which model provides the preferred response, with the identities of the models disclosed post-voting. After running Chatbot Arena for one month, we have collected around 30 K votes. Since the platform does not use pre-defined questions, it allows gathering a wide range of unrestricted use cases and votes in the wild, based on the diverse interests of users. A screenshot of the platform can be found at Appendix C.2.</p>
<h2>3 LLM as a Judge</h2>
<p>While our initial evaluations using MT-bench and Chatbot Arena rely on human ratings, collecting human preferences can be costly and laborious [44, 38, 31, 2, 13]. To overcome this, we aim to develop a more scalable and automated approach. Given that most questions in MT-bench and Chatbot Arena are open-ended without reference answers, devising a rule-based program to assess the outputs is extremely challenging. Traditional evaluation metrics based on the similarity between outputs and reference answers (e.g., ROUGE [25], BLEU [32]) are also ineffective for these questions.
As LLMs continue to improve, they show potential in replacing human annotators in many tasks [17, 20]. Specifically, we are interested in whether LLMs can effectively evaluate the responses of chat assistants and match human preferences. Next, we discuss the use and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge.</p>
<h3>3.1 Types of LLM-as-a-Judge</h3>
<p>We propose 3 LLM-as-a-judge variations. They can be implemented independently or in combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pairwise comparison. An LLM judge is presented with a question and two answers, and tasked to determine which one is better or declare a tie. The prompt used is given in Figure 5 (Appendix).</li>
<li>Single answer grading. Alternatively, an LLM judge is asked to directly assign a score to a single answer. The prompt used for this scenario is in Figure 6 (Appendix).</li>
<li>Reference-guided grading. In certain cases, it may be beneficial to provide a reference solution if applicable. An example prompt we use for grading math problems is in Figure 8 (Appendix).
These methods have different pros and cons. For example, the pairwise comparison may lack scalability when the number of players increases, given that the number of possible pairs grows quadratically; single answer grading may be unable to discern subtle differences between specific pairs, and its results may become unstable, as absolute scores are likely to fluctuate more than relative pairwise results if the judge model changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Advantages of LLM-as-a-Judge</h3>
<p>LLM-as-a-judge offers two key benefits: scalability and explainability. It reduces the need for human involvement, enabling scalable benchmarks and fast iterations. Additionally, LLM judges provide not only scores but also explanations, making their outputs interpretable, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
<h3>3.3 Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge</h3>
<p>We identify certain biases and limitations of LLM judges. However, we will also present solutions later and show the agreement between LLM judges and humans is high despite these limitations.
Position bias is when an LLM exhibits a propensity to favor certain positions over others. This bias is not unique to our context and has been seen in human decision-making [3, 34] and other ML domains $[22,41]$.
Figure 11 (Appendix) shows an example of position bias. GPT-4 is tasked to evaluate two responses from GPT-3.5 and Vicuna-13B to an open-ended question. When GPT-3.5's answer is positioned</p>
<p>Table 2: Position bias of different LLM judges. Consistency is the percentage of cases where a judge gives consistent results when swapping the order of two assistants. "Biased toward first" is the percentage of cases when a judge favors the first answer. "Error" indicates wrong output formats. The two largest numbers in each column are in bold.</p>

<p>first, GPT-4 considers GPT-3.5's answer more detailed and superior. However, upon switching the positions of the two responses, GPT-4's judgement flips, favoring Vicuna's answer.</p>
<p>To analyze the position bias, we construct two similar answers to each first-turn question in MT-bench by calling GPT-3.5 twice with a temperature of 0.7 . We then try three LLMs with two different prompts: "default" is our default prompt in Figure 5 (Appendix). "rename" renames the assistants in our default prompt to see whether the bias is on positions or names. As in Table 2, we found all of them exhibit strong position bias. Most LLM judges favor the first position. Claude-v1 also shows a name bias which makes it favors "Assistant A", as illustrated by the "rename" prompt. The position bias can be very significant. Only GPT-4 outputs consistent results in more than $60 \%$ of cases.</p>
<p>Note that this test is challenging because the answers are very similar and occasionally indistinguishable even to humans. We will show that position bias is less prominent in some cases in Appendix D.1. As for the origin of this bias, we suspect that it could be rooted in the training data or inherent to the left-to-right architecture of causal transformers, but leave a deeper study as future work.</p>
<p>Verbosity bias is when an LLM judge favors longer, verbose responses, even if they are not as clear, high-quality, or accurate as shorter alternatives.</p>
<p>To examine this bias, we design a "repetitive list" attack with model answers from MT-bench. We first select 23 model answers from MT-bench that contain a numbered list. We then make them unnecessarily verbose by asking GPT-4 to rephrase the list without adding any new information and insert the rephrased new list to the beginning of the original list. For example, if the original response contains 5 items, then the new response will contain 10 items but the first 5 items are rephrased from the original 5 items. An example is shown in Figure 12 (Appendix). We define the attack is successful if an LLM judge thinks the new response is better than the old response. Table 3 shows the failure rate of LLM judges under this attack, demonstrating that all LLMs may be prone to verbosity bias though GPT-4 defends significantly better than others. As a calibration, we find LLM judges are able to correctly judge identical answers (i.e., they always return a tie for two identical answers) but cannot pass the more advanced "repetitive list" attack.</p>
<p>Self-enhancement bias. We adopt the term "self-enhancement bias" from social cognition literature [4] to describe the effect that LLM judges may favor the answers generated by themselves.</p>
<p>We examine this effect statistically. Figure 3(b) shows the win rate (w/o tie) of six models under different LLM judges and humans. Compared to humans, we do observe that some judges favor certain models. For example, GPT-4 favors itself with a $10 \%$ higher win rate; Claude-v1 favors itself with a $25 \%$ higher win rate. However, they also favor other models and GPT-3.5 does not favor itself. Due to limited data and small differences, our study cannot determine whether the models exhibit a self-enhancement bias. Conducting a controlled study is challenging because we cannot easily rephrase a response to fit the style of another model without changing the quality.</p>
<p>Limited capability in grading math and reasoning questions. LLMs are known to have limited math and reasoning capability [10], which results in its failure of grading such questions because they do not know the correct answers. However, what is more intriguing is that it also shows limitations in grading basic math problems which it is capable of solving. For instance, in Figure 13 (Appendix), we present an example of an elementary math question in which GPT-4 makes an incorrect judgment. It's worth noting that although GPT-4 can solve the problem (when asked separately), it was misled by the provided answers, ultimately resulting in incorrect judgment. This pattern can also be seen in a reasoning question example in Figure 14 (Appendix). Both GPT-3.5 and Claude-v1 show a similar weakness. In Section 3.4, we will introduce a reference-guided method to mitigate such issues.</p>
<h1>3.4 Addressing limitations</h1>
<p>We present a few methods to address position bias and the limited grading ability for math questions.
Swapping positions. The position bias can be addressed by simple solutions. A conservative approach is to call a judge twice by swapping the order of two answers and only declare a win when an answer is preferred in both orders. If the results are inconsistent after swapping, we can call it a tie. Another more aggressive approach is to assign positions randomly, which can be effective at a large scale with the correct expectations. In the following experiments, we use the conservative one.
Few-shot judge. We assess whether few-shot examples can improve consistency in the position bias benchmark. We select three good judgment examples using MT-bench-like questions, GPT-3.5 and Vicuna for generating answers, and GPT-4 for generating judgments. The examples cover three cases: A is better, B is better, and tie. As shown in Table 12 (Appendix), the few-shot judge can significantly increase the consistency of GPT-4 from $65.0 \%$ to $77.5 \%$. However, high consistency may not imply high accuracy and we are not sure whether the few-shot examples will introduce new biases. Besides, the longer prompts make API calls $4 \times$ more expensive. We use the zero-shot prompt by default in our following experiments but leave an additional study in Appendix D.2.
Chain-of-thought and reference-guided judge. In Section 3.3, we have shown LLM's limited capability in grading math and reasoning questions. We propose two simple methods to mitigate this issue: chain-of-thought judge and reference-guided judge. Chain-of-thought is a widely used technique to improve LLM's reasoning capability [47]. We propose a similar technique to prompt an LLM judge to begin with answering the question independently and then start grading. Detailed prompt in Figure 7 (Appendix). However, even with the CoT prompt, we find that in many cases LLM makes exactly the same mistake as the given answers in its problem-solving process (See example in Figure 15 (Appendix), suggesting that LLM judge may still be misled by the context. Hence, we propose a reference-guided method, in which we first generate LLM judge's answer independently, and then display it as a reference answer in the judge prompt. In Table 4, we see a significant improvement in failure rate (from $70 \%$ to $15 \%$ ) over the default prompt.
Fine-tuning a judge model. We try fine-tuning a Vicuna-13B on arena data to act as a judge and show some promising preliminary results in Appendix F.</p>
<h3>3.5 Multi-turn judge</h3>
<p>In MT-bench, every question involves two turns to evaluate conversational abilities. Therefore, when comparing two assistants, it becomes necessary to present a total of two questions and four responses, complicating the prompt design. We explore two possible designs, (1) breaking the two turns into two prompts or (2) displaying complete conversations in a single prompt. Our finding is the former one can cause the LLM judge struggling to locate the assistant's previous response precisely. We illustrate a case in Figure 16 (Appendix) where GPT-4 makes an inaccurate judgment due to a faulty reference. This suggests the necessity of displaying a complete conversation to enable the LLM judge to better grasp the context. We then consider the alternative design that presents two full conversations in a single prompt in which we ask the LLM judge to focus on the second question (Figure 9 (Appendix)). This approach has been found to significantly alleviate the aforementioned referencing issue.</p>
<h1>4 Agreement Evaluation</h1>
<p>We study the agreement between different LLM judges and humans on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena datasets. On MT-bench, we also study the agreement among humans. MT-bench represents a small-scale study with controlled human evaluation, while Chatbot Arena represents a larger-scale study with crowdsourced human evaluation in the wild.</p>
<h3>4.1 Setup</h3>
<p>MT-bench. We generate answers for all 80 questions with 6 models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude-V1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B [38], and LLaMA-13B [39]. We then use 2 kinds of judges: LLM judges and 58 expert-level human labelers. The labelers are mostly graduate students so they are considered experts and more skilled than average crowd workers. We let LLM judges evaluate all pairs and let each human evaluate at least 20 random multi-turn questions. This resulted in around 3 K votes for all questions. The detailed data collection process is in Appendix C.
Chatbot Arena. We randomly sample 3K single-turn votes from 30K arena data, which covers models including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, Vicuna-7B/13B, Koala-13B [16], Alpaca-13B, LLaMA13B, and Dolly-12B. We use two kinds of judges: LLM judges and collected crowd judges (2114 unique IPs).
Metrics. We define the agreement between two types of judges as the probability of randomly selected individuals (but not identical) of each type agreeing on a randomly selected question. See more explanation in Appendix D.3. Average win rate is the average of win rates against all other players. These metrics can be computed with or without including tie votes.</p>
<h3>4.2 High agreement between GPT-4 and humans</h3>
<p>We compute agreement on MT-bench data. In Table 5, GPT-4 with both pairwise comparison and single answer grading show very high agreements with human experts. The agreement under setup S2 (w/o tie) between GPT-4 and humans reaches $85 \%$, which is even higher than the agreement among humans ( $81 \%$ ). This means GPT-4's judgments closely align with the majority of humans. We also show that GPT-4's judgments may help humans make better judgments. During our data collection, when a human's choice deviated from GPT-4, we presented GPT-4's judgments to humans and ask if they are reasonable (details in Appendix C.1). Despite different views, humans deemed GPT-4's judgments reasonable in $75 \%$ of cases and are even willing to change their choices in $34 \%$ of cases.
The data from Arena shows a similar trend, as illustrated by Table 6. Comparing GPT-4 and other LLM judges, we find they reach a similar non-tie agreement ratio between humans but the number of non-tied votes from GPT-4 is much larger. This means that GPT-4 is more affirmative and less suffered from position bias but other models also perform well when they give an affirmative answer.
In both tables, GPT-4 with single-answer grading matches both pairwise GPT-4 and human preferences very well. This means GPT-4 has a relatively stable internal rubric. Although it may sometimes perform slightly worse than pairwise comparison and give more tie votes, it is a more scalable method.
We then perform a breakdown analysis by computing agreement on different model pairs and categories. We only include non-tied votes. In Figure 2, we observe the agreement between GPT-4 and human progressively increases in line with the performance disparity of the model pairs (i.e., larger win rate difference), from $70 \%$ to nearly $100 \%$. This suggests that GPT-4 aligns with humans better when significant performance differences exist between the models.

We report two setups: "S1" includes non-tie, tie, and inconsistent (due to position bias) votes and counts inconsistent as tie; "S2" only includes non-tie votes. The agreement between two random judges under each setup is denoted as "R=". The top value in each cell is the agreement, and the bottom gray value is #votes.</p>

<h1>4.3 Win rates under different judges</h1>
<p>We plot the average win rate of models under different judges on MT-bench and Chatbot Arena in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively. The win rate curves from LLM judges closely match the curves from humans. On MT-bench second turn, proprietary models like Claude and GPT-3.5 are more preferred by the humans compared to the first turn, meaning that a multi-turn benchmark can better differentiate some advanced abilities of models. We also list the per-category win rate of</p>

<p>representative models in Table 7 to show how MT-bench differentiates models, in which we see GPT-4 is significantly better than others. Vicuna-13B is noticeably worse than GPT-3.5/4 in reasoning, math, and coding categories. Note that in math/coding category, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have similar overall win-rate because they both failed to answer some hard questions, but GPT-4 is still significantly better than GPT-3 in the direct pairwise comparison or single-answer grading. Please see a performance breakdown of MT-bench score for each category in Appendix D.4.</p>
<h1>5 Human Preference Benchmark and Standardized Benchmark</h1>
<p>Human preference benchmarks such as MT-bench and Chatbot Arena serve as valuable additions to the current standardized LLM benchmarks. They focus on different aspects of a model and the recommended way is to comprehensively evaluate models with both kinds of benchmarks.</p>
<p>We evaluate several model variants derived from LLaMA on MMLU [19], Truthful QA [26] (MC1), and MT-bench (GPT-4 judge). The training details are in Appendix E. Since we have shown that GPT-4 single-answer grading also performs well in Section 4.2, we use GPT-4 single-answer grading for MT-bench in favor of its scalability and simplicity. We ask GPT-4 to give a score for each turn on a scale of 10 by using our prompt templates (Figure 6, Figure 10) and report an average score of $160=80 \times 2$ turns. Table 8 shows the results. We find that fine-tuning on high-quality dialog datasets (i.e., ShareGPT) can consistently improve the model performance on MMLU and the improvement scales with fine-tuning data size. On the other hand, a small high-quality conversation dataset can quickly teach the model a style preferred by GPT-4 (or approximately human) but cannot improve MMLU significantly, as shown by the Vicuna-7B (selected) which is trained with only 4.8M tokens or 3 K conversations. In Table 8, no single benchmark can determine model quality, meaning that a comprehensive evaluation is needed. Our results indicate that using LLM-as-a-judge to approximate human preferences is highly feasible and could become a new standard in future benchmarks. We are also hosting a regularly updated leaderboard with more models ${ }^{2}$. Notably, DynaBench [21], a research platform dedicated to dynamic data collection and benchmarking, aligns with our spirit. DynaBench addresses the challenges posed by static standardized benchmarks, such as saturation and overfitting, by emphasizing dynamic data with human-in-the-loop. Our LLM-as-a-judge approach can automate and scale platforms of this nature.</p>
<h2>6 Discussion</h2>
<p>Limitations. This paper emphasizes helpfulness but largely neglects safety. Honesty and harmlessness are crucial for a chat assistant as well [2]. We anticipate similar methods can be used to evaluate these metrics by modifying the default prompt. Additionally, within helpfulness, there are multiple dimensions like accuracy, relevance, and creativity, but they are all combined into a single metric in this study. A more comprehensive evaluation can be developed by analyzing and separating these dimensions. We propose preliminary solutions to address the limitations and biases of LLM-as-a-judge in Section 3.4, but we anticipate more advanced methods can be developed.
Data collection and release. Appendix C describes the detailed data collection and release processes, which include the instructions we give to users, the screenshots of the data collection interface, the information about participated users, and the content of the released data.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Societal impacts. The societal impact of this study is multi-faceted. Our evaluation methods can help enhance chatbot quality and user experiences. However, addressing biases in these methods is crucial. Our dataset enables better studies of human preferences and model behavior. Advanced chat assistants may replace certain human tasks, resulting in job displacements and new opportunities.
Future directions. 1) Benchmarking chatbots at scale with a broader set of categories 2) Open-source LLM judge aligned with human preference 3) Enhancing open models' math/reasoning capability.</p>
<h1>7 Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this paper, we propose LLM-as-a-judge for chatbot evaluation and systematically examine its efficacy using human preference data from 58 experts on MT-bench, as well as thousands of crowdusers on Chatbot Arena. Our results reveal that strong LLMs can achieve an agreement rate of over $80 \%$, on par with the level of agreement among human experts, establishing a foundation for an LLM-based evaluation framework.</p>

<h1>B Case Study</h1>
<p>We list several case studies. The examples are generated by gpt-4-0314. They may not be fully reproducible with future GPT-4 versions.</p>
<p>Question: What are some business etiquette norms when doing business in Japan?</p>
<h2>Assistant A:</h2>
<p>Here are some business etiquette norms to keep in mind when doing business in Japan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Bowing: Bowing is a common greeting in Japan. It is a sign of respect and should be reciprocated.</li>
<li>Business cards: Business cards are exchanged at the beginning of a meeting. It is important to receive and give business cards with both hands and to take a moment to read the card before putting it away.</li>
<li>Punctuality: Being on time is important in Japan. Arrive a few minutes early to show respect for your colleagues.</li>
<li>Dress code: Dress conservatively and professionally. Men should wear dark suits and ties, while women should wear conservative business attire.</li>
<li>Language: Learn a few basic Japanese phrases to show respect for the culture. It is also important to speak clearly and avoid using slang or idioms.</li>
<li>Gift giving: Gift giving is a common practice in Japan. Bring a small gift, such as a box of chocolates or a small souvenir from your home country.</li>
<li>Dining etiquette: When dining with colleagues, wait for the host to begin eating before you start. Use chopsticks correctly and avoid leaving food on your plate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, showing respect for Japanese culture and customs is key to building strong business relationships in Japan.</p>
<h2>Assistant B:</h2>
<p>When doing business in Japan, it is important to be aware of and respect the country's business etiquette norms. Some of these norms include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Greetings: A handshake and bow is the standard greeting in Japan. It is important to bow deeply and to offer a firm handshake.</li>
<li>Business cards: In Japan, business cards are exchanged after the initial greeting. It is important to handle the card with respect and to read it carefully before placing it on the table.</li>
<li>Meetings: Meetings in Japan are typically formal and conducted in a hierarchical manner. It is important to address people by their titles and to avoid direct eye contact.</li>
<li>Punctuality: Punctuality is highly valued in Japan. It is important to arrive on time for meetings and to be prepared in advance.</li>
<li>Gift giving: Gift giving is a common practice in Japan, but it is important to be mindful of the occasion and the relationship. Avoid giving gifts that are considered too personal or extravagant.</li>
<li>Dining: Dining is an important part of doing business in Japan. It is important to be aware of the proper table manners and to avoid slurping or making loud noises while eating.</li>
<li>Communication: Communication in Japan is typically indirect and reserved. It is important to listen carefully and to avoid confrontational language.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, it is important to be respectful, punctual, and mindful of hierarchy when doing business in Japan.</p>
<h2>GPT-4 Judgment (when A is placed in the first position):</h2>
<p>Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide helpful and relevant information about business etiquette norms in Japan. However, Assistant A's answer is more detailed and organized, covering a wider range of topics such as dress code and language, which are not mentioned in Assistant B's response. Assistant A also provides more specific advice on how to handle certain situations, such as exchanging business cards and dining etiquette. Therefore, Assistant A's answer is more comprehensive and useful for someone looking to understand Japanese business etiquette.</p>
<h2>GPT-4 Judgment (when B is placed in the first position):</h2>
<p>Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide helpful and relevant information about business etiquette norms in Japan. However, Assistant B's answer is more detailed and covers a wider range of topics, such as addressing people by their titles, avoiding direct eye contact, and being mindful of communication styles. Assistant A's answer is more concise but lacks some of the depth found in Assistant B's response. Therefore, Assistant B's answer is better in this case.</p>
<p>Figure 11: An example of position bias. When Assistant A is placed in the first position, GPT-4 thinks A is better, but its verdict changes when we swap the position of A and B. We observe similar pattern from other LLM judges such as Claude/GPT-3.5.</p>
<p>Question: What is the central dogma of molecular biology? What processes are involved? Who named this?</p>
<h1>Assistant A:</h1>
<p>The central dogma of molecular biology is the fundamental principle that explains how genetic information flows within a biological system. It states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. This means that the genetic information stored in DNA is first copied into RNA, which then serves as a template for the synthesis of proteins.</p>
<p>The processes involved in the central dogma are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transcription rephrased: The act of copying genetic information from DNA to RNA.</li>
<li>Translation rephrased: The act of using genetic information in RNA to create proteins. 3. Transcription: The process by which the genetic information in DNA is copied into RNA. 4. Translation: The process by which the genetic information in RNA is used to synthesize proteins.</li>
</ol>
<p>The term "central dogma" was coined by Francis Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, in 1958.</p>
<h2>Assistant B:</h2>
<p>The central dogma of molecular biology is the fundamental principle that explains how genetic information flows within a biological system. It states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. This means that the genetic information stored in DNA is first copied into RNA, which then serves as a template for the synthesis of proteins.</p>
<p>The processes involved in the central dogma are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Transcription: The process by which the genetic information in DNA is copied into RNA. 2. Translation: The process by which the genetic information in RNA is used to synthesize proteins.</li>
</ol>
<p>The term "central dogma" was coined by Francis Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, in 1958.</p>
<h2>GPT-3.5 Judgment:</h2>
<p>Assistant A provides a more detailed and accurate response to the user's question. While both assistants correctly state the central dogma of molecular biology and who coined the term, Assistant A provides a more comprehensive explanation of the processes involved in the central dogma, including the rephrased definitions of transcription and translation. Therefore, I choose A as the better assistant.</p>
<h2>Claude-v1 Judgment:</h2>
<p>Both assistants answer the question by defining the central dogma and detailing the two processes involved, transcription and translation. However, Assistant A provides a more in-depth and detailed explanation by briefly rephrasing and elaborating on these processes. Assistant A also mentions who coined the term "central dogma", which provides useful context and shows a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Overall, assistant A gives a fuller and more insightful response, so I have chosen it as the better assistant for this question.</p>
<h2>GPT-4 Judgment:</h2>
<p>Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide accurate and relevant information about the central dogma of molecular biology, the processes involved, and who named it. However, Assistant A's answer contains a minor redundancy by rephrasing transcription and translation twice. Assistant B's answer is more concise and avoids this redundancy. Therefore, Assistant B's answer is better.</p>
<p>Figure 12: An example of "repetitive list" attack to examine verbosity bias. Except for the two rephrased items (highlighted in red), Assistant A's answer is exactly the same as Assistant B. Both GPT-3.5 and Claude-v1 show a verbosity bias towards the longer and repetitive answer. Only GPT-4 successfully detected this attack.</p>
<p>Question: Benjamin went to a bookstore and purchased a variety of books. He bought 5 copies of a sci-fi novel, each priced at $\$ 20,3$ copies of a history book priced at $\$ 30$ each, and 2 copies of a philosophy book for $\$ 45$ each. What was the total cost of his purchases?</p>
<h1>Assistant A:</h1>
<p>Assistant B:
The total cost of Benjamin's purchases was $\$ 115$. The total cost of his purchases is $\$ 295$.</p>
<h2>GPT-4 Judgment:</h2>
<p>Assistant B provided the correct answer to the user's question. Assistant A's response was incorrect. To calculate the total cost of Benjamin's purchases, we need to multiply the number of books by their respective prices and then add the results:
5 sci-fi novels * $\$ 20=\$ 100$
3 history books * $\$ 30=\$ 90$
2 philosophy books * $\$ 45=\$ 90$
Total cost $=\$ 100+\$ 90+\$ 90=\$ 295$
Assistant B's response is accurate and directly answers the user's question. Therefore, my final verdict is: [[B]]</p>
<h2>GPT-4's Answer (if asked separately):</h2>
<p>The cost of the sci-fi novels is $5 * \$ 20=\$&lt;&lt;5 * 20=100&gt;&gt;100$.
The cost of the history books is $3 * \$ 30=\$&lt;&lt;3 * 30=90&gt;&gt;90$.
The cost of the philosophy books is $2 * \$ 45=\$&lt;&lt;2 * 45=90&gt;&gt;90$.
The total cost of his purchases is $\$ 100+\$ 90+\$ 90=\$&lt;&lt;100+90=90=280&gt;&gt;280$. Answer: \boxed[280].
Figure 13: With a default prompt, GPT-4 shows limited capability in grading math questions. Despite being able to answer the question itself, its judgment was influenced by the given answers, leading to arithmetic mistakes highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p>Question: Each problem consists of three statements. Based on the first two statements, the third statement may be true, false, or uncertain.
i. Oranges cost more than apples.
2. Oranges cost less than bananas.
3. Bananas cost more than apples and bananas cost more than orange.</p>
<p>If the first two statements are true, then the third statement is</p>
<h2>Assistant A:</h2>
<p>false.
If oranges cost more than apples (statement 1) and oranges cost less than bananas (statement 2), then it is not possible for bananas to cost less than oranges and also cost more than both apples and oranges (statement 3). Therefore, statement 3 is false.</p>
<h2>Assistant B:</h2>
<p>false.
If the first two statements are true, then the third statement is false. The first statement says that oranges cost more than apples, and the second statement says that oranges cost less than bananas. This means that oranges cost less than bananas, which contradicts the third statement that bananas cost more than apples and more than oranges. Therefore, the third statement must be false.</p>
<h2>GPT-4 Judgment:</h2>
<p>Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user's question. They both concluded that the third statement is false based on the first two statements. However, Assistant B's response is slightly clearer and more concise in explaining the contradiction between the statements. Therefore, I choose Assistant B as the better response.
$[[B]]$</p>
<h2>GPT-4's Answer (if asked separately):</h2>
<p>True.
If oranges cost more than apples (statement 1) and oranges cost less than bananas (statement 2), it logically follows that bananas cost more than apples and bananas cost more than oranges, which is the third statement. So, if the first two statements are true, the third one is also true.</p>
<p>Figure 14: An example of GPT-4's limited capability in grading reasoning question. Despite GPT-4 knows how to solve the question (if asked separately), it made a wrong judgement saying both assistants' wrong answers are correct.</p>
<p>Question: How many integers are in the solution of the inequality $|x+\leq|&lt;10$ ?</p>
<h2>Assistant A:</h2>
<p>There are 19 integers in the solution of the inequality $|x+5|&lt;10$.</p>
<h2>Assistant B:</h2>
<p>To solve the inequality $|x+5|&lt;10$, we need to consider two cases:</p>
<p>Case 1: $x+5$ is positive or zero
In this case, the inequality becomes $x+5&lt;10$, which simplifies to $x&lt;5$.</p>
<p>Case 2: $x+5$ is negative
In this case, the inequality becomes $-(x+5)&lt;10$, which simplifies to $-x-5&lt;10$. Adding 5 to both sides gives $-x&lt;15$, and multiplying by -1 (and flipping the inequality) gives $x&gt;-15$.</p>
<p>So the solution to the inequality is $-15&lt;x&lt;5$. The integers in this range are $-14,-13,-12, \ldots, 4$, for a total of 20 integers. Therefore, there are 20 integers in the solution of the inequality.</p>
<h1>GPT-4 Judgment:</h1>
<p>To solve the inequality $|x+5|&lt;10$, we need to consider two cases:
Case 1: $x+5$ is positive or zero

<p>Comparing the answers provided by the two AI assistants:
Assistant A: 19 integers
Assistant B: 20 integers
The correct answer is 20 integers, so Assistant B provided the correct and more helpful response.
Final verdict: [[8]]</p>
<h2>GPT-4's Answer (if asked separatedly):</h2>
<p>We can split the inequality into two cases:</p>
<p>1) If $\$ x+5 \backslash$ ge $0 \$$ ， then $\$|x+5|=x+5 \$$. So, we have $\$ x+5&lt;10 \$$, which means $\$ x&lt;5 \$$. Since $\$ x+5 \backslash$ ge $0 \$$, we have $\$ x \backslash$ ge $-5 \$$. So in this case, $\$ x \$ \operatorname{can}$ be any integer from $\$-5 \$ 5$ to $\$ 4 \$$, inclusive, which gives us $\$ 5-(-5)+1=10 \$$ integers.
2) If $\$ x+5&lt;0 \$$, then $\$|x+5|=-(x+5) \$$. So, we have $\$-(x+5)&lt;10 \$$, which means $\$ x+5&gt;-10 \$$, which means $\$ x&gt;-$ $15 \$$ Since $\$ x+5&lt;0 \$$, we have $\$ x&lt;-5 \$$. So in this case, $\$ x \$$ can be any integer from $\$-14 \$ 5$ to $\$-6 \$$, inclusive, which gives us $\$-6-(-14)+1=9 \$$ integers.</p>
<p>In total, there are $\$ 10+9=\backslash$ boxed(19) $\$$ integers in the solution.</p>
<p>Figure 15: An example of GPT-4's wrong judgment with chain-of-thought prompt. We can see GPT-4 exactly copied Assistant B's answer (which contains arithmetic errors) and determined Assistant A's answer is incorrect. This suggest GPT-4's chain-of-thought process can be significantly influenced by the given answers despite we ask it to think independently.</p>
