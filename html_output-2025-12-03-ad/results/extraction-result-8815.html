                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This systematic review provides a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art research on data-to-text generation, addressing gaps, highlighting challenges, and proposing future directions. We examined various approaches in this field, assessing their effectiveness and limitations, while surveying literature on datasets, evaluation metrics, application areas, multilingualism, and methods for mitigating hallucinations. We shed light on the usage, popularity, and impact of datasets, alongside evaluation metrics, emphasizing both automatic and human assessment. Additionally, we explore the evolution of data-to-text models, emphasizing the widespread adoption of transformer models. With a focus on inclusivity, we stress the importance of research in low-resourced languages. Despite notable advancements in text quality, we examine strategies utilized to tackle hallucinations in models and advocate for universally applicable techniques. This review serves as a roadmap to inspire innovation, establish evaluation benchmarks, and drive progress in data-to-text generation.</p>

This systematic review undertakes a comprehensive analysis of current research on data-to-text generation, identifying gaps, challenges, and future directions within the field.Relevant literature in this field on datasets, evaluation metrics, application areas, multilingualism, language models, and hallucination mitigation methods is reviewed.Various methods for producing high-quality text are explored, addressing the challenge of hallucinations in data-to-text generation.These methods include re-ranking, traditional and neural pipeline architecture, planning architectures, data cleaning, controlled generation, and modification of models and training techniques.Their effectiveness and limitations are assessed, highlighting the need for universally applicable strategies to mitigate hallucinations.The review also examines the usage, popularity, and impact of datasets, alongside evaluation metrics, with an emphasis on both automatic and human assessment.Additionally, the evolution of data-to-text models, particularly the widespread adoption of transformer models, is discussed.Despite advancements in text quality, the review emphasizes the importance of research in low-resourced languages and the engineering of datasets in these languages to promote inclusivity.Finally, several application domains of data-to-text are highlighted, emphasizing their relevance in such domains.Overall, this review serves as a guiding framework for fostering innovation and advancing data-to-text generation.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>"Natural Language Generation" (NLG) is a specific branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the conversion of non-linguistic data or information representations into text.Its primary objective is to develop computer systems capable of generating understandable and coherent text in human languages, such as English and helping to boost communication between humans and machines [1].Natural language generation techniques are used in summarization [2], text simplification [3], machine translation [4], image captioning [5], dialogue generation [6], and question answering [7; 8].As a subfield of natural language processing, its applications have evolved to accommodate two categories depending on the nature of the input: text-to-text generation and datato-text generation.Data-to-text is defined as the task of generating comprehensible texts from structured inputs [1].These structured inputs or data can be table records [9; 10], graphs [11; 12], charts [13], or databases [14].They can also be images, such as in image captioning, but we will focus on non-image structured data for this study.The data-to-text field aims to simplify complex data and provide easy comprehension and access to a broader, unspecialized, or specific audience [15; 16].</p>
<p>The initial approach to data-to-text generation employed a modular pipeline architecture.In this setup, each module was typically addressed using a rule-based method [1].However, owing to the progress technology has made over the years, with the introduction of powerful GPUs, large storage devices, and deep neural networks.The need to write only rules became obsolete since the model can understand and follow input patterns to generate desired text at a much faster computation rate.As a rapidly growing field of research, tasks such as weather forecasts [17], sports news reporting [18], financial reports [19], robo-journalism [12], health care [20], and autobiographies [21] etc., which require textual summaries from structured data, can now be potentially automated with this technology.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>This section provides a concise overview of the diverse aspects of data-to-text systems, encompassing traditional, statistical, and contemporary neural approaches.Aiming to offer insights into the evolving trends and methodologies employed in the field of data-to-text generation.</p>
<p>Traditional Data-to-Text Systems</p>
<p>Traditional systems for data-to-text generation are commonly based on rules or utilize sets of templates created by humans.These templates include placeholders for slot values filled with dialogue inputs during execution [1; 15; 22; 23].In the process of templatization, natural language expressions are transformed into templates, where words directly representing data are replaced with slots according to rules derived from the text and consistencies in the data.The data-to-template generation is then applied to these templates, resulting in the generation of template sentence texts [23].However, the text generation process of this system is divided into distinct stages or modules, each dedicated to a specific task.Reiter and Dale [1] proposed a traditional five-module pipeline architecture for data-to-text generation, addressing the questions of "What to say?" and "How to say it?".These stages include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content selection: Determines the information to be mentioned in the text.2. Content ordering: Arrange this information in their appropriate sequences in the text.3. Content aggregation/structuring: Organises this information in separate sentences and paragraphs.4. Lexicalization: Finds appropriate phrases or words that best relay the message in the sentence.5. Referring expression generation: Generates referring expressions (references, coreferences), like proper nouns, he, she, they, and him, to the entities in the text/discourse where necessary.6. Surface realization: It combines the output of all the other steps toward generating a complete text from the input data.</li>
</ol>
<p>This system provides built-in faithfulness to input, a carefully regulated style, and quick response times, rendering them an attractive option.Nevertheless, they need help in scalability since creating new templates for diverse responses is necessary, and templates from one domain may not consistently apply to other domains.Despite substantial time and resource investments to incorporate linguistic details into the templates, they often need more contextual understanding, and the restricted template set hampers the system's overall naturalness [22].</p>
<p>Statistical Data-to-Text Systems</p>
<p>Statistical systems for summarizing data into text employ probabilistic models, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) [9; 24] and alignment learning [25], to transform non-linguistic data into human-readable text.These models, specifically a probabilistic generative model, operate by concurrently segmenting text into utterances and mapping each utterance to a meaning representation grounded in the world state [25].</p>
<p>Operating on a probabilistic foundation, these models predict the most likely subsequent word in the target sequence based on the input data sequence.Generative models, designed to address multiple ambiguities with a focus on aligning utterances to facts, concentrate on the probability distribution for each word during alignment learning [25].This modeling of the intrinsic distribution of data points is achieved through joint probability, where the input and output coexist.The result is effective alignment of utterances to facts, minimizing the need for extensive supervision, adept handling of multiple ambiguities, and demonstration of generalizability across diverse domains [25].</p>
<p>Neural Data-to-Text Systems</p>
<p>In recent times, advances in generative models have offered fluent, more natural texts and data-driven scaling narratives as compared to traditional systems [22].Modern data-to-text generation involves the production of natural language text descriptions in sequences that explain non-linguistic data.Let D represent the data pairs {r j , s j } N j=1 of N instances of the data records r, mapped to its human generated summaries s in an n sequence of words (w 1 , ..., w n ).This process aims to map and learn a correlation between these data pairs and generate text based on these learned properties.Several techniques have been employed in learning these latent variables, some of which are the seq-to-seq model, seq-to-seq model with copy mechanism [26; 27], and the transformer attention models [28; 29].Notably, transformer attention models focus on specific properties deemed relevant during the text generation process.These properties are critical for capturing contextual relationships and enhancing the overall quality of generated text.</p>
<p>One of the significant problems in neural text generation is the occurrence of hallucinations, repetitions, omissions, inconsistencies, and a lack of coherence, which can compromise the quality and credibility of the content [7; 30].Furthermore, there is a need for more resources and datasets for languages other than English, which hinders the development and enhancement of models for these languages [7].Addressing these issues is critical for improving the accuracy and efficacy of language models in generating high-quality content.Improved deep learning models that prioritize error reduction need to be developed, and more diverse datasets and resources in multiple languages should be available to train and validate these models.</p>
<p>Related Surveys</p>
<p>A systematic review of the literature on data-to-text is required to encapsulate trends, find critical challenges and techniques, and fill in the information gaps.Several literature surveys in the field of NLG have tried to show the contributions made in the field, with studies focusing more on other text generation tasks, their training and generation methods [7], a systematic review of text generation tasks [31], its applications areas [15], hallucination and semantic adequacy measures [30; 32], evaluation metrics [33], and the evolution of deep learning models in NLG [34].A related study by Sharma et al. [35] captures the advancements in data-to-text techniques, datasets, and evaluation methods.In our study, we will expound on the existing literature, methods, languages, application areas, hallucination mitigation measures, and quality of the generated texts using structured data.</p>
<p>For this study, we will only consider structured data such as tables, RDF (Resource Description Framework) [36], knowledge bases or graphs [37], SQL (Structured Query Language) [14], AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) [38], MR (Meaning Representation) [9], and MRS (Minimal Recursion Semantics) [39].We will also consider studies that focus on data-to-text generation and extract meaningful information about our research questions.</p>
<p>The first chapter focuses on the need for this systematic review and its structure, including how each chapter is organized.In Section 2, we will discuss the methodologies following the PRISMA 2020 [40] techniques for collecting and selecting relevant papers for this study.Section 3 discusses the results of the metadata extracted from the studies.The last sections 4, 5 and 6 offer discussions, recommendations and future directions, as well as the conclusion of the study.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Our survey on data-to-text adopts a systematic review approach, following the guidance set forth in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Page et al. [40] systematic review recommendations.We commence by formulating core research questions as the cornerstone of our investigation.Subsequently, we outline our search strategies and the electronic databases utilized for this purpose.Inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to refine the paper selection, and we conclude by defining our procedures for data extraction and synthesis.</p>
<p>Research Questions</p>
<p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the data-to-text domain and guide our research endeavors, we have formulated a primary research question.From this central query, we have derived a set of sub-questions, each illuminating a distinct facet of this domain.In the course of this paper, we will delve into these sub-questions in detail.Our primary research question is defined as follows: RQ: What does the existing literature in Natural Language Generation (NLG) reveal about text generation using structured data as input?Below, we present the derived sub-questions, each offering insight into specific aspects of our inquiry.These sub-questions will serve as the framework for our exploration: RQ1.Which standard datasets are commonly utilized for data-to-text generation in the literature?RQ2.Which languages are prevalent in data-to-text generation literature?RQ3.What are the techniques and design methods typically employed in data-to-text generation?RQ4.What measures are commonly employed to mitigate hallucinations in the generated text?RQ5.What are the prominent evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of generated texts?RQ6.Which application areas are explored in the context of data-to-text generation?</p>
<p>Search Strategies</p>
<p>We meticulously curated literature from various esteemed databases, focusing primarily on studies presented at conferences and published in journals renowned for their contributions to the field of Natural Language Generation.The information in Table 1 enumerates the conferences and journals pivotal to our research, while Figure 1b displays the categorization of venues as conferences or journals for the study publications.Our search efforts extended across various databases, including Google Scholar 1 , ACL anthology 2 , IEEE 3 , and Semantic Scholar 4 .To make the search more manageable, we downloaded a full Bibtex anthology with abstracts on the ACL anthology web page, deleted the bibliographies of studies less than 2017 and imported it into the Mendeley desktop application.Then, we implemented the search strategies on the bibliographies in the Mendeley desktop application and also conducted searches on other listed databases.It's worth highlighting that our database searches were conducted from September to October 2022.</p>

<p>Study Screening and Selection</p>
<p>Through the application of our search strategies, we amassed a substantial corpus of 1,078 pieces of literature.However, our dataset settled at 1,052 unique studies after diligently purging duplicate entries.The inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study are outlined below.</p>
<p>Inclusion Criteria 1. Focus on data-to-text generation, even if other text generation forms are considered.2. Publication within the period from 2017 to 2022. 3. Publications in high-impact factor journals and conferences, spanning from A1-B2 and Q1-Q2 categories.4. Inclusion of survey papers and shared task papers in data-to-text generation. 5. Literature written exclusively in English.6. Minimum of 5 citations.The extensive dataset obtained through our search strategy underwent thorough filtering, during which we carefully applied our inclusion and exclusion criteria.This process whittled down our dataset to a more manageable 635 studies.Our commitment to precision persisted as we further refined our dataset with updated inclusion and exclusion criteria, as shown above.Simultaneously, we gathered citation data for each study using Google Scholar.As a result, we excluded 412 studies from the original 635, retaining a robust set of 223 studies, each with citations equal to or exceeding 5. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of these 223 studies was undertaken through a comprehensive review of abstracts and contents.Papers that did not align with the eligibility criteria were meticulously filtered out by carefully reading the abstracts.In cases where abstracts were insufficient for determining eligibility, the entire paper was thoroughly examined.This meticulous process culminated in the selection of a final set of 90 papers for detailed examination and inclusion in our research.Notably, exclusions were made for papers not written in English, lacking human evaluation, or lacking a link to the code implementation.Exceptions were granted for 5 papers without human evaluation and 11 papers without code availability.Figure 1a illustrates the distribution of our papers across the chosen years.</p>
<p>Data Extraction and Synthesis</p>
<p>The data extracted from the 90 selected studies encompassed details such as the dataset used, the methodology employed, multilingual aspects, the evaluation metrics utilized, error mitigation strategies, and application areas.This information was systematically organized into a table and subjected to further analysis.The data synthesis, which relies on the information obtained during the extraction process, will be elaborated upon in the following section.Our categorization of datasets in the analysis encompasses eight distinct structured data types: Table, AMR, RDF, MR, SQL, Graph, JSON, and MRS.</p>

<p>E2E The E2E [112] dataset is a crucial resource for training end-to-end, datadriven natural language generation systems, specifically in the restaurant domain.It was gathered through crowdsourcing and meticulous quality control, using images as stimuli to evoke more natural and well-articulated human references than textual MRs.This dataset, openly released as part of the E2E NLG challenge, is approximately ten times larger than its predecessors.It introduces novel challenges due to its size, lexical diversity, syntactic intricacies, and discourse complexities.Learning from this dataset promises to generate more natural, diverse, and less template-like system utterances.It comprises a rich set of 50,602 English verbalizations paired with 5,751 dialogue-act-based meaning representations.The dataset is thoughtfully partitioned into training, validation, and testing subsets, maintaining a consistent distribution of MR and reference text lengths while ensuring MR variation across different sets.Each MR encompasses 3-8 attributes or slots, including information such as name, food, area, and corresponding values.</p>
<p>AMR The Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) [113] dataset 17 , encompassing series such as LDC2011T07, LDC2015E86, LDC2016E25, LDC2017T10, LDC2020T02, and LDC2020T07, presents a structured representation of semantic information.AMR is represented as a rooted, directed, acyclic graph with labelled edges (relations) and nodes (concepts), capturing the essence of "who is doing what to whom".It serves as a foundation for generating sentences that convey the semantics encoded within the graph.Specifically, LDC2017T10 within this series comprises 36,521 training instances of AMR graphs in PENMAN notation [114], along with their corresponding texts.Additionally, it includes 1,368 development instances and 1,371 test instances, providing a substantial resource for research and development in AMR parsing and natural language understanding and generation.</p>
<p>WikiBio The WikiBio dataset [21] is a comprehensive collection of biographical information covering individuals from diverse professions.This extensive dataset comprises over 10 million records, providing details such as names, dates of birth, occupations, and education.Focused on curating 728,321 biographies sourced from English Wikipedia, it serves as a valuable resource for evaluating text generation algorithms.The dataset encompasses the initial paragraph of each biography alongside its associated infobox, both tokenized to facilitate processing.Arranged in a standardized tabular layout, it proves to be of great utility for a range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, summarization, entity identification, and data extraction.Researchers can utilize this dataset for the development and evaluation of algorithms and models geared toward the analysis of biographical text.</p>
<p>RotoWire The RotoWire dataset [46], designed for table-to-text generation, offers a robust platform for generating human-like summaries from basketball game tables.With 4.9K examples and 1.6M tokens from rotowire.com, it includes game data and corresponding human-written summaries.RotoWire features extended texts and a diverse vocabulary, making content selection more challenging.It leverages table records to generate structured yet informal game summaries, appealing to those interested in game statistics.This dataset proves valuable for assessing data-to-document generation systems, especially in basketball game summaries.It presents the complex task of converting structured data into coherent, informative text, accommodating diverse audiences and writing styles.Researchers can employ it to develop and evaluate table-to-text generation models, advancing natural language generation in specific domains.</p>
<p>ToTTo The ToTTo dataset [10], is a valuable resource in table-to-text generation within an open-domain English context.It comprises a substantial training set of over 120,000 instances.Its primary objective is generating a controlled one-sentence description task based on the information in a Wikipedia table, mainly focusing on the highlighted table cells.The dataset's creation involved a meticulous process wherein noisy descriptions were meticulously paired with tables, and any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the highlighted cells were diligently rectified through iterative refinement.ToTTo stands as a pivotal benchmark for advancing high-precision, faithful, and conditional text generation research.</p>
<p>WMT Since its inception in 2006, the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT) has been a hub for machine translation shared tasks and competitions.Its impact extends to other fields of natural language generation, such as in multilingual datato-text generation [4; 48; 108].Initially centered around translation tasks, WMT has evolved to encompass various aspects, including biomedical, multimodal, and lowresource translation.The General primary Machine Translation task, previously known as the News Task, remains a core component.Additionally, WMT features evaluation tasks like Metrics and Quality estimation.Over the years, some tasks have been discontinued, but WMT's shared task results and datasets remain crucial benchmarks for advancing machine translation research.The WMT dataset is sourced from the OPUS corpus [115], and it consists of a parallel corpus in 18 languages, primarily from the news domain.It includes news commentary text extracted mainly from online news sources, with the test data containing about 1000 sentence pairs.While most languages are paired with English, some are also paired with languages other than English such as German, Russian, French, Spanish, Italian and Chinese.The competition offers training sets compiled from various sources [116; 117].</p>
<p>Viggo The ViGGO dataset [28] addresses limitations in existing data-to-text NLG corpora by focusing on video game descriptions and providing a more conversational context.It includes over 100 video game titles and their attributes, resulting in 2,300 structured meaning representations (MRs).These MRs cover nine different dialogue act types (DAs), making ViGGO suitable for open-domain dialogue systems.Crowdsourced reference utterances were collected for each MR, enabling neural language generation models to learn multiple ways of expressing the same content.While smaller in size compared to the E2E dataset, ViGGO offers greater lexical diversity, longer inform utterances, and a more natural-sounding context due to its grounding in real video game data.Additionally, ViGGO maintains a focus on shorter, conversational responses.</p>
<p>Language</p>
<p>Multilingualism has emerged as a crucial aspect of natural language generation within data-to-text field, showcasing the remarkable progress achieved in handling structured data across various languages.Data-to-text generation has faced numerous challenges when it comes to multilingual outputs, with English often dominating as the primary target language for generation tasks.In our analysis of the 90 selected papers, a striking trend is evident: 89 of them focused on generating summaries from structured data in English.While English takes the lead, other languages also make appearances, with German, Russian, French, Spanish, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese featuring in 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, and 2 papers, respectively.A variety of other languages were utilized in just one paper each, as illustrated in Table 4.</p>

Notably, a noteworthy study by Fan et al. [55] introduced a multilingual method for generating text from AMRs across twenty-one (21) EUROPARL languages.Similarly, researchers such as Xu et al. [79], Nema et al. [26], and Moussallem et al. [106] [109], and Teixeira et al. [12], have centered their efforts on bilingual text generation within the data-to-text context.Significant advancements have indeed been achieved in the domain of multilingual data-to-text generation, particularly in English, Chinese, and select European languages.Nonetheless, it is apparent that additional research is essential to advance this field.This research is needed to enable proficient multilingual generation across a more diverse range of languages, including those with diverse morphological structures and word order characteristics, as emphasized in Fan et al. [55] work.</p>

<p>In the field of data-to-text generation, various methodologies have been explored, including templates, statistical models, and neural network-based generation models.A significant number of studies selected for this systematic review opted for neural network models, ranging from basic sequence-to-sequence models [118] to advanced designs such as transformers [119] and large pretrained language models.Several studies have introduced refinements to these models to enhance their performance and set new benchmarks.Notably, research conducted by 27 studies, integrated a copy mechanism that uses probabilistic strategies to determine when and which tokens should be directly copied from the reference data.This copy model is particularly useful for ensuring that all data values appear in the generated text [98].Building on this innovation, subsequent investigations by five (5) studies devised fused attention [26] and hierarchical attention [67], improving decoder focus on input tokens and enhancing overall generation quality.However, some of these studies employed recurrent neural networks with static embeddings, which have shown suboptimal performance across various application domains such as in AMR-to-text [65; 2], MR-to-text [68], table-to-text [26] and in data-to-text [54].</p>
<p>Another line of research has focused on retaining the graph structure of the data using graph encoders [65] in graph neural network (GNN).Originally, graph data were linearized into sequences to accommodate sequence-to-sequence models.However, graph encoding has emerged as a promising method in data-to-text generation, especially in AMR-to-text generation.Graph encoders offer improvements over basic sequence-to-sequence models by inherently learning the graph structure and existing relations in the encoder and using an ordinary decoder to generate desired texts.</p>
<p>Ribeiro et al. [51] leveraged dual graph representations in AMR-to-text generation, effectively encoding divergent but complementary perspectives of the structural information in the AMR graph by simultaneously learning top-down and bottom-up node representations [51].The study by Zhao et al. [71] introduced DUALENC, a dual encoding model that addresses the structural gap in data-to-text generation by incorporating both graph and linear structures.This approach significantly improves text quality compared to single-encoder models, especially for structured inputs like trees or graphs.The DUALENC [71] model integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) encoders with an intermediate content planning stage.This combination allows the model to capture structural information and enhance the compatibility between input and output sequences [71].Another research Li et al. [80] introduces a hierarchical encoder equipped with a reasoning module for graph-based reasoning, which enhances the ability to capture various relations between records in different dimensions.This research also introduces auxiliary supervision tasks, including number ranking and importance ranking, to further improve the model's ability to handle different record relations [80].These advancements contribute significantly to the field of GNNs.Eighteen (18) papers were found to have used this method to improve on existing baselines.</p>
<p>To address the limitations of static embedding models, some research efforts have embraced transformer models such as RNN transformers [120; 121], BERT [119], T5 [122], BART [123], XLM [124], and GPT-2 [125] for data-to-text generation tasks.These transformer-based models incorporate contextualized embeddings and use positional encoding due to their non-recurrent nature.They are trained on a large corpus of online curated texts and seem to perform well across several domains after finetuning.A total of 38 studies incorporated transformer models into their research, as detailed in Table 5.</p>
<p>Hallucination Mitigation Measures</p>
<p>In the context of data-to-text, hallucination refers to the generation of content that lacks fidelity or is not supported by the source data provided [66].Divergence can also be considered a form of hallucination when it occurs in the reference text, signifying a deviation from the expected or accurate information [66].This highlights the importance of generating text that remains faithful to the underlying data and references.</p>
<p>To address and reduce errors and hallucinations in data-to-text generation, several strategies have been deployed.These strategies encompass a wide range of approaches, including dataset cleaning and standardization, the development of novel training modules and techniques, as well as the application of knowledge distillation methods [104].</p>
<p>In the subsequent subsections, we will delve into specific papers and elucidate the strategies they have employed to address challenges and improve data-to-text generation.This comprehensive exploration will provide valuable insights into the diverse approaches and techniques used in the field to enhance the quality and fidelity of generated text.</p>
<p>Dataset Refinement and Post Editing</p>
<p>Effective refinement of datasets and post-editing play an essential role in enhancing the quality and accuracy of data-to-text generation.Wang [101] made a significant contribution to this field by focusing on boosting factual accuracy.Their work involves developing Rotowire-FG, which stands for Fact Grounding-purified version of Rotowire [46].Within this context, they incorporated content normalization techniques aimed at boosting the overall accuracy of the generated text.These techniques involve actions like converting number words into their corresponding numerical values and standardizing mentions of entities, contributing to improved text fidelity and reliability [101].</p>
<p>In addition, the TOTTO dataset [10] facilitates the controlled generation of concise descriptions derived from Wikipedia tables.This initiative aimed to enhance controllability in data-to-text generation, addressing issues previously associated with crowd-sourced datasets, which is the incomplete alignment of information in the table and their corresponding summaries.Chen et al. [29] addresses logical-level generation, presenting the LOGIC2TEXT dataset designed for generating high-fidelity descriptions from logical forms.To address scientific data-to-text challenges, Suadaa et al. [76] emphasize numerical reasoning in textual descriptions, as evidenced by the creation and utilization of the numericNLG dataset [76].Collectively, these efforts improve data-to-text generation, enhancing text accuracy and coherence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shimorina and Gardent [27] focuses on handling rare items or entities in the generated text.Their approach involves post-processing the text to replace placeholders with the appropriate values based on a mapping between placeholders and initial values created during pre-processing.This strategy further enhances the fidelity of the generated text.</p>
<p>Training Techniques and Model Modification</p>
<p>In this field, Gong et al. [52] presents an innovative architecture, a hierarchical encoder for table-to-text generation that excels at encapsulating the intricacies of multi-dimensional table data.The model's ability to encode row, column, and time dimensions simultaneously enables it to generate text summaries that are both highly informative and coherent.A study Ribeiro et al. [59], introduces STRUCTADAPT, which leverages adapter modules to incorporate graph structure into pretrained language models (PLMs) for better Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) to text generation, resulting in enhanced performance compared to prior approaches [59].</p>
<p>Neural generation models use various strategies to reduce hallucination, including soft templates [98], copy mechanisms, content planning, and structure-aware systems [54].Training methodologies have evolved significantly, with some studies using paired training with unlabeled text [64], and others implementing a two-tiered approach involving an information extraction model and an attention-based encoder-decoder text generation model [46].The JointGT model by Ke et al. [90] enhances Knowledge Graph to text generation tasks by leveraging graph structure and pre-training tasks.</p>
<p>On a different note, (2) papers delved into Reinforcement Learning (RL) for data-to-text generation.Rebuffel et al. [104] introduces PARENTing, a reinforcement learning framework that is model-agnostic.This framework fine-tunes pretrained models using self-critical policy gradient algorithms to minimize hallucination in text generation by addressing divergence in training examples.Another study used multitask learning and reinforcement learning to incorporate content selection mechanisms into the encoder-decoder models [82].</p>
<p>Controllabilty and Constraints decoding</p>
<p>Controllability is achieved in data-to-text generation by introducing constraints and supervision during the decoding process or in the decoder.Various studies have contributed to this field:</p>
<p>• Lin et al. [42] [74] segments target text into fragments that align with data records, improving the control and interpretability of the generated output.This automatic segmentation, which adapts to domain-specific requirements, employs a soft statistical constraint to regularize the granularity of the segments [74].• Wang et al. [78] introduces Mention Flags (MF), a unique method that guarantees constraint satisfaction in Transformer-based text generation.By tracking the fulfilment of lexical constraints in the generated text and integrating them into the S2S Transformer models, MF ensures the creation of high-quality text that complies with the given constraints [78].• Lu et al. [86] presents NEUROLOGIC Aesque, an innovative decoding algorithm, inspired by A* search and designed for large-scale language models, that enables constrained text generation.This is achieved by combining heuristic cost estimates and logic-based lexical constraints, enhancing Constrained Machine Translation and Keyword-constrained generation [86].• Hardy and Vlachos [2] introduces a new method to improve AMR-based summarization by guiding it with the source document.This two-step process estimates the distribution of missing linguistic data and uses it to guide a seq2seq model, enhancing summary fluency and quality.</p>
<p>Ranking System</p>
<p>Eight (8) papers utilized rankers to improve the fidelity of the generated text [63; 105; 44; 83; 109; 11; 71; 80].The process of reranking in text generation, specifically within the decoder, is aimed at enhancing the quality and reducing semantic errors in the generated text.This involves the creation of rules or the use of an auxiliary classifier to verify if input slots are represented in the output, an important factor in maintaining semantic quality.Rerankers are commonly applied to the final hypotheses to enhance beam search and address its limitations.This can be achieved by establishing a reranking criterion or training a reranker to predict the best hypothesis within a beam based on function scores [63; 83; 11].The strategy employed involves over-generation, followed by reranking of potential outputs using criteria that were not explicitly optimized during training.The reranked outputs favour those with fewer missing or incorrect slot mentions, thereby enhancing accuracy and relevance [105; 63].This approach extracts meaningful information from encoder-decoder models and uses it to identify which attributes are mentioned in the generated text.</p>
<p>Additionally, A promising development in neural data-to-text generation is the introduction of a trainable evaluation metric.This metric, particularly useful when tables have multiple associated textual references, uses ranking models to assess the correctness of generated hypotheses by comparing them to the original table and corresponding references.It aims to overcome the limitations of existing metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, which do not fully capture the faithfulness of generated text to both the input table and references [44].</p>
<p>Pipeline and Planning Architecture Systems</p>
<p>In a survey of Natural Language Generation (NLG) architectures and methodologies, Gatt and Krahmer [15] categorizes NLG approaches into three main architectural paradigms: Modular, Planning, and Integrated (Global) architectures.These architectures encompass various generation systems, which are classified based on their methodological approach and design choices [15].To address challenges such as hallucination, omissions, and errors encountered in data-to-text generation, eleven (11) papers in total made use of this modular architecture.</p>
<p>Three (3) of these studies [23; 95; 12] resorted to traditional data-to-text methods.These methods typically involve a sequential process encompassing discourse ordering, text structuring, lexicalization, referring expression generation, and textual realization.These stages can be further categorized into macro planners, which combine content selection and document planning, and micro planners, which involve sentence aggregation, lexicalization, and referring expression generation [15].</p>
<p>In contrast, recent studies have witnessed a departure from traditional rule-based approaches in the initial planning stages.Instead, five (5) studies have adopted endto-end models for generating text, spanning from intermediate stages to the final surface realization.This transition aims to assess the efficacy of end-to-end models when compared to conventional rule-based or template systems [36; 11; 68; 107; 89].This shift underscores the dynamic evolution in NLG methodologies and architectural preferences.</p>
<p>Furthermore, four (5) investigations [83; 24; 16; 49; 71] have sought to compare the performance of neural modular architectures against end-to-end neural architectures.Collectively, these research findings indicate that supervised neural modularization or pipelining within data-to-text architectures leads to notable improvements in fluency, fidelity, and the overall quality of generated text summaries.These enhancements primarily result from error reduction during content selection, the model's ability to capture long-term structural dependencies, and the accurate ordering of facts [46; 49].Shao et al. [50] introduces the Planning-based Hierarchical Variational Model (PHVM) to address the limitations of existing neural methods in generating long and diverse texts in data-to-text generation tasks.The PHVM incorporates a planning mechanism and a hierarchical latent structure to capture inter-sentence coherence and generate varied expressions.By decomposing long text generation into dependent sentence generation sub-tasks, the model effectively models input data dynamically during generation [50].</p>
<p>Evaluation Metric</p>
<p>In data-to-text generation, assessing the quality and suitability of generated text has relied on various metrics over the years.These assessments can be broadly categorized into two groups: automatic evaluation and human evaluation.Automatic evaluation employs computational methods to measure text quality, while human evaluation enlists human participants to capture nuanced aspects of text quality and coherence.</p>
<p>Automatic Evaluation</p>
<p>N-gram Metrics</p>
<p>Our analysis indicates that the most commonly employed automatic metric is BLEU [126], with a substantial presence in 80 papers.It is closely followed by METEOR [127], which is employed in 40 papers, demonstrating its continued relevance.ROUGE [128], with 17 papers utilizing it, has also been a consistent choice for assessing generated text quality.Furthermore, CHrF++ [129], used in 10 papers, and NIST [130], applied in 9 papers, have offered valuable insights into the evaluation of data-to-text outputs.These metrics, while non-semantic in nature, have played a role in understanding word or character count and n-gram overlap between generated text and reference texts.</p>
<p>In seven studies, TER [131] was employed as an edit distance metric to evaluate machine translation, quantifying the human-level editing required to align system output with a reference [131].Additionally, fifteen studies utilized CIDEr [132], a widely adopted metric for image captioning, which assesses the similarity between generated and reference captions, considering both linguistic and content aspects, and applying TF-IDF-based n-gram weighting [133].Furthermore, two studies incorporated SPICE [134] metrics, which calculates the semantic propositional content overlap between generated and reference captions using scene graphs.Four (4) studies incorporated the use of the SER (Slot-Error Rate) metrics, which are appropriate for assessing the presence of named entities, with SER being computed through exact matching of slot values in the candidate texts [27].</p>
<p>Metric</p>
<p>Count Papers BLEU 80 [46], [64], [36], [65], [9], [98], [14], [99], [47], [2], [27], [23], [86], [96], [83], [49], [4], [66], [67], [84], [50], [68], [51], [52], [69], [100], [53], [39], [101], [102], [28], [11], [10], [103], [70], [71], [54], [72], [107], [87], [91], [73], [74], [88], [16], [26], [92], [29], [41], [55], [56], [57], [58], [81], [93], [75], [106], [109], [42], [110], [94], [43], [104], [37], [85], [61], [89], [90], [62], [76], [97], [78], [45], [105], [24], [63], [79], [60], [80], [111], [86] METEOR 40 [36], [9], [99], [27], [83], [49], [4], [66], [84], [51], [100], [102], [28], [11], [103], [71], [54], [72], [107], [91], [73], [74], [88], [56], [57], [106], [109], [110], [37], [85], [61], [90], [62], [76], [78], [105], [24], [60], [86], [81] ROUGE 17 [9], [98], [2], [28], [73], [74], [26], [92], [29], [57], [61], [90], [45], [105], [24], [60], [86] CIDER 15 [9], [98], [99], [83], [66], [28], [91], [74], [57], [58], [78], [105], [24], [60], [86] CHRF++ 10</p>

<p>Task Specific Metrics</p>
<p>A significant debate persists among researchers regarding the appropriateness of these non-semantic n-gram metrics for evaluating data-to-text outputs.These metrics primarily rely on word count and n-gram overlap between the generated text and reference texts, often showing limited correlation with human judgment [66].They were originally developed and applied in other natural language generation (NLG) domains, such as translation for BLEU, NIST and METEOR and summarization for ROUGE.</p>
<p>In response to the unique challenges posed by table-to-text generation, task-specific metrics like PARENT [66] and its variant, PARENT-T [73], have emerged.These metrics assess the quality of table-to-text outputs by comparing the generated information with the entries in the source table.The research also analyzes the sensitivity of the metrics to divergence by collecting labels for cases where references only contain information already present in the tables.The study shows that PARENT maintains a high correlation as the number of such examples varies [66].These task-specific metrics are gaining prominence, with nine (9) papers considering PARENT and one (1) paper exploring PARENT-T.</p>
<p>To enhance the semantic alignment between generated texts and their references, embedding-based and pretrained-based metrics have been introduced.These metrics utilize contextualized embeddings and Transformer-based models to assess the quality and similarity of generated text to reference sentences.BERTScore [135], featured in 7 papers, calculates the cosine similarity between generated texts and the ground truth, offering a more nuanced understanding of text quality.MoverScore [136], a metric that allows many-to-one matching, is used in 2 papers and computes the Euclidean distances between words or n-grams.It enhances the evaluation process by considering partial alignments and offering insights into text quality.Notably, BLEURT [137], a Transformer-based trained metric, has been employed in 5 papers.This approach pretrains BERT with synthetically generated sentence pairs by mask-filling with BERT, back-translation, or randomly dropping words to assess NLG system performance [133].</p>
<p>Information Extraction Metrics</p>
<p>In data-to-text evaluation, extractive evaluation methods were introduced in Wiseman et al. [46] to assess the performance of the alignment of the information extraction model in the content selection and text planning in the generation process.A total of 11 studies adopted these metrics to rate their model's performance in content selection and planning tasks.This approach employs metrics like content selection (CS), content ordering (CO), and relational generation (RG).An Information Extraction (IE) system is used to extract content plans, identify candidate entities and value pairs present in the generated text, and predict their types.CS evaluates how accurately the system's extracted records match those in the reference output, considering precision and recall.RG assesses factuality by measuring the proportion of system-extracted records that also appear in the input table.CO evaluates the system's record ordering by computing the normalized Damerau-Levenshtein Distance between the sequence of extracted records and the reference output [46].</p>
<p>The Table 6 illustrate the distribution of these evaluation metrics identified in various research papers.</p>

<p>While automatic metrics offer certain advantages, human evaluation is often favored when assessing generated texts.This is due to its enhanced precision in evaluating aspects such as semantic adequacy, coherence, fluency, and the identification of numerical errors.Existing automatic metrics are often benchmarked against human evaluation results to determine their reliability and suitability.In human evaluations, the assessment of the quality of generated text varies widely, with different criteria used depending on the task.Due to the lack of a standardized human evaluation procedure in Natural Language Generation (NLG), and even in the naming conventions of the criteria, researchers often adopt diverse approaches to evaluate their generated texts [138].In this review, we aim to show some aspects of human evaluation by categorizing them into the measures and methods of evaluation taking a cue from studies by Belz et al. [139], and Van Der Lee et al. [138].</p>
<p>Quality Criteria Measures</p>
<p>In our analysis, certain studies lacked explicit details regarding their methods, tools, and design of quality criteria.However, for those that provided such information, we extracted relevant data.A notable observation is the considerable variation in the meanings associated with the names of the quality criteria.Table 7 enumerates the top ten prevalent naming conventions identified in the literature with "fluency" being the most used in 29 studies.Several terms, such as relevance, clarity, readability, and factual, among others, are notable examples that were not included in the table.It's crucial to note that the interpretation and task associated with these names may differ.</p>
<p>Experimental Methods</p>
<p>This section of the human evaluation review explores various methodologies for obtaining and assessing responses based on quality criteria.Table 7 presents the human evaluation frameworks and metrics extracted from the studies.Our analysis reveals that, out of 28 studies conducting human evaluation assessments in crowd-sourcing platforms, 17 studies utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk as their primary crowdsourcing platform.Additionally, we examined the linguistic background of annotators involved; 11 studies employed expert annotators, while eight and five studies engaged graduate students and paper authors, respectively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we investigated the scale sizes used in each experiment.The most common scale size in 42 papers ranged from 1 to 5, followed by ranges of 10 to 30, and 50 and above in 5 and 4 papers, respectively.The 1-5 rank was the most popular scale range, appearing in 12 papers.Subsequently, the 0-100, 1-7, -100 to +100, and 0-5 scales were found in 6, 5, 3, and 3 papers, respectively.Two studies incorporated the TrueSkill Algorithm alongside the ranking task during evaluation, and various other scale sizes were identified in individual papers.</p>
<p>Additionally, we documented the agreement among annotators and the tools used in some studies.Statistical tools such as Krippendorff's α, Fleiss' Kappa, Cohen's Kappa, and Weighted Kappa were employed in 3, 5, and 2 studies to measure agreements among annotators.In 12 papers, responses from participants were aggregated using averages.</p>

<p>Data-to-text generation finds extensive application in diverse domains, reflecting its versatility and value in addressing specific needs, as shown in Table 8.It plays a pivotal role in dialogue systems, where 26 studies focus on generating dialogues across various conversational contexts.Another significant application domain is sports narration, with 18 studies employing data-to-text generation to create textual summaries of game match records, encompassing player details, team information, and scores.In the realm of biography generation, 15 studies work on generating biographical texts for individuals with data often sourced from platforms like English Wikipedia.The application extends to translation and multilingualism, with 12 studies leveraging data-to-text techniques to tackle multilingual challenges.Additionally, data-to-text methods have proven effective in question generation and answering, exemplified by four identified studies in this domain.The application footprint extends to weather forecasting, robo-journalism, relational databases, the legal domain, and financial reporting, each with several studies showcasing the practical utility of data-to-text generation in distinct contexts.Furthermore, advertising and recipe generation domains have harnessed data-to-text techniques effectively.This comprehensive coverage highlights the adaptability and broad applicability of data-to-text generation in diverse scenarios and underscores its role in addressing specific needs across multiple domains.</p>
<p>tend to favor WebNLG and E2E over other datasets due to the competition challenges and dedicated conferences associated with them.Moreover, these datasets, being human-curated, offer more natural and fluent content compared to online-extracted datasets, contributing to their widespread acceptance.</p>
<p>In terms of evaluation metrics, BLEU emerges as the most commonly used automatic metric, enjoying broad acceptance across various data-to-text tasks.This observation is supported by the considerable number of studies that incorporate this metric in Table 6.</p>
<p>In addition, the dominance of large language models is evident in their effectiveness for data-to-text generation, as reflected by the widespread adoption of transformer models, as illustrated in Table 5.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is no universally preferred technique for addressing the hallucination problem in data-to-text.However, based on our observations, most mitigation measures are task-specific, with data refinement being a more general and effective method.This involves processes such as deduplication, cleaning, and factuality grounding, exerting control over the content the generation model encounters during training.</p>
<p>Recommendation and Future Directions</p>
<p>We have conducted a thorough analysis of the prevailing trends and have provided answers to the research questions within the scope of this literature.Nonetheless, it has come to our attention that there is a need to extend research efforts to encompass more low-resourced languages as seen in Section 3.2.Additionally, in Section 3.3 owing to the temporal limitations defined in the exclusion criteria, we did not include papers pertaining to recent large language models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 [140; 141] and LLAMA [142; 143].In future investigations, our emphasis will be on studies that incorporate these advanced technologies into their research.</p>
<p>Moreover, from observations in Section 3.5, we recommend that future studies place greater emphasis on the utilization of contextual evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of data-to-text generation.These metrics have shown notable advantages in terms of semantic accuracy in data-to-text pairs, and their inclusion in evaluation frameworks is a direction worth exploring.</p>
<p>A standardized approach to human evaluation in the data-to-text field is essential.We strongly recommend authors to provide detailed explanations of their human evaluation procedures, including quality criteria definitions, response elicitation platforms, participants' knowledge backgrounds, etc.We also encourage the broader NLG community to collaboratively establish a universal naming convention to disambiguate similar terms and associated tasks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, referring to Section 3.4 and considering the richness of general knowledge that recent LLMs possess, we propose an advancement in their hallucination mitigation methods compared to task-specific LLMs.This improvement could focus more on addressing numerical and logical inference hallucination in the generated text.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This systematic review of data-to-text generation provides a comprehensive overview of the field, including its trends, challenges, and advancements.The review consolidates knowledge on datasets, language considerations, models, hallucination mitigation, and applications to guide future research endeavors.The insights gained from this review contribute to a deeper understanding of data-to-text generation, paving the way for continued innovation and progress.Addressing the identified trends and challenges will be crucial in advancing the capabilities and applicability of data-to-text generation systems as the field continues to evolve.</p>
