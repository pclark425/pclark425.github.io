                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language understanding and reasoning. Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p>

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in language understanding and reasoning.Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential.However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples.In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies.Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data.To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling-such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation-we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles.SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation.Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods.Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains.Given their increasing adoption, evaluating LLMs along multiple dimensions-including reasoning ability, domain knowledge comprehension, and general problem-solving skills-is becoming increasingly essential.Among these dimensions, assessing the logic reasoning capabilities of LLMs is particularly important, as logical reasoning serves as a foundational skill required for numerous tasks, especially those that involve intensive logical thinking, such as programming and software development.</p>

<p>I would have done my homework, but my refrigerator stopped working.</p>
<p>The two courses I took at UF were not very interesting.I don't think it's a good university.Researchers have extensively investigated the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs to assess their capacity for human-like reasoning.Initial studies converted symbolic logic, such as first-order logic, into natural-language descriptions [Han et al. 2022;Parmar et al. 2024]; however, these translations are overly rigid and unnatural, employing lengthy sentences embedded with formal constructs (∀, ∃, etc.) rarely used by humans.To create more natural and representative scenarios, Jin et al. [2022a] introduced the LOGIC dataset, featuring short, realistic yet simplistic fallacious statements derived primarily from student quizzes, and annotated these sentences with logical fallacy categories to increase difficulty.Nonetheless, many examples remained overly trivial and insufficiently challenging.To address these shortcomings, researchers proposed the COIG-CQIA benchmark [M-A- P 2024], which contains subtle logical errors sourced from forum posts on the Chinese online platform ruozhiba.However, the benchmark's reliance on direct Chinese-to-English translations diminishes the context-sensitive nuances essential for accurately evaluating logical reasoning, and it lacks annotations specifying logical fallacy types, limiting its use for robust fallacy categorization assessments [Li et al. 2025;Zhai et al. 2025].</p>
<p>Achieving a logic reasoning benchmark that simultaneously satisfies the conditions of being challenging, naturally expressed in native English, and labeled with specific fallacy types remains an unresolved challenge-an "impossible trinity" for evaluating LLMs. Figure 1 shows the examples of existing benchmarks and the desired benchmark.To bridge this gap, we introduce the SmartyPat-Bench.Initially, we identified a Reddit channel [Reddit 2025] similar in nature to the Chinese forum ruozhiba, suitable as a data source for our benchmark construction.During dataset compilation, we manually screened and verified the top 2,500 posts from the entire history of this Reddit channel, sorted in descending order by upvotes.</p>
<p>After filtering out low-quality content (e.g., toxic or unethical posts), we sampled and labeled 502 high-quality, native English posts to form the initial version of our benchmark.</p>
<p>Through constructing and evaluating our initial benchmark, we identified two desirable properties for logic reasoning benchmarks targeting LLMs: ❶ The capability to automatically generate sentences containing subtle logical fallacies.We observed that the distribution of fallacy types within manually collected datasets tends to be significantly imbalanced.Specifically, the three most frequent types collectively account for 79.7% of our dataset, while least frequent three types together comprise only 1.77%.Moreover, automatic generation enables greater control over content quality, reducing the need for extensive manual cleaning (e.g., filtering toxic or inappropriate posts).❷ The generated statements must accurately embody their intended logical fallacies.Ensuring the correctness of generated fallacies not only reduces the manual labeling effort but also guarantees the validity and reliability of benchmarking results.</p>
<p>With these two desired properties in mind, we designed an automated generator for creating statements containing cunning logical fallacies for evaluating LLMs, and we named this technique SmartyPat.First, by analyzing fallacious statements from the original SmartyPat-Bench dataset, we formulated a set of Prolog rules, along with corresponding fact structures, to represent the essential logical characteristics associated with each fallacy type.These Prolog rules form the foundation of SmartyPat, as they guarantee that, given accurate facts, statements containing specific, intended fallacies can be reliably generated.Consequently, the enforcement of controlled fallacy types can serve as the test oracles for rigorously testing LLMs.Second, leveraging the established Prolog rules and fact formats, SmartyPat employs LLMs to generate additional facts consistent with these predefined rules.Subsequently, by querying a Prolog program composed of carefully designed rules combined with the newly generated facts, SmartyPat produces structured statements containing logical fallacies.Finally, SmartyPat invokes LLMs again to transform these structured fallacious statements into fluent natural-language sentences.The resulting fallacious sentences, labeled with their respective fallacy types, serve as test cases for assessing the logic reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>
<p>We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate SmartyPat, leveraging both the original dataset SmartyPat-Bench and the generated benchmark SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented to assess the logical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.In terms of generation quality, SmartyPat produces subtle, high-quality fallacious statements comparable to human-written Reddit posts, significantly outperforming two baselines: direct LLM-based generation and indirect generation via LLM-produced Prolog rules.To assess LLM reasoning, we designed two evaluation tasks using both datasets: one for detecting the presence of logical fallacies, and another for categorizing them into specific types.In the detection task, reasoning models often underperform due to overanalysis, resulting in high false positive rates and lower F1 scores.In contrast, they generally excel in categorization.Among all models, the GPT series strikes a strong balance in performance across both tasks.</p>
<p>In summary, we make the following contributions:</p>
<p>(1) We introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark of 502 highquality, real-world English sentences, each annotated with the corresponding logical fallacy type(s).intended types of logical fallacies) for testing the logic reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>
<p>(3) We conduct a systematic evaluation of nine state-of-the-art LLMs on both fallacy detection and fine-grained categorization tasks, revealing significant performance gaps and highlighting the challenges of aligning model reasoning with human logic.We release our code and raw data in this repository: https://github.com/ltroin/Smartybench.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Logical Fallacy Categorization</p>
<p>Currently, there is no universally agreed-upon classification scheme for logical fallacies, and existing categorizations often include overlapping concepts.For instance, Li et al. [2025] introduce the category Lame Jokes, representing failures to grasp general knowledge or common sense, alongside Factual Error, which similarly pertains to misunderstandings of basic facts.These two categories substantially overlap, potentially leading to inconsistencies in label annotation.Similarly, Zhai et al. [2025] define Logical Error as contradictions or flawed reasoning, Commonsense Misunderstanding as mistakes regarding everyday facts, and Erroneous Assumption as incorrect premises.However, all these definitions could reasonably be included within a broader category such as Logical Error, thereby introducing ambiguity for both LLM interpretation and human annotation.</p>
<p>By analyzing existing classifications alongside the fallacious statements in our SmartyPat-Bench dataset, we propose a refined categorization of logical fallacies comprising 14 distinct types: False Dilemma, Equivocation, False Premise, False Analogy, Wrong Direction, Fallacy of Composition, Begging the Question, False Cause, Inverse Error, Improper Transposition, Improper Distribution or Addition, Contextomy, Nominal Fallacy, and Accident Fallacy.Further details regarding this categorization are provided in Table 7 in the appendix.</p>
<p>Logic Programming</p>
<p>Logic programming is a programming paradigm based on formal logic.Some famous logic programming languages are Prolog, Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Datalog.In this paper, we focus on Prolog.Prolog was originally developed to support artificial intelligence [Bobrow 1985;Rowe 1988], particularly in natural language processing applications [Nugues 2006].Prolog programs are made up of facts and rules.Users can use queries to ask Prolog to evaluate certain statements based on the facts and rules.Here we provide definitions of these key concepts: Facts.Facts represent the basic assertions about the world.They state what is unconditionally true.A fact is made up of a  and several , denoted as:
𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑡𝑒 (𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 1 , 𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 2 , ...)(1)
An example is  ℎ ( ℎ, ), which means John is the father of Mary.</p>
<p>The logic reasoning engine can provide three types of responds to the queries.If the engine can prove the statement of the query, then it will return  .If it cannot prove, it will return .If the query contains variables, then the engine can return variable bindings.For example, given the query ?−  (, ), the engine will return  = ℎ.Reasoning Rules.Generating new facts through logic programming requires facts (Equation ( 1)), rules (Equation ( 2)), queries (Equation ( 3)), and answers to the queries.In some papers [Li et al. 2024b;Schwartz et al. 2018], the authors simplify this process as reasoning rules denoted as follows:</p>
<p>1 (...),  2 (...), ... (...)

3 A PRELIMINARY STUDY WITH SMARTYPAT-BENCH</p>
<p>Limitations of Existing Benchmarks</p>
<p>Researchers have extensively investigated the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), initially employing symbolic logic translated into rigorous yet unnatural language constructs, thus failing to reflect authentic human expression.Subsequently, more naturalistic datasets, such as LOGIC, presented short, singlesentence logical fallacies from student quizzes, although these were often too simplistic or evidently erroneous to effectively challenge LLMs.Efforts like the Chinese-language COIG-CQIA benchmark advanced realism by sourcing cunning, context-dependent logical errors from online forums; however, reliance on direct translations diminished contextual nuance, and the lack of explicit logical fallacy categorization limited the benchmark's utility in comprehensively assessing LLMs' reasoning abilities.Table 1 presents a comparative overview of features among existing logic reasoning benchmarks designed for evaluating LLMs. Figure 1 in the Appendix shows some examples of the testcases of the benchmarks.The identified limitations of these benchmarks motivate the development of our proposed benchmark.To efficiently construct a high-quality SmartyPat-Bench dataset, we developed a structured preprocessing pipeline: we first performed keyword filtering to exclude inappropriate or unethical content, then applied an upvote-based selection strategy to identify high-quality posts by selecting the top 2,500 entries with the most engagement.Finally, five expert annotators manually reviewed these entries to confirm logical fallacies and appropriateness for public use.This procedure resulted in a linguistically diverse, reliable SmartyPat-Bench dataset containing 502 logically flawed posts.</p>
<p>Fallacy Labeling.</p>
<p>To ensure annotation quality and consistency, five authors labeled the dataset independently, selecting all applicable fallacies per sentence from the 14 predefined logical fallacies (Section 2.1).Subsequently, discrepancies were discussed and resolved through joint verification to reach consensus.Each sentence could receive multiple fallacy labels; for instance, "Our doctor said that my wife and I are going to have a sun.How can I harness its extensive energy when my wife gives birth?" is annotated with both Equivocation and False Analogy.</p>
<p>Sentence</p>
<p>Transformation.This step standardizes the syntactic and logical structure of sentences in SmartyPat-Bench for further analysis.The original dataset consists mainly of questions (e.g., "Why do meteors always land in craters?"), often embedding implicit premises and lacking explicit inferential structure.We represent sentences using first-order logic, constrained to conjunctions (∧) and implications (→), sufficient for modeling typical fallacious reasoning.Formally, sentences are normalized to
(𝑝 1 ∧ 𝑝 2 ∧ • • • ∧ 𝑝 𝑛 ) → 𝑞,
where each   is an atomic premise and  is the conclusion.To align with natural language, paraphrastic forms such as "Since  1 and  2 , therefore " or "If  1 and  2 , then " are employed.For example, the question "Why do meteors always land in craters?" is transformed into "Since we always find meteors in craters, therefore craters cause meteors.", explicitly highlighting the flawed inference.This normalization was manually performed by five authors, ensuring careful semantic interpretation and logical accuracy.</p>
<p>Observations from SmartyPat-Bench</p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of various fallacy types within SmartyPat-Bench.We observe that False Premise, Equivocation, and False Analogy are the three most prevalent fallacies, collectively accounting for over 79.7% of the dataset.In contrast, the three least frequent types-Improper Transposition, Fallacy of Composition, and False Dilemma-together constitute only 1.77%.This indicates a highly imbalanced representation of fallacy types in user-generated forum posts.Additionally, the entire process of constructing a rigorous benchmark for evaluating logic reasoning from real-world data is labor-intensive and time-consuming.On average, screening each sentence required approximately 0.5 minutes, annotating the logical fallacy types took roughly 3 minutes, and transforming questions into declarative sentences took around 2 minutes.This resulted in a cumulative workload of approximately 3,760 minutes-or roughly 62.67 hours-for a single annotator.Consequently, to reduce manual effort in developing larger datasets and to maintain complete control over dataset content, there is a need for techniques capable of automatically generating high-quality, logically fallacious statements.</p>
<p>METHODOLOGY</p>
<p>The overall workflow of SmartyPat is formalized in Algorithm 1 and we also visualized it in Appendix Figure 7. Specifically, the method consists of the following three stages:
𝑆 𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑦 ← 𝑆 𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑦 ∪ {𝑠 𝑛𝑙 } 14:
return   </p>
<p>• PrologKnowledgeGeneration (Section 4.2): This module utilizes the fallacyspecific predicates developed in the previous stage and employs an LLM to generate additional facts.These are inserted into the Prolog knowledge base (Line 8-9).• FallacySentenceTransformation (Section 4.3): In the final stage, the populated Prolog knowledge base is executed to infer fallacy-specific outputs.Only those fact pairs that satisfy the logical conditions of a given fallacy rule are retained.These outputs are then post-processed into natural language form and passed through an evaluation pipeline to verify their alignment with the intended fallacy type (Line 10 -13).</p>
<p>Prolog Program Design</p>
<p>This step aims to synthesize common reasoning patterns and convert the schemas derived in the previous stage into Prolog predicates that support logical verification.The procedure is outlined in Algorithm 1.We begin by leveraging the logical implication format defined for each fallacy type in Section 3.2.3(Line 5).Subsequently, multiple rounds of collaborative analysis were conducted among the co-authors to extract schematic reasoning patterns associated with each fallacy type.For example, the sentence "Why do meteors always land in craters?" exemplifies a fallacy that inverts the causal or temporal relationship between observation and explanation-thus allowing a relatively straightforward formalization.In contrast, semantically nuanced fallacies such as Contextomy involve distortions of quoted material or partial misinterpretations of intent, as seen in "If I continue eating an apple a day, will I never get my PhD?".These qualitative analyses allow us to formally capture the core structure of each fallacy (Line 6).The resulting abstractions serve as the basis for their corresponding Prolog representations.We then begin designing the Prolog predicates, denoted as pd, which include both rules and example facts that serve as few-shot demonstrations for the LLM (Line 7).Out of the 14 logical fallacy categories included in SmartyPat-Bench, 11 were selected for enhancement through this approach; the remaining three exhibited sufficiently high-quality outputs using the baseline method (see Section 5.2).</p>
<p>The full set of pd predicates-along with their semantic interpretations-is summarized in Table 2.Each predicate is crafted to precisely encode the specific reasoning flaw of its corresponding fallacy type.Formally, we define H Fvalid as the set of all Prolog fact instances that satisfy the rule R for a given fallacy type .The mapping
H Fvalid ↦ −→ pd(argument 1 , argument 2 , . . . , argument 𝑛 )
indicates that each fact in H Fvalid can be instantiated using the pd predicate with the corresponding arguments.This mapping guarantees that only logically valid constructions, as defined by R , are retained for natural language sentence generation.The formal definitions of all 11 fallacy types targeted for improvement are provided in Table 2. cannot.Specifically,   (, , ) holds since brushing for 2 minutes improves dental health for a day, and   (, Δ, Υ) holds since brushing once for 14 minutes yields a week-long effect.Temporal accumulation is valid:  (, , Δ), as seven repetitions of  compose Δ.However, effect-level accumulation fails: ¬ (, , Υ).Therefore, taking the positive version  (, , Υ) as a premise and instantiating it with such a tuple (, Δ, , Υ) leads to a fallacy, as it incorrectly assumes that repeating short-term effects compounds into the long-term effect.
RΦ = 𝑝𝑑 (𝐴, Δ, 𝐸, Υ) : − 𝐻 𝐸 (𝑋, 𝐴, 𝐸), 𝐻 𝐸 (𝑋, Δ, Υ), 𝑉𝐶 (𝐴, 𝑅, Δ), ¬𝑉𝐶 (𝐸, 𝑅, Υ) H Fvalid ↦ −→ 𝑝𝑑 (𝐴, Δ, 𝐸, Υ) <a href="5">𝑅 − 𝐼 𝐷</a>
Definition 2. False Analogy [FA].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (, Π, , Φ) that match the rule structure.Let  = kid, Π = kidney,  = kid_word, and Φ = grow_into_adult.The rule schema -FA captures a false analogy pattern, where two expressions share a lexical substructure but diverge semantically.Concretely,  (,  ) and  (Π,  ) hold since both kid and kidney has the property substring kid_word.Moreover,  (, Φ) holds, as the concept kid plausibly relates to grow_into_adult.However,  ≠ Π and ¬ (Π, Φ)-the kid in kidney does not grow into an adult-ney-so inferring  (Π, Φ) based solely on shared morphology constitutes a category mistake.The fallacy arises by overextending a single property sharing ( ) to imply a general case property sharing (Φ), which does not hold.
RΦ = 𝑝𝑑 (𝐸, Π, 𝑋, Φ) : − 𝐻𝑃 (𝐸, 𝑋 ), 𝐻𝑃 (Π, 𝑋 ), 𝐻𝑃 (𝐸, Φ), 𝐸 ≠ Π, ¬𝐻𝑃 (Π, Φ) H Fvalid ↦ −→ 𝑝𝑑 (𝐸, Π, 𝑋, Φ) <a href="6">𝑅 − 𝐹𝐴</a>
Definition 3. False Premise [FP].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (, Φ, Π, , Γ) matching the structure of rule schema -FP, which captures reasoning based on a false premise propagated through a plausible observation.Let  = people_has_two_lungs, Φ = two_lungs_breathe_out_carbon_dioxide, Π = lung_number_influence_carbon_number,  = people_can_have_one_lung, and Γ = one_lung_breathe_out_carbon_monoxide.Here,  (, Φ) holds: the established fact that people have two lungs and that two lungs breathe out carbon dioxide.A false premise is introduced via   (Φ, Π), incorrectly claiming that the number of lungs determines the type of carbon compound exhaled.Then,  (, Π) holds, since it is plausible to observe that some people have only one lung, and this could appear to support Π. Finally,   (Π, , Γ) concludes that one lung leads to exhalation of carbon monoxide.The fallacy arises from accepting Π-a false causal relationship-as a valid bridge between an observation and a conclusion, thus generating Γ from a structurally valid but semantically invalid reasoning chain.
RΦ = 𝑝𝑑 (𝑋, Φ, Π, 𝑂, Γ) : − 𝐸𝐹 (𝑋, Φ), 𝐹 𝑃 (Φ, Π), 𝑃𝑂 (𝑂, Π), 𝐹 𝑃𝐿𝐶 (Π, 𝑂, Γ) H Fvalid ↦ −→ 𝑝𝑑 (𝑋, Φ, Π, 𝑂, Γ) <a href="7">𝑅 − 𝐹 𝑃</a>
Definition 4. Accident Fallacy [AF].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (, , , ) that match the rule schema -AF, which formalizes the accident fallacy-misinterpreting a general rule by extending it beyond its reasonable bounds.Let  = shampoo_bottle,  = lather_rinse_repeat,  = wash_once_or_twice, and  = infinite_washing.Here, (, ) holds since the rule appears on the shampoo bottle.A reasonable interpretation is captured by  (,  ): the instruction implies washing once or twice.However,   (, ) also holds: an unreasonable interpretation would suggest one must wash infinitely.Since  ≠ , the conclusion formed by treating  as a valid reading commits an accident fallacy.The error arises from rigidly applying a general rule without regard to practical limits or intended scope, leading to an absurd or unintended consequence.
RΦ = 𝑝𝑑 (𝑂, 𝑅, 𝐼, 𝐾) : − 𝐻𝑅(𝑂, 𝑅), 𝑅𝑅𝐼 (𝑅, 𝐼 ), 𝑅𝑈 𝐼 (𝑅, 𝐾), 𝐼 ≠ 𝐾 H Fvalid ↦ −→ 𝑝𝑑 (𝑂, 𝑅, 𝐼, 𝐾) <a href="8">𝑅 − 𝐴𝐹 </a>
Definition 5. Fallacy of Composition [FC].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (, Π, Ω) that match the rule schema -FC, which captures the fallacy of composition-mistakenly attributing a property of a part to the whole.Let  = chimney, Π = survives_fire, and Ω = building.Here,  (, Π) holds: the chimney has the property of surviving fire.In addition,  (, Ω) holds since the chimney is a structural part of the building, and  (Ω, Π) holds because the building as a whole lacks the property of surviving fire.The fallacy occurs when one concludes that the entire building must also survive fire merely because one of its components does.This invalid inference results from illegitimately projecting a part's property onto the composite structure.

Definition 6. Begging the Question [BQ].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (, ) that match the rule schema -BQ, which captures the fallacy of begging the question-where a claim is supported by reasoning that ultimately presupposes the claim itself.Let  = bible_true,  = bible_word_of_god, and  = bible_says_god_exists.Here, (, ) holds: the truth of the Bible is claimed based on the argument that it is the word of God.Then, (, ) holds: the explicit meaning of that argument is that the Bible asserts God's existence.Finally,  (,  ) holds: the assertion that God exists relies on assuming the Bible is true.This circular structure results in the fallacy-since the conclusion  is embedded in the reasoning .This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (Θ, Γ) that match the rule schema -CT, which captures the fallacy of contextomy-where a statement is taken out of its original context to support an unrelated conclusion.Let Θ = time_is_money,  = time_is_valuable_as_money, Δ = time_is_literally_money, Φ = third_world_countries_have_less_money, and Γ = time_is_slower_in_third_world_countries.Here,  (Θ, ) holds: the phrase "time is money" is reasonably interpreted to mean time is valuable.However,  (Θ, Δ) holds as well, representing a misreading that treats the phrase out of the context (literally in this case).This misinterpretation is then linked via   (Δ, Φ) to a socioeconomic fact, and finally   (Φ, Γ) commits the fallacy by concluding that time moves more slowly in poorer countries.The fallacy arises from detaching a figurative expression from its intended context and chaining it to unrelated empirical claims, thereby producing a logically unsound and rhetorically misleading argument.

Definition 8. Inverse Error [IE].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (Δ, ) that match the rule schema -IE, which formalizes the inverse error fallacy-drawing a false implication in the reverse direction of a valid one, particularly when the inverse domain is broader or less constrained.Let Δ = cycling_backwards,  = gain_weight,  = cycling_forwards, and  = reduce_weight.Here,  (, Δ) and  (, ) hold: cycling forwards is the complement of cycling backwards, and reducing weight is the complement of gaining weight.A valid implication exists in the forward direction:   (, )-cycling forwards implies weight loss.However, the reverse implication ¬  (, ) also holds: losing weight does not imply cycling forwards.If the reverse implication were valid, it would mean that weight loss is exclusively caused by cycling forwards, and that their complements align perfectly.But this is not the case.The core insight of the inverse error rule is that when the domain of Δ is broader than that of , the complement of Δ is correspondingly narrower than the complement of -leading to a logical mismatch when inverting the implication.improper transposition fallacy-mistakenly reversing an implication by focusing on a shared consequence while ignoring alternative causes.Let  = rainy_days,  = wet_ground, and  = sprinklers_on.In this case, both   (, ) and   (, ) hold: rainy days and sprinklers each imply wet ground.Crucially,  ≠ , and ¬   (,  ), ¬   (, ) hold-rain and sprinklers are causally independent.The fallacy arises when one incorrectly infers   (, )-that wet ground implies rainy days-despite the existence of other sufficient conditions (e.g., sprinklers) that can also cause .

Definition 10.Wrong Direction [WD].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of (Π,  ) that match the rule schema -WD, which formalizes the wrong direction fallacy-confusing the direction of causality by treating an effect as if it were the cause.Let  = move_eye_close_to_mirror and Π = mirror_looks_like_eye.</p>
<p>Here,  (, Π) holds: the visual effect of the mirror resembling an eye occurs solely due to the proximity of the observer's own eye.There exists no other alternative cause  ≠  such that  (, Π), satisfying the open cause condition  (, Π).However, ¬ (Π,  ) holds: the visual appearance of the mirror does not in turn cause the eye to move closer.The fallacy arises When the unidirectional logic is reversed-asserting that mirrors inherently resemble eyeballs-this misinterprets a self-induced perceptual effect as an intrinsic property of the object being observed.

Definition 11.False Cause [FS].This definition identifies all valid instantiations of ( , ) that match the rule schema -FS, which formalizes the false casue fallacy-wrongly treating the mere temporal or spatial co-occurrence of two events as evidence that one directly produces the other as a substance.Let  = lightbulb_switch,  = darkness_emission, Υ = room_event, and  = absence_of_light.Here, (Υ, ) and (Υ, ) hold: both the action of switching the lightbulb and the resulting darkness occur as part of the same observable room event.However,  (, ) identifies the real cause of darkness as the absence of light, not the switching action itself.Since  ≠  and  @ &lt;  (the switch action precedes the observed effect), the fallacy arises when one concludes that turning off a lightbulb emits darkness as a physical substance.This misrepresents a lack (the absence of illumination) as a generative act, conflating temporal correlation with causal production.

<p>Prolog Knowledge Generation</p>
<p>To address the challenge of automatically generating statements containing nuanced logical fallacies, we leverage the facts and rules constructed in the previous section, in combination with LLMs, to significantly reduce human effort.Specifically, we provide the LLM with both the formal rule defining the fallacy type and corresponding Prolog facts as few-shot examples (Line 8).</p>
<p>An important observation from our experiments is that LLMs are better able to capture inter-predicate relationships when facts related to a specific fallacy instance are grouped together, rather than grouped by predicate name.For instance, in Equation 8, it is more effective to group HR(O, R), RRI(R, I), and RUI(R, K) within a single example.This grouping encourages the LLM to semantically align argument values and generate a logically coherent combination of HR, RRI, and RUI predicates.</p>
<p>Moreover, because predicates encode relationships between arguments, adding inline comments to clarify each predicate improves the LLM's understanding.For example, the fact HR(highway, maximum_speed_65) can be annotated as % this means highway has a rule of maximum speed 65.These comments help LLMs more accurately infer the semantics of each predicate and produce higher-quality examples aligned with the intended fallacy logic.The prompt used for this task is presented in Table 3.</p>

<p>Fallacy Sentence Transformation</p>
<p>This section aims to transform appropriate fact combinations into natural language sentences that reflect the implication-style format established in Section 3.2.3.Specifically, we utilize the knowledge base K prolog (Lines 9-10) and construct a query to extract all valid Prolog knowledge facts corresponding to the rules of a given fallacy type, denoted as H Fvalid (Line 11).Finally, we instruct the LLM using both the template set   and the retrieved facts H Fvalid to convert the logical facts into natural language , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .Publication date: August 2025.sentences (Line 12).The prompt used for sentence transformation is shown in Table 4.We denote the resulting dataset as SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented.</p>

<p>EXPERIMENTATION</p>
<p>SmartyPat utilizes a Prolog-based backend comprising a total of 1,458 lines of code, including 24 unique predicates for facts, 13 for rules, and 11 distinct queries.We also implement 12 Python scripts comprising a total of 1,517 lines of code, used to handle LLM responses, process data, compute evaluation metrics, and generate visualizations.We use Claude 3.7 with extended thinking mode [Anthropic 2025b] to generate new facts.Our experimentation is designed to address the following three research questions: Deepseek-R1 [DeepSeek 2025a] and GPT-o3-mini [OpenAI 2025c] across several benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond [Anthropic 2023].The method serves as our first baseline and follows a straightforward three-step process: (1) collect example sentences for each fallacy type along with their formal definitions, (2) prompt the LLM with both the examples and definitions, and (3) instruct the model to generate new sentences exhibiting the same fallacy.The full is provided in Table 9. • FallacyGen-Prolog: Logical fallacy detection and generation is inherently a structured reasoning task, which naturally motivates the use of Prolog-a declarative logic programming language well-suited for encoding real-world knowledge as structured facts and inference rules.To explore this direction, we implement FallacyGen-Prolog, a method where LLMs are prompted to generate Prolog programs as intermediate representations for constructing fallacious sentences.This approach parallels FallacyGen-Direct, but with a key distinction: the LLM is instructed to synthesize Prolog facts, predicates, and inference rules based on the fallacy definition and a list of example sentences.The model is also responsible for composing corresponding natural language sentences, though no constraints are imposed on the generation format or the explicit use of reasoning rules.The full prompt is provided in Table 10 Appendix 9.6.</p>
<p>5.1.2Benchmark and Tools.We summarize the datasets employed for each research question and the tools used in the experimentation process.</p>
<p>• SmartyPat-Bench: This benchmark is used in all RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3.For RQ1, it serves as the foundation to validate the reliability of our sentence quality evaluator.For RQ2 and RQ3, it is employed to evaluate LLM capabilities in logical fallacy detection and categorization.• SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented: This benchmark is also used in RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3.For RQ1, we refer to SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented as SmartyPat to ensure consistency in method comparison and to justify the superiority of SmartyPat in fallacy generation.For RQ2 and RQ3, it is used alongside SmartyPat-Bench to compare LLM performance on both datasets.• Benign-Bench: This benchmark is used for RQ2 and RQ3.We collect logically correct sentences from C4 and FineWeb [FineWeb 2024; for AI 2019], manually filtering for samples of similar length to those from r/ShittyAskScience, resulting in a curated set of 502 logically sound entries.This benchmark is mixed with SmartyPat-Bench and SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented to compute metrics such as false positive rates.• Prolog-related: We use SWI-Prolog [Wielemaker et al. 2024], a widely adopted open-source implementation of the Prolog language, recognized for its robustness and reliability in logic programming applications.</p>
<p>RQ1: Fallacy Generation Quality</p>
<p>To systematically evaluate the quality of generated fallacious sentences, we compare three generation methods: FallacyGen-Direct, FallacyGen-Prolog, and Smarty-Pat.For each selected logical fallacy type, each method is tasked with generating 20 distinct sentences.This yields a balanced dataset that enables per-fallacy analysis across generation strategies.Sentence Quality Evaluator.To mitigate evaluation bias, we adopt a cross-model evaluation framework.Specifically, all sentence generations are conducted using Claude 3.7 with extended thinking, while scoring is performed by a separate model, GPT-4o.This separation ensures that the evaluation results reflect generalizable sentence quality rather than model-specific artifacts.Each generated sentence is evaluated on a 0-3 scale, where 3 denotes strong alignment with the intended fallacy type.To ensure robustness and minimize randomness, all evaluations are conducted at a temperature of 0, and each sentence is scored three times.The evaluation prompt used is detailed in Table 12.</p>
<p>Sentence Quality Evaluator Validity.To validate the validity of our scoring prompt, we conduct two key assessments to ensure it can serve as a reliable proxy for human annotation.First, we apply the prompt to all declarative sentences in the benchmark dataset SmartyPat-Bench.As shown in Appendix 9.7, all labeled fallacy types achieve average scores above 2.9, demonstrating the prompt's strong discriminative ability ).These fallacies are thus readily generable without requiring contextually grounded reasoning.This shows that LLMs excel at generating surface-level fallacies but struggle with more complex, logically embedded ones.In contrast, fallacy types such as CT demand richer contextual inference or sociocultural awareness, presenting more significant challenges.As a result, we exclude these trivially generable fallacies from Prolog-based generation, given that FallacyGen-Direct already achieves near-optimal performance, leaving limited room for improvement.</p>
<p>SmartyPat Effectiveness.As illustrated in Figure 3, SmartyPat consistently reduces the number of low-quality outputs (scores 0 and 1) and significantly increases the proportion of high-quality sentences (scores 2 and 3).This pattern is consistent across almost all fallacy types.Notably, for example, FC, SmartyPat generates 60 score-3 instances, outperforming FallacyGen-Prolog (25) and FallacyGen-Direct (9), underscoring its superiority in capturing both structure and semantics.SmartyPat demonstrates a significant quality advantage in generating sentences for the selected logical fallacies.</p>
<p>Comparison of Average Scores.all categories.The "Enhance" row highlights the relative improvement of SmartyPat over FallacyGen-Direct.On average, SmartyPat outperforms by 38.12%, with notable gains in IE (+58.88%),IT (+62.16%),FC (+52.54%), and FS (+45.08%).These results demonstrate that SmartyPat significantly improves both structural accuracy and semantic fidelity across a diverse set of logical fallacy types.These results demonstrate that SmartyPat significantly surpasses baseline methods, confirming its effectiveness for generating logic-driven fallacy instances.</p>
<p>ANSWER to RQ1</p>
<p>Based on the generation of 20 sentences per fallacy type across all three methods, we find that SmartyPat is the most effective logical fallacy generator.By integrating specially designed Prolog predicates with LLM-based fact generation, SmartyPat demonstrates superior performance in generating diverse and high-fidelity fallacious reasoning instances for each fallacy type.</p>
<p>RQ2: LLM Fallacy Existence Detection Capability</p>
<p>To evaluate the capability of LLMs in identifying the existence of logical fallacies in sentences, we assess nine state-of-the-art LLMs on both SmartyPat-Bench and Smar-tyPat, which cover 14 and 11 fallacy types, respectively.Our analysis is conducted from two perspectives: the overall ability of LLMs to detect logical fallacies, and the relative ease with which different fallacy labels are identified.Logical Fallacy Detection Ability We compute the FP (false positives), representing logically sound sentences incorrectly identified as fallacious; the FN (false negatives), representing fallacious sentences misclassified as sound; and the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.The results are shown in Figure 4. First, we observe that SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented generated by SmartyPat exhibits a similar distribution of FP, FN, and F1-scores compared to the original SmartyPat-Bench, suggesting that LLMs perceive both benchmarks as comparably fallacious in nature.Across both datasets, non-reasoning models such as DeepSeek V3 and Grok-2 consistently achieve the highest F1-scores, outperforming well-known reasoning-oriented models like Claude 3.7 (extended thinking) and GPT-o3-mini.This outcome is counterintuitive, as reasoning models are typically expected to perform better on logical tasks.A closer inspection reveals that these models tend to overanalyze and apply overly strict criteria for what constitutes a logically sound sentence.For instance, a sentence such as "If you are a beginner, it is best to begin with a flat board"-which is relatively benign-is flagged by Claude 3.7 as an accident fallacy, on the grounds that the rule is overly general.This behavior may stem from a form of confirmation bias in LLMs, wherein models are predisposed to interpret inputs through the lens of the task domain (i.e., assuming all content must involve a fallacy) [O' Leary 2025].Furthermore, we find that all models exhibit high FP rates and near-zero FN rates across both SmartyPat-Bench and SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented reinforcing the observation that LLMs are prone to over-identify fallacies.Notably, reasoning models tend to exhibit even higher FP rates than non-reasoning models such as DeepSeek V3 Table 6.The accuracy (higher is better) of LLMs in identifying logical fallacies in sentences from SmartyPat-Bench and SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented. EC denotes equivocation, NF denotes nominal fallacy, and etc.We highlight high accuracy rates (above 85%) in red, and low accuracy rates (below 15%) in blue.To save space, we adopt shorthand notations, see Table 7. Avg.stands for the average.labels, and then dividing by the total number of ground-truth labels for that fallacy type.When analyzing the average behavior of all models across the two benchmarks for each fallacy type (i.e., vertically), we find that LLMs are particularly effective at detecting False Cause (FS) and False Analogy (FA).In contrast, detection accuracy is notably lower for Contextomy (CT), followed by Improper Transposition (IT) and Improper Distribution or Addition (ID).These results suggest that LLMs are more capable of recognizing causal relationships and performing basic analogical reasoning-skills aligned with human intuition-but struggle with fallacies that require more nuanced contextual understanding.When comparing model performance across all fallacy categories (i.e., horizontally), we observe that detection accuracy on SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented consistently surpasses that on SmartyPat-Bench, further reinforcing the high quality and clarity of fallacious reasoning captured by the SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented dataset.Model-specific behavior will be further discussed in the next subsection.</p>
<p>ANSWER to RQ2</p>
<p>LLMs generally detect logical fallacies well but often overanalyze, resulting in high false positive rates.Surprisingly, non-reasoning models like Grok-2 and DeepSeek V3 often outperform reasoning models in detection-likely due to fewer overinterpretations.Higher detection accuracy on SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented further suggests it effectively captures essential fallacy characteristics.</p>
<p>RQ3: LLM Fallacy Categorization Capability</p>
<p>This section will experiment on if llm can correctly assign fallacy labels to the given sentences.We tested all nine LLMs on both SmartyPat-Bench and SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented. The categorization task differs from the row averages in Table 6 in that it evaluates not only whether the ground-truth fallacy appears in the model's predicted labels, but also considers the overall similarity between the two sets-including factors such as prediction order and the presence of incorrect labels.Ranked Fallacy Scorer.We adopt a weighted scoring mechanism where the rank of the model's prediction determines its score: Let  = [ 1 ,  2 , . . .,   ] denote the ground-truth fallacy labels, and  = [ 1 ,  2 , . . .,   ] denote the predicted fallacy labels.</p>
<p>The original scoring algorithm evaluates prediction quality by iterating through each predicted label   .If   appears in , it contributes positively with a score of + 1  , where  is the prediction position; otherwise, it contributes negatively as − 1  .Formally, the scoring function is defined as:   -9.32 -13.30 -36.66 -55.80 -62.46 -80.64 -89.40 -177.31 -184.13Comparision of fallacy label score on SmartyPat-Bench Fig. 5.

of fallacy types), but only one ground-truth fallacy exists.In this case, none of the predicted fallacies appear in , yielding the lowest possible score:
− 𝑇 −1 𝑖=1 1
 .Fallacy Categorization Capabilities.Figure 5 presents fallacy label scores for each model, with the left figure corresponding to SmartyPat-Bench and the right to SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented. Comparing the two, we observe that the distribution of scores in the right figure skews more toward the left (higher score), indicating improved categorization performance on SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented. This further supports the claim that SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented captures logical fallacy patterns more clearly and is easier for LLMs to classify accurately.Notably, both Claude 3.7 and Claude 3.7 with extended thinking show improvements of approximately 70%-likely on SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented possibly due to their familiarity with the generated content [Panickssery et al. 2024].Additionally, reasoning models tend to outperform their non-reasoning counterparts.We can observe that O3Mini achieves significantly better results on both datasets compared to GPT-4o and DeepSeek R1 outperforms DeepSeek V3.These results suggest that reasoning models are generally more effective than non-reasoning models in fallacy classification tasks.Grok-2 Performance Explanation.Interestingly, Grok-2 performs significantly better than expected-it also ranks second in RQ2 for fallacy existence detection.This counter-intuitive result is explained in Table 8, which shows that Grok-2 tends to generate fewer predicted labels.Producing fewer incorrect labels reduces the overall penalty in the scoring function, which benefits its final categorization score.In contrast, more rigorous models like the Claude 3.7 series generate the highest number of predicted labels for both SmartyPat-Bench and SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented. However, this also introduces more incorrect labels, negatively impacting their score in the categorization task (Figure 5).This effect is further evidenced in SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented, where the gap in predicted label count between the most verbose model (Claude 3.7 series) and the most conservative (O3-mini) shrinks approximately from 700 to 300 labels .Takeaway Message.The GPT series-particularly GPT-o3-mini-demonstrates consistently strong performance, ranking third in F1 score (Figure 4), with only a 5% gap from the top performer.It achieves the best results in categorization (Figure 5).With the fewest predicted labels overall (Table 8), indicating high precision in label selection, GPT-o3-mini emerges as a well-balanced model for both detection and classification tasks.</p>
<p>ANSWER to RQ3</p>
<p>Reasoning LLMs generally perform better in fallacy categorization.Grok-2 achieves competitive scores by generating fewer labels and thus fewer penalties, while the GPT series balances label quantity and strong categorization performance.</p>
<p>LIMITATIONS AND FUTUREWORK</p>
<p>Evaluating LLMs' Capability of Explaining Logical Fallacies.This work evaluates the ability of LLMs to detect and classify logical fallacies, using labeled data for this task.However, correctly assigning a fallacy label does not necessarily indicate that the model truly understands the underlying reasoning.To demonstrate genuine understanding, an LLM would need to explain why a given sentence constitutes a fallacy-or why it does not.While this explanation-based evaluation is valuable, it is beyond the scope of this work (an automated technique for logical fallacy testcase generation) and remains an open direction for future research.Soundness of the Test Oracles.Since we rely on LLMs to generate new logical facts, there are chances that the facts may not fit the rules well.Although the generated facts may appear syntactically correct, the atoms within them may not always perfectly align with the intended relationship expressed by the predicate when LLMs are not correctly promptd.Therefore, the test oracles (existence of fallacies and labels) for the generated testcases may not be 100% sound.Nevertheless, these instances would still be interpretable and the experiment results in RQ1 show that the quality of the generated data is very close to the manually processed dataset.</p>
<p>RELATED WORK</p>
<p>Logic Reasoning Benchmarking.Traditional evaluation methods assess various logical inference forms, including inductive reasoning, which involves drawing conclusions from a set of observed propositions and generalizing patterns from specific cases [Sinha et al. 2019]; deductive reasoning, which derives logically certain conclusions from all available observations, even in the presence of unobserved special cases [Tian et al. 2021]; and abductive reasoning, which aims to identify the most plausible explanation for a given set of observations [Del and Fishel 2022].These reasoning tasks typically require constructing complex first-order logic representations that involve the use of quantifiers (∀ for universal quantification, ∃ for existential quantification, ∃! for unique existence, and ∄ for negated existence), as well as logical connectives such as conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), negation (¬), implication (→), biconditional (↔), exclusive or (⊕), nand (↑), and nor (↓).To rigorously assess an LLM's inferential capabilities, benchmarks such as FOLIO [Han et al. 2022] and LOGICBench [Parmar et al. 2024] provide structured evaluation settings that test its ability to navigate these logical constructs effectively.</p>
<p>Testing Deep Learning Models.DeepGauge [Ma et al. 2018] pioneered testing deep learning (DL) systems, emphasizing the importance of test oracles for DL, including LLMs.Subsequent works adapted traditional software testing techniques, such as mutation testing [Humbatova et al. 2021] and fuzzing [Xie et al. 2019], to DL systems.Recently, logic programming was introduced for generating logically sound factual knowledge to test LLMs for hallucination detection [Li et al. 2024b], highlighting its potential for effective LLM testing.</p>

<p>In this section, we provide the prompt specifically crafted for scoring with LLMs.To ensure scoring consistency and reduce randomness, the temperature parameter of the LLMs is fixed at 0 throughout the evaluation process.The prompt is shown in the Table 11.</p>
<p>Querying Prompt</p>
<p>In this stage, we present detailed definitions of each logical fallacy to the LLMs.A carefully constructed prompt guides the model to assess whether a sentence exhibits any logical fallacy and to identify the most relevant one(s), if applicable.The results are returned in a structured JSON format to support subsequent processing steps.The Sentence Quality Evaluator and Sentence Quality Evaluator Validity tasks are evaluated using a shared prompt.As the prompt is capable of addressing both tasks effectively, we provide a single example to illustrate its design.The prompt is shown in the Table 12.Instruction: You are a professional logical fallacy evaluator.Your task is to review a file containing sentences that illustrate specific logical fallacies and assign each a score based on how well the sentence demonstrates the intended fallacy (as indicated by its type field).Evaluate them more holistically based on your understanding of how these fallacies manifest in real-world human communication and reasoning.Do not use code-based method.Scoring Guide:</p>
<p>-Score 0: The sentence makes no sense or does not exhibit the intended logical error.</p>
<p>-Score 1: The sentence shows only minor applicability of the fallacy in its type field.</p>
<p>-Score 2: The sentence largely demonstrates the fallacy.</p>
<p>-Score 3: The sentence is a perfect example of the logical fallacy as described in its type.Definitions:</p>

Baseline Testing and Analysis.We find that FallacyGen-Direct demonstrates high performance in generating specific fallacy types-particularly equivocation, nominal fallacy, and false dilemma.These categories predominantly rely on shallow lexical cues and syntactic structures, LLMs can reproduce without engaging in deep semantic reasoning.For instance, equivocation and nominal fallacy exploit lexical ambiguity (e.g., pound referring to both currency and weight, or burn calories not denoting literal combustion).Their generation hinges on surface-level word associations, a strength of LLMs.Similarly, false dilemma often manifests through rigid binary framing, which LLMs can emulate by pattern-matching simplistic sentence structures (e.g., framing options as mutually exclusive, despite real-world scenarios rarely being binary in nature.</p>
<p>As shown in Table6, this analysis aims to identify which fallacy types LLMs are better at detecting using SmartyPat on the SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented dataset.Detection accuracy is computed by checking, for each ground-truth fallacy label in a sentence, whether it appears in the LLM's predicted , Vol. 1, No. 1, Article .Publication date: August 2025.

CONCLUSIONWe propose SmartyPat-Bench, a real-world dataset of fallacious questions, and SmartyPat, a Prolog-based method for generating high-quality fallacy sentences, resulting in SmartyPat-Bench-Augmented. SmartyPat outperforms two baselines in generating accurate, diverse fallacies.Evaluating nine state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that stronger models tend to overanalyze, causing high false positives.Non-reasoning models excel at detection, while reasoning models perform better at categorization.The GPT series, especially GPT-o3-mini, offers the best overall balance across both tasks.
