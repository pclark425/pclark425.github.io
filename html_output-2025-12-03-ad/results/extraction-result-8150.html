                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This paper investigates the integration of cognitive agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) within the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to reinforce software project management. By deploying virtual agents in simulated software environments, this study explores their potential to fulfill fundamental roles in IT project development, thereby optimizing project outcomes through intelligent automation. Particular emphasis is placed on the adaptability of these agents to Agile methodologies and their transformative impact on decision-making, problem-solving, and collaboration dynamics. The research leverages the CogniSim ecosystem, a platform designed to simulate real-world software engineering challenges, such as aligning technical capabilities with business objectives, managing interdependencies, and maintaining project agility. Through iterative simulations, cognitive agents demonstrate advanced capabilities in task delegation, inter-agent communication, and project lifecycle management. By employing natural language processing to facilitate meaningful dialogues, these agents emulate human roles and improve the efficiency and precision of Agile practices. Key findings from this investigation highlight the ability of LLM-powered cognitive agents to deliver measurable improvements in various metrics, including task completion times, quality of deliverables, and communication coherence. These agents exhibit scalability and adaptability, ensuring their applicability across diverse and complex project environments. This study underscores the potential of integrating LLM-powered agents into Agile project management frameworks as a means of advancing software engineering practices. This integration not only refines the execution of project management tasks but also sets the stage for a paradigm shift in how teams collaborate and address emerging challenges.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Software engineering has undergone significant transformations due to rapid technological progress.The integration of sophisticated tools and methodologies is now essential to manage the increasing complexity and scale of modern software systems [1,2].</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In this rapidly changing landscape, the adoption of advanced technologies plays a critical role in addressing the challenges posed by large-scale and complex software systems.</p>
<p>Today's software development environment faces significant challenges, including managing extensive codebases, ensuring security, and maintaining quality across distributed teams.Traditional methodologies, such as the Waterfall model, have given way to Agile frameworks that emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility [3].</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of Agile methodologies, they have inherent limitations when scaling and managing large-scale, complex projects effectively [4].Managing complex software systems requires breaking down the development process into structured activities.A common approach involves applying generic activities, communication, planning, modeling, construction, and deployment for each major product function [5].</p>
<p>The Scrum, a framework within Agile methodologies, addresses large-scale software system challenges through structured processes and defined roles.As shown in Figure 1, it organizes work via artifacts and scheduled meetings.The Product Backlog, managed by the Product Owner, aligns requirements with stakeholder goals.The Scrum team, led by the Scrum Master, plans a Sprint Backlog for a time-boxed iteration called a Sprint.Daily Scrums track progress, while the Sprint Review assesses deliverables, and the Sprint Retrospective identifies improvements [6].This cycle ensures transparency, accountability, and steady progress toward a quality product.As detailed in Figure 2, software engineering is built on layered technology where each layer contributes to the quality and structure of the development process.This layered approach encompasses a focus on quality, processes, methods, and tools, collectively facilitating the systematic management of software engineering tasks [5].It enables project teams to estimate resource requirements, schedule tasks, and define work products for each development stage.Multi-Agent Systems, comprising networks of autonomous agents that interact to achieve defined objectives within their environment, offer a resilient solution to these challenges [8].These agents collaborate seamlessly, emulating human problem-solving processes and contributing to overall system efficiency [9].</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Large Language Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4, along with others like Google's PaLM and Meta's LLaMA, have transformed natural language processing by generating human-like content across various formats, including natural text generation for conversational tasks and storytelling, code generation to assist in software development, and tool use to perform complex workflows such as web searching, robotic operations, and online shopping [10].In software engineering, LLMs can automate routine tasks like code completion, documentation, and debugging, reducing errors and leading to higher productivity [11][12][13].</p>
<p>Scaling Agile methodologies for large, complex projects introduces challenges such as coordinating across multiple teams, maintaining communication, and aligning organizational goals.Frameworks like SAFe, LeSS, and DAD address these issues by offering structured yet flexible approaches to Agile on scale, including defined roles, processes, and lifecycle models tailored to project needs.Although adoption requires overcoming cultural resistance and integration challenges, these frameworks have shown improvements in product quality, customer satisfaction, and delivery speed [13].</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have been applied to distributed problems in dynamic environments [14], and the FIPA standards [15] established by the IEEE Computer Society enhance interoperability and efficiency within Agile frameworks.These standards streamline agent communication, coordination, and scalability.When combined with LLMs, as in frameworks like CoALA, MASs benefit from improved memory management, adaptive decision-making, and fluid inter-agent cooperation [16].</p>
<p>Recent advancements in MASs and LLMs are reshaping software engineering by introducing cognitive capabilities that improve reasoning, planning, and teamwork [17].LLM-based MASs have emerged as a promising vision, equipped to address complex engineering tasks through autonomous problem-solving and scalable coordination [18].Frameworks such as AGILE integrate reinforcement learning and LLMs, enabling agents to leverage tools and consult domain experts more effectively [19].These agents have demonstrated applicability throughout the software lifecycle-from for requirements from engineering to maintenance-supported by specialized benchmarks and evaluation methods [20].CodePori exemplifies the scalable integration of LLM-MAS, streamlining development tasks such as design, coding, and testing [21].</p>
<p>Over the past decade, Agile methodologies have significantly matured, with research underscoring the importance of theory-driven approaches to enhance their effectiveness [3].Simultaneously, incorporating intelligent techniques, including machine learning and Bayesian networks, into Agile software development (ASD) has been shown to support decision-making, optimize effort estimation, and refine resource allocation [2].Advances in MASs combined with LLMs illustrate how LLM-powered agents can promote more nuanced negotiation, role specialization, and collaborative decision-making [22].Such systems can shift organizational dynamics from competition toward cooperative efforts, improving knowledge exchange and communication [8].Furthermore, integrating theoryof-mind capabilities into LLM-based MASs promises richer context-sensitive interactions and deeper inter-agent comprehension [23].</p>
<p>Motivation and Research Gap</p>
<p>The combination of Multi-Agent Systems and Large Language Models creates a significant synergy, giving rise to cognitive multi-agent ecosystems that merge the strengths of both technologies [23,24].This integration is particularly relevant in Agile software development, where flexibility, collaboration, and customer-centric approaches are paramount [1].LLM-augmented MASs can facilitate more efficient task performance, adapting to dynamic contexts and evolving requirements, and thereby more effectively address the complexities inherent in modern large-scale software engineering projects.</p>
<p>At the same time, frameworks for scaling Agile practices-such as the Scaled Agile Framework, Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS), or Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)-provide structured guidance for extending Agile principles across diverse and distributed teams [4,25], while these frameworks have achieved measurable improvements in areas like product quality and delivery speed, they still struggle to fully accommodate the heightened complexity and coordination demands of large-scale software initiatives.Existing approaches often lack the cognitive sophistication required to integrate advanced decision-making support and context-aware communication, leaving critical opportunities for more robust reasoning, planning, and adaptability unaddressed.</p>
<p>Although MASs have shown potential in distributed problem-solving and adaptive coordination [14,15], and LLMs have demonstrated effectiveness in tasks such as code generation, documentation, and interactive tool use [10][11][12][13], the literature lacks a cohesive framework that unifies these capabilities within a scaled Agile context.Recent work has explored cognitive MASs and LLMs individually [16][17][18][19], yet the integration of these technologies into established scaled Agile processes remains limited and fragmented.</p>
<p>Integrating cognitive agents and LLMs into frameworks like SAFe could provide deep, context-sensitive insights into project management and development workflows, enhancing not only the efficiency and quality of engineering tasks but also the agility with which teams respond to evolving objectives [26,27].By explicitly addressing the current research gap-namely, the absence of a comprehensive, LLM-augmented MAS framework aligned with scaled Agile methodologies-this work aims to establish a foundation that can lead to improved coordination, decision-making, and adaptability in large-scale software engineering efforts.</p>
<p>Objectives and Problem Statements</p>
<p>This study aims to develop and analyze the CogniSim framework, a cognitive Multi-Agent System designed to transform software project management by integrating cognitive agents powered by LLMs.The primary objectives are to create a framework that automates routine project tasks, enhances workflows, and aligns with established Agile practices-particularly SAFe-to ensure scalability and effectiveness.By demonstrating its practical applications in software engineering, the framework will be evaluated through case studies and simulations.</p>
<p>Building upon the identified research gap and the outlined objectives for integrating LLM-augmented MASs within Scaled Agile Frameworks, this study's evaluation focuses on the following research questions (RQs):</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>RQ1: To what extent can cognitive agents, powered by LLMs, effectively simulate Agile roles and processes in a complex software development environment (e.g., SAFe)? 2.</p>
<p>RQ2: How do variations in key parameters (e.g., model type, number of iterations, agent roles) influence the quality of outcomes, including code artifacts, documentation, and decision-making efficacy?</p>
<p>Approach and Methodology</p>
<p>This study adopts a design and implementation process to develop and refine the CogniSim framework as a problem-solving artifact.The methodology is aligned with Agile principles and SAFe guidelines, ensuring that the virtual environment and agent interactions reflect the complexities of large-scale software development [3,4,25].By grounding the approach in Agile concepts and considering the evolving nature of software architectures, we address the need for reconciling architectural documentation with Agile methodologies for better project outcomes [28].</p>
<p>Each cognitive agent represents a distinct Agile role-such as a Product Owner, System Architect, or QA Engineer-and operates autonomously to manage tasks, perform quality assurance, and provide continuous feedback.By doing so, the system emulates typical workflows, dependencies, and communication patterns in modern software engineering projects [1,2,5].</p>
<p>The technical foundation involves Python-based tooling, GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 language models, and the LangChain framework.LLM-powered agents process natural language instructions, generate documentation, and make context-aware decisions.This capacity allows the agents to adapt to evolving project goals, resource constraints, and shifts in priority, supporting Agile methodologies that emphasize responsiveness to change [11][12][13].</p>
<p>This methodology uses iterative simulations and case studies to evaluate the system's performance under various conditions.Simulated scenarios include activities such as Program Increment (PI) Planning, Iteration Execution, and Inspect-and-Adapt Workshops, all of which are core elements of SAFe-based Agile processes.These simulations enable controlled experimentation with different agent configurations, memory management strategies, and prompt designs to assess the system's effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability [17][18][19].</p>
<p>Evaluations rely on both qualitative and quantitative metrics.Key measures include the clarity and accuracy of generated artifacts, the extent to which decisions align with the defined architectural and business objectives, and the timeliness of deliverables.By comparing these outcomes against accepted best practices or human-generated baselines, the study identifies areas for improvement and informs subsequent adjustments to agent behavior, communication protocols, and underlying language model configurations [2,22].This iterative feedback loop ensures that CogniSim remains adaptable as project complexity or organizational needs evolve [23,24].</p>
<p>Evaluation Framework</p>
<p>The evaluation applies both qualitative and quantitative techniques to assess how well the CogniSim framework supports Agile project management practices.Each simulation run produces a detailed record of interactions, decisions, and generated artifacts, as well as configuration parameters and anomalies encountered.This comprehensive documentation enables reproducibility and clear analysis pathways.</p>
<p>A qualitative thematic analysis is performed on the collected data to identify patterns that align with Agile principles, including communication efficiency, iterative refinement of tasks, and conformity with SAFe guidelines.Emergent themes are contrasted against established best practices to ensure that observed improvements are not coincidental.Quantitative metrics complement these qualitative insights, examining factors such as task completion times, clarity of generated outputs, and responsiveness to evolving requirements.These metrics provide a multifaceted perspective on performance.Although initial results suggest positive potential, future work involves extending the range of conditions tested, introducing more complex scenarios, and incorporating benchmarking against human-driven baselines to further refine the framework's utility and reliability.</p>

<p>Preliminaries</p>
<p>This section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts essential to this study, including agile software development methodologies with a focus on the Scaled Agile Framework, an introduction to cognitive agents and Large Language Models, and the fundamentals of Multi-Agent Systems and their applications in software engineering.</p>
<p>Agile Software Development</p>
<p>Agile software development is a group of methodologies that promote development, collaboration, and adaptability throughout the software development life cycle.Unlike the Waterfall model, Agile emphasizes customer collaboration, responses to change, and progressive delivery of tangible software [29].</p>
<p>One of the most adopted agile methodologies is Scrum, which structures development into time-boxed iterations called sprints.Each sprint results in a shippable product increment, allowing for consistent reassessment of project priorities and alignment with customer needs [30].As illustrated in Figure 3, a generic Agile iteration cycle typically begins by selecting items from a prioritized backlog, proceeding through development and testing, demonstrating increments to stakeholders, and reflecting in retrospectives to guide continuous improvement.For expanding organizations dealing with advanced systems and multiple teams, the Scaled Agile Framework provides a coherent approach to scaling Agile practices [25].SAFe integrates principles from Lean thinking, Agile development, and systems thinking to facilitate coordination between teams and align development efforts with the goals of the organization.As illustrated in Section 8, the Scaled Agile Framework emphasizes five conceptual layers, Organizational Agility, Lean Portfolio Management, Enterprise Solution Delivery, Agile Product Delivery, and Team and Technical Agility, which collectively enable organizations to scale Agile practices and achieve business agility, with cognitive agents and MASs supporting each layer.</p>
<p>SAFe introduces the concept of the Agile Release Train (ART) [31], a structure that aligns multiple Agile teams and stakeholders to incrementally develop and deliver value within a value stream.While the ART is a SAFe-specific concept, the notion of multiple teams working in parallel and integrating their increments continuously is not exclusive to SAFe. Figure 4 offers a framework-neutral conceptual representation of how multiple Agile teams can plan, deliver, and integrate increments to support complex product development.This alignment facilitates improved coordination, synchronization, and collaboration between teams, enhancing the ability to handle advanced projects and product development.Despite its benefits, the implementation of scaled Agile practices, including SAFe, presents challenges such as maintaining alignment between multiple teams, ensuring consistent communication, and integrating advanced technologies [32].The integration of pioneering technologies such as cognitive agents and LLM can address these challenges by automating coordination tasks and enhancing communication efficiency.</p>
<p>Cognitive Agents and Large Language Models</p>
<p>Cognitive agents are smart systems capable of perceiving their environment, reasoning about inputs, learning from experiences, and taking actions to achieve goals [33].They mimic human cognitive functions such as perception, learning, and problem-solving, enabling them to perform advanced tasks autonomously.A single cognitive agent, as shown in Figure 5, can range from a simple unit equipped with a specific function to a highly capable entity integrating diverse components such as memory, tools, and reasoning mechanisms.This flexibility allows cognitive agents to adapt to varying requirements, enabling modular scalability and dynamic task allocation based on evolving needs.</p>
<p>The development of Large Language Models, such as GPT-4, has advanced the capabilities of cognitive agents [34].LLMs, such as GPT-4, are trained on diverse and extensive datasets, including sources like web pages, books, and scientific articles, enabling them to understand and generate language effectively [34].This capability allows cognitive agents to process input from natural language, participate in conversations, and perform tasks that require understanding context and semantics [35].In the context of software engineering, LLMs enhance cognitive agents by enabling them to automate code generation [36], assist in documentation [37], facilitate communication [23], and support decision-making [24].By automating code generation, cognitive agents can produce code snippets or entire functions based on natural language descriptions, streamlining the development process.Assisting in documentation involves creating or updating documentation by summarizing code functionalities, ensuring that project documentation remains updated and substantial.Facilitating communication allows these agents to serve as virtual assistants in meetings, transcribing discussions and highlighting action items, thereby improving team collaboration.Additionally, supporting decisionmaking enables agents to analyze project data and provide insights that inform strategic decisions, enhancing the decision-making process within development teams [18].</p>
<p>The integration of LLMs into cognitive agents empowers them to handle tasks that require understanding advanced linguistic patterns and domain knowledge, making them valuable assets in Agile software development environments [18].</p>
<p>The integration of Large Language Models into cognitive agents enhances their linguistic capabilities while also advancing their overall cognitive functions through foundational components such as planning, memory, and tool use.In an LLM-powered autonomous system, as shown in Figure 6a, the LLM functions as the agent's central processor, coordinating processes to efficiently address complex tasks.Planning involves breaking down extensive objectives into manageable subgoals, facilitating systematic advancement through structured strategies.Reflection and self-assessment enable the agent to analyze prior actions, learn from mistakes, and optimize future strategies, thereby increasing the precision and effectiveness of its outcomes.</p>
<p>Memory is structured into short-term and long-term functionalities.Short-term memory employs in-context learning and prompt engineering to quickly assimilate new information, while long-term memory supports the storage and retrieval of extensive information over extended durations, often using external vector stores and rapid-access systems.Furthermore, the agent's ability to utilize tools enhances its capabilities beyond the limitations of pretrained models.By integrating external APIs, real-time data, executable code, and proprietary information, the agent substantially improves its adaptability and operational efficiency in evolving environments.</p>
<p>Figure 6b illustrates the architecture of cognitive agents, highlighting the four interdependent components, perception, reasoning, learning, and action, arranged in a cyclic process.At the center of this architecture, Large Language Models act as the unifying core, enhancing each layer's functionality.The perception layer utilizes LLMs to improve natural language understanding, enabling agents to process and interpret complex linguistic inputs.In the reasoning layer, LLMs provide contextual insights and support advanced decisionmaking processes.The learning layer benefits from the continuous learning capabilities offered by LLMs, enabling agents to adapt and evolve using textual data.Finally, the action layer leverages LLMs to facilitate language-based task execution, ensuring efficient and accurate interaction with the environment.The cyclic design emphasizes the iterative and interconnected nature of these components, driven by the central role of LLMs.Recent advancements in the application of Large Language Models demonstrate their potential in educational and project management contexts, as evidenced by the MCQGen framework.This framework leverages LLMs combined with retrieval-augmented generation and advanced prompt engineering to automate personalized content creation [39].</p>
<p>Multi-Agent Systems</p>
<p>Multi-Agent Systems consist of interacting agents that collaborate to achieve individual or shared goals within an environment [40].Each agent operates autonomously, perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions.The agents in a MAS can be homogeneous-where all agents share identical capabilities, roles, and behavior-or heterogeneous, with agents differing in capabilities, roles, or objectives, allowing for specialization and complementary problem-solving.This distinction enables the MAS to be tailored to specific applications, with homogeneous systems offering simplicity and uniformity, while heterogeneous systems provide greater flexibility and complexity.In addition, their interactions can range from cooperative to competitive [41,42].</p>
<p>In software engineering, Multi-Agent Systems are applied in various domains.Figure 7 illustrates these applications, including distributed problem-solving, simulation and modeling, resource management, and collaborative software development.</p>
<p>In distributed problem-solving, agents divide complex problems into tasks and solve them concurrently, improving efficiency [43].Simulation and modeling involve the use of MASs to replicate real-world systems, such as traffic networks or social behaviors, to analyze and predict outcomes [44].Resource management tasks are managed by agents that handle resources in cloud computing environments, optimizing allocation and utiliza-tion [45].In collaborative software development, agents help integrate, test, and deploy code, thereby enhancing collaboration between development teams [46].The application of MASs in software engineering offers several benefits.Scalability is achieved because MASs can handle expanding systems by distributing tasks among agents, allowing the system to grow without a significant drop in performance [47].Flexibility is provided by agents' ability to adapt to changes in the environment or requirements, making MASs suitable for systems where conditions frequently change [48].Robustness is enhanced by the decentralized nature of the MAS, which reduces the single point of failure and increases the reliability of the system [49].</p>
<p>Frameworks such as ChatDev demonstrate the power of LLMs in unifying diverse roles through a structured, language-based communication model.By segmenting tasks into smaller, manageable phases and utilizing mechanisms like communicative dehallucination to ensure precision, these systems enhance the quality, completeness, and execution of generated software [50].</p>
<p>Integrating cognitive agents powered by LLMs into MASs combines the benefits of both technologies, leading to systems capable of advanced reasoning, learning, and collaboration [8].This integration is particularly advantageous in Agile software development, where adaptability and enhanced communication are crucial.</p>
<p>CogniSim Framework</p>
<p>Before detailing its architecture, it is essential to clarify the nature of CogniSim and the capabilities it must encompass to address the challenges of large-scale Agile software development outlined in previous sections.CogniSim is a cognitive software framework designed to enhance and streamline Agile project management processes by integrating cognitive agents powered by Large Language Models into a Multi-Agent System environment.Rather than serving as a mere collection of standalone tools, CogniSim provides an intelligent system of LLM-augmented agents that collaborate with human teams.To effectively address previously discussed challenges, such as increasing complexity, scalability, and the need for efficient communication, CogniSim must incorporate several key features and characteristics.These include cognitive assistance in understanding and reasoning about project contexts, the automation of labor intensive activities, inherent scalability aligned with Agile principles, and continuous quality assurance to ensure adherence to established practices.Table 1 summarizes these key attributes, highlighting how each directly addresses the challenges identified earlier.</p>
<p>Feature/Characteristic Description and Role in Addressing Challenges</p>
<p>Cognitive assistance LLM-powered agents provide human-like reasoning capabilities, enabling them to interpret natural language requirements and adapt to changing project contexts.This aligns with previous analyses highlighting the need for intelligent automation in complex software projects [23,34].</p>
<p>Automation of routine tasks</p>
<p>By automating coding, documentation, and backlog refinement, the framework reduces human workload and cognitive overhead, allowing team members to focus on strategic decisions.Prior studies show that LLM-based code generation and documentation support improve productivity [11,36].</p>
<p>Scalability and Agile alignment</p>
<p>CogniSim integrates seamlessly with Agile methodologies, particularly SAFe, ensuring synchronized development, continuous improvement, and effective communication across multiple teams and large-scale projects [4,25].</p>
<p>Quality assurance and methodology adherence</p>
<p>Specialized agents continuously verify that deliverables meet coding standards, adhere to Agile processes, and align with strategic objectives.This ensures high-quality outputs, as evidenced by the importance of formal quality metrics in software engineering [3,51].</p>
<p>With these foundational capabilities established, the following subsections detail the CogniSim framework's layered architecture, its agent categorization, its integration with SAFe, and the quality measures that guide its performance evaluation.</p>
<p>Framework Architecture</p>
<p>The CogniSim framework is built on a layered architecture that integrates cognitive agents, communication protocols, learning algorithms, decision-making frameworks, and collaboration tools.As depicted in Figure 8, the architecture consists of several key components.</p>
<p>The Foundation Layer is composed of a Large Language Model, such as GPT, BERT, and T5, which serves as the backbone for natural language understanding, reasoning, and task execution.These models provide the foundational capabilities necessary for enabling higher-layer functionalities.This layer allows the system to process, analyze, and generate human-like responses, making it suitable for integration with various applications.</p>
<p>The Multi-Agent System Layer consists of two distinct components.Layer 2 (A) represents the core MAS framework where agents interact, collaborate, and make autonomous decisions.These agents leverage the LLM foundation for reasoning and adaptiveness.Layer 2 (B) encompasses systems with AI integrations, such as Jira, Microsoft Azure, and GitHub, which provide operational support and external APIs for seamless task management, development, and communication.</p>
<p>The Cognitive Agents Layer (Layer 3) includes roles such as Product Owners, DevOps Engineers, and Development Teams.These agents manage and streamline tasks using integrated AI systems.Product Owners define and prioritize backlog items, ensuring alignment with business needs.DevOps Engineers maintain the CI/CD pipeline for smooth deployments and operations.The Development Team implements features, conducts code reviews, and performs testing.This modular and layered architecture ensures scalability, flexibility, and enhanced collaboration across human teams and AI-driven agents, optimizing software engineering workflows.</p>
<p>Agent Categorization</p>
<p>Within the CogniSim framework, agents are categorized based on their roles and responsibilities to optimize collaboration and task execution.The main categories include Manager Agents, Executor Agents, Quality Checker Agents, and Methodology Reviewer Agents.Manager Agents are responsible for high-level decision-making, resource allocation, and overseeing project progress [52].These agents emulate roles such as Project Managers and Product Owners.Executor Agents focus on performing specific tasks such as coding, testing, and documentation [53], representing roles like Developers, QA Engineers, and Technical Writers.Quality Checker Agents ensure that deliverables meet predefined quality standards [54] by conducting code reviews, performing testing, and validating outputs against requirements.Methodology Reviewer Agents monitor adherence to Agile practices and methodologies [3], providing feedback on processes and suggesting improvements to enhance efficiency.Table 2 summarizes the agent categories and their primary functions within the framework.</p>
<p>Each agent is equipped with specific capabilities aligned with its role, enabling specialization and efficiency in task execution.The collaborative interaction among different agent types facilitates a comprehensive approach to project management, ensuring that all aspects of the software development lifecycle are effectively addressed.[31].</p>
<p>Methodology Reviewer Agents play a crucial role in promoting continuous improvement by monitoring processes and providing feedback, thereby fostering a culture of continuous improvement as advocated by SAFe [32].Furthermore, agents focus on delivering value by aligning their tasks with the organization's strategic objectives, enhancing customer satisfaction [4].Figure 9 illustrates how CogniSim integrates with the SAFe framework.By integrating with SAFe, CogniSim enhances coordination across multiple teams, improves communication efficiency, and ensures that development efforts are aligned with organizational goals.The cognitive agents automate routine coordination tasks, allowing human team members to focus on strategic decision-making and innovation.</p>
<p>Cognitive agents dynamically adjust their reasoning and decision-making processes as project priorities evolve, integrating newly identified requirements and stakeholder feedback into their ongoing workflows.By continuously reassessing user stories, backlog items, and architectural constraints, these agents reconfigure tasks, timelines, and resource allocations in response to changing conditions.This iterative adaptation ensures that cognitive agents maintain momentum, alignment, and flexibility within Agile environments, effectively supporting teams as project contexts change.</p>
<p>Development Platform</p>
<p>The CogniSim framework operates on a structured and adaptable development platform that integrates cognitive agents and Large Language Models into a Multi-Agent System.This section examines the platform's architectural design, its essential components, and the implementation features that underscore its flexibility and scalability for Agile software development practices.</p>
<p>Platform Architecture</p>

<p>Quality Measures and Performance Metrics</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the CogniSim framework, a set of quantitative and qualitative measures was used, capturing both the efficiency of cognitive agents and their adherence to best practices.These metrics included Task Completion Time, Quality of Deliverables, Communication Efficiency, Resource Utilization, Adaptability, and Compliance with Agile Practices.Task Completion Time measures the duration taken by agents to complete assigned tasks, providing insights into their efficiency and speed [58].Quality of deliverables is assessed through code quality metrics such as cyclomatic complexity, code coverage, and adherence to coding standards [51].Communication efficiency is evaluated based on the frequency and clarity of interactions between agents and between agents and members of the human team, indicating the effectiveness of collaboration [59].Resource utilization monitors how effectively agents allocate and manage resources, reflecting optimization capabilities [53].Adaptability gauges agents' responsiveness to evolving project requirements and environmental conditions [48], while compliance with Agile Practices ensures alignment with established Agile and SAFe methodologies, maintaining industry best practices [32].These comprehensive metrics facilitate a multidimensional evaluation of agent performance.Continuous monitoring and analysis enable the identification of areas for improvement, guiding iterative enhancement of the CogniSim ecosystem.Furthermore, analyzing the impact of varying simulation parameters, such as model type, temperature settings, number of iterations, and agent roles, provides deeper insight into how these factors influence the metrics.For example, adjusting the temperature parameter affects the variability of agent responses and, in turn, influences Communication Efficiency and Quality of Deliverables.Increasing the number of iterations allows observation of agent behavior over extended interactions, offering further understanding of their Adaptability and Compliance with Agile Practices.By systematically refining these parameters, optimal configurations can be identified to enhance overall system performance.</p>
<p>Key Findings and Implications</p>
<p>The experiments reveal that cognitive agents can effectively handle structured Agile phases (e.g., PI Planning, Iteration Execution) by producing relevant user stories, code snippets aligned with predefined requirements, and infrastructure scripts for CI/CD pipelines.For example, during Iteration Execution, agents delivered code integrating a payment API and generated corresponding test cases, thereby demonstrating the creation of tangible software artifacts.</p>
<p>However, the agents' effectiveness was mixed in more open-ended phases (e.g., Inspect and Adapt), highlighting challenges in adaptability and innovation without further prompt engineering.The choice of model type (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5-turbo)and parameter settings influenced the quality, clarity, and timeliness of outputs.While GPT-4 excelled in generating well-structured code and documentation, lower temperatures enhanced precision and reliability.</p>
<p>In summary, these experiments answer our research questions (RQ1 and RQ2) by showing that cognitive agents can simulate various Agile roles effectively, produce meaningful software artifacts, and maintain performance quality under controlled experimental conditions.Adjusting independent variables (such as model type and iteration length) allowed us to identify settings that optimize dependent variables (such as code quality or responsiveness to changing requirements).Future work will focus on refining these experimental methods, incorporating more diverse project types, and validating results with real-world developer feedback.</p>
<p>Future Work</p>
<p>The future directions of this study encompass multiple pivotal areas aimed at enhancing the integration of cognitive agents, Large Language Models, and Multi-Agent Systems within Agile development frameworks.These directions focus on research extensions, technological advancements, and the addressing of ethical concerns, ensuring the continuous evolution and practical applicability of the proposed framework.</p>
<p>Research Extensions</p>
<p>The integration of cognitive agents, Large Language Models, and Multi-Agent Systems within Agile development frameworks offers substantial opportunities for further research.A pivotal area for extending the current study involves exploring the scalability and interoperability of the LLM ecosystem across software projects of different sizes and complexities.This entails assessing the ecosystem's performance through pivotal metrics such as sprint completion times, defect rates, and adherence to project deadlines.By employing simulations and load testing, researchers can evaluate the system's efficiency and effectiveness as project sizes expand [60,61].</p>
<p>Another significant avenue for investigation is the enhancement of models for human-AI collaboration.Developing pioneering interfaces and mechanisms for mutual learning between human developers and AI agents can substantially enhance team dynamics.Refining MAS architectures to align more effectively with Agile practices may enable LLMs to simulate and facilitate human-like interactions within software development teams [62,63].This includes embedding predictive analytics into MAS to provide actionable insights into potential project delays, allowing teams to implement corrective measures proactively.</p>
<p>Moreover, practical validation of the proposed ecosystem remains essential.Deploying the system across real-world software projects will facilitate the evaluation of its impact on productivity, quality, and team dynamics.Integration testing to ensure compatibility with tools such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and issue trackers is crucial for its seamless incorporation into existing development workflows [61].Empirical studies in this context will generate valuable feedback for refining the system and addressing implementation challenges.</p>
<p>Technological Advancements</p>
<p>Emerging technologies present numerous opportunities to further enhance the proposed framework.Continuous advancements in AI and LLMs necessitate ongoing updates and retraining to sustain system effectiveness and adherence to ethical standards [64].Investigating innovative MAS architectures capable of dynamically adapting to complex project requirements may lead to more resilient and flexible systems [63,65].Incorporating sophisticated natural language processing capabilities can enhance the contextual understanding and emotional intelligence of cognitive agents, enabling them to better interpret human inputs and respond effectively across diverse scenarios.</p>

<p>By staying attuned to these technological advancements, the framework can evolve to address the changing demands of software engineering.Such evolution is crucial for maintaining relevance and effectiveness, ensuring that the system remains capable of addressing dynamic challenges in project management and software development.</p>
<p>Security and Privacy Considerations</p>
<p>As AI technologies become integral to project management, addressing ethical considerations is crucial, particularly regarding data privacy, security, and fairness.Protecting sensitive information requires robust encryption methods, stringent access controls, and adherence to data protection regulations such as GDPR.Transparency in AI-driven decision-making processes further fosters trust among team members and stakeholders.Bias mitigation in AI models is another critical challenge, addressed through continuous monitoring of outputs to identify and rectify biases caused by imbalanced training data or flawed algorithms.Employing fairness-aware machine learning techniques and promoting diversity in training datasets are effective strategies to reduce bias.Furthermore, fostering an organizational culture that prioritizes ethical AI usage through training and awareness programs supports the responsible and trustworthy integration of AI technologies [64].</p>
<p>Establishing clear guidelines and providing training for both human team members and AI agents can nurture a collaborative working environment.This includes stressing accountability, encouraging responsible AI usage, and facilitating open discussions about ethical dilemmas that may arise during project development [67].</p>
<p>However, LLMs may still inadvertently introduce biases or misinterpret nuanced project requirements, particularly when dealing with ambiguous instructions or culturally specific contexts.Their knowledge is derived from training data that can reflect historical imbalances or inaccuracies, potentially affecting the prioritization and communication of tasks.Recognizing these limitations is essential to ensure that human oversight and continuous refinement of the model remain central aspects of a reliable and equitable software project management ecosystem [68].</p>
<p>Integrating Cognitive Agents into the Enterprise-Wide Agile Scaling Framework</p>
<p>The Scaled Agile Framework is widely adopted for scaling Agile practices in large organizations, providing a structured approach through its core conceptual layers, which collectively enable organizations to achieve business agility [25].As illustrated in Figure 13, these layers emphasize the progression from organizational strategy down to team-level execution and highlight how cognitive agents and MASs can support each level.By leveraging cognitive agents and Multi-Agent Systems at these higher conceptual layers, organizations can enhance decision-making, streamline operations, and foster continuous alignment of business strategies.For example, cognitive agents can automate data analysis to support strategic planning, ensuring that initiatives remain aligned with shifting market demands and organizational priorities.Additionally, MASs can optimize resource allocation by providing real-time insights, enabling more adaptive budgeting and portfolio management.</p>
<p>Future work involves exploring how the integration of cognitive agents and Large Language Models can further enhance enterprise-level Agile frameworks.By embedding cognitive agents into these layers, organizations can automate coordination tasks, improve communication efficiency, and facilitate decision-making processes.For instance, cognitive agents could assist in strategic alignment through predictive analytics, or in Agile Product Delivery by automating code generation and documentation [36,37].</p>
<p>Moreover, incorporating Multi-Agent Systems powered by LLMs can support crossteam collaboration within scaled Agile initiatives.These agents can simulate humanlike interactions, enabling more effective coordination across teams and enhancing the scalability of Agile practices [8].</p>
<p>Investigating the challenges and opportunities of integrating cognitive agents into enterprise-level Agile frameworks is a promising area for future research.This includes assessing the impact on team dynamics, addressing potential ethical concerns, and developing best practices for implementation.</p>

<p>Summary of Contributions</p>
<p>This study has demonstrated the substantial advancements achieved through the integration of cognitive agents, Multi-Agent Systems, and Large Language Models into Agile development frameworks such as SAFe and SCRUM.Rather than making definitive claims about complex task automation, decision-making improvements, or productivity gains, we now present these as preliminary high-level opportunities indicated by our initial simulations.For example, the framework showed potential in automating routine backlog item refinements and code snippet generation, offered preliminary indications of more autonomous architectural recommendations, and hinted at reduced turnaround times for certain project tasks.However, due to space and scope constraints, rigorous quantification of these gains or direct comparisons against human-led baselines are deferred to future research.</p>
<p>The research introduced a cohesive framework that facilitates improved task management and fosters collaboration among team members.The utilization of cognitive agents has proven effective in supporting continuous adaptation to evolving project needs, aligning seamlessly with the principles of Agile methodologies.Concept diagrams provided in Figure 14 illustrate how the MAS interacts with critical project management components and external systems.These diagrams emphasize the system's ability to theoretically automate task allocation, problem-solving, collaboration, and documentation, while ensuring continuous learning, adaptability, and transparency within the system.Specific empirical validation of these capabilities will be addressed in future studies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the practical applications of MASs and LLMs extend beyond software development and project management into domains such as healthcare, education, and financial modeling.These systems streamline workflows, reduce the cognitive burden on human teams, and improve communication between developers, clients, and stakeholders [63,67].By addressing common Agile challenges, including communication gaps and scaling difficulties, the research provides valuable insights into improving Agile project outcomes.</p>
<p>Implications for Practice</p>
<p>The integration of these technologies presents significant implications for Agile software project management.Organizations that adopt MASs and LLMs can realize strategic benefits, including enhanced decision-making capabilities, improved risk management, and better project insights.Automating routine tasks enables human team members to focus on strategic project aspects, thereby boosting team productivity and fostering innovation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ability of these systems to handle advanced projects with greater precision and reduced operational costs can confer a competitive advantage in the software industry.By ensuring compatibility with existing cloud platforms and software libraries, the proposed architectures enable seamless incorporation into development practices [61].This adaptability is critical in software engineering, where flexibility and responsiveness to change are essential for success.</p>
<p>Final Remarks</p>
<p>In conclusion, the integration of cognitive agents, MASs, and LLMs into Agile development frameworks signifies a pivotal advancement in software engineering.While the potential benefits are considerable, it is essential to address the challenges associated with these technologies, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and transparency in AI-driven decisions [64].Future research should prioritize refining human-AI collaboration models, enhancing agent capabilities, and ensuring that ethical considerations remain central to technological progress.</p>
<p>The ongoing evolution of these systems will undoubtedly shape the future of software engineering, enabling organizations to manage complex projects more effectively and efficiently.By embracing these innovations, the industry can anticipate improved decisionmaking processes, optimized workflows, and dynamic adaptation to project needs, driving progress and achieving success in an increasingly competitive landscape.</p>

Agent categories and roles in CogniSim.The CogniSim framework aligns with the Scaled Agile Framework to enhance Agile practices in large-scale software development environments.The integration is achieved through several mechanisms.Firstly, cognitive agents are mapped to roles defined in SAFe, such as Release Train Engineers, Product Owners, and System Architects [25].This role mapping ensures that agents fulfill responsibilities consistent with SAFe principles.Additionally, Manager Agents coordinate Executor and Quality Checker Agents to form virtual Agile Release Trains, facilitating synchronized development and delivery
