                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> On Functional Plurality: A Taxonomy of Benign and Problematic Functions</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Philosophers interested in conceptual engineering take it for granted that the same concept can unproblematically play diverse functions, but this view overlooks the fact that conceptual and functional change often impair concepts and even functions themselves. I demonstrate that while conceptual and functional engineering may improve concepts and functions, they can also produce detrimental effects. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully assess the potential benefits or problems before making any modifications. Frequently, we overlook the fact that, for instance, adding extra functions to our concepts modifies them; this may increase, but also impair, their theoretical and practical efficacy. I analyze and clarify these possibilities through a general classificatory framework encompassing concepts, functions, and conceptual and functional change. The larger aim of this paper is to bring attention to these complex and under-researched relationships and pave the way for further research in this area.</p>

Philosophers interested in conceptual engineering take it for granted that the same concept can unproblematically play diverse functions, but this view overlooks the fact that conceptual and functional change often impair concepts and even functions themselves.I demonstrate that while conceptual and functional engineering may improve concepts and functions, they can also produce detrimental effects.Therefore, it is crucial to carefully assess the potential benefits or problems before making any modifications.Frequently, we overlook the fact that, for instance, adding extra functions to our concepts modifies them; this may increase, but also impair, their theoretical and practical efficacy.I analyze and clarify these possibilities through a general classificatory framework encompassing concepts, functions, and conceptual and functional change.The larger aim of this paper is to bring attention to these complex and under-researched relationships and pave the way for further research in this area.KeywordsConcepts and functions • Functional plurality • Conceptual plurality • Conceptual engineering • Conceptual change</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We often assume that we use concepts appropriately: that we know their meanings, referents, and uses.However, we usually and problematically employ more than one concept; we use two, three, or more conflicting concepts at the same time.The problems that generate this defective employment range from harmless ambiguity to impaired communication, impaired concepts and their functions.These difficulties may be of little consequence for daily communication but are dangerously confusing in empirical and theoretical investigations.When a fisherman is attempting to catch whales, for example, it is beside the point whether whales fall under the concept MAMMAL or FISH, but it becomes much more relevant when biologists are doing their taxonomic job.</p>
<p>The importance of understanding the way we use concepts is more evident when concepts and functions experience change.Conceptual change, such as transitioning from the fishers' concept WHALE to the taxonomic WHALE*, can produce functional change in concepts and vice versa: concepts' modification causes a modification in their function and vice versa.But are all kinds and combinations of changes appropriate?We do not have a systematic treatment of the relationships between concepts, functions, and change.We often assume that it is unproblematic if we devise new functions for concepts to attain new goals, yet conceptual and functional modification can have beneficial or problematic implications.In this paper, I outline a necessary and general framework for discussing, assessing, and modifying these relationships.Although I do not intend to provide a complete and completely correct framework, it can provide us with a better understanding of concepts and their functions.</p>
<p>The literature on concepts and functions is immense.Psychologists (see, e.g., Carey,  1985, 1991; diSessa, 2006) and philosophers (Kitcher, 1978; Nersessian, 1980, 2008;  Rusanen &amp; Pöyhönen, 2013; Thagard, 1990, 2008) have heavily inquired into the nature of concepts and conceptual change.Recently, the study of functions and functional change has increased among philosophers (Brigandt &amp; Rosario, 2020; Marques  &amp; Wikforss, 2020; Nado, 2019; Prinzing, 2017; Riggs, 2021).Despite this vast body of literature, the multiple and complex relationships between concepts, functions, their modifications, and their consequences remain largely obscure.In this paper, I demonstrate that there are two general kinds of conceptual and functional modifications, "benign" and "problematic," that produce benign and problematic concepts and functions.I also highlight the importance of studying the distinctions and parallels between concepts and functions.</p>
<p>This paper has the following organization.First, I analyze the general characteristics of concepts, functions, and the process of conceptual and functional change in Sect. 2.Then, resorting to popular concepts like GENE, SPECIES, and CLIMATE CHANGE, we will see that the functions that remain the same or improve (often due to conceptual improvement) and functional relationships that result from concepts fulfilling compatible functions are benign.Next, in Sect.3, I show that problematic functions and functional relationships result from preserving or worsening functions and concepts fulfilling incompatible functions.In the last section, I synthesize the findings and bring attention to the complex relationships between concepts, functions, and conceptual and functional change.There is not only a plurality in the conceptual realm but also in the functional one.Both interact in different ways and lead to multiple and complex patterns.Thus, I expect that the present analysis encourages further research on conceptual and functional issues like individuation, continuity, verbal disputes, and conceptual and functional engineering.</p>
<p>Concepts, Functions, and Conceptual and Functional Change</p>
<p>In this section, I offer a rough characterization of concepts, conceptual change, functions, and functional change.We will see that change is better thought of as a gradual process and acknowledge the intricate nature of some aspects of the relationships between concepts and functions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, it is important to recognize that there is not currently a dominant theory that univocally explains the nature of concepts (Margolis &amp; Laurence,  2015).There are no "widely accepted, well-articulated, and empirically tested theories of conceptual change either.Instead, the field consists of multiple perspectives that combine many commonsense and theoretical ideas in kaleidoscopic fashion" (diSessa, 2006, 89).Scientists have examined concepts through the lenses of three distinct fields: science (Nersessian, 1980), education (diSessa, 2006), and cognitive psychology (Carey, 1985, 1991). 1 Building on these perspectives, philosophers have further developed and refined these ideas.The work of Kuhn, for example, has been particularly influential in the theory-theory approach (Gopnik &amp; Meltzoff, 1997).According to this interpretation, students, like scientists, abandon ideas associated with concepts only if there are firm grounds (Carey, 1985, 1991). 2 Rusanen and Pöyhönen (2013) argue for a psychological theory of conceptual change, and Nersessian (1980, 2008) argues that students construct concepts in the same way that scientists do. 3 However, despite this vast and convoluted literature, we do not need a unique and precise understanding of concepts to start examining the general relationships between concepts, functions, and change.We can start with the classical representationalist approach to concepts. 4This view is widely accepted in cognitive science and is highly influential in philosophy to the point that it is regarded as the default position (Carey, 2009; Margolis &amp; Laurence, 2007; Pinker, 2007).As Belleri puts it, "there is a tendency, at least in analytic philosophy, to think that concepts only, or ultimately, have a representational function" (2021, 5).Even philosophers advocating for non-representational accounts of conceptual engineering like Löhr, acknowledge that "most current theories of conceptual engineering clearly focus on language and thought as means to representing the world" (2021, 13039).</p>
<p>Adopting the representationalist approach, we can regard concepts as the mental-representing components (constituting elements) of propositions, thoughts, and 1 Besides, some understand concepts by their role in a theory (the theory-theory approach (Carey, 1985,  2009; Gopnik and Meltzoff, 1997)); others favor the exemplar approach in which something falls under the concept C only if it satisfies sufficient properties encoded in C (Hampton, 2006). 2 Following this line of research, cognitive psychologists have compared naïve theories to scientific ones (see Wellman and Gelman, 1992; Vosniadou, 2002; Gopnik and Wellman, 1994). 3Many other philosophers have analyzed conceptual identification and change (Brigandt, 2010; Cappelen, 2018; Kitcher, 1978; Thagard, 1990, 2008). 4 Perhaps some concepts do not have a representational role.It could be especially true if we take a pragmatist view of truth (see Price et al., 2013).But, given that representation is only one kind of function (we can use another), it cannot work as an objection to the viability of the present analysis.</p>
<p>beliefs, reflecting the way things stand out in the world. 5Even though this representational function is not the only one that concepts serve, it is perhaps the most important, at least for epistemic purposes: classifying, generalizing, knowing, describing, explaining, and so on. 6Now, following most theorists on concepts (especially philosophers), I analyze representation in terms of meaning and reference (or kindred notions like sense or intension and reference or extension). 7The concept CHAIR, for instance, refers to the class of chairs and its meaning consists of the properties we associate with chairs such as being designed for seating, typically having four legs and including a backrest (of course, there are multiple subtle ways to understand meaning and reference, but they are beyond the scope of this paper).Roughly put, we can individuate concepts by their reference and meaning.CHAIR is a different concept of, say, TABLE, because, while the first refers to the class of chairs, the second refers to the class of tables.Additionally, TABLE does not include distinctive properties meant by CHAIR such as including a backrest.</p>
<p>"Conceptual change" is also a difficult notion at the heart of the debate about the possibility of conceptual engineering.Some philosophers like Cappelen think that we cannot easily engage in conceptual engineering because the meaning and reference of our terms largely depend on the external world and we cannot easily change them without changing first the world itself.It is not my intention to enter that debate.Instead, moving forward, I will proceed on the assumption that the conceptual change necessary for conceptual engineering is feasible.</p>
<p>Returning to the issue of conceptual change, I do not attempt to offer a precise definition of either conceptual change or theoretical change.However, if we understand concepts as composed of meaning and reference, as I have done above, we can conceive of conceptual change as a change in meaning, reference, or both of them.8Concepts usually change by including new meanings and referents or excluding existing ones.Consider CHAIR again.CHAIR changes if we include tables as its referents, and, therefore, include furniture that lacks a backrest as a property, or if we exclude furniture for sitting that has four legs.Now, it is important to note that determining the exact point of change in a concept can be challenging.But we can, nevertheless, opt for a rough but helpful definition in terms of degree.Following Thagard (1990, 2008), 9 we can understand conceptual change as a matter of degree.Consider the concept SPECIES-S.The first degree of 5 See Brigandt (2010, 21), Cappelen and Plunkett (2020), Nersessian (1980), and Thagard (1990, 258).Concepts are mental representations even if one regards them as models or constructs (Floridi, 2011,  283). 6Brigandt (2010), for example, identifies the inferential role (meaning, intension, sense), reference (extension), and epistemic goal (the kinds of inferences that a concept is intended to support) as the main elements of concepts.conceptual change is a small change, a slight variation in the "instances" of species SPE-CIES-S refers to on different occasions.A further change takes place when "weak rules" change, like s inhabiting non-typical regions.The modification of "strong rules" results in more change: SPECIES-S changes when an s ceases to eat a specific kind of food.Then, there are modifications in the "part-whole relations."An s can lose some parts of its body, or some specimens may lack or have more parts than the previously studied individuals.The concept changes even more if we modify a "kind relation": introducing a different species r as a kind of s.The biggest changes occur when we recategorize concepts, that is, when concepts jump from one "branch of the categorical tree" to another, such as when we do not classify s as a species but as an inorganic entity.Now, concepts can serve, play, or fulfill (I use these words as synonymous) different roles (and consequently, achieve distinct specific aims or goals) that the literature often refers to as "functions." 10 We must be aware that, although there are several theories of what functions are (see Jorem (2022) for an overview), understanding the functions of concepts as concepts serving a role does not exclude other influential views on functions, such as the etiological perspective, according to which functions are the byproduct that explains the survival of an entity or a trait (Simion  &amp; Kelp, 2019).We can easily think of the etiological functions of concepts as serving a survival role.With that said, we can recognize that scientific concepts (and commonsense ones), for example, play typical "epistemic functions" like explaining, generalizing, solving problems, and making analogical inferences.Additionally, they can play "non-epistemic functions" like species conservation, the reorganization of social structures, and providing entertainment.</p>
<p>Functions might be valuable because, as some have argued (Nado, 2019; Prinzing, 2017), focusing on the uses of concepts can be helpful in answering continuity challenges.11Given that functions admit multiple, distinct, and modified concepts (in meaning and reference) under their range, conceptual change is compatible with functional stability.Unfortunately, as we will see below, direct intervention in changing concepts and functions or concepts fulfilling novel roles changes functions.Additionally, the fulfillment of new functions is a functional change that indirectly modifies the underlying concepts.</p>
<p>Before closing this section, it is worth highlighting that, although determining the precise point at which a function ends and another begins is a difficult question, we can, as with concepts, understand the identity of functions as a matter of degree and as part of a hierarchy.Functions are either general (coarse-grained) or specific (finegrained).Epistemic and non-epistemic functions simpliciter are two instances of the more general kinds of functions.These general functional categories include the more specific functions of describing and explaining (specific epistemic functions) and promoting economic and political goals (specific non-epistemic functions).These consist, in turn, of even more specific epistemic and non-epistemic functions like describing and explaining the feeding habits or species s (more specific and epistemic functions), selling or conserving s (more specific and non-epistemic functions), and so on.Keeping this distinction in mind is important for evaluating relationships between the diverse kinds of functions.</p>
<p>In summary, we have learned in this section that concepts and functions change and maintain complex relationships among them.In the following two sections, I focus on two of them: benign and problematic.Let us start with benign functions and functional relationships.</p>
<p>Benign Functions and Functional Relationships</p>
<p>We have explored some relevant properties of concepts, functions, and conceptual and functional change.However, given that this paper deals mainly with functions, in this and the following section, I offer a non-exhaustive general framework for classifying them.The fundamental classification is between benign and problematic functions and benign and problematic functional relationships.In this section, we will see the benign cases of which there are two broad kinds: when we directly preserve or improve a function or if the functional relationship is one of compatibility-which is an innocuous relationship that could even improve functions.</p>
<p>Function Preservation and Improvement</p>
<p>My main interest is in functions, so I will not discuss the details of conceptual change, but please note that functional change, as mentioned above, is the product of conceptual change (and remember that the second is compatible with the stability of functions).There are two broad kinds of functional change that preserve or produce benign functions: first, functional preservation (of already benign functions) or improvement, and second, the conceptual fulfillment of novel compatible functions.Let us begin with the first kind.</p>
<p>Functions can either improve or remain the same. 12In both cases, except when the original function is problematic (we will tackle these cases in the next section), the resulting functions are benign.Logically, the preservation of benign functions gives us benign functions because no change has taken place to the original benign functions.The Mendelian concept GENE, for example, and its benign function of explaining the dynamics of inheritance remained the same for decades.The function of the Mendelian concept GENE fulfilled at that time was benign and remained benign even after the arrival of molecular genetics.Another kind of benign change occurs when conceptual change improves the original functions. 13Categories like the Mendelian concept GENE and the pre-Darwinian concept SPECIES have improved thanks to advances in molecular genetics and the introduction of the theory of evolution.The pre-Darwinian GENE and SPECIES have evolved alongside scientific knowledge and have led to better functions like explaining, predicting, and providing a comprehensive understanding of genes and species. 14</p>
<p>Compatible Functional Relationships</p>
<p>Another kind of benign functional change occurs when concepts play novel functions that are compatible with the existing ones.The new functional relationship is benign regardless of whether the novel functions are benign or problematic by themselves.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, concepts can fulfill various functions that fall broadly into two generic classes: epistemic and non-epistemic.If we preserve compatibility between the diverse uses of a concept, we end up with benign or beneficial functional relationships.A given concept can play multiple compatible epistemic functions like explaining, predicting, describing, and enabling understanding.They also play compatible non-epistemic functions like promoting ethical, social, political, creative, and economic goals.Ordinarily, a concept that accurately describes a situation (epistemic function) is compatible with explicative and predictive power (other epistemic functions), and the first function improves the second.For example, the Mendelian GENE describes the patterns of inheritance (mutation, recombination, and function) and it improves the capacity of the Mendelian GENE to explain and predict the phenotypic characteristics of organisms.</p>
<p>Consider the biological concept of SPECIES<em>, which individuates species as interbreeding natural populations reproductively isolated and the phylogenetic concept of SPECIES</em><em>, which individuates species as part of a phylogenetic tree.SPECIES</em> fulfills the epistemic function of describing species and we can add to it the non-epistemic one of promoting the conservation of biodiversity.SPECIES<strong> also describes species and we can add to it the non-epistemic function of tackling diseases like malaria (Kitcher, 1984).In both cases, these concepts' roles, epistemic and non-epistemic, do not conflict and the resulting functional relationships are benign, and these benign relationships even improve the epistemic and the non-epistemic functions. 15ne may challenge the compatibility of SPECIES and SPECIES</strong> because, although they are compatible regarding their respective non-epistemic functions, their epistemic roles of describing species clash: each one has a meaning and reference that excludes the distinctive meaning and reference of the other concept.Well, to begin with, we must note that both concepts and their epistemic 14 Most research on conceptual engineering (Cappelen, 2018, 2020; Cappelen and Plunkett, 2020), metalinguistic negotiation (Belleri, 2020; Plunkett, 2015; Thomasson, 2016), amelioration and explication (Brun, 2016; Carus, 2007), and "functional engineering" (Nado, 2019; Prinzing, 2017) has focused on the improvement of these and many other concepts.Cognitive psychologists, educators, and philosophers of science have also put a lot of effort into the examination of the nature, evolution, and improvement of concepts (for an overview, see diSessa ( 2006)). 15As Intemann (2015, 218) claims, "having scientific information that succeeds in protecting the things we care about also requires models that are epistemic reliable.".functions, though incompatible between them, are compatible with the available empirical evidence.These concepts are underdetermined by the empirical evidence and this allows us some freedom for conceptual change and conceptual diversity that would be unacceptable otherwise. 16Second, my discussion in this paper focuses on the problems that incompatibility within concepts produces.The incompatibility between SPECIES<em> and SPECIES</em>* is between two concepts.The incompatibility between these two concepts is not intraconceptual but interconceptual, and it would not necessarily damage their epistemic or non-epistemic functions.Third, SPECIES may be just one general concept playing the two fine-grained epistemic functions of describing species from a biological point of view and describing them from a phylogenetic perspective.These functions are compatible because they are fine-grained functions operating in different contexts-contrary to the coarse-grained function of describing species operating in all contexts-such as in biodiversity conservation and the identification of diseases, respectively.Contextually evaluating functional compatibility allows us to judge the compatibility or incompatibility of functions (we will explore these issues in greater detail in the following sections).</p>
<p>According to the analysis of this section, functional preservation and improvement produce benign functions (moreover, functional improvement is at the heart of what revisionary philosophers and scientists do).Functional relationships may also produce benign functions when functional change preserves compatibility and the latter improves the interacting functions.A way to understand whether functions are compatible or not is by analyzing if they are context-dependent fine-grained functions or coarse-grained ones that perform across contexts.</p>
<p>From the previous analysis, we can derive the following principles:</p>
<p>(i) Functional preservation (of already benign functions) and improvement preserve benign and bring about better functions, respectively.(ii) Compatible functional relations preserve or improve benign functions.(iii) The compatibility of functions is often context-dependent and it may take place in just some contexts or across all of them.</p>
<p>We have discussed the benign cases, but there are also problematic functions and functional relationships.Let us now turn to these cases.</p>
<p>Problematic Functions and Functional Relationships</p>
<p>Concepts behave like tools and their functions can be impaired if the first do not adequately fulfill their roles.We can deteriorate, for example, the current epistemic function (accurate or reliable description) of the concept SPECIES* if we use it to refer to the then presumed fixed nature of organisms (pre-Darwinian epistemic function). 17In this section, I identify some of the problematic kinds of functions and functional relationships.The first difficulty results from the preservation of already harmful functions or their "deterioration" by direct conceptual modification (remember that conceptual change causes functional change).Problematic functional relationships (the second difficulty) arise due to concepts fulfilling novel incompatible functions.</p>
<p>Impaired Functions and Incompatible Functional Relationships</p>
<p>The first problematic case comes from the preservation of already harmful functions or the deterioration of functions.One can think of preserving or returning to the pre-Darwinian SPECIES, in which case the coarse-grained epistemic function of describing and explaining species would remain harmful (given that we now have better concepts) or be impaired (if we give up our current concepts about species and return to this concept).Of course, the fine-grained non-epistemic functions of the pre-Darwinian SPECIES were and continue to be contextually useful in most practical contexts.However, the non-epistemic and epistemic functions of SPECIES<em> and SPECIES</em>* are better suited for these practical contexts and for the theoretical taxonomic contexts.Although the pre-Darwinian concept may be contextually advantageous for trading purposes, it is not sufficiently good in a taxonomic context.</p>
<p>The second problematic case is the existence of problematic functional relationships that result from adding or, equivalently, having concepts fulfill different but incompatible functions.These problematic relationships can go beyond and damage the performance of one, two, or more functions.Why? Because, unless we choose to live with incompatibility, attempting to restore compatibility requires us to eliminate or damage the already existing functions.</p>
<p>Among the variety of functions that a concept may play, we can find the descriptive, explanatory, predictive, justificatory, social, economic, political, technological, creative, and entertaining ones.These fall under the two coarse-grained categories mentioned in previous sections: epistemic and non-epistemic.Conflict may arise at the general or specific level between epistemic, non-epistemic, or both functions.Descriptive functions, for example, can clash with explanatory ones, the economic with the political, and the descriptive with the creative, and the only way to restore compatibility is to eliminate or damage one or the already existing functions. 18onsider a concept like CLIMATE CHANGE whose epistemic function, in a scientific context, is to describe certain phenomena in the most accurate and fruitful 17 The coarse-grained function of referring does not suffer alteration.But, the fine-grained function of referring to the real changing species (as revealed by contemporary biology) is damaged if not completely abandoned. 18Most of the time, we must make tradeoffs between reaching an equilibrium between accurately describing facts and employing them to solve physical and economic problems.The concepts FRIC-TIONLESS PLANE and MARKETS IN PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM offer the best of two worlds.At other times, we may prefer to fulfill one function to its fullest, like accurately describing (as far as possible) planes and markets, in which case we would need fine-grained concepts.</p>
<p>way.This concept points to a causal ontology in which humans play a protagonist role in climate change.Now suppose that, due to the desire to fulfill an economic goal, and then to restore functional compatibility, we change the meaning of this concept to exclude the patent climatic effects of human agency.The general epistemic function of describing a phenomenon and the specific epistemic function of cutting nature at its joints when describing climate change would be compromised.CLIMATE CHANGE now is not so good at fulfilling the role of cutting the nature of climate change and its causes at its joints as its previous version; we have damaged the epistemic function.Something like this has already happened in Canada's death of evidence (Goldenberg, 2015), where commercial interests silenced environmental research. 19</p>
<p>Some Objections and More Cases</p>
<p>At this point, one may object that we should not worry because some concepts can play incompatible functions at the same time, but this is more apparent than real.Let me illustrate it with the concept GENE.GENE seems to play the incompatible epistemic functions of explaining the ontology of genes as units that make a difference to the phenotype (its Mendelian function) and as units that give rise to molecular products without influencing the phenotype (its molecular function).The answer is that incompatibility never arises in the first place: either GENE is really a compound of the Mendelian GENE<em> and the molecular GENE</em>* or it is only one concept performing in different contexts: in a Mendelian context or in a molecular context.</p>
<p>In the first case, the underdetermination of the conceptual by the empirical evidence allows, as discussed above, for diverse conceptualizations (GENE<em> and GENE</em><em>), which, in turn, guarantee diverse epistemic functions. 20GENE</em> and GENE** are incompatible with each other but compatible with the empirical evidence.We do not end up with one incompatible concept but rather with two concepts performing separately.In the second case, GENE is a single concept playing different epistemic functions in different contexts (as discussed in Sect.3, there are functions-whether epistemic or non-epistemic-that are context-dependent). 19Another example of the incompatible use of functions is when concepts are employed to promote beliefs or theories in which the concepts have not originally played a role.Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont  (1999) collected a series of these kinds of concept misuses.Philosophers, psychoanalysts, sociologists, and linguists employed, for example, scientific concepts to convince and impress readers.The assignment of the novel non-epistemic function of impressing the reader impaired the previous epistemic function of describing the world.Perhaps they were unintentionally using them for this purpose, but the fulfillment of the new non-epistemic function changed the meaning and reference of concepts.As a result, the original epistemic function was undermined.To number a few cases, Lacan equated STRU CTU RE with TOPOLOGY and conflated IRRATIONAL with IMAGINARY NUMBER (ch.1).Bruno Latour confused Einstein's pedagogical exposition with the real content of the theory of relativity and then misinterpreted the relativistic concept FRAME OF REFERENCE (ch.5).And Debray used Gödel's theorem to derive the political consequence that "a government of the people by the people is impossible" (ch 11). 20In the context of biological research, Kitcher calls "pluralistic realism" the "idea that our objective interests may be diverse, that we may be objectively correct in pursuing biological inquiries which demand different forms of explanation, so that the patterning of nature generated in different areas of biology may cross-classify the constituents of nature" (1984, 330).</p>
<p>Underdetermination of the conceptual by the empirical evidence also allows, in this case, biologists to employ GENE in different contexts-this concept is epistemically useful for some tasks in one or more contexts but defective across all of them.GENE proves, for example, useful in a Mendelian context for the epistemic functions of describing and predicting the phenotypic characteristics of organisms, inheritance patterns (mutation, recombination, and function), and locating the pieces of DNA that make a difference to the phenotype.In contrast, this same concept, GENE, is useful in a modern molecular context (where genes are understood as linear sequences of DNA nucleotides) for the epistemic functions of describing and explaining how genes bring about their molecular products, which need not overlap with phenotypic (see Brigandt (2010) and Griffiths (2015)). 21onsider SPECIES again.SPECIES further illustrates the fact that concepts cannot play diverse incompatible epistemic functions that, in turn, lead to distinct and incompatible non-epistemic functions.Either SPECIES is a compound of two concepts or it is a concept performing in different contexts.In the first case, SPECIES is really a label for the biological concept SPECIES<em> and for the phylogenetic concept SPECIES</em><em>.SPECIES</em> fulfills the epistemic function of describing species as interbreeding populations whose boundaries are determined by their reproductive isolation (Mayr, 1969, 1970).SPECIES<strong> fulfills the function of describing species based on the evolutionary relationships between organisms (Hennig, 1966). 22These concepts fulfill different epistemic functions and we can see it when these concepts occur in sentences.If we endorse reproductive isolation, SPECIES*, as the correct concept to determine species ontology, then "there are two different tiger species in the San Diego Zoo" is false (see, Ludwig, 2016), but it is true if we endorse the phylogenetic concept SPECIES</strong>.Similarly, SPECIES<em> makes false the statement that "at least forty species of orchids became extinct in Indonesia during the twentieth century," but this statement is true if we employ SPECIES</em><em>.Furthermore, as mentioned above, reproductive isolation concepts (SPECIES</em>) can be helpful in promoting the non-epistemic functions of species preservation (Conix, 2019; Frankham et al.,  2012).SPECIES<em> has played a vital role in the conservation of the endangered Alabama sturgeon because this concept counts this fish as belonging to just one species, but this fish would belong to two different species from the phylogenetic perspective (Ludwig, 2016; Scharpf, 2000).On the other hand, SPECIES</em><em> was crucial to "separate six sibling species within the Anopheles complex of mosquitoes, and thus to understand the distributions of malarian infection in Europe" (Kitcher, 1984, 317). 23gain, this functional plurality does not mean that the same concept can play incompatible functions.The original concept SPECIES is really a compound of two concepts (SPECIES</em> and SPECIES**) or it performs in two different contexts.The first case raises no incompatibility because there are two concepts performing their respective fine-grained epistemic functions (describing species' patterns of reproduction or their patterns of evolution) and, of course, the coarse-grained epistemic function of describing species.The second case does not give rise to any incompatibility either because SPECIES describes species from the point of view of reproductive isolation in a biological context and describes species from an evolutionary perspective in a phylogenetic context.There is no incompatibility either at the coarse-grained epistemic function of describing species because SPECIES fulfills this general function in both contexts.On the other hand, the two epistemic functions are compatible with the fine-grained epistemic functions of describing species in a biological context (describing species' patterns of reproduction) and in a phylogenetic one (describing their patterns of evolution).Now, both fine-grained epistemic functions of SPECIES support fine-grained non-epistemic ones.The biological concept supports biodiversity preservation (remember the case of the Alabama sturgeon), and the phylogenetic one can be helpful in following the spread of malaria disease (remember the case of the Anopheles mosquito).There is no incompatibility because both epistemic and non-epistemic functions are operating in different contexts.A conflict could, of course, arise between epistemic and non-epistemic functions if we use the biological concept for tracking malaria and the phylogenetic for biodiversity preservation.However, incompatibility does not arise because each concept supports its respective practical role.</p>
<p>We must also pay attention to the relationships between fine-grained and coarsegrained functions.The fine-grained epistemic functions of both the biological and the phylogenetic concepts fulfill the coarse-grained epistemic function of describing species and the fine-grained non-epistemic ones of preserving biodiversity and understanding the distribution of malaria, respectively.Why is it important?Because there are also compatibility and incompatibility relationships between finegrained and coarse-grained functions.The fine-grained non-epistemic function of preserving biodiversity is incompatible with the phylogenetic concept SPECIES** (its fine-grained epistemic counterpart) but compatible with the coarse-grained epistemic function of describing species.So, we must be careful to contextually assess these multifarious relationships.Compatibility is contextual.</p>
<p>The above considerations suggest that preserving already impaired functions or directly impairing them and consenting to functional incompatibility are problematic.Functional relationships may produce problematic functions when functional change preserves incompatibility and when the latter worsens one or more of the interacting functions.Therefore, these principles (parallel to those at the end of Sect.3) follow:</p>
<p>(a) Functional preservation (of already problematic functions) and impairment preserve problematic and bring about worse functions, respectively.(b) Incompatible functional relations preserve or worsen problematic functions.(c) The incompatibility of functions is often context-dependent and it may take place in just some contexts or across all of them.</p>
<p>Functional Plurality</p>
<p>Let us take stock.I have argued that there are benign and problematic functions and functional relationships.We must note that concepts and functions influence each other.Conceptual change can preserve, improve, or deteriorate functions and vice versa.Without losing sight of this mutual influence and noting that I focus on the dynamics of functions, we can see that the principles (i) and (a) of Sects. 3 and 4 imply that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Functional preservation (of already benign functions) and improvement preserve benign functions and bring about better ones, respectively, and functional preservation (of already problematic functions) and impairment preserve problematic functions and worsen problematic ones, respectively. 24</li>
</ol>
<p>Compatibility or incompatibility also play a crucial role because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compatible functional relations preserve or improve benign functions (principle (ii) of Sect.3). 3. Incompatible functional relations preserve or worsen problematic functions (principle (b) of Sect.4).</li>
</ol>
<p>From principles 1, 2, and 3, we can conclude that if we want to avoid problematic cases, we must preserve or improve functions and ensure that they are compatible.Conceptual engineers and philosophers interested in the diverse functions fulfilled by concepts have not carefully addressed this issue.However, a deep examination of this plurality is a crucial element for using concepts effectively.We cannot take for granted that a given concept can fulfill diverse roles without anticipating that functional change leads to either benign functions and functional relationships or to their problematic counterparts.We need to assess compatibility first.Furthermore, philosophers and other engineers and users of concepts must seriously consider the ideas that: 4. The compatibility and incompatibility of functions are often context-dependent (by principles (iii) and (c) of Sects. 3 and 4). 5.There may be compatible and incompatible functions in just some contexts or across all of them (by principles (iii) and (c) of Sects. 3 and 4).</p>
<p>Principles 4 and 5 warn us about the necessity of identifying the contextual range of functions to determine compatibility or incompatibility.Some functions are context-relative, but others may span across many or all contexts.25These principles have not received sufficient attention in the literature despite their importance in identifying genuine incompatibilities and, therefore, avoiding problematic uses of concepts.</p>
<p>The existence of epistemic, non-epistemic, fine-grained, and coarse-grained functions, along with principles 4 and 5 remind us that functional plurality is quite complex.In the previous section, we saw that the fine-grained functions (biological and phylogenetic) of SPECIES are fulfilled by two concepts (SPECIES<em> and SPECIES</em><em>) or these functions are fulfilled by the sole concept of SPECIES but in different contexts.The epistemic function of describing species from a biological perspective is compatible with the non-epistemic function of preserving biodiversity, but the epistemic function of describing species from a phylogenetic perspective is not.However, as principle 5 implies, compatibility and incompatibility may occur across all contexts, so we must also assess them across all contexts.Since the coarse-grained epistemic function of describing species has a greater contextual reach, it is compatible-unlike the fine-grained epistemic function of the phylogenetic concept SPECIES</em>-with the non-epistemic function of preserving biodiversity.In other words, the non-epistemic function of biological preservation is incompatible at the fine-grained level but compatible at the coarse-grained level.Specific functions may affect their more general counterparts and vice versa.This discussion suggests that we need to analyze case by case against a general classificatory framework like the one I present and that it would pay off to investigate the not yet fully recognized complex relationships that functions maintain across different contexts.</p>
<p>The present analysis has additional relevant implications.To begin with, we must acknowledge the close similarities between concepts and functions, as well as between conceptual change and functional change.Most of the ongoing research has focused on the individuation of concepts and the modeling of conceptual change, but functions and functional change exhibit similar properties.We can regard both conceptual and functional change as a matter of degree (and, as with concepts, we do not need clear-cut conditions of individuation for functions to analyze their transformation).In the same way that we are careful in assessing the conditions of individuation of concepts, we must pay attention to functional individuation, especially when conceptual and functional change occur.</p>
<p>In the same way that we strive to preserve, improve, and maintain consistency among our concepts, we must care about functions.Moreover, the plurality of functions intertwines with that of concepts, and one can influence each other.We must be careful to preserve good concepts and functions, improve them when needed, and assess their compatibility.</p>
<p>Another fundamental implication of the present analysis is that the plurality of functions demands further research on each aspect of this topic. 26We need to pursue a line of research parallel to conceptual engineering regarding functions: a kind of "functional engineering" research (Nado, 2019).From conceptual engineering to conceptual amelioration and metalinguistic negotiations, we must consider the applicability of these procedures to functions.</p>
<p>Finally, if the thesis that there are close similarities between concepts and functions is correct, then the current discussions concerning individuations, continuity, and verbal disputes apply to functions too.We need more clarity on the identity conditions of functions and their relationship to topic continuity.Finally, in the face of the probable difficulty of functional discontinuity, could we appeal to functions of a higher kind or any other similar notion that does the job?</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>I have argued that functions possess some properties analogous to those of concepts.To effectively understand their nature, I have offered a non-exhaustive general framework that emphasizes the importance of classifying various kinds of functions and their interrelationships.Concepts can play different functions that can be benign or problematic, and we must carefully assess them.We must be especially alert to address problematic cases, particularly when we want a concept to fulfill a non-epistemic function that clashes with the already epistemic function that the concept fulfills (or vice versa).We must also be cautious and make the necessary tradeoffs, revisions, and eliminations.</p>
<p>We need to do much more research on the topic of functions.We must be aware of the existence of the plurality not only of concepts but also of functions and that both concepts and functions can be subject to parallel treatment, allowing us to ameliorate or impair them through functional engineering.
 It has been customarily to address conceptual change only in terms of meaning and reference stability, but reference can change too, as in the case of GENE(Brigandt, 2010).
And others(Chi, 2008;Richard, 2019).
The number of studies of functions, functional change, and the aims of concepts is small, but there is currently an increasing interest in this topic. A growing body of research, especially from philosophers, focuses on the use of concepts to achieve specific aims(Brigandt, 2010(Brigandt, , 2011;;Brigandt and Rosario, 2020;Ludwig, 2016) and functions (instead of concepts) to account for identification and change(Nado, 2019;Prinzing, 2017;Simion and Kelp, 2019;Sundell, 2017;Thomasson, 2020).
 See Cappelen (2020)  for criticism.
When "it is preserved" (see, for example, Lindauer, 2020).
As Brigandt claims regarding epistemic functions: "[…] given a term's stable epistemic goal, a change in the term' inferential role (e.g., its definition) is warranted if due to the new inferential role the epistemic goal is met to a larger extent than hitherto"(2010, 24).
Furthermore, from a philosophical point of view, the epistemic function of describing species is fulfilled by numerous general concepts consistent with the available empirical evidence. We fulfill the epistemic function of describing species if we take species to be homeostatic property clusters(Boyd, 1999), stable property mechanisms(Slater, 2015), or nodes in causal networks(Khalidi, 2018).
See alsoAttenborough (2015).21  The meaning and reference of the molecular concept GENE differ from the Mendelian concept because only the first recognizes that mutations and recombination can happen to parts of DNA. Consequently, the Mendelian alleles that explain the phenotypic characters do not perfectly correspond to molecular genes.22  Other proposals for the individuation of species focus on a speciation event(Wiley, 1981) and evolutionary novelty(Nelson Platnick, 1981).
 See Brigandt (2020)  andBrigandt and Rosario (2020) for the contrary perspective.24  Better functions are benign but not the other way around.
