                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Neuroimaging modalities in the detection of Alzheimer's disease-associated biomarkers</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. Neuropathological changes in AD patients occur up to 10–20 years before the emergence of clinical symptoms. Specific diagnosis and appropriate intervention strategies are crucial during the phase of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The detection of biomarkers has emerged as a promising tool for tracking the efficacy of potential therapies, making an early disease diagnosis, and prejudging treatment prognosis. Specifically, multiple neuroimaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, optical imaging, and single photon emission-computed tomography, have provided a few potential biomarkers for clinical application. The MRI modalities described in this review include structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and arterial spin labelling. These techniques allow the detection of presymptomatic diagnostic biomarkers in the brains of cognitively normal elderly people and might also be used to monitor AD disease progression after the onset of clinical symptoms. This review highlights potential biomarkers, merits, and demerits of different neuroimaging modalities and their clinical value in MCI and AD patients. Further studies are necessary to explore more biomarkers and overcome the limitations of multiple neuroimaging modalities for inclusion in diagnostic criteria for AD.</p>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia.Neuropathological changes in AD patients occur up to 10-20 years before the emergence of clinical symptoms.Specific diagnosis and appropriate intervention str ate gies are crucial during the phase of mild cogniti v e impairment (MCI) and AD.The detection of biomarkers has emerged as a promising tool for tr ac king the efficacy of potential therapies, making an early disease diagnosis, and prejudging treatment prognosis.Specifically, multiple neuroimaging modalities, including ma gnetic r esonance ima ging (MRI), positr on emission tomography, optical ima ging, and single photon emissioncomputed tomograph y, ha v e pr ovided a few potential biomarkers for clinical application.The MRI modalities described in this re vie w include structural MRI, functional MRI, diffusion tensor ima ging, ma gnetic r esonance spectr oscopy, and arterial spin la belling.These techniques allow the detection of presymptomatic diagnostic biomarkers in the brains of cogniti v el y normal elderl y people and might also be used to monitor AD disease pr ogr ession after the onset of clinical symptoms.This re vie w highlights potential biomarkers, merits, and demerits of differ ent neur oima ging modalities and their clinical value in MCI and AD patients.Further studies are necessary to explore more biomarkers and overcome the limitations of multiple neuroimaging modalities for inclusion in diagnostic criteria for AD.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, has no known pharmaceutical cure and is a common pr ogr essiv e br ain disease.AD is defined as a cognitive disorder and characterized by systematic dementia symptoms, such as memory, learning, language, executive function, visuospatial function, and behaviour al c hanges or impairment (K orczyn, 2011 ).T he World Health Organization estimates that over 30 million people worldwide suffer from AD, and the rate of AD incidence is accelerating with the increasing ageing of the world's population at present (Giridharan et al., 2022 ).In addition, the global AD epidemic is estimated to affect more than 100 million individuals by 2050 (van Oostveen and de Lange, 2021 ).AD will become a major challenge to public health and ultimatel y hav e an increased social burden (Liu et al., 2022 ).</p>
<p>Neur opathological c hanges occur up to 10-20 years before the emergence of clinical symptoms of AD (Blennow et al., 2006 ).The pr odr omal phase of AD is defined as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is characterized by declines in performance in one or more cognitive domains with the preservation of functional independence (Petersen, 2004 ).The initial pathological change in AD and MCI patients is neurotoxic amyloid-β (A β) deposition.In the br ain, abnormal pr ocessing of A β by β-secr etase and subsequentl y γ -secr etase contributes to the formation of senile plaques, which in turn results in the destruction of neurons .T his pathological process is exacerbated by the activity of r eactiv e oxygen species.Ev entuall y, A β-induced neur otoxicity leads to im-paired learning, a progressive degradation of mental state, and behavioural abnormalities (Alam and Sharma, 2019 ;Ausó et al., 2020 ).Like wise, hyper phosphorylation r esults in neur ofibrillary tangles (NFTs) containing abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau aggr egates, leading to neur onal loss, neur otoxicity, br ain atr ophy, and cognitive decline (Ausó et al., 2020 ).Patients with AD curr entl y go to the hospital for e v aluation late in the course of the disease and miss the stage of earl y interv ention/delay of disease de v elopment.Mor eov er, ther e ar e curr entl y no effectiv e clinical drugs for the treatment of AD, and early diagnosis and intervention can help to delay the de v elopment of AD and pr olong the healthy years of patients.Neur oima ging modalities can detect various aspects of br ain c hanges .T her efor e, it is necessary to searc h for neur oima ging biomarkers to ac hie v e the goal of early detection and intervention of diseases (Blennow et al., 2015 ).Specific and sensitive testing str ategies ar e crucial for the detection and accurate diagnosis of AD in the preclinical or early phase (Henry et al., 2013 ).</p>
<p>No w ada ys , biomark ers could objecti v el y r eflect the specific structural and molecular level changes in the body and have become a hot topic in clinical trials and scientific r esearc h in AD.In 2018, the NIA-AA proposed the AT(N) classification system, which categorized different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids).Biomarkers ar e gr ouped into the categories of β am yloid de position (A), pathologic tau (T), and neur odegener ation (N) [AT(N)] for the definition of AD, but biomarkers for MCI are not mentioned (Table 1 ).The NIA-AA recommends the consideration of biomarkers about amyloid positron emission tomogr a phy (PET) positivity, T able 1: A T(N): biomarker grouping.</p>
<p>A stands for a ggr egated A β or associated pathologic state biomarkers T stands for a ggr egated tau or associated pathologic state biomarkers N stands for neur odegener ation or neuronal injury biomarkers amyloid PET positivity tau-PET positivity br ain atr ophy sho wn b y structural MRI CSF A β42 or A β42/A β40 ratio decrease CSF phosphorylated tau increase reduced metabolism on FDG-PET increased total tau in the CSF A β: β amyloid; CSF: cer ebr ospinal fluid Tau-PET positivity, reduced metabolism on fluoro-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, brain abnormalities on quantitative structural magnetic r esonance ima ging (MRI) for AD dia gnosis (Jac k et al., 2018 ).</p>
<p>It is emphasized that the AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become a vailable .T he NIA-AA indicated that the AT(N) classification system is a r esearc h fr ame work that still needs to be thor oughl y examined and modified before being adopted in general clinical practice.</p>
<p>Although the NIA-AA recommends the consideration of some biomarkers for the definition of AD, there are some limitations in AD diagnosis.PET has the limitation of high cost.Furthermore, it cannot be ignored that high-dose PET radiation is harmful for people's health.Cer ebr ospinal fluid assays ar e inv asiv e, carry the risk of infection and side effects, and are not routine examinations in the clinic (Sperling et al., 2011 ).Ther efor e, ther e is still a need to dev elop nov el ima ging tec hniques for detecting r ele v ant biomarkers in the future .T he detection of biomarkers should be non-inv asiv e, low-cost, and routine in the clinic.More sensitive measures are necessary to detect early dysfunction and structural and functional disconnection (Kim et al., 2022a ).Other techniques, including functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), arterial spin labelling (ASL), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), single photon emission-computed tomogr a phy (SPECT), and nearinfr ar ed fluor escence (NIRF) pr obes r epr esent the potential possibility of identifying AD and discriminating AD from other dementia diseases, such as vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).T hus , a compr ehensiv e anal ysis of the av ailable neur oima ging modalities is necessary for identifying MCI and AD and differentiating AD from other diseases.In this review, a systematic literature search for articles was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE.We searched articles published in English from January 2000 through the end of April 2023.We used the following search terms as text for the search in the electronic databases: 'Alzheimer', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'MCI', 'AD', 'biomarker', 'MRI', 'ma gnetic r esonance ima ging', 'PET', 'positr on emission tomogr a phy,' 'SPECT', 'single photon emission-computed tomogr a phy', 'NIRF pr obes', 'near-infr ar ed fluor escence pr obes', 'structur al MRI', 'sMRI', 'fMRI', 'MRS', 'ASL', 'DTI', 'functional MRI', 'functional ma gnetic r esonance ima ging', 'ma gnetic r esonance spectr oscopy', 'arterial spin labelling', 'diffusion tensor imaging', and 'neur oima ging'.</p>
<p>Her ein, we r e vie w m ultiple neur oima ging modalities (structural MRI, fMRI, MRS, ASL, DTI, PET, SPECT, and NIRF probes) combined with potential biomarkers in MCI and AD, present their merits and demerits, discuss their clinical value, and show limitations in current clinical trials .T he influencing factors cannot be ignored in the design of clinical trials, such as age, sex, and years of education.Some limitations should also be considered in the design of clinical trials in the futur e, suc h as lack of large-scale and longitudinal studies.Whereas only traditional structural modalities are curr entl y r ecommended for the dia gnosis of AD in clinical pr actice, further r esearc h is necessary to overcome the limitations of these modalities to meet their future inclusion in diagnostic criteria for AD.</p>
<p>MRI</p>
<p>Due to its r elativ el y economical and convenient properties, MRI plays a vital role in the clinical diagnosis of AD as a noninvasive clinical test (Chandra et al., 2019 ).MRI techniques, such as structural MRI, fMRI, MRS, DTI, and ASL, r emain effectiv e in the detection of AD (Li et al., 2022a ;McKhann et al., 2011 ;Rankin et al., 2006 ).Eac h MRI tec hnique has its pr os and cons in the detection of AD.Doctors and r esearc hers should be familiar with the c har acteristics of different MR techniques when considering their clinical applications.Next , we discuss various biomarkers in multiple MRI modalities (structural MRI, fMRI, MRS, ASL, and DTI), and the differ ent br ain/connection r egions affected acr oss modalities for MCI and AD (Table 2 ).</p>
<p>Structural MRI</p>
<p>Structural MRI is used to reveal brain atrophy and other static tissue abnormalities .T he pr ogr ession of br ain atr ophy follows Br aak sta ges (Br aak and Br aak, 1991 ).NIA-AA dia gnostic r ecommendations refer to atrophy of critical brain regions (i.e. the parahippocampal gyrus , hippocampus , posterior association cortex, amygdala, and subcortical nuclei) using quantitative structural MRI in AD (Sperling et al., 2011 ).</p>
<p>Some studies have reported that atrophy was found in both the cer ebr al cortex and subcortical r egions in MCI patients using quantitativ e structur al MRI.In cer ebr al cortex atr ophy, a metaanal ysis r eported significant gr ey matter (GM) loss in the entorhinal cortex in the MCI group in comparison to the cognitively normal (CN) group (Lombardi et al., 2020 ).Entorhinal cortex atrophy is considered a good biomarker and might be used to differentiate MCI individuals from CN participants (Zhou et al., 2016 ).Mor eov er, entorhinal cortex atrophy, the location of the earliest lesions in AD, prediction of the conversion from MCI to AD in patients (Leandrou et al., 2018 ).In subcortical atrophy, GM volumetric loss occurs in the hippocampus in MCI patients in comparison to a CN group (Vasavada et al., 2015 ).Hippocampal atrophy in MCI patients is associated with declar ativ e memory deficits (Sc hröder and P antel, 2016 ).Hippocampal atrophy can be detected in CN elderly individuals up to 3 years before MCI diagnosis and may be a promising biomarker for presymptomatic disease.In addition, hippocampal atrophy can predict whether MCI patients would progress to AD during a 3-year follow-up (Miao et al., 2022 ).</p>
<p>A large number of studies have reported atrophy in the cerebral cortex, subcortical regions, and cerebellum in AD.In cerebral cortex atrophy, a meta-analysis reported significant GM loss in the entorhinal cortex in AD (Li et al., 2022b ).The entorhinal cortex is the br ain r eg ion that exhibits the earliest histolog ical alterations in AD, including the formation of NFTs and cell death (Igarashi, 2023 ).GM loss in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes is found in AD patients in comparison to CN individuals (Duarte et al., 2006 ).Considerable attention has been focused on understanding  (Hu et al., 2023 ).</p>
<p>In subcortical atrophy, volumetric loss occurs in the hippocampus, amygdala, and olfactory bulb in AD patients using quantitativ e structur al MRI (Cav edo et al., 2011 ;Li et al., 2011 ;Yu et al., 2015 ).Br ain atr ophy is observed in the hippocampus in the early course of AD (Li et al., 2011 ;Platero et al., 2019 ).The presence of diffuse hippocampal atrophy is associated with deficits in memory and executive functioning in AD patients (Oosterman et al., 2012 ).It also differentiates AD from Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) and DLB (Delli Pizzi et al., 2016 ;Tam et al., 2005 ).In addition, a meta-anal ysis r eported a significant volumetric r eduction in the amygdala in the AD group in comparison to the CN group (Zacková et al., 2021 ).Atrophy of the amygdala is associated with neur opsyc hiatric symptomatology and cognitive dysfunction in AD (P oulin et al., 2011 ).Furthermore , a volumetric reduction in the olfactory bulb is present in AD patients (Chen et al., 2018 ;P etekkay a et al., 2020 ;Yu et al., 2015 ).Of note, olfactory bulb is damaged in v ery earl y (i.e.Br aak's sta ge 0 or 1) sta ges (K o vács et al., 2001 ).</p>
<p>Studies of cerebellar atrophy have also been reported in AD patients .T he cerebellum is affected in the late clinical stage of AD (Tabatabaei-Jafari et al., 2017 ).Cerebellar atrophy may be secondary to the pr ogr ession of AD pathology in the cerebrum rather than the cerebellum itself (Colloby et al., 2014 ).</p>
<p>In summary, quantitative structural MRI is a popular neur oima ging tec hnique with good soft tissue contr ast and high spatial r esolution, whic h ar e important featur es for AD detection.Structural MRI also provides excellent anatomical detail of magnetic resonance images, which can provide reliable classification results with high diagnostic accuracy that correlate with the underlying pathology (Frisoni et al., 2010 ).Structural MRI studies hav e gener all y shown r obust volumetric declines in both the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in MCI and AD patients and atrophy of other br ain r egions in AD patients.According to Braak stage theory, the earliest neur odegener ation al ways occurs in the entorhinal cortex and spreads from there to the hippocampus.NFTs start to a ggr egate in the hippocampus .T he disease spr eads fr om the hippocampus to the entire temporal lobe, eventually reaching the cortex and other regions of the brain (Braak and Braak, 1991 ).Mor eov er, quantitativ e structur al MRI combined with biomarkers is a promising method for the discrimination of MCI and AD from the CN group and in the prediction of MCI conversion to AD in clinical trials.In particular, structural MRI is important in identifying gross structural lesions, differentiating AD from PDD and DLB with hippocampal atrophy.T hus , structural MRI studies should focus on differentiating AD from other forms of dementia, such as VaD and FTD, in the future.In fact, structural MRI cannot assess functional changes in the brain, so the combination with other measurements might enhance the accuracy of AD detection.Despite the widespread use of quantification software in research, the adoption of many quantification software packages in clinical practice is rare .T his is probably due to limited availability and the time needed for use of those pac ka ges as well as the questionable external validity of research results (Brisson et al., 2020 ).Future efforts aimed at more fully translating research results into clinical practice will improve the diagnostic ability of quantitative structural MRI, allowing for more reliable identification of patients in earl y sta ges of AD. fMRI fMRI detects changes in the haemodynamics of brain vessels to indir ectl y measur e neur al activ ation.The haemodynamic r esponse is thought to reflect brain region activation based on the number of oxyhaemoglobins and deoxyhaemoglobins pr esent (Gor e, 2003 ).fMRI is used to image the activation of br ain ar eas, and alter ed br ain activ ation has been found in some regions in patients with AD. fMRI includes task-based fMRI (t-fMRI) and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI).</p>
<p>t-fMRI is an advanced technique for evaluating brain mapping given a specific assigned task (motor, visual, neuropsychological, etc.) and functional activity alterations (Forouzannezhad et al., 2019 ).These task-based studies in MCI and AD patients investigate functional alterations during a particular activity, such as tasks of memory (Yetkin et al., 2006 ), vision (Rombouts et al., 2000 ), and motor performance.</p>
<p>The most pr e v alent and w ell-kno wn symptoms of AD and amnestic MCI ar e cognitiv e deficits, specificall y memory pr oblems .Moreo ver, an amnesic syndrome is typically the earliest symptom of AD (Dickerson and Sperling, 2008 ).The medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology in AD, and significant pathology is present in the MTL memory system at the MCI sta ge (Dic kerson and Sperling, 2008 ).Both hyperactivation and hypoactivation of the MTL during memory tasks hav e been r eported in MCI patients (Hampstead et al., 2011 ;Jin et al., 2012 ;Lenzi et al., 2011 ).The discrepancy of MCI patients in MTL may be caused by different activation patterns in MTL structures and hippocampal subregions in comparison to CN individuals (Yassa et al., 2010 ).This difference may also be due to the mixed sample of MCI and AD patients included in the studies (Celone et al., 2006 ).These findings indicate that future studies may focus on sample inclusion, avoiding mixed samples of MCI and AD patients .Furthermore , some studies have shown reduced posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus activation and hyperactivation in fr ontal r egions, including the pr ecentr al gyrus, in MCI patients in comparison to CN individuals during memory tasks (Hampstead et al., 2011 ;Jin et al., 2012 ;Terry et al., 2015 ).In AD, MTL hypoactivation, reduced posterior cingulate gyrus/praecuneus deactivation and frontal hyperactivation are approximately consistent findings during memory tasks (Canário et al., 2022 ;Jonin et al., 2022 ;P arr a et al. , 2013 ;Petrella et al. , 2007 ;Pihlajamäki and Sperling, 2009 ;Yetkin et al., 2006 ).</p>
<p>In addition, there is increasing evidence for motor dysfunction early in AD, even preceding cognitive deterioration (Agosta et al., 2010 ;Albers et al., 2015 ;Della Sala et al., 2004 ;Kueper et al., 2017 ;P arr a et al., 2013 ).Despite the pr e v alence of motor symptoms in MCI and AD patients, their underl ying neur al mec hanisms ar e not very explicit (Koppelmans et al., 2022 ).The motor performance of MCI patients has mainly been explored by other tec hniques, suc h as functional near-infr ar ed spectr oscopy (Holtzer and Izzetoglu, 2020 ;Liu et al., 2021c ).Decreases in activation are displayed in the cer ebellum, pr emotor, and supplementary motor regions for patients with earl y-sta ge AD during a motor task by t-fMRI (Koppelmans et al., 2022 ;Vidoni et al., 2012 ).As suc h, futur e studies could further focus on motor dysfunction in MCI using t-fMRI and explore potential biomarkers for being early predictors of MCI and AD that augment the diagnostic process.</p>
<p>Mor eov er, ther e hav e been a few neuroimaging studies that hav e explor ed the neur al basis of visuospatial deficits in AD.Based on studies thus far, no significant hyper activ ation or hypoactivation has been found in visuospatial processing tasks in MCI patients by using t-fMRI (Faraco et al., 2013 ;Jacobs et al., 2015 ;P a pma et al., 2012 ).Reduced activation detected by t-fMRI occurs mainly in the parieto-occipital, parietal, left inferior temporal gyrus, and pr emotor cortical ar eas in AD patients when compar ed to the CN group during visuospatial tasks (Bokde et al., 2010 ;Thiyagesh et al., 2009 ).These specific functional deficits in AD provide important evidence for an underlying pathophysiological basis for the symptom of visuospatial disorientation.</p>
<p>In addition to activation, t-fMRI can be used to explore the functional connectivity between different brain regions to represent/r eflect the le v el of functional comm unication between br ain regions in MCI and AD (van den Heuvel and Hulshoff Pol, 2010 ).Enhanced functional connectivity is found in the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and fusiform areas in MCI patients during the encoding task of nov el pictur e-w or d pairs (Hämäläinen et al., 2007 ).In addition, auditory stimulation was applied to control and patients with AD to investigate functional neuroanatomy alterations in an auditory scenario.Increased functional connectivity in the right supr amar ginal gyrus is also found in AD patients in comparison to CN individuals using the auditory task by t-fMRI (Golden et al., 2015 ).</p>
<p>Functional connectivity is studied not only by t-fMRI but also by rs-fMRI in MCI and AD patients.rs-fMRI examines spontaneous and sync hr onous blood oxygenation le v el-dependent lowfrequency fluctuations in the absence of the participant performing an explicit task during scanning.In addition, rs-fMRI provides insight into functional connectivity among structures in intrinsic networks implicated in the MCI and AD spectrum (Lv et al., 2018 ).Disrupted functional connectivity is mainly observed in the default mode network (DMN) and visual network (VN), whic h ar e involv ed in cognitiv e executiv e pr ocesses and visual memory (Forouzannezhad et al., 2019 ).A group of 'attentional networks' are also disrupted in MCI and AD patients by using rs-fMRI, including the frontoparietal (FPN), the dorsal attention (DAN), and the v entr al attention (VAN) networks .T he early clinical manifestation of AD is usually memory impairment.Howe v er, attention, as the initial stage of cognition, is often not easily perceived.</p>
<p>The DMN is the main network under investigation in rs-fMRI in MCI and AD.Decreased functional connectivity in the DMN has been reported in many studies .T his pattern of DMN dysfunction has been displayed in the MCI group with limited increases compared with the CN group between DMN structures, indicative of a pr odr omal compensatory mec hanism (DeMayo et al., 2023a ;Niu et al., 2018 ;Zhang et al., 2020 ;Zheng et al., 2017 ).Brain structures implicated in the DMN mostly include the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), pr ecuneus cortex, medial pr efr ontal and later al tempor al cortices and hippocampus (Forouzannezhad et al., 2019 ).Reduced functional connectivity in AD is shown between MTL structures, such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and the PCC by rs-fMRI (Greicius et al., 2004 ;Mohammadian et al., 2023 ;Yu et al., 2017 ;Zheng et al., 2017 ).This evidence indicates the significance of the MTL in the DMN as an indicator of AD.Le v els of PCC connectivity in the DMN to other DMN structures are associated with neur opsyc hological impairment (Celebi et al., 2016 ).Furthermore, there was an increase in anterior DMN regions (frontal lobe) and a decrease in posterior DMN regions (precuneus cortex) in early AD.Two to four years later, all br ain r egions sho w ed marked declines in connectivity.This evidence might support the notion that early mechanistic compensation occurs within the DMN, but eventually global neur odegener ation occurs (Damoiseaux et al., 2012 ).</p>
<p>In addition to the DMN, the VN of the brain is affected by AD pr ogr ession.Decr easing functional connectivity is shown between the left and right gyri and inferior temporal gyrus, which are in-volved in visual cognition in MCI.Functional connectivity reduction in these areas might lead to visual processing deficits, such as failur e to r ecognize faces (Cai et al., 2015 ).The results may explain why AD or MCI patients are unable to recognize familiar faces.Furthermore, the inhibited activity of the right inferior temporal cortex in patients with AD r epr esents the br eakdown of the VN caused by the long-term visual memory decline of AD patients (Jin et al., 2020 ;Zhong et al., 2014 ).</p>
<p>Mor eov er, this pattern of DAN dysfunction has been displayed in the MCI group compared with the CN group between DMN structures .Recent studies ha ve indicated that functional alterations in the DAN could be used as a sensitive marker to forecast the pr ogr ession fr om MCI to AD (Pini et al. , 2022 ;Wu et al. , 2022 ;Wu et al., 2023 ).AD-related decrease of DAN functional connectivity was mainly reported when mean mini-mental state exam score w as lo w er than 14 (Brier et al. , 2012 ;Zhao et al. , 2022 ).The DAN appears to be involved in the endogenous goal-driven attention orienting (top-down) pr ocess, whic h is responsible for the preparation and selection for stimuli and responses (Qi et al., 2020 ).Interv entional a ppr oac hes of tr anscr anial ma gnetic stim ulation and exercise ar e r eported about modulating functional connectivity in DAN (Kazemi et al., 2020 ).Furthermor e, earl y interv ention tr eatments in DAN may be potential directions for MCI and AD patients.</p>
<p>FPN was also significantly reduced in MCI and AD in comparison to CN individuals using rs-fMRI (Cruzat et al., 2023 ;Li et al., 2015 ;Pini et al., 2022 ).The FPN is involved in top-down attentional control and allocation of available neural resources to critical cognitive processes and motor planning and motor execution.Reduced connectivity in FPN may lead to the dysfunction of logic , regulating beha viour, learning, and complex planning abilities (Zhao et al., 2019 ).</p>
<p>Recent studies have reported that effects on the VAN are inconsistent in AD patients by using rs-fMRI.Decreased VAN functional connectivity was observed in AD patients compared with the CN individuals (Qian et al., 2015 ).The limited effects on VAN connectivity were also reported in the present investigation of AD, which might suggest that the VAN was stable and less susceptible to the impact of the AD (Kurth et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2012 ;Zhang et al., 2015 ).The VAN is involved in an exogenous stimuli-driven attention reorienting (bottom-up) process which is activated when detecting the salient targets (Yeo et al., 2011 ).There is a need for further r esearc h to inv estigate VAN in AD in the futur e.</p>
<p>Ov er all, the fMRI modality is used to measure brain activity and functional connectivity.Growing evidence suggests that brain activity and functional connectivity are consistent with cognitive function and neural processes.Brain functional changes might accompany or even precede detectable structural alterations (Qiu, 2022 ;Reas et al., 2020 ).t-fMRI can be used to examine alterations in functional connectivity and brain activation during tasks such as memory, vision, and motor performance in MCI and AD patients.In addition, t-fMRI is a promising technique to distinguish patients with AD and those with behavioural variant FTD with motor and cognitive tasks (Rucco et al., 2017 ).T hus , future fMRI studies in AD are needed to investigate the possibility of differentiating AD from other forms of dementia, such as PDD, DLB , V aD, and FTD, in the future.rs-fMRI can provide useful information about the functional connectivity of brain networks in MCI and AD patients, such as the DMN , VN , FPN , DAN , and VAN .Ho w e v er, other networks of the br ain, suc h as the control network, salience network, and sensorimotor networks, might be explored in AD in the futur e. fMRI data ar e indeed intensiv e to collect, clean, prepr ocess, and anal yse (Kim et al., 2022a ).Data collection and anal-ysis tec hniques ar e another critical ar ea for further de v elopment.Mor eov er, tec hnical factors are important in assessing fMRI; small amounts of head movement that are not easily detected and multiple different methods of data analysis may confound the results.Subsequent studies can compar e differ ent tec hniques to obtain stable and sensitive parameters and combinations of parameters and sites for detecting micr ostructur al c hanges.With adv ances in fMRI techniques , fMRI ma y ha ve potential in practical clinical use in the future.</p>
<p>MRS</p>
<p>MRS is an advanced method for the measurement of neurochemicals in either a single voxel or multiple voxels (Lee et al., 2017 ).MRS assesses the le v el of br ain metabolites, and its par ameters ar e expr essed as concentr ations or r atios, suc h as glutamate + glutamine (Glx), N-acetylaspartate (NAA), glutamate and N AA/creatine (Cr), glutamate/my o-inositol (mI), and N AA/mI ratios.</p>
<p>MRS can measur e c hemical concentr ations in the br ain (Kantarci et al., 2000 ).Since 1992, a decrease in NAA neuronal metabolites has been demonstrated using MRS performed on autopsy brain samples of AD patients with respect to le v els detected in the CN group.The observed decrease in NAA is linked to the number of senile plaques and NFTs in the brain (Klunk et al., 1992 ).The reduction in NAA or NAA/Cr has been considered a marker of neuroaxonal density and viability (Kantarci et al., 2000 ).</p>
<p>In MCI, NAA/Cr ratios are lo w ered in the left hippocampus and PCC (Oeltzschner et al., 2019 ;Zhu et al., 2015 ).When examining r egion-specific c hanges in AD, lo w er N AA and N AA/Cr are found in the PCC (Fayed et al., 2014 ), and lo w er mI/Cr is found in the anterior cingulate gyrus and posterior cingulate gyrus (Guo et al., 2016 ).A meta-anal ysis r eported that NAA decr eased in the posterior cingulate and hippocampus in AD patients, while mI and mI/Cr wer e incr eased in the posterior cingulate.Mor eov er, a sustained decrease was observed in the NAA/mI of the posterior cingulate in AD patients (Liu et al., 2021a ).Furthermore, the NAA/mI ratios in the PCC gradually decline during the transition from MCI to AD and are also deemed a valid discriminator of AD patients (Mitolo et al., 2019 ).Clinicall y, decr eased NAA is a predicti ve mark er of phenoconversion to both dementia and cogniti ve d ysfunction.In ad dition, the increased mI may affect the phosphorylation of membrane proteins or cause changes in phospholipid metabolism, affecting the formation of A β (Falini et al., 2005 ;Kantar ci, 2013 ).N AA/mI and N AA/Cr r atios distinguish AD fr om VaD, and glutamate/Cr ratios differentiate DLB from AD (Su et al., 2016 ;Weiss et al., 2003 ).</p>
<p>Glx, a product of the amination of glutamate, is tr ansferr ed to neur ons fr om glial cells after the exocytotic release of glutamate into the synaptic space .T he glutamate concentration and the glutamate/mI r atio ar e lo w er in patients with MCI than in the CN in the PCC (Zeydan et al., 2017 ).As free amino acids, both are involv ed in metabolism, neur onal function, plasticity, and excitotoxicity (Antuono et al., 2001 ).Recently, Glx has been considered a promising marker for AD.Glx concentrations are reduced in the hippocampus and cingulate region (Shiino et al., 2012 ).In addition, the Glx/Cr ratio is reduced in AD patients in the anterior cingulate cortex and right hippocampus (Huang et al., 2017 ).A β induces se v er al c hanges in nerv e cells, including syna ptic activity and loss of neuronal viability, leading to a reduction in glutamate le v els.Mor eov er, the decr ease in glutamate content affects A-amino-3h ydroxy-5-meth yl-4-isoxazolepr opionic acid r eceptors (AMPARs), which play a k e y role in cognition and synaptic function.Moreover, this decrease in AMPARs may be the reason for the decrease in cognitive function and the loss of synapses in AD.Glu and Glx/Cr may be seen as signs of cognitive deterioration in AD patients (Liu et al., 2010 ).</p>
<p>In summary, MRS can be used to explore potential associations between the le v el of metabolites and pathological changes in MCI and AD patients.In addition, MRS is important in differentiating AD from VaD and DLB.The adv anta ges of MRS ar e the substantially lo w er cost and the fact that it can be added to structural MRI sequences to extract additional information.MRS acquisition differs from a single-voxel technique, in which signals from a previously selected voxel are acquired, and multi vo xel spectr oscopy, in whic h man y voxels ar e sim ultaneousl y obtained.Single-v oxel spectroscop y has the adv anta ge that the quantification of metabolites is accurate and scan times are short, but only one brain region can be examined at a time.Multi vo xel spectroscop y allo ws sim ultaneous acquisition of data fr om numer ous br ain r egions with the limitation of being less pr ecise, and it demands a longer imaging time (Maul et al., 2020 ).In general, MRS quantifies metabolites by e v aluating metabolite concentr ations in a few select brain anatomical regions but not the whole brain (De-Mayo et al., 2023b ).To e v aluate the potential benefits for early AD detection, dia gnosis, and tr eatment, lar ge-scale, pr efer abl y longitudinal studies are necessary under standardized conditions in the future.</p>
<p>ASL</p>
<p>To the extent that regional metabolism and perfusion are coupled, ASL labels water molecules in arterial blood as an endogenous tracer for perfusion (Chao et al., 2010 ).In ASL, water molecules proximal to the area of interest in the arterial blood are magnetically labelled.</p>
<p>Cer ebr al blood flow (CBF) is the rate at which arterial blood is deliv er ed to the capillary bed in brain tissue and is gener all y quantified in millilitres of blood per 100 grams of tissue per minute (Brown et al., 2007 ).CBF is generally considered to be a proxy measur e for br ain functional acti vity.As the acti vity of neurons changes, so does the demand for oxygen, and the changing demand for energy moderates the CBF.CBF can be measured with a standard MRI sequence and compared to an unlabelled image as a control (Zhang et al., 2017 ).In this way, changes in the neurovascular system can be detected by ASL imaging.</p>
<p>In MCI, decreases in CBF are found in the bilateral and medial temporoparietal regions, PCC, and inferior prefrontal cortex (Dolui et al., 2020 ), wher eas incr eases in CBF ar e found in the hippocampus, amygdala, right inferior frontal and insular region, and basal ganglia (Dai et al., 2009 ;Duan et al., 2020 ).Regarding diseaser elated outcomes, r egional hypoperfusion is r elated to pr ogr ession from MCI to AD, in addition to functional and cognitive deterioration (Chao et al., 2010 ).In addition, notable hypoperfusion is present in the parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex areas, hippocampus , posterior cingulate , basal ganglia, thalamus , and fr ontal r egion in AD (Alexopoulos et al. , 2012 ;Duan et al. , 2020 ;Huang et al., 2018 ;Huang et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2020 ;Mak et al., 2014 ;Riederer et al., 2018 ;Zou et al., 2014 ).A meta-anal ysis r evealed that CBF measured via ASL sho w ed impairment in AD compared with the control group in subregions of the MTL.The CBF difference was significant in the hippocampus between the AD and CN groups (Kapasouri et al., 2022 ).Reduced CBF coexists with incr eased CBF, whic h is a r esponse to pathologic dama ge in the earl y sta ges of the neur odegener ativ e pr ocess.In particular, CBF is ele v ated in AD patients in the hippocampus, whic h suggests a compensatory increase in neural activity.In addition, the CBFimpair ed r egions in AD ar e colocalized with two br ain r estingstate networks: the DMN and the salience network.The regions of CBF changes sho w ed great spatial overlap with the AD pathologically affected regions (Anchisi et al., 2005 ).Moreover, measures of perfusion on ASL imaging may also differ entiate AD fr om VaD, DLB, and FTD (Binnewijzend et al., 2014 ;Gao et al., 2013 ;Mao et al., 2023 ).</p>
<p>In summary, ASL is a perfusion MRI modality that is r elativ el y inexpensive and easy to perform; furthermore, it could be added to conventional brain MRI, requiring 5 minutes of additional scan time .Moreo ver, ASL can pro vide CBF quantification and can be performed r epeatedl y (Alsaedi et al., 2018 ).Gr owing e vidence supports the utility of ASL to measure CBF in AD and differentiate AD patients from CN individuals.ASL is also a helpful technique in differentiating AD from V aD, DLB , and FTD.Hypoperfusion thr ough ASL ov erla ps with hypometabolism patterns acquired via FDG-PET in AD patients.In addition, ASL is useful to explor e ov erla pping pathogenetic mec hanisms in AD (Gr ade et al., 2015 ).T he nonin v asiv e and inexpensiv e natur e of the ASL measurements and the extraction of additional quantitative and vascular information might make the use of ASL in AD an attr activ e alternative to FDG-PET.The limitation of ASL in clinical practice is its low signal-to-noise r atio, whic h r esults in r educed ima ge quality (Alsaedi et al. , 2018 ).W ith impr ov ements in experimental design and har dw are, ASL could be a promising tool for exploring early detection, pathogenetic mechanisms, and diagnosis of AD.</p>
<p>DTI</p>
<p>DTI is one of the most effectiv e MR tec hniques for the investigation of brain anatomy and measures the thermal motion of water molecules (Beaulieu and Allen, 1994 ).DTI can acquire data for a wide variety of micr ostructur es, whic h is vital for identifying disruption of those micr ostructur es due to disease and the fibre tr ac ks of white matter (WM) (Buckner et al., 2009 ).</p>
<p>The primary metrics of DTI include the av er a ge r ate of water molecule diffusi vity, mean diffusi vity (MD), and the variability associated with diffusion, fractional anisotropy (FA) (Madden et al., 2012 ).FA is used to r epr esent the motional anisotropy of water molecules and is sensitive to the integrity of WM, whereas MD is a scalar measure of the directionally averaged diffusion magnitude and is used to assess the micr ostructur al pr operties of broad br ain structur es, including gr ey matter (Maeda et al., 2021 ).</p>
<p>MCI patients show extensive and serious abnormal diffusion measures in the corpus callosum, temporal brain region, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (Brueggen et al., 2019 ;Li et al., 2016 ).In addition, the integrity of se v er al WM fibr es, including the bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract and left hippocampal cingulum, forceps minor, left cingulum (cingulate gyrus), and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, was damaged in MCI patients (Luo et al., 2019 ;Shao et al., 2019 ).The selective impairment of WM is probably associated with the pathologicall y pr ov en distribution of NFTs and amyloid plaques in the cortex and interconnection among WM fibres (Head et al., 2004 ).MD increases in the basal forebrain are related to an increased risk of progression from MCI to AD (Brueggen et al., 2015 ).Mor eov er, Brueggen et al., Li et al., and a meta-anal ysis r eported that decreased FA in patients with AD was identified in the left fr ontal lobe, cor pus callosum, fornix, cingulate gyrus, cingulate bundle , uncinate fasciculus , superior longitudinal fasciculus , inferior fronto-occipital fascicles, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and MTL, including the hippocampus and cingulum, in AD patients (Chen et al. , 2023 ;K umar et al. , 2022 ;Qin et al. , 2021 ).MD is significantly higher in the splenium of the corpus callosum and parietal lobe WM in AD patients than in those in healthy controls (Duan et al., 2006 ).MD and FA abnormalities are associated with executive and memory dysfunction (Hirni et al., 2013 ;Sjöbeck et al., 2010 ).Diffusivity metrics also differentiate AD from other dementias, such as DLB and FTD (Firbank et al., 2016 ;Sc humac her et al., 2023 ;Zhang et al., 2009 ).Furthermore, combined with the WM dispersion c har acteristics pr ovided by DTI and artificial intelligence tec hnology, curr ent r esearc h has made br eakthr oughs in the assisted recognition of AD (Chen et al., 2022 ).</p>
<p>Ov er all, DTI can be used to describe the micr ostructur e of WM through its tensor model.The diffusion features and structural connectomics of specific br ain r egions may provide useful information for assisted earl y r ecognition of AD.DTI might r e v eal the structural impairment and dysfunction of WM in AD patients through the combination of macroscopic network activity and micr oscopic neur al structur e, whic h could pr ovide a theor etical basis for understanding the abnormal neur al mec hanisms underl ying AD and interv ention tr eatment.DTI can be used to describe the micr ostructur e of WM but has limited value in describing GM atr ophy, cortical v ariation, and br ain functional network activ ation (Wang et al., 2022 ).Ther efor e, it is necessary to further combine fMRI, structural MRI, and ASL with other neur oima ging modalities in the study of AD neural mechanisms in the future and investigate whether there is a relationship between structural and functional connections and their influence on the pr ogr essiv e pathology of AD .T r aditional DTI has limitations in r esolving intr avoxel complexities such as crossing, fibre bending, and twisting.High angular resolution diffusion imaging has appeared to address this limitation by sampling the diffusion signal along many gradient directions .It ma y offer an impr ov ed a ppr oac h to biomarker discovery (Lenglet et al., 2009 ).The new technique should be consider ed to ov ercome existing barriers in clinical trials in the future.Finally, most AD WM abnormality studies based on DTI are crosssectional studies (Chen et al., 2023 ).This experimental design may miss individual differences and longitudinal progression in the pr ogr essiv e pr ogr ession of AD.In the future, longitudinal studies will further focus on early biomarkers for the transformation prediction of MCI individuals into AD.</p>
<p>PET</p>
<p>PET ima ging measur es metabolic c hanges by using differ ent r adioactiv e tr acers for eac h intended tar get (Ruan and Sun, 2023 ).PET ima ging involv es the coincident detection of gamma rays r eleased fr om positr on annihilation e v ents originating fr om r adioactiv e tr acers (Omami et al., 2014 ).Owing to the higher diagnostic accuracy of PET for AD in both diagnostic and r esearc h contexts, PET has been used as an imaging method in various ther a peutic and pr ognostic studies .T he neur opathologic featur es of AD include intracellular NFTs consisting of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated Tau protein and extracellular senile plaques composed of A β peptides (Scheltens et al., 2016 ).The NIA-AA r ecommends the consider ation of biomarkers about amyloid PET positivity, Tau-PET positivity, and reduced metabolism on FDG-PET for AD diagnosis (Table 1 ).</p>
<p>Am yloid PET binds am yloid-β fibrils in senile plaques.Curr entl y, carbon-11 Pittsbur gh compound B ([ 11 C]PiB) is the most extensiv el y studied in the amyloid radiopharmaceuticals (Johnson et al., 2013 ).In MCI patients, increased [ 11 C]PiB uptake has been reported in comparison to AD patients (Forsberg et al., 2008 ).In ad dition, [ 11 C]PiB uptak e is pr edictiv e of pr ogr ession to AD (Lim et al., 2014 ).It has been reported that [ 18 F]florbetapir-positive scans wer e pr edictiv e for pr ogr essiv e deterior ation of cognitiv e states in MCI and AD patients, compared with those with a negative scan (Doraiswamy et al., 2014 ).Furthermore, [ 18 F]flutemetamol and [ 18 F]florbetaben have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Tripathi and Murray, 2022 ).[ 18 F]flutemetamol has shown the ability to discriminate patients with AD from elderly healthy (Hatashita et al., 2019 ).In addition, [ 18 F]florbetaben is a deri vati ve of polyethylene glycol stilbene and has shown high specificity for A β with probable AD patients (Barthel et al., 2011a(Barthel et al., , 2011b ) ). Diffuse cortical amyloid tracer binding is predominant in frontal and posterior cingulate with a r elativ e sparing of medial temporal cortex, sensorimotor, and occipital cortex in AD (Okam ur a et al., 2018 ).</p>
<p>Tau PET binds paired helical filaments-tau in NFTs, neuropil thr eads, and dystr ophic neurites.The earliest r adiotr acer to target tau was [ 18 F]-labelled THK-523 in vivo but unfortunately, a v ery high r etention in WM pr ecludes its use in r esearc h (Villemagne et al., 2014 ).Additionally, several [ 18 F]-labelled arylquinoline deri vati ves were developed as candidate tau PET r adiotr acers such as [ 18 F]THK-5105 and [ 18 F]-THK-5117 (Harada et al., 2015 ).</p>
<p>[ 18 F]THK5351, has shown faster uptake and washout kinetics and lo w er WM uptake compared with [ 18 F]THK5117 in AD patients, as well as lower cortical retention in MCI compared with AD (Lockhart et al., 2016 ).In addition, [ 18 F]AV-1451 sho w ed distribution of tau pathology according to Braak stages (Marquié et al., 2017 ).Furthermore, 18F-AV-1451 uptake was found in the cortex in MCI, while the uptake was confined in the hippocampus in A β negative healthy participants (Pontecorvo et al., 2017 ).There are a few ne wer r adio tr acers suc h as [ 18 F]RO-948, [ 18 F]JNJ64349311, [ 18 F]PI-2620, and [ 18 F]GTP1 that have been used for tau imaging (Leuzy et al., 2019 ;Sanabria Bohórquez et al., 2019 ).Tau tracer binding is ob viousl y higher in the temporo-parietal cortex, and lo w er in subcortical regions in AD (Lagarde et al., 2019 ).A close relationship is observed with tau pathology and se v erity of cognitiv e impairment and hence may be used as a prognostic biomarker for AD (Villemagne et al., 2018 ).</p>
<p>FDG-PET relies on the detection of hypometabolism in different br ain r egions corr esponding to sites of neur odegener ation.The reliance of the brain on glucose for its activity allows FDG, a glucose analogue, to be used to measure glucose transportermediated uptake, following which activity is tr a pped in the cells after phosphorylation.Glucose uptake is inv ersel y pr oportional to neuronal dysfunction (Nasrallah and Dubroff, 2013 ).FDG-PET measures glucose metabolism in different brain regions and represents a metabolic marker in the preclinical detection and early diagnosis of dementia.Metabolic changes commonly occur before detectable structur al c hanges take place in the brain (Sanchez-Catasus et al., 2017 ).Hypometabolism in FDG-PET images is considered a biomarker of AD.FDG-PET is used in the differential diagnosis of AD and evaluation of MCI conversion to AD (Rice and Bisdas, 2017 ).Cer ebr al glucose hypometabolism has been consistentl y demonstr ated in the posterior cingulate gyrus, MTL, frontal cortices, and/or parieto-temporal regions of typical AD patients.Similarl y, moder ate hypometabolism has been detected in the basal ganglia, cerebellum, visual cortices, and sensorimotor thalamus (Tripathi and Murray, 2022 ).</p>
<p>In summary, PET has been used as a biomarker in various prognostic and ther a peutic studies and studies related to AD.The high dia gnostic accur acy of PET ima ging has also been consider ed in diagnostic and research criteria for AD.FDG-PET plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of AD.Amyloid PET is becoming more common in clinical practice.Amyloid PET has been used in clinical trials of novel drugs that help reduce the formation of A β but has not yet ac hie v ed favour able outcomes.Failur e of antiamyloid ther a pies for AD leads to a paradigm shift to w ar ds tau as a ther a peutic tar get (Tripathi and Murr a y, 2022 ).Tau PET ma y offer new insights and be of great help in the differential diagnosis and treatment selection of AD patients.In addition, PET is a costly, inv asiv e, and inconv enient tec hnique that also r equir es exposur e to ionizing radiation, limiting its clinical application (Acuff et al., 2020 ).Despite these differ ences, PET ima ging has the potential to impr ov e the diagnostic specificity and targeted therapy of AD.</p>
<p>SPECT</p>
<p>SPECT, a nuclear medicine imaging modality, involves injecting a gamma-emitter r adiotr acer into the patient and obtaining tomogr a phic ima ges of its distribution.T hus , it can be used to detect both cellular and c hemical c hanges linked to a disease .T he absorption of the radiotracer relies on the biochemical behaviour of the tracer in vivo (Catafau, 2001 ).</p>
<p>SPECT e v aluates r egional CBF and is correlated with metabolic changes (O'Brien et al., 2014 ).The presence of hypoperfusion in SPECT in the posterior parietal cortex, posterior cingulate, and in MCI patients has been consistently associated with an increased risk of pr ogr ession to AD (Quar anta et al., 2018 ).Typicall y, AD is r epr esented on SPECT ima ges by hypometabolism in the temporal, posterior parietal, and PCC with either normal a ppear ance of the sensorimotor cortex and the primary visual, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia or the presence of bilateral hypoperfusion (Ferrando and Damian, 2021 ).</p>
<p>In summary, SPECT is curr entl y one of the most widel y av ailable imaging techniques for the study of brain function with lo w er cost than PET (Ritt, 2022 ).Regional CBF imaging using SPECT may provide useful information about brain perfusion in the diagnosis of AD.SPECT is valued for its high specificity and sensitivity in differentiating AD from CN individuals (Kong et al., 2023 ).123Iioflupane (DaTscan™) SPECT has been a ppr ov ed in the Eur opean Union and the USA to e v aluate PDD patients (Kemp et al., 2011 ).Ther efor e, SPECT is a promising tool for exploring the early detection and diagnosis of AD.</p>
<p>Fluorescence Molecular Tomography</p>
<p>Pr esentl y, definitiv e and accur ate AD dia gnosis still r elies on clinical findings from postmortem analysis of AD patients' brains (Murphy and LeVine, 2010 ;Valotassiou et al., 2018 ).In addition, nuclear imaging modalities have some disadvantages, such as high cost, poor resolution, long testing times, and unavoidable exposur e to r adioactivity (Xu et al., 2016 ).Optical imaging modalities, particularl y NIRF ima ging, may pr ovide a non-inv asiv e in vivo method to visualize the real-time status of the AD brains more accur atel y at the biomolecular le v el (Liu et al., 2021b ;López-Cuenca et al., 2021 ).Importantly, small molecule NIR pr obes ar e used to detect Tau protein, β-amyloid, and other biomarkers (Rai et al., 2022 ).Optical imaging applications can simultaneously record and analyse both the spatial and functional dynamics of pathological injuries (Liu et al., 2021b ).</p>
<p>Gr eat pr ogr ess has been made for AD pr obes.Ho w e v er, ther e are some challenges for small molecular fluorescence AD probes in vivo .(i) There is a lack of NIRF probes for the accurate identification of different pathological states of A β, which should be addressed by further molecular design.(ii) Most reported probes onl y tar get one or two associated biomarkers.Ho w e v er, it is vital to use different probes that detect corresponding targets from the same resource.(iii) Although dual diagnostic and therapeutic AD pr obes wer e r eported with in vitro data, an in vivo study is missing (Liu et al., 2022 ).</p>
<p>In summary, AD probes yield sharp fluorescence signal enhancement on binding to AD biomarkers, leading to clear images of biomarkers with a high signal-to-background ratio.The AD pr obes ar e designed to penetr ate the blood −br ain barrier and target AD biomarkers for the precise diagnosis of early-stage AD.AD pr obes hav e m ultiple other functions, suc h as ther a peutic integration and multimodal imaging, and various optimal characteristics, such as a variety of optical properties and dual responsiveness (Rai et al., 2022 ).AD probes should be considered in novel molecular design strategies for the precise diagnosis and treatment of AD at an early stage.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>General summary</p>
<p>We have reviewed the literature concerning neuroimaging modalities, gener all y including MRI (structur al MRI, t-fMRI, rs-fMRI, MRS, ASL, and DTI), PET, SPECT, and optical imaging, in MCI and AD patients.Differ ent neur oima ging modalities with v arious biomarkers have already provided useful information in terms of diagnosing AD during the preclinical stage, tracking its progression, and differentiating AD from other forms of dementia.In structur al MRI studies, ther e ar e pr omising biomarkers in both MCI and AD patients, such as hippocampal atrophy and entorhinal cortex atr ophy.Hippocampal atr ophy can predict whether MCI patients would pr ogr ess to AD and can be used to differ entiate AD fr om PDD and DLB.Entorhinal cortex atrophy that provides prediction for the conversion from MCI patients to AD.Other biomarkers in the cer ebr al cortex detected by using structur al MRI (e.g.GM loss in the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes), subcortical regions (e.g.atrophy of the amygdala and olfactory bulb), and cerebellum (e.g.cerebellar atrophy) also have potential in AD patients.In fMRI studies, t-fMRI is used to investigate functional alterations during tasks of memory, vision, and motor performance in MCI and AD patients.Some contr adictory r esults wer e found r egarding brain activation of the MTL during memory tasks in MCI patients .T his difference ma y be due to the mixed sample of MCI and AD patients, and there is a need for further r esearc h to overcome the limitations of the inclusion criteria in the future.Additionall y, r educed posterior cingulate gyrus/precuneus deactivation and frontal hyperactivation are approximately consistent findings during memory tasks in MCI and AD patients.t-fMRI and rs-fMRI studies in this r e vie w demonstr ate disruptions in brain functional connectivity patterns in AD and MCI patients compared to CN group.Changes in both structural and functional network organization in AD are linked to the patterns of amyloid-β and tau accum ulation and spr ead, pr oviding insights into the neur obiological mechanisms of AD.Furthermore, the detection of gener elated connectome c hanges might be helpful in the earl y dia gnosis of AD and facilitate the de v elopment of personalized thera peutic str ategies that ar e effectiv e in the earl y sta ges of AD (Yu et al., 2021b ).In MRS studies, the concentration or ratios of brain metabolites, such as Glx, NAA, glutamate, and ratios of NAA/Cr, glutamate/mI, and NAA/mI, were found to be promising biomarkers .In ASL studies , c hanges in CBF wer e found in differ ent br ain regions in MCI and AD patients by using ASL, which differentiates AD from V aD, DLB , and FTD.In DTI studies, WM damage was found in MCI and AD patients by using DTI.Additionall y, r ecent r esearc h has made br eakthr oughs in combining DTI and artificial</p>
<p>T he rela tionships among different markers</p>
<p>Ther e ar e v arious biomarkers that can be detected by different neur oima ging methods, as mentioned befor e. Differ ent biomarkers belong to one category.Biomarkers of brain structures (i.e.hippocampal atr ophy, fr ontal, parietal, and tempor al lobe atr ophy), WM damage, and CBF are all classified as anatomical structures, whic h ar e measur ed in structur al MRI, DTI, ASL, and SPECT, re-spectiv el y.Mor eov er, m ultiple neur oima ging modalities ar e used to measure the same biomarker, and a neuroimaging method can measur e differ ent biomarkers.PET and NIRF pr obes ar e all r epr esentativ e neur oima ging methods for measuring pathogenic proteins (A β deposition and tau), and PET can also be used for measuring the le v el of glucose metabolism.Br ain activ ation and functional connectivity are generally measured by using t-fMRI.Moreover, functional connectivity is measured by using not only t-fMRI but also rs-fMRI (Table 3 ).The NIA-AA recommends the consideration of biomarkers about amyloid PET positivity, Tau-PET positivity, reduced metabolism on FDG-PET, brain abnormalities on structural MRI for AD diagnosis (Table 1 ).Asia Expert Opinion in 2021 recommends that the brain networks impairment on fMRI and the WM integrity impairment on DTI are promising biomarkers for AD diagnosis (Kandiah et al., 2022 ).In other prospective biomarkers, regional hypoperfusion and hypertransfusion on ASL or SPECT, decreased level and ratios of brain metabolites in MRS, hyper-and hypo-activation in the task-related region on t-fMRI are also promising biomarkers for AD diagnosis.Across all these biomarkers , in vestigators should consider specificity to the disease process, histological validation, practical feasibility in a clinical r esearc h setting, sensitivity to detect abnormalities, and relationship to cognitive/clinical outcomes.Howe v er, ther e is not a single neur oima ging tec hnique that meets all these criteria and provides a sufficiently rich understanding of pathological pr ocesses.Differ ent ima ging modalities with biomarkers may offer complementary information and rich information that could be used for tr ac king and staging within individuals.Combining neur oima ging modalities with composite neur oima ging biomarkers is a new open field, and m ulticentr e clinical trials are needed to further explore composite neur oima ging biomarkers in the future (Márquez and Yassa, 2019 ).</p>
<p>Ad v antages and disad v antages of neuroimaging modalities</p>
<p>Ther e ar e v arious neur oima ging modalities in this r e vie w.Eac h imaging modality has its own adv anta ges and limitations .T he major adv anta ge of MRI is its widespr ead av ailability in AD r esearc h.MRI scans pr ovide detailed anatomical information (Márquez and Yassa, 2019 ).Ho w e v er, ther e ar e still some limitations to be addressed on different MRI modalities.(i) fMRI data are indeed intensive to collect, clean, pre-process, and analyse.MRS quantifies metabolites by e v aluating metabolite concentr ations in a few select brain anatomical regions but not the whole brain.The limitation of ASL in clinical practice is its low signal-to-noise ratio, whic h r esults in r educed ima ge quality.In addition, Tr aditional DTI has limitations in resolving intravoxel complexities such as cr ossing, fibr e bending, and twisting.(ii) Methods to further impr ov e the effect of high field intensity MRI on the human body should be further studied (Yu et al., 2021a ).Compared with MRI, PET, and SPECT can visualize neur otr ansmitters and brain receptors and determine specific biomolecule concentrations in the picomolar range if developed to have higher sensitivity (Bois et al., 2008 ;Cheng et al., 2012 ).Notably, previous studies reported that PET had insurmountable limitations due to its high cost, the short half-lives of the radioactive atomic species and scarcity of the r equir ed isotopes (Bertoncini and Celej, 2011 ).Compared to PET, SPECT has a r elativ el y low signal-to-noise ratio and background interference (Yang et al., 2020 ).Optical imaging has become a reliable a ppr oac h for fast data acquisition, wide availability, and the real-time detection of A β with high sensitivity and high resolution (Kaminski Schierle et al., 2011 ;Maeda et al., 2007 ).Despite tremendous pr ogr ess in small molecular fluor escence AD pr obes, ther e are still some limitations for AD imaging and ther a py in vivo .For example, NIR fluor escence pr obes that combine NIR fluorescence imaging with other conventional phototherapies for the accurate identification of different pathological states of A β in vivo have not yet been de v eloped (Ma et al., 2018 ;Ozawa et al., 2021 ;Suzuki et al., 2019 ).</p>
<p>Influenced factors</p>
<p>Ther e is gr owing e vidence about neur oima ging biomarkers in AD.Ho w e v er, the influencing factors may be ignored in the design of clinical trials .T he influencing factors of age and sex have been reported in clinical trials in AD.Age remains the greatest risk factor for AD and is thus a fundamental driver for the de v elopment of this disease (Masters et al., 2015 ).An accelerated decrease was found in hippocampal volume at the baseline age of 55-60 years, and an accelerated decline was found in cortical thickness and hippocampal volume at the baseline age of 65-70 years.Accelerated declines in hippocampal volume continue after 70 years (Luo et al., 2022 ).Between 2015 and 2030, the number of people in the world aged 60 years or over is projected to grow by 56%, and by 2050, the global aged population is projected to more than double .T he incr easing a geing at the global population le v el has led to a high increase in the prevalence of AD (Riedel et al., 2016 ).In an AD Neur oima ging Initiativ e study, br ain atr ophy r ates wer e ∼1-1.5% faster in women than in men in a 1-year follow-up e v aluation (Hua et al., 2010 ).A meta-analysis reported that men had higher GM densities than women in se v er al br ain r egions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, putamen, and insular cortex (Ruigrok et al., 2014 ).Men with AD show lower connectivity strength than women within se v er al br ain network pr operties (Li et al., 2021 ).A study of AD patients reported that striatal A β accumulation was faster in women than in men (Kim et al., 2022b ).A higher pr e v alence and incidence of AD is found in women than in men.The greater risk of AD in females may be attributed to their greater longevity of, on a verage , 4.5 years .Women ma y ha ve intrinsic susceptibilities to the disease, including hypertension, menopause, pregnanc y disor ders, hormone ther a py, and gynaecological sur geries (Cui et al., 2023 ).Tau depositions significantl y incr eased in females in some brain regions in A β positive patients (Zhang et al., 2022 ).Epidemiological studies have reported that higher education years are associated with a reduced risk of incident AD, suggesting that education may pr ovide pr otection a gainst the onset of AD (Cho et al., 2015 ;Scarmeas et al., 2006 ).This pr otectiv e effect of education is supported by the cognitive reserve hypothesis.Cognitiv e r eserv e r efers to the ability of the brain to compensate for damage by using pre-existing cognitive processing appr oac hes or by recruiting compensatory approaches (Scarmeas and Stern, 2004 ).Ther efor e, an individual with higher education years might cope better with an equivalent level of pathology than an individual with lo w er education y ears , which in turn, dela y the clinical expression of AD (Dumurgier et al., 2010 ).Once AD clinicall y manifests, br ain pathology is alr ead y ad vanced in AD patients with higher education, more so than those with lo w er education.Ther efor e, the influencing factors of age, sex, and years of education should be considered in the design of clinical trials for AD.</p>
<p>Limitations in the design of clinical trials</p>
<p>Based on the reported findings about neur oima ging modalities, we found some limitations in the design of clinical trials.First, a limitation of neur oima ging modalities is their use in mostly crosssectional studies.AD is a pr ogr essiv e disease in natur e, whic h r equires longitudinal data about early biomarkers for the prediction of transformation from MCI to AD. Next, those studies in this revie w wer e gener all y performed in small cohorts including 10-100 participants .T hus , m ulticentr e and lar ge-scale trials ar e necessary in the futur e.In brief, lar ge-scale and longitudinal studies are worth conducting with optimized and standardized neur oima ging modalities to elucidate the pathogenesis and facilitate the early diagnosis of AD in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, differ ent ima ging modalities hav e shown substantial utility in identifying biomarkers of AD pathology.T hese , in turn, could be used to impr ov e dia gnostic accur acy and dev elop nov el molecular-based tr eatment interv entions.While onl y tr aditional structur al modalities ar e curr entl y r ecommended for the diagnosis of AD in clinical practice, further research is necessary to overcome the limitations of mor e adv anced modalities.Advancements in these modalities should warrant their future inclusion in diagnostic criteria for AD.</p>

In ad-dition to MRI, biomarkers in other neur oima ging modalities haveshown potential in identifying MCI and AD. PET plays an impor-tant role in the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. The limitation ofhigh cost may be solved with social de v elopment and impr ov e-ment of medical insur ance. Mor eov er, SPECT is mainl y used forthe diagnosis of PDD at present, and studies on the diagnosis ofAD using SPECT ar e scarce. Mor e clinical trials ar e necessary toinv estigate the dia gnosis of AD using SPECT. Pr eclinical studiesindicate that NIRF imaging is an advanced modality in AD. It isnecessary to explor e NIRF ima ging in clinical trials in AD in thefuture . T he clinical value of these biomarkers in different neu-r oima ging modalities needs to be further demonstrated and hasthe potential to be included in the AT(N) classification system inthe futur e. Furthermor e, other ne w biomarkers should be discov-ered and explored in different neuroimaging modalities.
