                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Citation metrics serve as the cornerstone of scholarly impact evaluation despite their well-documented vulnerability to inflation through self-citation practices. This paper introduces the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a sophisticated metric designed to recalibrate citation counts by accounting for discipline-specific self-citation patterns. Through comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that excessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially misdirecting billions in research funding. Recent studies confirm that self-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men self-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing inequalities in academic recognition. Our open-source implementation provides comprehensive tools for calculating SCAI and related metrics, offering a more equitable assessment of research impact that reduces the gender citation gap by approximately 8.5%. This work contributes to the paradigm shift toward transparent, nuanced, and equitable research evaluation methodologies in academia, with direct implications for funding allocation decisions that collectively amount to over $100 billion annually in the United States alone.</p>

<p>Billions at Stake: How Self-Citation Adjusted Metrics Can Transform Equitable Research Funding

Citation metrics serve as the cornerstone of scholarly impact evaluation despite their well-documented vulnerability to inflation through self-citation practices.This paper introduces the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a sophisticated metric designed to recalibrate citation counts by accounting for discipline-specific self-citation patterns.Through comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines, we demonstrate that excessive self-citation inflates traditional metrics by 10-20%, potentially misdirecting billions in research funding.Recent studies confirm that self-citation patterns exhibit significant gender disparities, with men self-citing up to 70% more frequently than women, exacerbating existing inequalities in academic recognition.Our open-source implementation provides comprehensive tools for calculating SCAI and related metrics, offering a more equitable assessment of research impact that reduces the gender citation gap by approximately 8.5%.This work contributes to the paradigm shift toward transparent, nuanced, and equitable research evaluation methodologies in academia, with direct implications for funding allocation decisions that collectively amount to over $100 billion annually in the United States alone.</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The assessment of scholarly impact through citation metrics has evolved into a critical determinant in academic evaluation, funding allocation, hiring decisions, and career advancement [1], [2].Traditional metrics such as the h-index [1] and i10-index [3] have become standard quantitative tools for measuring research impact.However, these metrics share a fundamental epistemological limitation: they treat all citations with equal weight, regardless of source, including self-citations where authors reference their own previous work [4], [5].</p>
<p>While self-citation represents a legitimate and often necessary aspect of research continuity and development [6], substantial evidence suggests that excessive self-citation can artificially inflate citation counts and distort perceived scholarly impact [4], [7].Longitudinal studies indicate that each self-citation generates approximately three additional citations over a five-year period [4], creating a compounding effect that significantly skews traditional metrics.Recent analyses from 2023-2024 have further reinforced these findings, highlighting persistent patterns across disciplines [8].</p>
<p>This distortion engenders several systemic problems with profound consequences for the research ecosystem: First, there is a fundamental misrepresentation of genuine research influence and impact across the scholarly landscape.The artificial inflation of citation metrics through strategic selfcitation obscures the true influence of research contributions, undermining the credibility of evaluation systems and potentially rewarding self-promotion over substantive impact.</p>
<p>Second, the potential misallocation of increasingly scarce research funding based on inflated metrics represents a significant economic concern.With federal research funding in the United States alone exceeding $100 billion annually [9], even a modest percentage of misallocation translates to billions of dollars directed toward research that appears more impactful than it genuinely is.</p>
<p>Third, there is the exacerbation of existing gender and field disparities.Robust studies demonstrate that men self-cite up to 70% more than women [10], creating a compounding disadvantage for female researchers.Recent research from 2023 has confirmed that these disparities persist and may even be increasing in certain fields [11], [12].</p>
<p>The academic community increasingly acknowledges these limitations [5], [13], [14], yet widely adopted alternatives remain elusive.This paper addresses this critical gap by introducing the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a novel metric designed to provide a more accurate assessment of scholarly impact by accounting for self-citation patterns while preserving the virtues of traditional citation metrics.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.Section II presents the motivation and background for developing citation metrics that adjust for self-citation, incorporating recent findings from 2022-2024.Section III details our methodological contributions, including the SCAI algorithm and its implementation.Section IV presents results from applying SCAI to a diverse dataset of researcher profiles.Section V discusses the implications of these findings for research evaluation and funding allocation.Finally, Section VI concludes with a summary of contributions and directions for future work.</p>
<p>II. MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND</p>
<p>A. Limitations of Current Citation Metrics</p>
<p>Traditional citation metrics fundamentally fail to distinguish between self-citations and external citations, treating both as equivalent indicators of research impact.The h-index [1], defined as the maximum value h where a researcher has published h papers with at least h citations each, counts selfcitations on par with external citations.Similarly, the i10index [3], which measures the number of publications with at least 10 citations, does not differentiate citation sources.This equivalence creates profound vulnerabilities in the evaluation system that manifest in several interrelated ways.Researchers can systematically increase their self-citation rates to boost citation counts [4], [15].While some self-citation reflects natural research progression, excessive self-citation can manifest as strategic behavior aimed at artificially inflating metrics [7].Recent studies from 2023 have revealed self-citation patterns across disciplines that suggest some researchers strategically employ this approach to enhance their perceived impact [8].</p>
<p>The impact of self-citation extends well beyond the immediate count.Fowler and Aksnes [4] demonstrated through longitudinal analysis that each self-citation generates approximately three additional citations over five years, creating a compounding effect that significantly amplifies the initial inflation.This finding has been reinforced by more recent research showing the long-term impact of self-citation patterns on career trajectories [11].</p>
<p>Analogous issues exist at the journal level, where high selfcitation rates can inflate journal impact factors [16].Journals exhibiting excessive self-citation rates have been temporarily suppressed from citation reports [17].Recent data from 2023 Journal Citation Reports show that this practice continues to influence journal rankings [18].</p>
<p>B. Financial and Equity Implications</p>
<p>The distortion of citation metrics has profound and farreaching consequences that extend well beyond academic recognition, affecting both financial resource allocation and equity in the research ecosystem.</p>
<p>Citation metrics frequently inform funding decisions [19].If a 10-20% metric inflation results in even a 10% misallocation of funds, the cumulative financial impact across the research ecosystem becomes substantial.In the United States alone, federal research funding exceeds $100 billion annually [9], meaning potential misallocation could reach billions of dollars.Recent analyses of funding distributions from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicate that citation-based evaluation plays a significant role in determining resource allocation [20].</p>
<p>The gender disparities in self-citation practices have been consistently documented, with men self-citing up to 70% more than women [10], [21].When unadjusted citation metrics drive evaluation, these disparities compound existing inequities in academia [22], [23].Recent studies from 2023-2024 have further demonstrated that articles authored by women in highimpact journals receive fewer citations than those authored by men, particularly when women collaborate as both primary and senior authors [24].This disparity has significant implications for career advancement and recognition in academia.</p>
<p>Self-citation rates vary substantially across disciplines [6], [7].Fields with naturally higher self-citation rates may appear disproportionately impactful when evaluated using traditional metrics, potentially skewing cross-disciplinary comparisons and funding allocations [14].Recent discipline-specific analyses have confirmed these patterns, showing particularly high self-citation rates in engineering and physical sciences compared to humanities [8].</p>
<p>C. Previous Approaches</p>
<p>Several approaches have been proposed to address the limitations of traditional citation metrics, though none have comprehensively addressed the self-citation issue.</p>
<p>Numerous modifications to the h-index have been proposed, including the g-index [25], which gives more weight to highly cited papers, and the m-quotient [1], which normalizes the hindex by career length.However, few directly address the selfcitation conundrum.More recent variants such as the hm-index proposed by Stanford University researchers adjust for coauthorship but still do not adequately account for self-citation patterns [26].Some citation databases offer the option to exclude self-citations when calculating metrics [27].However, this approach treats all self-citations as invalid, ignoring their legitimate role in research continuity [6].Recent innovations in bibliometric platforms like Scopus's CiteScore 2023 have attempted to address broader citation issues but still do not fully resolve the self-citation problem [28].</p>
<p>Field-normalized citation metrics aim to account for discipline-specific citation patterns [14].While valuable for cross-field comparisons, these approaches typically do not specifically address self-citation bias.Recent efforts such as the Journal Citation Indicator introduced in Journal Citation Reports 2023 provide normalized metrics but still do not adequately account for self-citation patterns [18].</p>
<p>These previous approaches either fail to address self-citation directly or take an overly reductive view that does not recognize the nuanced role of self-citation in scholarly communication.Our work builds on these foundations while explicitly focusing on developing a metric that appropriately adjusts for self-citation patterns while preserving the interpretability and utility of traditional citation metrics.</p>
<p>III. CONTRIBUTIONS</p>
<p>A. Conceptual Framework</p>
<p>The Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI) presented in this paper provides a more accurate and equitable measure of scholarly impact by building on the foundation of traditional citation metrics while incorporating sophisticated adjustments for self-citation patterns.</p>
<p>Our framework recognizes three key principles derived from decades of bibliometric research and reinforced by recent studies: Not all self-citations are problematic; moderate self-citation is a natural part of research continuity and knowledge building.Recent analyses from 2023 confirm that baseline self-citation rates vary by field and career stage, indicating that some level of self-citation is inherent to the scholarly communication process [8].The impact of self-citation on perceived scholarly influence is non-linear and compounds over time.Recent research has shown that this compounding effect creates widening disparities in perceived impact over the course of academic careers [11].</p>
<p>Lastly, adjustment factors should be transparent, adaptable to different disciplines, and grounded in empirical evidence.Recent field-specific analyses from 2023-2024 have provided enhanced understanding of disciplinary norms that can inform such calibrations [8].Based on these principles, we have developed a comprehensive approach to citation analysis that includes three complementary metrics.The SCAI serves as the primary metric for assessing citation impact with self-citation adjustment, providing a more equitable measure of scholarly influence.</p>
<p>The Self-Citation Ratio (SCR) functions as a complementary diagnostic tool that quantifies the proportion of citations that are self-citations, allowing for transparency in the evaluation process.The s-index specifically tracks self-citation patterns over time, providing insights into how these patterns evolve throughout a researcher's career.</p>
<p>B. SCAI Algorithm</p>
<p>The Self-Citation Adjusted Index is calculated using the following algorithm, developed through extensive testing and validation:
SCAI = h − α • (SCR − β) γ • h(1)
Where:</p>
<p>• h is the traditional h-index • SCR is the Self-Citation Ratio (total self-citations divided by total citations)</p>
<p>• α is a field-specific calibration parameter (default: 0.5)</p>
<p>• β is a threshold for acceptable self-citation (default: 0.1, or 10%)</p>
<p>• γ is an exponential parameter that controls the penalty's growth rate (default: 1.5)The algorithm applies a non-linear penalty to the h-index based on the degree to which a researcher's self-citation ratio exceeds the acceptable threshold.This approach offers several methodological advantages that address the limitations of current metrics.</p>
<p>The algorithm allows moderate self-citation without penalty, acknowledging its role in research progression.The threshold parameter β establishes a baseline level of acceptable selfcitation, calibrated to discipline-specific norms.Recent research has shown that these norms vary significantly across fields, with engineering and physical sciences showing higher baseline self-citation rates than humanities [8].The algorithm applies progressively larger adjustments as self-citation rates increase beyond disciplinary norms.The exponential parameter γ ensures that the penalty grows non-linearly with excessive self-citation, reflecting the compounding nature of self-citation effects demonstrated in recent research [11].</p>
<p>Furthermore, the approach maintains proportionality to the original h-index, preserving interpretability.By expressing the adjustment as a proportion of the original h-index, the SCAI retains a clear relationship to the familiar metric while correcting for self-citation distortion.The algorithm can be calibrated for different disciplinary norms through parameter adjustment.The field-specific calibration parameter α allows for customization based on empirical analysis of disciplinespecific self-citation patterns, as documented in recent studies [8].</p>
<p>C. Open-Source Implementation</p>
<p>We have developed and released an open-source Python package, scholar-citations [29], to implement the SCAI and related metrics.The package is available on PyPI [30] and the source code is hosted on GitHub [31].</p>
<p>The implementation provides the following features to support comprehensive citation analysis:</p>
<p>The software enables comprehensive data collection from major citation databases (Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science), ensuring broad coverage of the scholarly literature.Recent updates in 2023 have expanded compatibility with enhanced API access to these platforms.The implementation offers sophisticated identification and classification of selfcitations, using author disambiguation algorithms to accurately identify when researchers cite their own work.This component has been enhanced based on recent advances in author identification methods.</p>
<p>The package calculates traditional metrics (h-index, i10index) and their self-citation-adjusted counterparts, providing a comparative framework for evaluation.The calculations incorporate recent methodological refinements based on bibliometric research from 2022-2023.Field-specific calibration options, including parameter estimation, allow for customization based on disciplinary norms.These calibrations have been updated to reflect recent findings on field-specific self-citation patterns [8].Advanced visualization tools for citation analysis enable intuitive interpretation of results.The visualization capabilities have been enhanced to support comparative analysis across gender, career stage, and discipline.</p>
<p>Export functionality for further analysis and integration with research workflows facilitates broader adoption and integration with institutional assessment processes.</p>
<p>Code Snippet 1 demonstrates the basic usage of the package:

This implementation represents a significant contribution to the field of bibliometrics by providing accessible, open-source tools for calculating and analyzing self-citation-adjusted metrics.The software has been designed with extensibility in mind, allowing future researchers to build upon our work and adapt it to evolving bibliometric standards.</p>
<p>IV. RESULTS</p>
<p>A. Dataset and Methodology</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the SCAI, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of citation data from 5,000 researcher profiles across six disciplinary categories 12 :</p>
<p>Our analysis included 1,200 researchers from Computer Science, representing diverse subfields including artificial intelligence, computer systems, and theoretical computer science.The large sample reflects the growing prominence of computer science in citation analyses.We analyzed data from 1,000 researchers in Life Sciences, encompassing molecular biology, neuroscience, and ecology.This broad category reflects the diverse subdisciplines within the life sciences and their varying citation practices.Our sample included 900 researchers from Physical Sciences, including physics, chemistry, and astronomy.These fields have been shown to have distinct citation patterns in recent bibliometric studies [8].</p>
<p>The dataset incorporated 800 researchers from Social Sciences, spanning economics, psychology, and sociology.Recent research has highlighted unique citation dynamics in these fields that differ from natural sciences [10].We analyzed data from 700 researchers in Engineering, including electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering.Recent studies have shown that engineering fields have some of the highest self-citation rates among all disciplines [8].</p>
<p>The sample included 400 researchers from Humanities, encompassing philosophy, history, and literature.These fields typically show lower overall citation counts but distinct citation patterns that merit separate analysis.For each researcher in our sample, we collected comprehensive bibliometric data to support our analysis.We compiled the complete publication history for each researcher, including temporal patterns that reveal how publication and citation rates evolve over career stages.Recent research has shown that career stage significantly influences self-citation practices [8].</p>
<p>We gathered granular citation counts for each publication, distinguishing between self-citations and external citations.This detailed data allowed us to analyze specific citation patterns at the publication level.We recorded self-citation counts (author citing their own work), applying sophisticated author disambiguation techniques to ensure accurate identification.Recent advances in author identification have improved the precision of these measurements.</p>
<p>We calculated traditional metrics (h-index, i10-index) to establish baseline measures for comparison with our adjusted metrics.These standard metrics remain the most widely used in academic evaluation.</p>
<p>We collected demographic information (where available) including gender and career stage, allowing for analysis of disparities in citation practices.Recent research has highlighted the importance of considering these demographic factors in citation analysis [24].We applied the SCAI algorithm to this 1 Source code available on GitHub: https://github.com/rahvis/scholarcitations 2 Software package available at PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/scholar-citations/dataset using field-specific calibration parameters determined through rigorous preliminary analysis of disciplinary norms.The methodology employed statistical validation techniques to ensure robustness and reliability of results.</p>
<p>B. Impact of Self-Citation on Traditional Metrics</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed significant effects of self-citation on traditional citation metrics.Table I shows the average percentage inflation of h-index across disciplines due to selfcitation.These findings indicate that across all disciplines, traditional h-index values are inflated by an average of 13.9% due to selfcitation, with substantial variation across disciplines.Engineering shows the highest inflation at 18.6%, while Humanities shows the lowest at 7.2%.These differences reflect the varying research cultures and citation practices across academic fields, consistent with recent bibliometric analyses [8].</p>
<p>The discipline-specific patterns align with recent findings from 2023 showing that fields with more experimental and collaborative research tend to have higher self-citation rates.This pattern likely results from the cumulative nature of research in these fields, where researchers build directly on their previous work [8].Our findings further indicate that the inflation effect compounds over time.Researchers with higher baseline citation rates experience greater absolute inflation in their metrics, creating a cumulative advantage that widens disparities in perceived scholarly impact.This compounding effect has significant implications for long-term career trajectories and resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p>C. SCAI Performance</p>
<p>We conducted a comparative analysis of the SCAI against traditional h-index values across the dataset.Fig. 1 shows the distribution of adjustment magnitudes.</p>
<p>For researchers with moderate self-citation rates (SCR ¡ 0.1), the SCAI applies minimal adjustments, differing from the h-index by less than 5%.This pattern reflects the algorithm's design principle that moderate self-citation is a legitimate aspect of research continuity and should not be penalized.Recent bibliometric analyses from 2023 suggest that selfcitation rates below 10% generally reflect normative citation practices rather than strategic behavior [8].For researchers with high self-citation rates (SCR ¿ 0.2), the adjustments are more substantial, with SCAI values up to 25% lower than the traditional h-index.This significant adjustment for excessive self-citation aligns with recent findings suggesting that self-citation rates above 20% often reflect strategic citation behavior rather than natural research progression [8].</p>
<p>The distribution of adjustments shows a peak around 12.5%, corresponding to the most common self-citation patterns in our dataset.This distribution provides a clear visualization of how the SCAI recalibrates traditional metrics across the research ecosystem, with the majority of researchers experiencing moderate adjustments that reflect typical self-citation behavior.The SCAI demonstrates the ability to discriminate between different levels of self-citation behavior while preserving the utility of the metric for researchers who engage in normative citation practices.</p>
<p>This targeted adjustment approach addresses the limitations of binary methods that either include all self-citations or exclude them entirely.</p>
<p>D. Gender Analysis</p>
<p>Our dataset included gender information for 4,200 researchers.Analysis of this subset revealed significant gender differences in self-citation patterns and the impact of applying the SCAI.Table II   These results confirm previous findings [10] that male researchers, on average, have significantly higher self-citation rates than female researchers.Men in our sample had an average Self-Citation Ratio of 0.21, meaning that 21% of citations to their work came from themselves.In contrast, women had an average SCR of 0.12, or 12% self-citations.This disparity aligns with recent studies from 2023-2024 showing persistent gender differences in citation practices [12].The gender difference in self-citation translates directly into differential inflation of citation metrics.The h-index for male researchers was inflated by an average of 17.4% due to self-citation, compared to 10.1% for female researchers.This means that traditional citation metrics systematically advantage male researchers through the mechanism of selfcitation.</p>
<p>When the SCAI is applied, the average citation metric gap between male and female researchers is reduced by approximately 8.5%, suggesting that traditional metrics may systematically disadvantage female researchers due to differences in self-citation behavior.This finding has profound implications for gender equity in academic evaluation and aligns with recent research showing gender disparities in citation patterns [12], [24].Recent studies from 2023-2024 have provided additional context for these disparities.Research has shown that articles authored by women in high-impact medical journals receive fewer citations than those authored by men, with the gap widening when women are both primary and senior authors [24].Our findings suggest that differential self-citation behavior contributes significantly to this citation gap.</p>
<p>The gender disparity in self-citation may reflect broader patterns of differential self-promotion in academia.Recent research suggests that professional norms regarding selfpromotion affect men and women differently, with women potentially facing greater social costs for the same selfpromotion behaviors [11].</p>
<p>E. Career Stage Analysis</p>
<p>We also examined how self-citation patterns and the impact of the SCAI vary by career stage.Researchers were categorized as early-career (less than 10 years since first publication), mid-career (10-20 years), or senior (greater than 20 years).Table III shows the results of this analysis.Intriguingly, early-career researchers show higher selfcitation rates and corresponding h-index inflation compared to senior researchers.Early-career researchers had an average Self-Citation Ratio of 0.19, compared to 0.14 for senior researchers.This finding suggests that the relative impact of selfcitation may be greater during the early stages of a research career, potentially exacerbating the challenges faced by earlycareer researchers in establishing their scholarly reputation.Recent research from 2023 has confirmed this pattern across multiple disciplines [8].The higher self-citation rates among early-career researchers may reflect several factors.First, early-career researchers often work within narrower research domains, making self-citation more likely as they build upon their previous work.Second, the pressure to demonstrate impact may lead to higher self-citation rates among this cohort.Recent studies suggest that increasing competition for academic positions and funding has intensified publication pressures, particularly for early-career researchers [11].</p>
<p>The career stage analysis also revealed that the impact of self-citation on perceived scholarly influence evolves over time.While the absolute number of self-citations may increase with career length as researchers accumulate more publications, the relative proportion of self-citations tends to decrease.This pattern suggests that as researchers establish their reputation, external citations become a larger proportion of their total citations, diminishing the relative impact of selfcitation.These findings have significant implications for career development and evaluation policies.Traditional citation metrics may disproportionately advantage researchers who engage in higher rates of self-citation early in their careers, potentially creating cumulative advantages that persist throughout their academic trajectory.</p>
<p>The SCAI provides a mechanism to mitigate these effects, creating a more level playing field across career stages.</p>
<p>V. DISCUSSION</p>
<p>A. Implications for Research Evaluation</p>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that traditional citation metrics can be significantly inflated by self-citation, with an average h-index inflation of 13.9% across disciplines.This inflation varies systematically by field, gender, and career stage, creating entrenched biases in research evaluation that have farreaching consequences for the academic ecosystem.</p>
<p>The introduction of the SCAI offers several advantages for research evaluation that address these systematic biases.By adjusting for self-citation patterns, the SCAI provides a more accurate representation of external recognition and impact.This is particularly important for high-stakes evaluations such as tenure reviews, grant applications, and institutional assessments.The increasing reliance on quantitative metrics in academic evaluation necessitates that these metrics accurately reflect scholarly influence rather than self-promotion strategies.Recent research from 2023-2024 has reinforced the importance of addressing gender disparities in citation metrics.Our results show that applying the SCAI reduces the average citation metric gap between male and female researchers by approximately 8.5%.This suggests that selfcitation-adjusted metrics could help address gender disparities in academic evaluation and recognition.Given the persistent underrepresentation of women in many academic fields, particularly at senior levels, metrics that reduce systematic bias become increasingly important for achieving gender equity in academia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, recent studies have shown that women experience a systematic disadvantage in citation counts, with articles authored by women receiving fewer citations than those authored by men, particularly when women are both primary and senior authors [12], [24].By addressing one mechanism through which gender disparities in citations arise-differential self-citation behavior-the SCAI contributes to more equitable evaluation practices.The SCAI framework allows for field-specific calibration parameters, acknowledging the variation in self-citation norms across disciplines.This makes the metric suitable for both withinfield and cross-field comparisons, addressing one of the major limitations of traditional citation metrics.The ability to calibrate the metric for different disciplinary contexts enhances its utility for institutional and funding agency evaluations, as demonstrated by recent bibliometric analyses of field-specific citation patterns [8].</p>
<p>B. Financial Implications</p>
<p>The financial implications of citation metric inflation are substantial and warrant serious consideration.Research funding decisions often consider citation metrics as indicators of impact and potential [19].If traditional metrics are inflated by an average of 13.9%, and this inflation affects funding allocations even partially, the misallocation of research funds could be significant.Recent analyses from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) indicate that citation-based metrics significantly influence funding decisions [20].With annual research funding in the United States exceeding $100 billion [9], even a modest misallocation due to distorted metrics could significantly impact research advancement and innovation.</p>
<p>Consider the following scenario based on recent funding allocation patterns:</p>
<p>• Annual research funding in the U.S. exceeds $100 billion [9] • Approximately 50% of this funding is allocated with some consideration of citation metrics [19] • If metric inflation leads to a 10% misallocation within that portion, the result would be approximately $5 billion annually being allocated based on inflated impact metrics rather than genuine scholarly influence This scenario is not merely theoretical.Recent studies examining the relationship between citations per dollar in research funding have demonstrated that funding allocation decisions significantly influence research productivity and impact [32].When funding decisions are influenced by inflated metrics, the consequences ripple throughout the research ecosystem.The financial impact extends beyond direct research funding.Career advancement, salary decisions, and institutional resource allocation all frequently reference citation metrics.When these metrics are systematically distorted by self-citation patterns, the cumulative economic effect multiplies.Recent analyses of resource allocation patterns in academia suggest that citationbased evaluations influence billions in institutional investment decisions beyond direct research grants [33].</p>
<p>The SCAI provides a more robust metric for funding decisions, potentially leading to more effective allocation of research resources.By rewarding external recognition rather than self-promotion, funding agencies can better identify promising researchers and projects that have demonstrated impact beyond their originators.This realignment of incentives could have profound effects on the research ecosystem, directing resources toward work with broader influence and applications.Recent implementations of citation-adjusted funding metrics at several research institutions have shown promising preliminary results, with resources being distributed more equitably across gender and career stages when self-citation effects are accounted for [11].These early implementations provide a model for broader adoption of self-citation adjusted metrics in funding decisions.</p>
<p>C. Implementation Challenges</p>
<p>While the SCAI offers significant advantages, its implementation faces several challenges that must be addressed for widespread adoption:</p>
<p>Accurate calculation of the SCAI requires comprehensive citation data, including the ability to identify self-citations.Access to such data may be limited or inconsistent across different citation databases and platforms.Recent initiatives such as the Initiative for Open Citations have improved data accessibility, but challenges remain in standardizing citation data formats and ensuring comprehensive coverage [34].The academic community has invested heavily in traditional metrics, both culturally and technically.Shifting to new metrics requires overcoming institutional inertia and convincing stakeholders of the benefits of change.This resistance is not merely technical but reflects deeper questions about how we value and evaluate research.Recent surveys of academic administrators reveal significant attachment to traditional metrics despite recognition of their limitations [35].</p>
<p>Determining appropriate calibration parameters (α, β, γ) for different fields requires careful analysis of disciplinary norms and citation patterns.This calibration process must be transparent and empirically grounded to ensure acceptance.Recent field-specific analyses provide a foundation for these calibrations, but ongoing research will be needed to refine these parameters as citation practices evolve [8].</p>
<p>Any metric can potentially be gamed.While the SCAI addresses one form of metric manipulation (excessive selfcitation), other strategies may emerge.Ongoing monitoring and refinement will be necessary to maintain the integrity of the metric.The co-evolution of metrics and strategic responses represents a continuing challenge for bibliometrics.Recent analyses of evaluation system gaming suggest that comprehensive approaches combining multiple metrics offer the greatest resistance to manipulation [5].Despite these challenges, the benefits of implementing self-citation-adjusted metrics like the SCAI outweigh the costs, particularly given the significant implications for research evaluation and funding allocation.The academic community's increasing focus on responsible metrics, as evidenced by initiatives such as the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) and the Leiden Manifesto, suggests that the time is ripe for such innovations [19].</p>
<p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This paper has introduced the Self-Citation Adjusted Index (SCAI), a novel citation metric designed to provide a more accurate and equitable assessment of scholarly impact by adjusting for self-citation patterns.Our comprehensive analysis of 5,000 researcher profiles across diverse disciplines demonstrates that:</p>
<p>• Traditional citation metrics are inflated by an average of 13.9% due to self-citation, with substantial variation across disciplines, gender, and career stages</p>
<p>• Men self-cite at significantly higher rates than women (21% vs. 12%), creating systematic advantages in traditional citation metrics</p>
<p>• The SCAI reduces gender disparities in citation metrics by approximately 8.5%, offering a more equitable evaluation framework</p>
<p>• The potential financial impact of metric inflation is substantial, potentially affecting billions in research funding allocations Recent studies from 2023-2024 have reinforced these findings, showing persistent patterns of self-citation disparities across disciplines and demographics [8], [12].The gender disparities in citation patterns revealed in recent research highlight the urgency of addressing these systematic biases in research evaluation [24].Our open-source implementation provides accessible tools for calculating and analyzing selfcitation-adjusted metrics, contributing to the growing movement toward more transparent and fair research evaluation methods.This work sits at the intersection of bibliometrics, science policy, and research ethics, with implications for how we understand and reward scholarly contribution.</p>
<p>A. Future Work</p>
<p>Several directions for future work emerge from this research, informed by recent developments in bibliometrics and research evaluation:</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies to track the evolution of self-citation patterns and their impact over time, particularly as awareness of these issues increases.Recent analyses suggest that citation patterns are dynamic and respond to changing evaluation standards [8], highlighting the importance of temporal studies.Integration of the SCAI with other complementary metrics, such as field-normalized citation indicators, to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.Recent innovations in bibliometrics emphasize the importance of multi-dimensional assessment approaches that consider diverse aspects of research impact [26].</p>
<p>Expansion of the current implementation to support additional data sources and visualization options, enhancing usability for different stakeholders.Recent advances in data visualization techniques offer opportunities to improve the interpretability and accessibility of citation metrics [34].Development of guidelines for the appropriate use and interpretation of self-citation-adjusted metrics, particularly for funding agencies and promotion committees.Recent policy initiatives in research assessment emphasize the importance of contextspecific implementation guidance [19].</p>
<p>Investigation of potential gaming behaviors that may emerge in response to the adoption of new metrics, and development of countermeasures.Recent research on metric manipulation suggests that proactive consideration of strategic responses can enhance the robustness of evaluation systems [5].Implementation trials with funding agencies to assess the practical impact of using self-citation adjusted metrics in resource allocation decisions.Recent pilot programs with adjusted citation metrics provide models for such implementation studies [11].</p>
<p>B. Final Remarks</p>
<p>Citation metrics serve as essential tools for research evaluation, but their limitations must be acknowledged and addressed.The SCAI represents a step toward more robust, equitable assessment of scholarly impact.By adjusting for selfcitation patterns, the SCAI provides a more accurate reflection of external recognition and influence, potentially leading to fairer evaluation practices and more effective allocation of research resources.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the scientific community, including the increasing adoption of responsible research assessment principles [19] and growing awareness of gender disparities in academic recognition [12], create a favorable environment for the implementation of more equitable citation metrics.The SCAI addresses a specific mechanism through which these disparities are perpetuated and offers a practical solution that builds on familiar evaluation frameworks.As the academic community continues to refine its approach to research assessment, metrics like the SCAI can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of scholarly impact, one that values external validation over self-promotion and rewards genuine contribution to the advancement of knowledge.After three decades of studying citation patterns and their implications, I am convinced that such refinements are essential for the health and integrity of our research ecosystem and for ensuring that we allocate our limited research resources to truly impactful work.</p>
