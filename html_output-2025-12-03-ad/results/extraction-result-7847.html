                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where it is demonstrated that short universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to deceive judge LLMs to predict inflated scores.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful zero-shot assessors used in real-world situations such as assessing written exams and benchmarking systems. Despite these critical applications, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs to adversarial manipulation. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we demonstrate that short universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to deceive judge LLMs to predict inflated scores. Since adversaries may not know or have access to the judge-LLMs, we propose a simple surrogate attack where a surrogate model is first attacked, and the learned attack phrase then transferred to unknown judge-LLMs. We propose a practical algorithm to determine the short universal attack phrases and demonstrate that when transferred to unseen models, scores can be drastically inflated such that irrespective of the assessed text, maximum scores are predicted. It is found that judge-LLMs are significantly more susceptible to these adversarial attacks when used for absolute scoring, as opposed to comparative assessment. Our findings raise concerns on the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge methods, and emphasize the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in LLM assessment methods before deployment in high-stakes real-world scenarios.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful zero-shot assessors used in real-world situations such as assessing written exams and benchmarking systems. Despite these critical applications, no existing work has analyzed the vulnerability of judge-LLMs to adversarial manipulation. This work presents the first study on the adversarial robustness of assessment LLMs, where we demonstrate that short universal adversarial phrases can be concatenated to deceive judge LLMs to predict inflated scores. Since adversaries may not know or have access to the judge-LLMs, we propose a simple surrogate attack where a surrogate model is first attacked, and the learned attack phrase then transferred to unknown judge-LLMs. We propose a practical algorithm to determine the short universal attack phrases and demonstrate that when transferred to unseen models, scores can be drastically inflated such that irrespective of the assessed text, maximum scores are predicted. It is found that judge-LLMs are significantly more susceptible to these adversarial attacks when used for absolute scoring, as opposed to comparative assessment. Our findings raise concerns on the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge methods, and emphasize the importance of addressing vulnerabilities in LLM assessment methods before deployment in highstakes real-world scenarios. ${ }^{1}$</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be proficient zero-shot assessors, capable of evaluating texts without requiring any domain-specific training (Zheng et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023a). Typical zero-shot approaches prompt powerful LLMs to either generate a single quality score of the assessed text (Wang et al.,</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: A simple universal adversarial attack phrase can be concatenated to a candidate response to fool an LLM assessment system into predicting that it is of higher quality. The illustration shows the universal attack in the comparative and absolute assessment setup.</p>
<p>2023a; Liu et al., 2023b) or to use pairwise comparisons to determine which of two texts are better (Liusie et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023). These zeroshot approaches mark a compelling new paradigm for assessment, enabling straightforward referencefree evaluation that correlates highly with human judgements, while being applicable to a range of diverse attributes. There has consequently been a surge of leveraging LLM-as-a-judge in many applications, including as benchmarks for assessing new models (Zheng et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023b) or as tools for assessing the written examinations of real candidates.</p>
<p>Despite the clear advantages of zero-shot LLM assessment methods, the limitations and robustness of LLM-as-a-judge have been less well-studied. Previous works have demonstrated potential limitations in robustness, and the presence of biases such as positional bias (Wang et al., 2023b; Liusie et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023b), length bias (Koo et al., 2023) and self-preferential behaviours (Zheng et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023d). This paper pushes this paradigm further by investigating whether appending a simple universal phrase to the end of an as-</p>
<p>sessed text could deceive an LLM into predicting high scores regardless of the text's quality. Such approaches not only pose challenges for model evaluation, where adversaries may manipulate benchmark metrics, but also raise concerns about academic integrity, as students may employ similar tactics to cheat and attain higher scores.</p>
<p>This work is the first to propose adversarial attacks (Szegedy et al., 2014) targeting zero-shot LLM assessment. In practical settings, the adversary may either not have any knowledge of the judge-LLMs, access to the model weights, or be limited in the number of queries that can be made to the model (due to costs or suspicion from excessive querying). Therefore, we learn the attack phrase while using a surrogate model (Papernot et al., 2016) and transfer the universal attack phrase to other judge-LLMs. We demonstrate that universal attack phrases learned with access only to FlanT5-3B model, a small encoder-decoder transformer, can transfer to larger decoder-only models and cause Llama2-7B, Mistral-7B and ChatGPT to return the maximum score, irrespective of the input text. We find that LLM-scoring (as opposed to pairwise LLM-comparative assessment) can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks, and concatenating a universal phrase of just 5 tokens can trick these systems into providing highly increased assessment scores. Additionally, we find that comparative assessment is more robust than LLM-scoring to such adversarial attacks, although the direct attacks on the surrogate model can yield marginally inflated scores. Finally, as an initial step towards defending against such attacks, we use the perplexity score (Jain et al., 2023) as a simple detection approach, which demonstrates some success. As a whole, our work raises awareness of the vulnerabilities of zero-shot LLM assessment, and highlights that if such systems are to be deployed in critical real-world scenarios, adversarial vulnerabilities should be considered and addressed.</p>
<h2>2 Related Work</h2>
<p>Bespoke NLG Evaluation. For Natural Language Generation tasks such as summarization or translation, traditional assessment metrics evaluate generated texts relative to gold standard manual references (Lin, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Zhang et al., 2019). These methods, however, tend to correlate weakly with human assessments. Following work designed automatic evaluation system
systems for particular domains and attributes. Examples include systems for dialogue assessment (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020), question answering systems for summary consistency (Wang et al., 2020; Manakul et al., 2023), boolean answering systems for general summary assessment (Zhong et al., 2022a) or neural frameworks for machine translation (Rei et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Zero-Shot Assessment with LLMs. Although suitable for particular domains, these automatic evaluation methods cannot be applied to more general and unseen settings. With the rapidly improving ability of instruction-following LLMs, various works have proposed zero-shot approaches. These include prompting LLMs to provide absolute assessment scores (Wang et al., 2023a; Liu et al., 2023b), comparing pairs of texts (Liusie et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023) or through leveraging assigned output language model probabilities ( Fu et al., 2023), and in some cases demonstrating state-of-the-art correlations and outperforming performance of bespoke evaluation methods.</p>
<h2>Adversarial Attacks on Generative Systems.</h2>
<p>Traditionally, NLP attack literature focuses on attacking classification tasks (Alzantot et al., 2018; Garg and Ramakrishnan, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019). However, with the emergence of generative LLMs (Zhao et al., 2023), there has been discussion around NLG adversarial attacks. A range of approaches seek to jailbreak LLMs, and circumvent inherent alignment to generate harmful content (Carlini et al., 2023). Attacks can be categorized as input text perturbation optimization (Zou et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2024; Lapid et al., 2023); automated adversarial prompt learning (Mehrotra et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Chao et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2024); human adversarial prompt learning (Wei et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023c); or model configuration manipulation (Huang et al., 2024). Beyond jailbreaking, other works look to extract sensitive data from LLMs (Nasr et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2020), provoke misclassification (Zhu et al., 2023a) or trick translation systems into making a change in perception (Raina and Gales, 2023; Sadrizadeh et al., 2023). For assessment, although early research has explored attacking NLP assessment systems (Raina et al., 2020), there has been no work on developing attacks for general LLM assessment models such as prompting LLama and GPT, and we are the first</p>
<p>to conduct such a study.</p>
<h2>3 Zero-shot Assessment with LLMs</h2>
<p>As discussed by Zhu et al. (2023b); Liusie et al. (2023), there are two standard reference-free methods of prompting instruction-tuned LLMs for quality assessment:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLM Comparative Assessment where the system uses pairwise comparisons to determine which of two responses are better.</li>
<li>LLM Scoring where an LLM is asked to assign an absolute score to each considered text.</li>
</ul>
<p>For various assessment methods, we consider rankings tasks where given a query context $\mathbf{d}$ and a set of $N$ responses $\mathbf{x}<em 1:="1:" N="N">{1: N}$, the objective is to determine the quality of each response, $s</em>$ of the text's true quality. This section will further discuss the details of both comparative assessment (Section 3.1) and absolute assessment (Section 3.2).}$. An effective LLM judge should predict scores for each candidate that match the ranking $r_{1: N</p>
<h3>3.1 Comparative Assessment</h3>
<p>An LLM prompted for comparative assessment, $\mathcal{F}$, can be used to determine the probability that the first candidate is better than the second. Given the context $\mathbf{d}$ and two candidate responses, $\mathbf{x}<em j="j">{i}$ and $\mathbf{x}</em>}$, to account for positional bias (Liusie et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b) one can run comparisons over both orderings and average the probabilities to predict the probability that response $\mathbf{x<em j="j">{i}$ is better than response $\mathbf{x}</em>$,</p>
<p>$$
p_{i j}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathcal{F}\left(\mathbf{x}<em j="j">{i}, \mathbf{x}</em>}, \mathbf{d}\right)+\left(1-\mathcal{F}\left(\mathbf{x<em i="i">{j}, \mathbf{x}</em>\right)\right)\right)
$$}, \mathbf{d</p>
<p>Note that by doing two inference passes of the model, symmetry is ensured such that $p_{i j}=1-p_{j i}$ for all $i, j \in{1, \ldots, N}$. The average comparative probability for each option $\mathbf{x}<em n="n">{n}$ can then be used as the predicted quality score $\hat{s}</em>$,</p>
<p>$$
\hat{s}<em n="n">{n}=\hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x}</em>
$$}\right)=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} p_{n j</p>
<p>which can be converted to ranks $\hat{r}<em 1:="1:" N="N">{1: N}$, that can be evaluated against the true ranks $r</em>$.</p>
<h3>3.2 Absolute Scoring Assessment</h3>
<p>In LLM absolute scoring, the LLM, $\mathcal{F}$, is prompted to directly predict the assessment score. The
prompt is designed to request the LLM to assess the quality of a text with a score (e.g. between 1-5). Two variants of scoring can be applied; first where the score is directly predicted by the LLM,</p>
<p>$$
\hat{s}<em n="n">{n}=\hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x}</em>\right)
$$}\right)=\mathcal{F}\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathbf{d</p>
<p>Alternatively, following G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023b), if the output logits are accessible one can estimate the expected score through a fair-average by multiplying each score by its normalized probability,</p>
<p>$$
\hat{s}<em n="n">{n}=\hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x}</em>\right)
$$}\right)=\sum_{k=1: K} k P_{\mathcal{F}}\left(k \mid \mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathbf{d</p>
<p>where $K$ is the maximum score, as indicated in the prompt, and the probability for each possible score $k \in{1, \ldots, K}$ is normalized to satisfy basic probability rules, $\sum_{k} P_{\mathcal{F}}\left(k \mid \mathbf{x}<em _mathcal_F="\mathcal{F">{n}, \mathbf{c}\right)=1$ and $P</em>\right) \geq 0, \forall n$.}}\left(k \mid \mathbf{x}_{n}, \mathbf{c</p>
<h2>4 Adversarial Assessment Attacks</h2>
<h3>4.1 Attack Threat Model</h3>
<p>Objective. For typical adversarial attacks, an adversary aims to minimally modify the input text $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow \mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\delta}$ in an attempt to manipulate the system's response. The adversarial example $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ is a small perturbation on the input $\mathbf{x}$, designed to cause a significant change in the output prediction of the system, $\mathcal{F}$,</p>
<p>$$
\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\delta}) \neq \mathcal{F}(\mathbf{x})
$$</p>
<p>The small perturbation, $+\boldsymbol{\delta}$, is constrained to have a small difference in the input text space, measured by a proxy function of human perception, $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\delta}) \leq \epsilon$. Our work considers applying simple concatenative attacks to assessment LLMs, where a phrase $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ of length $L \ll|\mathbf{x}|$ is added to the original text $\mathbf{x}$,</p>
<p>$$
\mathbf{x}+\boldsymbol{\delta}=x_{1}, \ldots, x_{|\mathbf{x}|}, \delta_{1}, \ldots, \delta_{L}
$$</p>
<p>The attack objective is to then maximally improve the rank of the attacked candidate response with respect to the other candidates. Let $\hat{r}<em i="i">{i}^{\prime}$ represent the rank of the attacked response, $\mathbf{x}</em>}+\boldsymbol{\delta}$, when no other response in $\mathbf{x<em i="i">{1: N}$ is perturbed,
$\hat{r}</em>}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{\delta})=\operatorname{rank<em 1="1">{i}\left(\hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x}</em>}\right), \ldots, \hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x<em N="N">{i}+\boldsymbol{\delta}\right), \ldots, \hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x}</em>\right)\right)$
The adversarial objective is to minimize the predicted rank of candidate $i$ (i.e. the attacked sample) relative to the other unattacked candidates,</p>
<p>$$
\boldsymbol{\delta}<em i="i">{i}^{*}=\underset{\boldsymbol{\delta}}{\arg \min }\left(\hat{r}</em>)\right)
$$}^{\prime}(\boldsymbol{\delta</p>
<p>Universal Attack. In an assessment setting, it is impractical for adversaries to learn an adversarial example $\boldsymbol{\delta}<em i="i">{i}^{<em>}$ for each candidate response $\mathbf{x}_{i}$. Much more practical is to use a universal adversarial example $\boldsymbol{\delta}^{</em>}$ that could be applied to any candidate's response $\mathbf{x}</em>}$ to consistently boost the predicted assessment rank. Assuming a training set of $M$ samples of contexts and $N$ candidate responses per context, $\left{\left(\mathbf{d}^{(m)}, \mathbf{x<em m="1">{1: N}^{(m)}\right)\right}</em>$ is the one that most improves the expected rank when attacking each candidate in turn,}^{M}$, the optimal universal adversarial example $\boldsymbol{\delta}^{*</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{r}(\boldsymbol{\delta}) &amp; =\frac{1}{N M} \sum_{m} \sum_{n} \bar{r}_{a}^{(m)}(\boldsymbol{\delta}) \
\boldsymbol{\delta}^{*} &amp; =\underset{\boldsymbol{\delta}}{\arg \min }(\bar{r}(\boldsymbol{\delta}))
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where the average is computed over all $M$ contexts and $N$ candidates.</p>
<p>Surrogate Model Transfer Attack. Traditional adversarial attack methods often assume full access to the target model, but this setting might be unrealistic when attacking assessment systems. Hence, we consider the more practical scenario where the adversary only has full access to a surrogate model that differs from the actual judge-LLM used by the assessment system. The attack can be learned on the surrogate model and then transferred to the target model as initially proposed by Liu et al. (2016); Papernot et al. (2016). The assumption is that due to possible similarities in training data, training recipes and model architectures, the attacks may transfer reasonably to the target model.</p>
<h3>4.2 Practical Attack Approach</h3>
<p>In this work, we use a simple greedy search to learn the universal attack phrase ${ }^{2}$. For a vocabulary, $\mathcal{V}$ the greedy search finds the most effective adversarial word to append iteratively,</p>
<p>$$
\delta_{l+1}^{<em>}=\underset{\delta \in \mathcal{V}}{\arg \min }\left(\bar{r}\left(\delta_{1: l}^{</em>}+\delta\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>In practice, it may be computationally too expensive to compute the average rank (as specified in Equation 8). Therefore, we instead approximate the search by greedily finding the token that maximises the expected score when appended to the</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>current sample,</p>
<p>$$
\delta_{l+1}^{<em>}=\underset{\delta}{\arg \max } \mathbb{E}<em 1:="1:" l="l">{\mathbf{x}}\left[\hat{s}\left(\mathbf{x}+\delta</em>^{</em>}+\delta\right)\right]
$$</p>
<p>The algorithm for the practical greedy search attack on comparative assessment and absolute assessment systems is given in Algorithm 1.</p>

<h2>5 Experimental Setup</h2>
<h3>5.1 Datasets</h3>
<p>We run experiments on two standard language generation evaluation benchmark datasets. The first dataset used is SummEval (Fabbri et al., 2021), which is a summary evaluation benchmark of 100 passages, with 16 machine-generated summaries per passage. Each summary is evaluated by human assessors on coherency ( COH ), consistency (CON), fluency (FLU) and relevance (REL). These attributes can be combined into an overall score</p>
<p>(OVE), which is the average of all the individual attributes. The second dataset is TopicalChat (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2019), which is a benchmark for dialogue evaluation. There are 60 dialogue contexts, where each context has 6 different machine-generated responses. The responses are assessed by human evaluators on coherency $(\mathrm{COH})$, continuity (CNT), engagingness (ENG), naturalness (NAT), where again the overall score (OVE) can be computed as the average of the individual attributes.</p>
<h3>5.2 LLM Assessment Systems</h3>
<p>We consider a range of standard instruction-tuned generative language models that can be used as judge-LLMs: FlanT5-xl (3B parameters) (Chung et al., 2022), Llama2-7B-chat (Touvron et al., 2023), Mistral-7B-chat (Jiang et al., 2023), and GPT3.5. FlanT5-xl, the smallest and the only encoder-decoder system, is used as the surrogate model for learning the universal adversarial attack phrases for both comparative and absolute assessment. Once the attack phrases are learned on FlanT5-xl, they are transferred to the other target LLMs to evaluate their effectiveness. Our prompts for comparative assessment follow the prompts used in Liusie et al. (2023), where different attributes use different adjectives in the prompt. For absolute assessment, we follow the prompts of GEval (Liu et al., 2023b) and use continuous scores (Equation 4) by calculating the expected score over a score range (e.g., 1-5 normalized by their probabilities). Note that the GPT3.5 API does not provide token probabilities, so for GPT3.5, we use standard prompts without token probability normalization.</p>
<h3>5.3 Methodology</h3>
<p>Each dataset is split into a development set and a test set following a 20:80 ratio. We use the development set ( $20 \%$ of the passages) to learn the attack phrase using a simple greedy search to maximize the expected score of the attacked samples and evaluate using the test set ( $80 \%$ of the passages). Furthermore, we only use two of the candidate texts to learn the attacks (i.e., 2 of 16 for SummEval and 2 of 6 for TopicalChat), and therefore perform the search over a modest total of 40 summaries for SummEval and 24 responses for TopicalChat.</p>
<p>For each dataset and attribute, we perform a separate universal concatenation attack using the notation (TASK ASSESSMENT ATTRIBUTE) to
indicate the task (SummEval, TopicalChat), the assessment method (comparative, scoring), and the evaluation attribute (overall, consistency, continuity) for each learned universal attack phrase ${ }^{3}$. E.g., SUMM-COMP-OVE denotes the phrase learned for comparative assessment when attacking the SummEval overall score.</p>
<p>We learn a single universal attack phrase on the surrogate model, FlanT5-xl, for all experiments in the main paper. Once the universal attack phrases are learned on the surrogate model, the attack is further assessed when transferred to the other target models: Mistral-7B, Llama2-7B, and GPT3.5. The vocabulary for the greedy attack is sourced from the NLTK python package ${ }^{4}$.</p>
<h3>5.4 Attack Evaluation</h3>
<p>To assess the success of an attack phrase, and for comparing the performance between comparative and absolute, we calculate the average rank of each candidate after an attack is applied (Equation 8). An unsuccessful attack will yield a rank near the average rank, while a very strong attack will provide an average rank of 1 (where each attacked candidate is assumed to be the best of all unattacked candidates of the context).</p>

Smaller LLMs (FlanT5-xl, Llama2-7b and Mistral-7b) demonstrate reasonable performance on SummEval and TopicalChat, but larger models (GPT3.5) perform much better, and when applying absolute scoring can outperform smaller systems using comparative assessment.</p>
<h3>6.2 Attack on Surrogate Model</h3>
<p>Section 5.3 details the attack approach to learn the universal attack phrases for the surrogate model. Figure 2 illustrates the impact of the universal adversarial on SummEval and TopicalChat, where FlanT5-xl is used as the surrogate LLM assessment system. For Summeval, the overall score (OVE) and consistency (CON) is attacked while for Topical-Chat the overall score (OVE) and continuity (CNT) is attacked. The attributes CON and CNT were selected due to the similar performance for these attributes in the absolute and comparative settings (seen in Tables 1 and 2).</p>
<p>The success of the adversarial attacks is measured by the average ranks of the text after an attack. Figure 2 demonstrates that both comparative assess-</p>

ment and absolute assessment systems have some vulnerability to adversarial attacks, as the average rank decreases, and continues to decrease as more words are added to the attack phrase. However, absolute scoring systems are significantly more susceptible to universal adversarial attacks, and with just four universal attack words, the absolute scoring system will consistently provide a rank of 1 to nearly all input texts. Table 3 provides the raw scores for comparative and absolute assessment, where we see that for absolute assessment, a universal attack phrase of 4 words will yield assessment scores on average near the maximum score of 5 . The specific universal attack phrases learnt for each task are given in Appendix A.</p>
<p>The relative robustness of comparative assessment systems over absolute assessment systems can perhaps be explained intuitively. In an absolute assessment setting, an adversary exploits an input space which is not well understood by the model and identifies a region that spuriously encourages the model to predict a high score. However, in comparative assessment, the model is forced to compare the quality of the attacked text to another</p>

<p>(unattacked) text, meaning the attack phrase learnt has to be invariant to the text used for comparison. This makes it more challenging to find an effective universal attack phrase. Further explanations for the relative robustness of comparative assessment systems are explored in Appendix B.</p>
<h3>6.3 Transferability of the Surrogate Attack</h3>
<p>Figure 2 demonstrated that absolute assessment systems are highly vulnerable to a simple universal attack phrase concatenated to an input text. To evaluate the effectiveness of these attack phrases on more powerful target models, we explicitly transfer the attacks learned on the FlanT5-xl surrogate model to other models such as Llama2, Mistral and GPT3.5. We focus on transferring the absolute scoring attacks, as comparative assessments were found to be relatively robust for the surrogate FlanT5-xl model. Figure 3 shows the results of transferring the attack phrases to these models, highlighting several key findings: 1) There can be a high level of attack transferability for absolute scoring. For TopicalChat, the attacks generalize very well to nearly all systems, with all systems being very susceptible to attacks when assessing continuity. 2) When more powerful models assess the <em>overall</em> (OVE) quality, the transferability is less effective, suggesting that assessing more general, abstract qualities can be more robust. Interestingly, powerful large models (GPT3.5) are more susceptible when attacked by shorter phrases, possibly because longer phrases may begin to overfit the properties of the surrogate model. 3) The attack transfers with mixed success for SummEval, which may highlight that the complexity of the dataset can influence attack transferability.</p>
<h3>6.4 Attack Detection</h3>
<p>In this section, we perform an initial investigation into possible defences that could be applied to detect if an adversary is exploiting a system. Defences can take two forms: adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015) where the LLM is re-trained with adversarial examples, or adversarial attack detection where a separate module is designed to identify adversarial inputs. Although recent LLM adversarial training approaches have been proposed (Zhou et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2023b), re-training is computationally expensive and can harm model performance, hence detection is preferred. Recent detection approaches for NLG adversarial attacks tend to focus on attacks that circumvent LLM safety filters, e.g., generating malicious content by jailbreaking (Liu et al., 2023c; Zou et al., 2023; Jin et al., 2024). Robey et al. (2023) propose SmoothLLM, where multiple versions of the perturbed input are passed to an LLM and the outputs aggregated. Such defences are inappropriate for LLM-as-a-judge setups, as though the perturbations are designed to cause no semantic change, they can result in changes in other attributes, such as fluency and style, which will impact the LLM assessment. Similarly, Jain et al. (2023); Kumar et al. (2024) propose defence approaches that involve some form of paraphrasing or filtering of the input sequence, which again interferes with the LLM-as-a-judge scores.</p>
<p>A simple and valid defence approach for LLM-as-a-judge is to use perplexity to detect adversarial examples (Jain et al., 2023; Raina et al., 2020). The perplexity is a measure of how unnatural a model, θ finds a sentence x,</p>
<p>$$
\text{perp} = -\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}|} \log(P_{\theta}(\mathbf{x})).
$$</p>
<p><img alt="img-3.jpeg" src="img-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Precision-Recall curve when applying perplexity as a detection defence</p>
<p>We use the <em>base</em> Mistral-7B model to compute perplexity. Adversarially attacked samples are expected to be less natural and have higher perplexity. Therefore, we can evaluate the detection performance using precision and recall. We select a specific threshold, β to classify an input sample <strong>x</strong> as clean or adversarial, where if perp &gt; β the sample would be classified as adversarial. The precision, recall and F1 is then</p>
<p>$$P = \frac{TP}{TP+FP} \quad R = \frac{TP}{TP+FN} \quad F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{P \cdot R}{P+R},$$</p>
<p>where FP, TP and FN are standard counts for False-Positive, True-Positive and False-Negative respectively. The F1 can be used as a single-value summary of detection performance.</p>
<p>To assess detection, we evaluate on the test split of each dataset, augmented with the universal attack phrase concatenated to each text, such that there is balance between clean and adversarial examples. Figure 4 presents precision-recall (p-r) curves for perplexity detection as the threshold β is swept, for the different universal adversarial phrases. Table 4 gives the best F1 scores from the p-r curves. For SummEval all the F1 scores are near 0.7 or significantly above, whilst for TopicalChat the performance is generally even better. This demonstrates that perplexity is fairly effective in disentangling clean and adversarial samples for attacks on LLM-as-a-judge. However, Zhou et al. (2024) argue that defence approaches such as perplexity detection can be circumvented by adaptive adversarial attacks. Hence, though perplexity gives a promising starting point as a defence strategy, future work will explore other more sophisticated detection approaches. Nevertheless, it can also be concluded from the findings in this work that an effective defence against the most threatening adversarial attacks on LLM-as-a-judge is to use comparative assessment over absolute scoring, despite an increased computational cost.</p>

<h2>7 Conclusions</h2>
<p>This is the first work to examine the adversarial robustness of zero-shot LLM assessment methods against universal adversarial attacks, and reveal significant vulnerabilities in LLM absolute scoring and mild vulnerabilities in LLM comparative assessment. We demonstrate that the same short 4-word universal adversarial can be appended to any input text to deceive LLM assessment system into predicting inflated scores. Notably, LLM-scoring attacks developed with a smaller surrogate LLM-scoring system can be effectively transferred to larger LLMs such as ChatGPT. We also provide an initial investigation into simple detection approaches, and show that perplexity can be a promising tool for identifying adversarially manipulated inputs. Further work can explore adaptive attacks and more sophisticated defence approaches to minimize the risk of misuse. On the whole, this paper raises awareness around the susceptibility of LLM-as-a-judge NLG assessment systems to universal and transferable adversarial attacks.</p>
<h2>8 Limitations</h2>
<p>This paper investigates the vulnerability of LLM-as-a-judge methods in settings where malicious entities may wish to trick systems into returning inflated assessment scores. As the first work on the adversarial robustness of LLM assessment, we used simple attacks (concatenation attack found through a greedy search) which led to simple defences (perplexity). Future work can investigate methods of achieving more subtle attacks, which may require more complex defences to detect. Further, this work focuses on attacking zero-shot assessment methods, however, it is possible to use LLM assessment in few-shot settings, which may be more robust and render attacks less effective. Future work can explore this direction, and also investigate designing prompts that are more robust to attacks.</p>
<h2>9 Risks \&amp; Ethics</h2>
<p>This work reports on the topic of adversarial attacks, where it's shown that a universal adversarial attack can fool NLG assessment systems into inflating scores of assessed texts. The methods and attacks proposed in this paper do not encourage any harmful content generation and the aim of the work is to raise awareness of the risk of adversarial manipulation for zero-shot NLG assessment. It is possible that highlighting these susceptibilities may inform adversaries of this vulnerability, however, we hope that raising awareness of these risks will encourage the community to further study the robustness of zero-shot LLM assessment methods and reduce the risk of future misuse.</p>

<h2>B Analysis of Relative Robustness of Comparative Assessment</h2>
<p>It is observed that comparative assessment is more robust than absolute assessment. Arguably this could be due to an implicit prompt ensemble with different output objectives in comparative assessment. In absolute assessment, the adversary has to find a phrase that always pushes the predicted token to the maximal score 5 , irrespective of the input test. For comparative assessment, to evaluate the probability summary $i$ is better than $j$ to ensure symmetry, we do two passes through the system. To attack system $i$, for the first pass, the adversary has to ensure the attack phrase increases the probability of token A (the prompt asks the system to select which text input, A or B, is better, where A corresponds to the text in position 1 and B corresponds to the text in position 2) being predicted. For the second pass the adversary has to decrease the predicted probability of token A (as
attacked summary is in position 2). This means the objective of the adversary in the different passes is dependent on the prompt ordering of summaries, as well as the objectives being the complete opposite in the two passes (competing objectives). This means the universal attack phrase has to recognise automatically whether it is in position 1 or in position 2 and respectively increase or decrease the output probability of generating token A. This is a lot more challenging and could explain the robustness of comparative assessment. How do we assess this hypothesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>We perform an ablation where the comparative assessment system does asymmetric evaluation such that the probability system $i$ is better than $j$ is measured asymmetrically, with the attacked text always in position 1, such that the adversarial attack only has to maximize the probability of token A. It is expected that the asymmetric comparative assessment system is less robust.</li>
<li>We re-apply the greedy search algorithm with this asymmetric setup.</li>
<li>We evaluate the efficacy of the attack phrase in the asymmetric setting.</li>
<li>We repeat the above experiments with the attack only in position 2 (objective then being to minimize the probability of token B). We term the universal attack phrases asymA and asymB.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results are presented in Table 6 and Table 7. It seems that even in this asymmetric setting the robustness performance is only slightly (if that) worse than that of the symmetric evaluation setting in the main paper. This suggests that perhaps there is a separate aspect of comparative assessment approach that contributes significantly to the robustness. Further analysis will be required to better understand exactly which aspects of comparative assessment are giving the greatest robustness.</p>

<h2>C Transferability of the Comparative Assessment Attack</h2>
<p>Figure 2 shows that when the surrogate model (FlanT5-xl) is run as comparative assessment it is only mildly susceptible to the universal adversarial attack. Hence, Section 6.3 in the paper reports only the transferability of the attack on the absolute assessment systems to the target larger models (Mistral, Llama2 and ChatGPT). For completeness, in this section we provide the impact of transferring the attacks for comparative assessment. The transferability plots are given in Figure 5. As would be expected, the mild attacks learnt for the surrogate model FlanT5-xl are only are able to maintain at best a mild impact for the target models.</p>
<h2>D Direct Attack on Target Model</h2>
<p>The main paper proposes a practical method to attack LLM-as-a-Judge system that use large LLMs, via a surrogate model (FlanT5-xl in this work). For comparison, this section presents the results for performing a direct attack on Llama2-7B (a target larger model). The resulst are presented for absolute assessment in Figure 6. As would be expected from the bounds of the transfer attacks, the direct attack is equally (and more) successful in deceiving the LLM absolute scoring systems into giving the attacked text the highest ranking score.

<h2>E Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) Universal Attack</h2>
<p>In the main paper we present an iterative greedy search for a universal concatenative attack phrase. Here, we contrast our approach against the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) adversarial attack approach used by Zou et al. (2023). In our GCG experiments we adopt the default hyperparameter settings from the paper for the universal GCG algorithm. The GCG attack is a whitebox approach that exploits embedding gradients to identify which tokens to substitute from the concatenated phrase. Table 8 shows the impact of incorporating GCG with initialization from the existing learnt attack phrases for absolute assessment and the comparative assessment on overall assessment. From these results it appears that GCG has a negligible impact on the adversarial attack efficacy, and can in many cases degrade the attack (worse average rank) - this is perhaps expected for the best / well optimized attack phrases.</p>

<p>The main paper presents the impact of the adversarial attack phrases for comparative and absolute assessment systems on the average rank as defined in Equation 8. However, it is more interpretable to understand the the impact on the probability, $p_{i j}$ (Equation 1) of an attacked system being better than other systems for comparative assessment and the impact on the average predicted score (Equation 3) for absolute assessment. Tables 9-12 give the inter-</p>
<p>pretable breakdown of each attack for comparative assessment and Tables 13-28 give the equivalent interpretable breakdown for absolute assessment.</p>

<h2>G LLM Prompts</h2>
<p>Figure 7 shows the prompts used for absolute scoring via G-EVAL, while Figure 8 shows the prompt template used for comparative assessment.</p>
<h2>H Attacking Bespoke Assessment Systems</h2>
<p>The focus of the paper is on adversarially attacking zero-shot NLG assessment systems. However, one practical defence could be to use a bespoke NLG assessment system that is finetuned to a specific domain. Zhong et al. (2022b) propose such a bespoke system, Unieval that has been finetuned for summary assessment evaluation for each attribute on SummEval. The Unieval system predicts a quality score from 1-5 for each attribute of assessment. Here we explore attacking each attribute of Unieval in turn for the SummEval dataset. Interestingly Unieval appears significantly more robust to these form of adversarial attacks than the zero-shot NLG systems in the main paper. However, it can be observed that there is some vulnerability in the Unieval when assessed on the fluency attribute.</p>
<h2>I Licensing</h2>
<p>All datasets used are publicly available. Our implementation utilizes the PyTorch 1.12 framework, an open-source library. We obtained a license from Meta to employ the Llama-7B model via HuggingFace. Additionally, our research is conducted per the licensing agreements of the Mistral-7B, GPT3.5, and GPT-4 models. We ran our experiments on A100 Nvidia GPU and via OpenAI API.</p>
