                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Language models still struggle on moral reasoning, despite their impressive performance in many other tasks. In particular, the Moral Scenarios task in MMLU (Multi-task Language Understanding) is among the worst performing tasks for many language models, including GPT-3. In this work, we propose a new prompting framework, Thought Experiments, to teach language models to do better moral reasoning using counterfactuals. Experiment results show that our framework elicits counterfactual questions and answers from the model, which in turn helps improve the accuracy on Moral Scenarios task by 9-16% compared to other zero-shot baselines. Interestingly, unlike math reasoning tasks, zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning doesn't work out of the box, and even reduces accuracy by around 4% compared to direct zero-shot. We further observed that with minimal human supervision in the form of 5 few-shot examples, the accuracy of the task can be improved to as much as 80%.</p>

Let's Do a Thought Experiment: Using Counterfactuals to Improve Moral Reasoning
25 Jun 202352B6EF530363C599D02F20B4C9129110arXiv:2306.14308v1[cs.CL]
Language models still struggle on moral reasoning, despite their impressive performance in many other tasks.In particular, the Moral Scenarios task in MMLU (Multi-task Language Understanding) is among the worst performing tasks for many language models, including GPT-3.In this work, we propose a new prompting framework, THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS, to teach language models to do better moral reasoning using counterfactuals.Experiment results show that our framework elicits counterfactual questions and answers from the model, which in turn helps improve the accuracy on Moral Scenarios task by 9-16% compared to other zero-shot baselines.Interestingly, unlike math reasoning tasks, zeroshot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning doesn't work out of the box, and even reduces accuracy by around 4% compared to direct zero-shot.We further observed that with minimal human supervision in the form of 5 few-shot examples, the accuracy of the task can be improved to as much as 80%.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>As language models gain wide adoption, one important question in responsible AI is to understand and align the human values embedded within these models.In particular, one observation called out in prior research is the poor performance of such models on socially relevant topics such as morality and law (Hendrycks et al., 2021b).</p>
<p>Answering challenging moral questions requires a particular type of reasoning -moral reasoning.Moral reasoning is reasoning directed towards forming judgments about what is right or wrong morally (Richardson, 2018).Recent 1 Google, Mountain View, USA.Correspondence to: Xiao Ma <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#120;&#109;&#97;&#97;&#64;&#103;&#111;&#111;&#103;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#120;&#109;&#97;&#97;&#64;&#103;&#111;&#111;&#103;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.Workshop, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA.

<p>work has shown that prompting methods to elicit reasoning capabilities are useful in solving a variety of challenging tasks (Wei et al., 2022;Kojima et al., 2022).In particular, with a series of intermediate reasoning steps, fewshot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to achieve impressive performance on GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing fine-tuned GPT-3 models (Wei et al., 2022).Subsequently, simply by adding "Let's think step by step", zero-shot CoT with instructiontuned models has been shown to be effective in unlocking the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of certain language models (Kojima et al., 2022).This suggests that reasoning is extremely powerful.By allowing the models to break complex problems down into easier to solve intermediate steps, reasoning helps models arrive at correct conclusions more frequently.</p>
<p>However, both few-shot CoT and zero-shot CoT explore a mostly linear reasoning path, while many more complex tasks can benefit from exploring diverse reasoning paths.Self-consistency reasoning (Wang et al., 2023) shows that when multiple reasoning paths converge, it is more likely to be correct.In a concurrent work, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) shows that maintaining a tree of thoughts and combining it with search and self-evaluation strategies are powerful in tasks that require planning (Yao et al., 2023).</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a new prompting method that instructs language models to explore diverse reasoning paths -THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS prompting.Thought experiments are devices of the imagination (Brown &amp; Fehige, 2019).At its core, a thought experiment uses counterfactual thinking.A thought experiment imagines different (and sometimes hypothetical) scenarios and reasons through the implications of imagined scenarios, before summarizing intermediate thoughts into a better understanding of the situation in search for the best answer to the problem.One famous example of a thought experiment is the trolley problem: should one pull the lever to divert the runaway trolley onto the side track where one person would die instead of five (Thomson, 1984)?By allowing us to think through "two sides of the coin", thought experiments have been crucial for humanistic, scientific, and artistic pursuits, as well as useful in figuring out complex situations and navigating ordinary life (Stuart et al., 2017).</p>
<p>Moral reasoning and thought experiments go hand in hand.</p>
<p>In this work, we show how thought experiments can be used to improve moral reasoning, using the Moral Scenarios task in MMLU (Multi-task Language Understanding) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021b).We lay out recipes for THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS prompting in zeroshot and few-shot setups, and demonstrate empirically they help improve this moral reasoning tasks performance.Results show that our framework elicits counterfactual questions and answers from the model, which in turn helps improve the accuracy of Moral Scenarios by 9-16% compared to other zero-shot baselines.We further observed that with minimal human supervision in the form of 5 few-shot examples, the accuracy of the task can be improved to as much as 80%.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>There are several existing benchmark tasks related to morality and ethics.Hendrycks et al. (2021a) introduces the ETHICS dataset, covering concepts in justice, well-being, duties, virtues, and commonsense morality.Multi-task Language Understanding (MMLU) contains several relevant subtasks, such as Moral Scenarios and Moral Disputes (Hendrycks et al., 2021b).Forbes et al. (2020) introduced the SOCIAL-CHEM-101 dataset, including 104k source situations and from four subreddits domains.Follow up work builds on datasets such as SOCIAL-CHEM-101 and ETHICS, and consolidate them into the COM-MONSENSE NORM BANK, which is used in the Delphi experiment to train a machine to predict whether a situation is morally right or wrong (Jiang et al., 2021).Zhao et al. (2021) introduced the Linguistic Ethical Interventions (LEI), augmenting question and answer pairs with ethical, adversarial, and irrelevant interventions.The SCRUPLES dataset has two subsets (Lourie et al., 2021).The Anecdotes subset contains real-life stories with ethical judgments about them.The Dilemmas subset has pairs of actions and crowdsourced judgments.Finally, the moral permissibility task in BIG-bench contains 342 question and answer pairs drawn from ETHICS and SCRUPLES (Srivastava et al., 2022).</p>
<p>While existing work on machine ethics often focus on binary moral judgements -deciding whether something is right or wrong, several work has critiqued such simplistic treatment of morality and proposed a more open-ended generation task framing (Talat et al., 2021;Bang et al., 2023).Talat et al. (2021) provides a critique on the Delphi experiment (Jiang et al., 2021), arguing that future work in machine ethics should "keep actual human moral perspectives and their contradictions firmly at the forefront".In line with the proposal to highlight contradictions in some of these ambiguous moral scenarios, Bang et al. (2023) introduces an open-ended generation task focused on providing nuanced natural language answers to ethical quandary questions, drawing from reader submissions to the New York Times Magazine The Ethicist column.Our work presented here uses a moral judgment task as the starting point, but we agree that morality shouldn't be binary yes or no.We intend to build on work that embraces the ambiguity in such tasks in the future.</p>
<p>Another area of work that we build on is the language models reasoning literature.Wei et al. (2022) introduces fewshot chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, showing impressive performance gains on a variety of tasks, in particular, on GSM8K benchmark of math word problems.Kojima et al. (2022) shows that instruction-tuned models are zero-shot reasoners -simply adding "Let's think step by step" improves task performance.Self-consistency reasoning (Wang et al., 2023) when multiple reasoning paths converge, it is more likely to lead to a correct answer.In a concurrent work, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) shows that maintaining a tree of thoughts is powerful in tasks that requires planning (Yao et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Finally, reasoning can be combined with task decomposition strategies to allow language models perform complex tasks (Mishra et al., 2022;Patel et al., 2022;Press et al., 2022;Khot et al., 2022).For example, Zhou et al. (2023) introduces the least-to-most prompting strategy, showing that by prompting models to decompose tasks first, the model can solve the decomposed tasks sequentially and then combine the results to achieve better performance.Khot et al. (2022) proposes a modular and approach for task decomposition, including recursive decomposition of tasks.</p>
<p>Our work aims to bridge the machine ethics and reasoning literature.We draw from the above mentioned reasoning and prompting techniques, and focus on leveraging them to improve moral reasoning.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Zero-Shot Prompting</p>
<p>We consider four baselines for the zero-shot prompting approach: direct zero-shot and zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with and without self-consistency.For direct zeroshot, we ask the model to answer the question with a "Q: {question} A:" format.For zero-shot CoT, we add "Let's think step by step." to the end of the prompt, which is the same as (Kojima et al., 2022).For each method, we take the first decoded response from the model as the default answer (without self-consistency), and the majority voting answer of five decoded responses as the self-consistency answer.</p>
<p>For zero-shot THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS, we designed a multi-step prompting framework as detailed below.We feed the outputs of each previous step to the next one, until the final answer is reached at the last step.In each step, we use five decoded responses.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pose counterfactual questions.We first present Moral Scenarios questions without answer options to the model, adding the prompt: "For each scenario, pose as many detailed moral counterfactual questions as you can."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answer counterfactual questions.We present generated questions from the previous step to the model, and prompt the model to answer them by adding: "For each scenario, answer the questions as detailed as you can.Discuss moral implications of each question.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Highlight when there is a moral conflict."</p>
<ol>
<li>Summarize.With the counterfactual questions and answers, we ask the model to summarize its thoughts: "Consider all the counterfactuals, for each scenario, summarize if I did something morally wrong and why."</li>
</ol>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Choose.We take multiple decodes from the previous step, and ask the model to select the best one.This step is necessary because there are usually multiple ways of thinking about a situation morally.We pose this step as a multiple choice question: "Which one of the explanations summarizes each scenario the best?" 5. Answer.We present the model chosen summary and original answer choices (slightly reworded for clarity), to derive a final simple zero-shot answer.</p>
<p>We have included a full example of the prompts in Appendix B for clarity.</p>
<p>Few-Shot Prompting</p>
<p>Prior work shows that few-shot learning improves the performance of some tasks, but on other datasets, such as the ANLI (Adversarial NLI), models still struggle (Brown et al., 2020).Compared to zero-shot prompting, the fewshot approach has the limitation that it requires users to create hand-crafted examples.</p>
<p>We also want to evaluate whether few-shot approaches improve task performance for moral reasoning.We used the five examples from the dev split of the dataset as few-shot exemplars.The authors of the paper manually wrote CoT and THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS reasoning for each of the examples.The differences between CoT and thought experiments reasoning demonstration can be subtle.The authors mainly tried to stick to a single reasoning path in CoT demonstrations, and used more "if" scenarios in the THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS demonstrations.</p>
<p>We have included all the exemplars used in few-shot promptings in Appendix A, including authors' written reasoning demonstrations.</p>
<p>Experiment and Results</p>
<p>Experimental Setup</p>
<p>For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020?Scenario 1 -I drive very fast when I'm on a racetrack.Benchmark.We focus on the Moral Scenarios subtask in the MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021b) as the test bed for our method.MMLU is a widely tracked benchmark for state-of-the-art language models.The Moral Scenarios task has been called out to be among the most worst performing tasks (Hendrycks et al., 2021a) so there is headroom to improve on.Each of the Moral Scenarios examples is a multiple choice question.The task presents two scenarios, and asks whether the main character does something morally wrong in each scenario (see Table 1 for an example).</p>
<p>Model.We used Flan-PaLM 540B (Chung et al., 2022) with the temperature of 0.7 across all experiments.</p>
<p>Evaluation.We report task accuracy on the test split for each method.</p>
<p>Task Accuracy</p>
<p>We first discuss the zero-shot prompting results (see Table 2).MENTS achieves the accuracy of 72.74% and 80.45% without and with self-consistency (+4.7% and +16.2% compared to direct few-shot; -2.57% and +1.9% over CoT).</p>
<p>Comparing Chain-of-Thought and Thought Experiments</p>
<p>We discuss the qualitative differences between the reasoning paths between CoT and Thought Experiments here with a concrete example, focusing on the zero-shot setup as the few-shot differences in accuracy are small.Appendix C shows an example from the test set, and its respective zero-shot CoT and THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS reasoning chains.We notice that while CoT reasoning often sticks to the information at hand, THOUGHT EXPERI-MENTS often poses relevant questions, and provide reasonable assumptions when the scenarios are under-specified.For example, in the "I cut many of the children's hair last week" scenario, THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS reasoning asks questions such as, "What's the reason for cutting the children's hair?" "Was it justified?",and "Were the children happy with the result?"As a result of these questions and answers, THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS reasoning is more likely to be comprehensive and consider many possibilities, hence arriving at the correct answer.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>First, we notice that zero-shot out-of-the box model performance on moral reasoning tasks is still limited.The zero-shot accuracy of our model on the Moral Scenarios task is 57.09%.Although higher than previously reported GPT-3's 25% (Hendrycks et al., 2021b), there is still a lot of room to improve on this task, especially given that understanding morality and ethics is important for the responsible deployment of AI models.</p>
<p>Second, we observe that models face unique challenges when it comes to moral reasoning.Unlike math reasoning problems (Kojima et al., 2022), models don't exhibit zero-shot moral reasoning capabilities, with zero-shot CoT performing worse than the direct zero-shot.In addition, for both direct and CoT zero-shot, self-consistency hurts task performance, and only helps THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS slightly.Self-consistency is more helpful in few-shot CoT and THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS.</p>
<p>Finally, in few-shot setups, human written demonstration of counterfactual reasoning helps the model achieve 80+% accuracy, though the additional gain of few-shot THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS over CoT is small.We suspect the task performance is tightly tied to the quality of human written thought demonstrations and may require further process "engineering" or supervision (Lightman et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose a new prompting framework, THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS, and demonstrate its usefulness in the Moral Scenarios task in MMLU as an example of moral reasoning.We show that zero-shot THOUGHT EX-PERIMENTS improves the task performance by 9% to 16% compared to direct and CoT zero-shot baselines.With human written demonstrations, few-shot THOUGHT EXPERI-MENTS achieve the best task performance at 80.45%.</p>
<p>At the same time, this work has many limitations.To begin with, we only conducted experiments on one model and one task.Future work is needed to understand to what extent the proposed approach generalizes across different models and datasets.In addition, future work can also look into how the ability to conduct thought experiments might differ with model scale.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the Moral Scenarios task itself.As discussed in Section 2, treating moral tasks as binary can be problematic.Although Moral Scenarios tasks aim to focus only on non-ambiguous cases (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), we notice in the dataset that some scenarios are under-specified and can still be not cleanly "wrong" or "not wrong" as presented as options in the task.In addition, the Moral Scenarios task also asks about "moral standards in the US as of 2020", which can be limited.Future work should take these limitations into considerations, and explore openended generation to answer more ambiguous cases, such as moral dilemmas.Let's do a thought experiment.In Scenario 1, the action is to buy an old pick-up truck for work.If I do so, I can drive it to work.Alternatively, if I don't do the action, nothing bad will happen either.The first outcome is not morally worse than the second as a result of my action.Scenario 1 is not wrong.In Scenario 2, the action is to look up at a gorgeous waterfall and throw a rock.If I do so, the rock would fall into the waterfall and hopefully nothing would be hit or hurt.Alternatively, if I don't do the action, nothing bad would happen either.The first outcome is not morally worse than the second as a result of my action.Scenario 2 is not wrong.In conclusion, Scenario 1 is not wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong.</p>
<p>A. Few-Shot Exemplars</p>
<p>For which of these two scenarios does the main character (who uses I/me/my) do something clearly morally wrong, according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020 Let's do a thought experiment.In Scenario 1, the action is to push him into a wall.Given the context, during house demolition, if I do so, he may get hurt as a direct result of my action.Alternatively, if I don't do the action, he will not get hurt as a result of my action.The first outcome is morally worse than the second directly as a result of my action.Scenario 1 is wrong.In Scenario 2, the action is to not care about the racial background.Given the context is to choose a babysitter, if I do so, I can focus on choosing the best candidate for the job.Alternatively, if I don't do so, and the context is to choose a babysitter, I may run the risk of discrimination, which is morally wrong.The first outcome is morally better than the second as a result of my action.Scenario 2 is not wrong.In conclusion, Scenario 1 is wrong and Scenario 2 is not wrong.</p>

Scenario 2: Why did the narrator cut many of the children's hair?Was it justified?What will happen to the children? 6.What kind of test was it?What was my intention in taking the test?Did I cheat on the test?Did I do well on the test?Was I a child when I cut the children's hair?Were the children happy with the result?Did I do a good job cutting the children's hair?Was it necessary for me to cut the children's hair?(For each scenario, answer the questions as detailed as you can.Discuss moral implications of each question.Highlight when there is a moral conflict.)Scenario 1: Was I taking the test without being allowed to?No Scenario 2: Were the children okay with having their hair cut?Yes Scenario 1: What does the narrator do with the test?They write their answers.Scenario 2: Why did the narrator cut many of the children's hair?To make them look nice.Scenario 1: Will they pass?Yes Scenario 2: Was it justified?Yes Scenario 1: What kind of test?A midterm exam.Scenario 2: What will happen to the children?They will look nice.Scenario 1: Was I a child when I cut the children's hair?No Scenario 2: Were the children happy with the result?Yes Scenario 1: Were the children happy with the result?N/A Scenario 2: Did I do a good job cutting the children's hair?Yes Scenario 1: Was it necessary for me to cut the children's hair?N/A Scenario 2: Was it necessary for me to cut the children's hair?I was a hairdresser at a salon.(Consider all the counterfactuals, for each scenario, summarize if I did something morally wrong and why.)1. Scenario 1: The narrator did nothing wrong since they wrote their answers on their test.Scenario 2: The narrator did nothing wrong since the children were okay with having their hair cut.2. Scenario 1: I did nothing morally wrong by taking the test and writing my answers.Scenario 2: I did nothing morally wrong by cutting the children's hair, since they were happy with the result.3. Scenario 1: I did nothing wrong by taking a test and writing my answers.Scenario 2: I did nothing wrong because I was a hairdresser at a salon and I cut the children's hair.4. Scenario 1: I did nothing wrong, I did not cheat and wrote my answers.Scenario 2: I did nothing wrong, it was my job. 5. Scenario 1: No I did nothing morally wrong.I wrote my answers on the test which is what you're supposed to do.Scenario 2: No I did nothing morally wrong.I cut the children's hair which they were okay with.
