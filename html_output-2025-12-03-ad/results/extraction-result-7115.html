Prototype theory construes membership in a concept's extension as graded, detemzined by similarity to the concept's '3e.W exemplar (or by some other measure of central tendency).

The distinguishing doctrine of the new theory is that entities fall neither sharply in nor sharply out of a concept's extension. Rather, an object instances a concept only to the extent that it is similar to the prototype of the concept; the boundary between membership and nonmembership in a concept's extension is thus fuzzy.
