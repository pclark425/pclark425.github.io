                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of question-sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts is introduced.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> It is well documented that NLP models learn social biases, but little work has been done on how these biases manifest in model outputs for applied tasks like question answering (QA). We introduce the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of question-sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. Our task evaluate model responses at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses reflect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test whether the model’s biases override a correct answer choice. We find that models often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model’s outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conflicts, with this difference widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>It is well documented that NLP models learn social biases, but little work has been done on how these biases manifest in model outputs for applied tasks like question answering (QA). We introduce the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of question sets constructed by the authors that highlight attested social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions relevant for U.S. English-speaking contexts. Our task evaluates model responses at two levels: (i) given an under-informative context, we test how strongly responses reflect social biases, and (ii) given an adequately informative context, we test whether the model's biases override a correct answer choice. We find that models often rely on stereotypes when the context is under-informative, meaning the model's outputs consistently reproduce harmful biases in this setting. Though models are more accurate when the context provides an informative answer, they still rely on stereotypes and average up to 3.4 percentage points higher accuracy when the correct answer aligns with a social bias than when it conflicts, with this difference widening to over 5 points on examples targeting gender for most models tested.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Large language models (LMs) learn social biases present in the world, and the increased use of these systems across different contexts increases the cases where these biases can lead to harm. LMs have been found to reproduce social biases in downstream tasks such as language generation (Sheng et al., 2019) and coreference resolution (Rudinger et al., 2018). The use of these models in real-world applications therefore risks harming marginalized individuals and groups. However, little work has been done to understand how these biases manifest in the outputs of question-answering (QA) models. To assess these biases in model outputs, we measure biases against a range of social categories and
<img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Examples in BBQ come in sets of 4, created by varying the two contexts options in (A), ambiguous context only or ambiguous + disambiguated context, with the two question types in (B), negative question or non-negative question. We then repeat this with "Christian" and "Muslim" switched. The correct answers for this set are shown in (C). Each example is presented as a multiple-choice question with three choices. In this case, all questions have the options "The Christian", "The Muslim", and "Unknown".
also measure in which contexts these impacts are most likely to be exhibited.</p>
<p>There are many, often conflicting, ways bias is defined in NLP (Blodgett et al., 2020); we focus on stereotyping behavior and build on the definition and treatment of bias in QA from Li et al. (2020), who have shown that the marginal probabilities a model associates with different answer options are related to positive or negative associations with different gender and racial identities. However, it has not yet been shown how these differences manifest in discrete model outputs, as differences in likelihoods will not always correspond to a difference in the model's categorical prediction, and whether those manifestations are tied to identifiable biases</p>

<p>Table 1: Examples from the nine bias categories. Each one contains a linked source that identifies the bias as negative or harmful. The underlined portion represents the slot that is templated in, shown with one potential filler.
rather than generic associations between identity labels and positively or negatively valenced words. To address this, we create the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), a dataset of hand-written contexts that target attested social biases against nine different socially-relevant categories and that has been validated by both experts and crowdworkers.</p>
<p>We match each context with questions and answer options that test if a model systematically relies on social biases. Each example appears with two questions that reflect a negative or harmful bias: one asks for the target of a harmful stereotype (e.g., "who steals things?"), and the other asks for the nontargeted entity (e.g., "who never steals things?"). To measure when biased model outputs are likely to manifest, we assess both cases where there is not enough information in the context to answer the question (leading to the correct answer being an expression of uncertainty, such as "not known") and cases where the correct answer is present, allowing us to test when the biases that we already know are present in LMs override the correct answer.</p>
<p>Motivation Compared to many bias datasets, BBQ covers a broader range of socially-salient attributes of individuals, many of which fall under protected categories, and each example template targets one specific bias that has been attested to cause harm. We intend this benchmark to be a
stronger measurement tool than what is currently available, allowing for more reliable and accurate conclusions about how models reproduce social biases. This work does not directly contribute to debiasing or other harm reduction measures (e.g., better pre-deployment testing), but we expect it to be an enabling tool for work that does.</p>
<p>Scope We focus on harms that arise when biased models are deployed as QA systems. The harms we assess reflect (i) stereotype reinforcement, which risks perpetuating biases, and (ii) stereotype attribution, which risks attributing bias-based characteristics to individuals based on attributes of their (real or perceived) identities. Concretely, if a QA model displays the bias that overweight people have low intelligence, it may be more likely to select an individual described as overweight in response to any questions that reflect lack of intelligence, regardless of whether such a response is supported in the text. This model behavior harms overweight individuals by (i) reinforcing the stereotype that weight is related to intelligence, and (ii) attributing low intelligence to the specific person described.</p>
<p>BBQ Each bias category contains at least 25 unique templates written by the authors and validated using crowdworker judgments; the 325 different templates in BBQ expand into an average of about 175 questions each for a final dataset size of</p>
<p>over 58k examples. ${ }^{1}$ We test UnifiedQA (Khashabi et al., 2020), RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and DeBERTaV3 (He et al., 2021) models on BBQ and find that in under-informative contexts, the models generally select unsupported answers rather than answers that express uncertainty, often in ways that align with social biases. This perpetuation of bias persists to cause an accuracy decrease of up to 3.4 percentage points in disambiguated contexts when the correct answer is not aligned with a social bias.</p>
<h2>2 Related Work</h2>
<p>Measuring Bias in NLP Several studies have investigated the prevalence of bias in NLP models (Caliskan et al., 2017; May et al., 2019; Bordia and Bowman, 2019; Davidson et al., 2019; Magee et al., 2021), with many focusing on cases of models exhibiting stereotyping behavior. Though Blodgett et al. (2020) point out that what these studies mean by "bias" can vary quite widely, the finding that models encode associations derived from negative stereotypes and social biases is well replicated. In defining bias for this study, our design aligns most closely with the definition of representational harms by Crawford (2017) as harms that "occur when systems reinforce the subordination of some groups along the lines of identity." When constructing data to measure this bias, contrasting groups of people rather than just relevant attributes highlights the difference in outcomes and impact on groups targeted by a given stereotype (Dev et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Social Biases in Downstream NLP Tasks The presence of bias in a model's representations or embeddings does not, on its own, indicate that a model will produce biased outputs. In order to understand where the output of a model reinforces biases, we look at how these biases manifest in two downstream classification tasks where such research already exists: coreference resolution and hate speech detection.</p>
<p>In coreference resolution, much of the work on bias has focused on specific gender stereotypes (Lu et al., 2020) or gender-occupation associations (Rudinger et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018). The work often focuses on how model performance is affected by whether the example is aligned with relevant stereotypes, with Webster et al. (2018) finding that biases in the training corpus led to</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>models incorrectly adopting a bias towards selecting masculine pronouns. Cao and Daumé III (2020) extend work on gender bias to include non-binary identities and highlight how bias can be introduced through human annotation and surface in coreference resolution as model predictions that are both incorrect and harmful.</p>
<p>In hate speech detection, Röttger et al. (2021) create HATECHECK and investigate failure points of classification models, like differences in performance across target groups. Similarly, Davidson et al. (2019) find differences in hate speech detection performance for tweets written in African American English in contrast with Standard American English. Others have focused not only on gender and race-based biases, but also age, religion, sexual orientation, and disability status (see Dev et al. 2021 for a survey). Sap et al. (2020) place a range of biases into inference frames to tie potential hate speech to the real-world bias being invoked. Vidgen et al. (2021) also include a range of individual and intersectional biases, and they develop a dataset with fine-grained annotations related to both the type of bias and the target.</p>
<p>Social Biases in Question Answering To our knowledge, there is only one other dataset for measuring social bias in QA models, UnQover ( Li et al., 2020). They use underspecified questionsquestions that cannot be answered by the given context-to assess model biases from gendered name-occupation associations, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. Li et al. compare model scores associated with two answer options, rather than the outputs of the model, to reveal whether the stereotypes investigated are represented in the model.</p>
<h2>3 The Dataset</h2>
<p>BBQ contains 58,492 unique examples. We create templates which consist of two questions, answer choices, a partial context missing information necessary to answer the questions, and a disambiguating context that provides the necessary information. Each template is written from scratch by the authors and is inspired by an attested bias. Each context isolates the targeted bias and has two slots that we fill with labels representing the given category (see Table 1). This design allows us to keep the context consistent while inserting different values for the labels. We annotate each template for (i) the value relevant to the bias (e.g., cognitive ability in Table 1 for age), (ii) the possible bias targets, and</p>
<p>(iii) the source the bias is attested in.</p>
<p>BBQ tests biases in model predictions, allowing us to study how social biases may manifest in downstream tasks. This is in contrast to UnQover, which measures the model likelihoods and thus merges biased model behavior that does and does not alter the model outputs. Though their measure is likely to identify representational biases that BBQ does not, this will only be in instances where a link between model behavior and harm cannot be established; we exclusively focus on cases where model behavior changes. Further, BBQ always provides models with a correct answer option, allowing us to study under what circumstances a model's biases override an otherwise valid answer. This is again in contrast to UnQover, which measures the likelihood assigned to two incorrect options. As we always provide a correct answer option, we include a way for the model to indicate that the answer is not known. In order to not rely too strongly on the lexical item "unknown," we randomly sample from a distribution of ten equivalent expressions (e.g., "cannot be determined", "not known"); we refer to these as UNKNOWN answers.</p>
<h3>3.1 Coverage</h3>
<p>We include nine broad categories of social bias (Table 1), mostly taken from the protected demographic categories defined by the US Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC, 2021). For physical appearance, we expand beyond the EEOC's definitions to include other features (e.g., weight) with reported bias. In each example, the negative question explicitly states a social bias that targets a member of that category. For example, within religion, some templates test biases against Muslims (e.g., associations with terrorism, violence, or misogyny), and others test biases against Jews (e.g., associations with greed or dual loyalties).</p>
<p>We include two intersectional biases: gender by race/ethnicity and socio-economic status by race/ethnicity. We analyze this subset separately from the other categories, as non-target construction can not be random, as one relevant demographic feature is often shared between the target and non-target, making the contrast more similar than in the non-intersectional subset of BBQ.</p>
<h3>3.2 Template Construction</h3>
<p>Table 1 shows a template example from each of the nine bias categories in BBQ. Each template is hand-
written by the authors and references a specific bias reported as negative towards or having caused harm to members of a given protected category. We take any of the following as evidence or documentation of harm: research articles documenting the effects of stereotypes and biases, news articles discussing the effects of specific stereotypes or biases, Wikipedia pages listing stereotypes and biases negatively associated with a given group, and personal blogs giving first-hand accounts of harm caused by stereotypes and biases. For the two intersectional categories, we create templates with three comparisons such that one named entity is the bias target, and the second entity differs along one of the two dimensions targeted or both. For example, if the bias target is Black men, the comparisons may be between a Black man and (a) a Black woman, (b) an Asian man, and (c) an Asian woman.</p>
<p>Questions Examples come in clusters of four, with negative and non-negative question variants, with and without a disambiguating context. A negative question is one in which a social value in the US is violated and the bias it reflects is harmful to certain groups. A non-negative question is the complement of the negative question; it does not imply that it is not harmful. This allows us to assess whether the response rate for a given label is biased, as some labels may have a higher overall probability in the model's training data, which may affect the probability of selecting it as a response. If we only used negative questions, we would not be able to tell whether an answer was chosen due to a question-agnostic preference for the disadvantaged group (itself a kind of bias, but not the one we are measuring) or the specific biased association that the question is meant to draw out.</p>
<p>Some questions include words that indicate probabilistic judgments, such as "probably" or "likely." We include these to allow for a degree of pragmatic inference, though in some cases the biases that we test correspond to real-world differences (e.g., older adults really are more likely, on average, to have trouble hearing compared to younger adults). However, even in these cases, the attribution of a specific property to an individual in the text would not be warranted in the ambiguous contexts, as verified during our example validation (§4).</p>
<p>Ambiguous Contexts The ambiguous contexts serve to (i) introduce the general setting and the two group categories that the questions reference, and</p>
<p>(ii) evaluate model behavior in cases where there is insufficient evidence from the context to provide an answer. The correct answer in all the ambiguous contexts is the UNKNOWN answer option.</p>
<p>Disambiguated Contexts The disambiguated contexts provide information about which of the individuals mentioned in the ambiguous context is the answer to the negative/non-negative question. The correct answer in the disambiguated contexts is always one of the two individuals, with one individual being the answer to the negative question and the other the answer to the non-negative question.</p>
<p>Balancing Templates Li et al. (2020) note that the order in which the target and non-target phrases appear affects model behavior, and that this effect needs to be separated from measures of bias. Therefore, we permute the order of the target and non-target words for each example such that if one example from a template references 'a man in a wheelchair and a man who is walking,' another example from that same template will reference 'a man who is walking and a man in a wheelchair.'</p>
<p>Number of Templates per Category Each of the nine top-level categories and the two intersectional categories include 25 unique templates, and the race and gender categories each contain an additional 25 templates constructed using proper names. The number of examples generated for each template varies between 8 examples ${ }^{2}$ and 200, with most templates generating at least 100 examples. In most cases, we have at least two unique templates that capture each bias (e.g., two separate templates in religion refer to the same stereotype associating Jews with greediness) in order to minimize idiosyncratic effects of a particular phrasing of the context.</p>
<h3>3.3 Vocabulary</h3>
<p>Explicit Labels of the Bias Target The vocabulary for the target and non-target labels is specific to each category. In the case of nationality, race/ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and gender, the templates are typically created from a vocabulary of group labels (e.g., "Muslim", "Buddhist", and "Jewish" are three of the 11 labels used in religion). For age, disability status, physical appearance, and socio-economic status, the labels often use a custom set of words or phrases written</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>for each template. This customization is necessary because there are many ways to indicate that two people differ, and these descriptions or category labels differ in their appropriateness and grammatical acceptability in a given context. For example, in age, templates can reference ages (e.g., "72-yearold"), generations (e.g., "millennial"), family terms (e.g., "grandfather"), or use adjectives (e.g., "very young"). Detailed discussion of considerations in creating these labels is in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Proper Names Within gender and race/ethnicity categories, we include templates using proper names that are stereotyped of a given category (e.g., "Jermaine Washington" for a Black man, "Donna Schneider" for a White woman). Within gender, we use first names from the 1990 US census, ${ }^{3}$ taking the top 20 most common names for people who identified themselves as male or female. Within race/ethnicity, we rely on data from a variety of sources (details in Appendix B) and always include both a given name and a family name, as both can be indicative of racial or ethnic identity in the US.</p>
<p>We add the strong caveat that while names are a very common way that race and gender are signaled in text, they are a highly imperfect proxy. We analyze templates that use proper names separately from the templates that use explicit category labels. However, as our proper name vocabulary reflects the most extreme distributional differences in name-ethnicity and name-gender relations, this subset still allows us to infer that if the model shows bias against some names that correlate with a given protected category, then this bias will disproportionately affect members of that category.</p>
<h2>4 Validation</h2>
<p>We validate examples from each template on Amazon Mechanical Turk. One item from each of the template's four conditions is randomly sampled from the constructed dataset and presented to annotators as a multiple-choice task. Each item is rated by five annotators, and we set a threshold of $4 / 5$ annotators agreeing with our gold label for inclusion in the final dataset. If any of the items from a template fall below threshold, that template is edited and all four associated items are re-validated until it passes. Additional details on the validation procedure are in Appendix D. To estimate human accuracy on BBQ, we repeat the validation procedure</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
<p>with a random sample of 300 examples from the final dataset. We estimate that raw human (crowdworker annotator) accuracy on BBQ is $95.7 \%$, and aggregate human accuracy calculated via majority vote is $99.7 \%$. Agreement between raters is high, with a Krippendorf's $\alpha$ of 0.883 .</p>
<h2>5 Evaluation</h2>
<p>Models We test UnifiedQA's 11B parameter model (Khashabi et al., 2020), as it achieves state-of-the-art performance on many datasets. UnifiedQA is trained on eight datasets and accepts multiple input string formats, so we include results for inputs with RACE-style (Lai et al., 2017) and ARC-style (Clark et al., 2018) formats. UnifiedQA outputs strings, so we score by exact match between the top output and each answer option. ${ }^{4}$</p>
<p>For comparison with other language models that show high performance on multiple-choice QA datasets, we also test RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) and DeBERTaV3 (He et al., 2021). We test both the Base and Large models to compare performance on BBQ at different model sizes. In order to test these models on BBQ, we fine-tune them on RACE (Lai et al., 2017), a multiple choice question-answering dataset, for 3 epochs with a learning rate of $1 \mathrm{e}-5$ and a batch size of 16 .</p>
<p>Accuracy We compute accuracy in each category and context. Within the disambiguated contexts, we further separate accuracy by whether the correct answer for the example reinforces or goes against an existing social bias in order to assess whether model performance is affected by whether a social bias is useful in answering the question.</p>
<p>Bias Score Because accuracy alone fails to capture response patterns within inaccurate answers, we introduce a bias score to quantify the degree to which a model systematically answers questions in a biased way. We calculate bias scores separately for the ambiguous and disambiguated contexts, as these two contexts represent model behavior in very different scenarios and require different scaling. The bias score reflects the percent of non-UNKNOWN outputs that align with a social bias. A bias score of $0 \%$ indicates that no model bias has been measured, while $100 \%$ indicates that all answers align with the targeted</p>
<p><sup id="fnref3:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>social bias, and $-100 \%$ indicates that all answers go against the bias. Answers contribute to a positive bias score when the model outputs the bias target in the negative context (e.g. answering "the girl" for who is bad at math?) or the non-target in the non-negative context (e.g., answering "the boy" for who is good at math?). The bias score in disambiguated contexts ( $s_{\text {Dis }}$ ) is calculated as shown below, with $n$ representing the number of examples that fall into each response group, so $n_{\text {biased_ans }}$ represents the number of model outputs that reflect the targeted social bias (i.e., the bias target in negative contexts and the non-target in non-negative contexts), and $n_{\text {non-unknown_outputs }}$ is the total number of model outputs that are not UNKNOWN (i.e., all target and non-target outputs).</p>
<h2>Bias score in disambiguated contexts:</h2>
<p>$$
s_{\text {Dis }}=2\left(\frac{n_{\text {biased_ans }}}{n_{\text {non-unknown_outputs }}}\right)-1
$$</p>
<h2>Bias score in ambiguous contexts:</h2>
<p>$$
s_{\text {AMB }}=(1-\text { accuracy }) s_{\text {Dis }}
$$</p>
<p>We scale bias scores in ambiguous contexts by accuracy to reflect that a biased answer is more harmful if it happens more often. This scaling is not necessary in disambiguated contexts, as the bias score is not computed solely on incorrect answers. ${ }^{5}$ Although accuracy and bias score are related, as perfect accuracy leads to a bias score of zero, they reflect different model behaviors. Categories can have identical accuracies but different bias scores due to different patterns of incorrect answers.</p>
<h2>6 Results</h2>
<p>Accuracy Overall accuracy on BBQ is highest for UnifiedQA with a RACE-style input format at $77.8 \%$ and lowest for RoBERTa-Base at $61.4 \%$ (chance is $33.3 \%$ ). However, models are generally much more accurate in the disambiguated contexts than in the ambiguous contexts (see Figure 5 in the Appendix), showing that when a correct answer is in the context, models are fairly successful at selecting it, even when that answer goes against known social biases. However, accuracy in disambiguated contexts where the correct answer aligns with a social bias is still higher than examples in which</p>

<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Accuracy difference within the disambiguated contexts. We calculate this as accuracy on examples where the correct answer is not aligned with the target bias, minus the accuracy on examples where the correct answer is aligned with the bias. Accuracy is often lower in cases where the correct answer is nonaligned with the social bias, and a greater loss of accuracy in nonaligned examples is represented by a more negative value.
the correct answer does not align with a social bias. Figure 2 shows how much the accuracy drops when the correct answer is nonaligned with a social bias, relative to when the correct answer aligns with the bias. ${ }^{6}$ Within each model, this difference is present in most of the categories, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Bias Score We observe much stronger biases within the ambiguous contexts compared to the disambiguated contexts (Figure 3). This difference is primarily driven by the much higher model accuracy in disambiguated contexts, as increases in accuracy will move the bias scores closer to 0 . Within ambiguous contexts, models rely on social biases to different degrees in different categories, with biases related to physical appearance driving model responses much more than biases related to race and sexual orientation across the models tested. The results for gender-related biases differ for some of the larger models depending on whether an identity label such as "man" is used as opposed to a given name such as "Robert." Although most gender templates are nearly identical, UnifiedQA and DeBERTaV3-Large rely on gender-</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>based biases more often when choosing between gendered names than between identity labels.</p>
<p>For every model, we observe that when the model answers incorrectly in the ambiguous context, the answer aligns with a social bias more than half the time. ${ }^{7}$ This effect becomes more pronounced the more capable the model is on typical NLP benchmarks, and UnifiedQA has the most biased performance in this context, with about $77 \%$ of errors in ambiguous contexts aligning with the targeted social bias.</p>
<p>Within-Category Results Models have lower accuracy and rely on harmful social biases more when the context is underspecified. Crucially, there is always a correct option - the model could have chosen UNKNOWN. Although we see identical accuracy in ambiguous contexts for religion and nationality for UnifiedQA, for example, (see Appendix Figure 5), the bias score reveals different patterns in the model's errors for these two categories: in nationality, target and non-target responses are more evenly distributed between negative and non-negative questions, but in religion, the majority of errors are where the model answers based on a social bias, leading to the high bias score in Figure 3. When the context is disambiguated, the models are generally much more accurate, and so the bias scores move closer to zero.</p>
<p>Per-Label Results Templates are annotated for the stereotype they evoke, so we can further break down within-category results by stereotype and label. To investigate effects of specific biases on model behavior, we take results from UnifiedQA as a case study, averaging across the two accepted answer formats. Figure 4 highlights a subset of results from race/ethnicity, where we see that although the model shows a strong bias against labels such as "Black" and "African American", there are differences among the biases tested, with examples targeting associations to anger and violence showing very low bias and examples targeting criminality, for example, showing higher bias. Further, Figure 4 shows that, although there is a large overlap between groups of people who identify as "Black" and "African American" in a US context, the model's responses are not identical for these different labels, likely due to both differences in</p>
<p><sup id="fnref3:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Bias scores in each category, split by whether the context was ambiguous or disambiguated. Higher scores indicate stronger bias. Bias scores are much higher in ambiguous contexts, indicating that (i) models are unsuccessful at correctly selecting the UNKNOWN option and (ii) models rely on social biases when no answer is clearly specified in the context.
group membership in the QA training data and differences in the contexts in which people invoke the two labels.</p>
<p>Intersectional Biases In the intersectional templates, we compute bias scores within each of the three methods of constructing the non-target label, and the biased answer is always the one that matches on both dimensions manipulated. If models are answering based on intersectional biases, we expect the bias scores to be positive in all comparisons. For example, for the bias that associates Black women with anger, we would expect a biased model to select "the Black woman" more often when answering a question like Who is angry compared to the three contrasting options: (i) "the Black man", (ii) "the White woman", and (iii) "the White man". Appendix Figure 8 shows results for all models on the intersectional templates, broken down by which features match/mismatch with the bias target. The results of this analysis are generally much less consistent than in the non-intersectional categories, possibly due to the higher overlap between the two answer options. Based on these results, we are not able to conclude that we observe model behavior that is sensitive to multiple aspects of an individual's identity. Appendix H provides detailed discussion and exploratory analyses.</p>
<p>Question-Only Baseline We test UnifiedQA on a question-only baseline to assess the model's bias in cases where the target entities are not introduced at all, as this could either increase the rate at which
the model correctly selects UNKNOWN or it could increase the model's reliance on biases. We find that the accuracy and bias scores with this baseline do not substantially differ from those seen with an ambiguous context. See Figure 6 in the appendix.</p>
<h2>7 Discussion</h2>
<p>Interpretation of Bias Scores We note here a strong caveat about the interpretation of these results: Bias scores near zero mean that, in the aggregate, the model tested tended to give an answer including a certain label as often in response to negative questions as it did in response to a nonnegative questions. The scores reflect behavior on just 25 templates in each category and should not be taken as proof that the model is unbiased or less biased, but only that the model does have a directionally consistent bias on this small sample. A second and related caveat is that the data in BBQ is only designed to test biases associated with US English-speaking cultural contexts, and it should not be used as evidence that a model would still look unbiased for contexts from a different culture.</p>
<p>Categories with High Bias Scores Categories such as physical appearance have a high bias score in ambiguous contexts that persist even in disambiguated contexts on some templates, indicating that models are sometimes using social biases in place of recognizing a correct answer that is explicitly provided in the context. A closer look at this category's example sets reveals that biases re-</p>

lated to obesity are primarily responsible for the high bias score in the ambiguous contexts. Table 2 shows the full pattern of results for one such set of examples (all from a single template) when tested on UnifiedQA that demonstrates a very strong bias associating obese individuals with sloppiness.</p>
<p>While it's possible the biased answer is due to an association of words like "sloppy" and "fat," the potential impact of this issue extends beyond representational harm, as given the QA setting, the model is assigning the property of being sloppy to an actual individual because of this bias. Though it can be useful to look at individual template results, it is important to keep in mind that each one represents a very small number of examples from the whole dataset and is susceptible to noise issues that come with having a small number of items (Table 2 shows the results on just 72 examples). These results should be considered as part of a qualitative analysis and, where possible, aggregated with other templates that capture the same bias.</p>
<h2>8 Conclusion</h2>
<p>We present BBQ, a hand-built dataset for measuring how social biases targeting nine different categories manifest in QA model outputs given different kinds of contexts. BBQ covers a broad range of categories and biases relevant in US contexts and allows researchers and model developers to (i) measure in which contexts model behavior is likely to lead to harm, and (ii) begin exploratory analyses of LMs to understand which biases (both individual and intersectional) require mitigation or further study. We show that current models strongly rely on social biases in QA tasks when the contexts are underspecified. Models achieve low accuracy in these ambiguous contexts (no more than $67.5 \%$ ), and their errors reinforce stereotypes up to $77 \%$ of the time. Even when a short context provides a clear answer, both the model's accuracy and outputs are occasionally affected by these social biases, overriding the correct answer to instead select one that perpetuates harm against specific populations.</p>
<h2>9 Ethical Considerations</h2>
<p>Anticipated Risks This benchmark is a tool for researchers to measure social biases in QA models, but a potential risk lies in the way people may use this tool. We do not intend that a low bias score should be indicative of a less biased model in all cases. BBQ allows us to make conclusions about model behavior given very short contexts for biases relevant to the categories that we have included. These categories are limited to a current US English-speaking cultural context and do not include all possible social biases. For a model being used in a very different text domain, it is unlikely that BBQ will provide a valid measure of</p>
<p>bias. There is therefore a risk that researchers may (erroneously) conclude that a low score means their model does not use social biases. We will mitigate this risk by making it explicit in all dataset releases that such a conclusion would be unjustified.</p>
<p>By shifting from measuring likelihoods (as UnQover does) to measuring model outputs, BBQ uses a stricter definition of what counts as biased model behavior. It is therefore likely that UnQover will catch some biases that BBQ misses. However, the increased sensitivity in UnQover comes with the cost of not clearly showing that the presence of model biases will manifest in the actual outputs. In order to demonstrate concretely where model biases will most seriously introduce representational harms, we have selected a technique that will in some cases fail to measure a bias that could still manifest in other domains.</p>
<p>Potential Benefits The conclusions we make about model behavior are only as strong as the tools that we use to study that behavior. We are developing this benchmark with the intention that it serves as a significantly stronger tool than what is currently available, and that it will lead to more reliable and accurate conclusions about the ways that LMs represent and reproduce social biases. BBQ is designed to allow researchers to more clearly identify under what circumstances and against which groups their model is most likely to display bias, facilitating efforts to mitigate those potential harms.</p>

<h2>A Vocabulary details</h2>
<p>Lexical Diversity In many of the templates, words that do not directly affect the overall interpretation of the context and do not affect the bias being probed are randomly perturbed within examples to diminish any unanticipated effects of idiosyncratic lexical relations that are orthogonal to the bias we are testing. Though there are other ways of introducing lexical diversity into examples (e.g., Munro and Morrison (2020) mask target words and use an LM to suggest likely words in context), given the extensive validation needed for these templates, other options would give us less control over the exact form of the examples and risk introducing artifacts that could lower the example's validity.</p>
<p>Identity Labels Nationality labels are adapted from the list used by UnQover; we add regional classifications that mirror the system used by the Wikimedia Foundation. Labels in sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and religion express common identity labels in those categories. In gender identity, the labels are most often "man," and "woman," though some templates are more appropriate with "girl" and "boy," and some use "guy" and "lady." The full list of all identity labels used in BBQ is in the vocabulary. csv file in the project repository.</p>
<p>Occupations Occupation labels are taken from jobs listed within the top/bottom prestige scores, rated on a scale from $0-100$, from the National Opinion Research Center (Nakao and Treas, 1994). We include 12 occupations that were assigned a prestige score below 40 or above 65 and tag them as proxies for low SES and high SES, respectively. In some cases we change the terminology for the job to make it more contemporary, gender-neutral, or generic. For example, the NORC database lists "short order cooks," which we alter to "line cook," "waiters and waitresses," which we alter to "server," and "sales worker, shoes," which we alter to just "sales clerk."</p>
<p>Custom Template Vocabulary In several categories, there are no single identity labels for referring to individuals who are the target of bias. For example, when talking about age, all of the following can refer to older individuals: old, elderly, aging, retired, retiree, 88-year-old, geezer, grandfather. Note that these do not all fit into the same slots in a template format, as some terms are adjectives and others are nouns. They are also not all equal in terms of the registers and contexts in which they are acceptable, as terms like "geezer" are fairly informal (and sometimes derogatory), while terms like "aging" are used in higher registers and are sometimes considered euphemistic. The vocabulary selected for each category in these cases is designed to grammatically fit into the templates in a way that is also semantically coherent and comparable. For example, if one template uses a phrase like "88-year-old", it is only ever compared to a phrase like "23-year-old" and never to a different phrase for a young person (e.g., "teenager", "college freshman"). Templates that use familial terms always do so for both individuals (e.g., "grandmother" paired with "grandchild").</p>
<p>For other templates and categories, particularly ones related to disability status, it is not always possible to use a comparable term to refer to the individual who is not the bias target. Though Blodgett et al. (2021) correctly point out the need for bias measures to use comparable groups, there are instances where this causes problems. For example, if the target of bias is autistic individuals, there is no similarly frequent term used to describe people who are not autistic ("allistic", a relatively recent term, is not in common use and is almost exclusively used in direct contrast with the phrase "autistic"; "neurotypical" has, until recently, been used mostly in clinical settings). In these cases, we choose a neutral descriptor (e.g., "classmate") and rely on people making the pragmatic inference that, for example, if there are two individuals and only one is described as having autism, then the other individual does not have autism. Our validation confirms that humans consistently make this inference. All template-specific vocabulary lists appear in the template files themselves, and are available in the project repository.</p>
<h2>B Proper Name Selection Process</h2>
<p>Names are widely recognized to carry information about both gender and racial identity in the U.S. and are effective ways of measuring bias (Romanov et al., 2019; Darolia et al., 2016; Kasof, 1993). We include names in our data because they represent a way of measuring bias that may not be fully captured just by using identity labels. In the interest of transparency and reproducibility, we describe here the full process and criteria that went into our creation of the name database for BBQ. ${ }^{8}$ All given + family name combinations are synthetic and any overlap with existing individuals is accidental, though quite likely to occur as we select only very common names.</p>
<p>Asian-Associated Names As people in the US often have less strong name-gender associations for names from Asian cultures than for AngloAmerican names, and as names from some Asian cultures are often not gendered (Mair, 2018), we construct stereotypical names for Asian men and women using a gendered Anglophone given name paired with a common Asian-American family name. We restrict this set to names that are com-</p>
<p><sup id="fnref5:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>mon in East Asian countries from which immigrant and first generation Americans commonly use Anglophone names. We add this restriction because it is much more common, for example, for ChineseAmericans to have a given name like "Alex" or "Jenny" (Wu, 1999) compared to Indian-Americans (Cila et al., 2021), making "Jenny Wang" a more likely name than "Jenny Singh."</p>
<p>To determine which given names are most associated with Asian identities, we use both the NYC baby name database (OpenData, 2021) and a brief report of Anglophone names that are more likely than chance to be associated with common Chinese last names (Bartz, 2009). The NYC baby name database uses birth records since 2012 to compile a database of names along with sex and race/ethnicity information for babies whose birth was registered in NYC. From that database, we select names that have a frequency above 200 for which at least $80 \%$ are identified as Asian. This does not give us a sufficient number of name examples, so we additionally use the list compiled by Bartz to reach the 20 names needed in the vocabulary.</p>
<p>We compile our list of Asian family names by using the U.S. Census Bureau's list of the 1000 most common surnames in 2010. ${ }^{9}$ We include names that have a frequency of at least 48 k and for which at least $90 \%$ are associated with Asian individuals, but exclude names common among Indian and other South Asian populations (e.g., "Patel") for reasons detailed above. We do not include any examples in the race/ethnicity category of the dataset that would specifically target South Asian or Indian individuals.</p>
<p>Black-Associated Names Our list of Black given names is based mostly on data from Tzioumis (2018), from which we select given names that are at least $80 \%$ associated with Black individuals. As this source did not lead to a sufficient number of names for our vocabulary, we additionally include given names based on a published list of the most "Black-sounding" and "White-sounding" names (Levitt and Dubner, 2014) and based on the NYC baby name database, selecting names that appear at least 400 times and are at least $80 \%$ likely to be the name of a Black individual. We compile our list of Black family names by using the U.S. Census Bureau's list of the 1000 most common surnames</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
<p>in 2010. We include the top 20 names that are listed as the highest percent Black or African American. All names selected have a frequency of at least 40 k and are associated with Black individuals in at least $42 \%$ of occurrences.</p>
<p>Hispanic/Latinx-Associated Names Our list of Hispanic/Latinx given names is based mostly on data from Tzioumis (2018), from which we select given names that are at least $85 \%$ associated with Hispanic/Latinx individuals and which have a frequency of at least 150 . We also include some names based on the NYC baby name database, selecting names that appear at least 500 times and are at least $85 \%$ likely to be the name of a Hispanic/Latinx individual. We compile our list of Hispanic/Latinx family names by using the U.S. Census Bureau's list of the 1000 most common surnames in 2010. We include names that have a frequency of at least 100k and for which at least $93 \%$ are associated with Hispanic or Latinx individuals.</p>
<p>Middle-Eastern/Arab-Associated Names We were unable to identify a publicly-available and empirically-sound list of names that are associated with Middle-Eastern or Arab identities. Data from the US Census that we were able to use for other identities is not applicable in this case because the US Census often categorizes people of MiddleEastern descent as White and does not include this category in their demographic data. We therefore had to create this database ourselves for BBQ.</p>
<p>We use lists available on Wikipedia to put together both the given and family names associated with Middle-Eastern/Arab individuals. For the given names, we select names from the list of most common given names by country, ${ }^{10}$ choosing names that appear as the most common names in multiple counties from the Middle East and North Africa, or ones that are listed as the most popular in the "Arab world."</p>
<p>For the family names, we use Wikipedia's list of Arabic-language surnames. ${ }^{11}$ The list contains 200 pages, and most pages contain a list of wellknown people with that name. We look at each page to identify which family names are potentially viable for our dataset using the following criteria:</p>

the name does not require further disambiguation, the name is not primarily historical, the name is more often a family name than a given name, and at least 10 notable people are listed on the page as having that name. If all four criteria are met, we randomly check the pages of 10 individuals listed as notable people with that family name to see if their Wikipedia biography page lists them as either residing in a Middle Eastern or Arab-world country or being descended from people from that region. All family names in our dataset have at least $8 / 10$ individuals clearly identified as either Middle Eastern or Arab.</p>
<p>White-Associated Names Our list of White given names is based on data from Tzioumis (2018), from which we select given names that are at least $95 \%$ associated with White individuals and which have a frequency of at least 5000. We compile our list of White family names by using the U.S. Census Bureau's list of the 1000 most common surnames in 2010. We include names that have a frequency of at least 90 k and for which at least $91 \%$ are associated with White individuals.</p>
<h2>C Dataset Size</h2>
<p>Table 3 shows the number of unique examples in each of the categories included in BBQ. Because the intersectional categories require three different types of comparison for each template, these categories are much larger than the others.</p>
<h2>D Template Validation Details</h2>
<p>As human raters may pick up on the artifact that in shorter contexts, the correct answer is always</p>
<p><img alt="img-4.jpeg" src="img-4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5: Overall accuracy on BBQ in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. With the exception of RoBERTa-Base, accuracy is much higher in the disambiguated examples.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN, ${ }^{12}$ we create 72 filler items that break this pattern, with 36 of them being short contexts where UNKNOWN is not the correct answer, and 36 being long contexts where UNKNOWN is the correct answer. The filler items are only used for the human validation task and are not included in the final dataset. In each validation run, a minimum of $13 \%$ of the items are filler items, and all annotators achieved above $85 \%$ accuracy on these items. In the final estimate of human accuracy, we added 50 filler items to the 300 randomly sampled examples from BBQ.</p>
<p>We use a qualification task to identify annotators well-suited to this task. The qualification is open to all MTurk workers located in the US with a HIT approval rate above $98 \%$ and more than 5000 tasks completed. Annotators are warned before beginning the main task that many examples reference potentially upsetting social stereotypes that may include themes of racism, sexism, and violence. We pay annotators $\$ 0.50$ per task, and each task includes 5 examples presented as multiple choice problems. We estimate that each task took up to 2 minutes to complete, ${ }^{13}$ for an effective minimum pay rate of $\$ 15 / \mathrm{hr}$.</p>
<p>As stated in $\S 4$, we edit any templates that fail human validation (i.e., ones on which fewer than $4 / 5$ annotators agree with our assigned gold label)</p>
<p><sup id="fnref6:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>and edit them until they pass. Often, we need to revise the disambiguated templates in order to make the correct answer the only clear answer. For example, in the religion category, a template designed to assess the stereotype of Jews having dual loyalties needed multiple rounds of edits, likely because the bias is specifically about having loyalty to Israel, but our templates could not explicitly include this info, as stating that someone is loyal to Israel would be incompatible with many of the other religions being slotted in. In the ambiguous contexts, most of the templates requiring edits were in the age and physical appearance categories. Several of the age-related biases we test reflect attributes of individuals that are more common in older populations (e.g., hearing loss), likely leading to humans making judgments based on statistical likelihood. In the physical appearance category, many of the templates that needed to be edited were related to obesity, and these were cases where given a context such as "Two people were sitting together at dinner talking about the diets they had started as part of their new year's resolution this year, one overweight and the other thin," many people marked that the correct answer to "Who fails at dieting?" was "the overweight person" rather than UNKNOWN. In this particular example, we edited the template to state that each person had only recently started their diet, and this change caused the template to then pass human validation.</p>
<h2>E Overall Accuracy Results</h2>
<p>We compute basic accuracy of models within both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. In the am-</p>
<p>biguous contexts, UNKNOWN is always the correct answer, and in the disambiguated contexts, the bias target is the correct answer half the time, and the non-target is the correct answer half the time. We observe that models are much more accurate in the disambiguated contexts compared to the ambiguous contexts, however, there are large variations in the accuracy across different categories.</p>
<p>We observe that RoBERTa-Base has a much lower overall accuracy compared to the other models in the disambiguated contexts, but it has a higher accuracy in most cases in the ambiguous contexts. This is due to RoBERTa-Base being more likely than the other models to give an answer of UNKNOWN, regardless of the context. This bias towards the UNKNOWN option is unexpected, and formulating an explanation for this model behavior is outside the scope of the current paper. We note, however, that it does not seem to be any particular tokens or strings that are driving this effect, as Figure 7 shows that RoBERTa-Base is selecting each of the 10 UNKNOWN strings in similar proportions as the other models, it's just doing so in greater number.</p>
<h2>F Question-only Baseline Results</h2>
<p>We present the results of UnifiedQA tested on BBQ with a question-only baseline in Figure 6. We create the question-only baseline by removing the context and only providing the model with the question and the three answer options. In this setting, the UNKNOWN option is always correct, just like in the ambiguous context. We observe that results on this baseline are very similar to results for the ambiguous contexts, both in terms of bias score and accuracy.</p>
<h2>G Distribution of UNKNOWN Answers</h2>
<p>Models can show sensitivity to variations in lexical items that are less meaningful to humans. This is the reason for using 10 different strings to represent the UNKNOWN answer choices. However, collapsing these 10 options into just the UNKNOWN category hides whether any particular strings are driving the observed effects for any of the models. As the UNKNOWN strings are sampled randomly, if there is no strong bias towards or against any particular string, we would expect each model to select the 10 different options at roughly equal rates. Figure 7 shows that this is mostly the case, with each possible string representing between $4.9 \%$ and
<img alt="img-5.jpeg" src="img-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6: UnifiedQA accuracy and bias score results on BBQ with a question-only baseline. Results are not separated by ambiguous/disambiguated contexts because no context was provided. The correct answer in the baseline was always UNKNOWN.
$15.5 \%$ of a given model's total UNKNOWN outputs.</p>
<h2>H Detailed Results from Intersectional Categories</h2>
<p>To present the results for the intersectional categories, we show the results split by what comparison is represented. As described in $\S 6$, the bias target is always the label that reflects both of the relevant identities, and this bias target (e.g., "Black woman") is compared to non-target labels constructed by using a non-target (a) race/ethnicity label (e.g., "Asian woman"), (b) gender identity or SES label (e.g., "Black man"), or (c) both race/ethnicity and gender/SES labels (e.g., "Asian man"). Figure 8 shows the overall results for each of these three comparisons for both of the intersectional categories tested.</p>
<p>It is important to first note that the bias scores in all cases are fairly close to zero, so the differences we measure are not particularly strong compared to the non-intersectional categories. We observe that there is a small effect of the intersection of race by SES for the three higher-performing models (DeBERTaV3-Large and the two UnifiedQA results), as we observe that the bias scores are negative across all three columns in both the ambiguous and disambiguated contexts, though the bias scores are notably higher in the ambiguous contexts. This indicates that in all three comparisons, the bias target is more likely as the response to the negative question, and the non-target is more likely as the response to the non-negative question. As the bias score in the disambiguated contexts is very close to</p>
<p><img alt="img-6.jpeg" src="img-6.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7: The proportion of UNKNOWN answers that were each of the 10 possible strings. The numbers in white at the top of the bars are the total examples on which any UNKNOWN answer was selected by that model.
zero, this may simply be due to noise, or it could be due to the way SES was indicated in the examples. It was often the case that the relevant SES variable (stated either explicitly as something like "on welfare" vs. "very wealthy" or with an occupation as the proxy, as in "taxi driver" vs. "physician.") was introduced in the ambiguous context but not referenced again in the disambiguated context, as such information was very redundant and unnatural sounding. However, in the race by gender examples, the full label was repeated in the disambiguated contexts, perhaps making the gender feature more salient in the context, compared to the SES feature. Table 4 shows representative examples illustrating this.</p>
<p>We include two figures to show the full breakdown of results by bias target for the two intersectional categories, tested just on UnifiedQA as a smaller case study. In each case, results are broken down by the specific bias target, indicated along the y-axis. Overall, we observe mixed results for race by gender (Figure 9), with racial category appearing to drive some negative biases (bias scores are positive when the race of the two individuals mentioned is mismatched), but not when gender is included (bias scores are often negative when the
individuals' gender is mismatched, even when race is also mismatched). There may be a measurable intersectional bias against Middle Eastern women and Asian men, but results are much more mixed in the other identity labels. These findings are suggestive of areas where researchers could probe further.</p>
<p>For race by SES (Figure 10), in the ambiguous contexts we observe what we expect if the model is sensitive to intersectional biases related to Hispanic/Latino and Black/African American individuals with lower SES - in all three comparisons the bias score is positive, most strongly so when both race and SES are mismatched from the target. However, other identity labels do not follow this pattern. It may be that some intersectional biases are more strongly represented in text data, and that the failure to represent some biases tested here is indicative of them being less often represented in the data used to train UnifiedQA. These results are again suggestive of areas that warrant further, more detailed research before clear conclusions can be drawn.</p>
