                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> While large language models exhibit remarkable performance in the Question Answering task, they are susceptible to hallucinations. Challenges arise when these models grapple with understanding multi-hop relations in complex questions or lack the necessary knowledge for a comprehensive response. To address this issue, we introduce the"Decompose-and-Query"framework (D&Q). This framework guides the model to think and utilize external knowledge similar to ReAct, while also restricting its thinking to reliable information, effectively mitigating the risk of hallucinations. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of D&Q: On our ChitChatQA dataset, D&Q does not lose to ChatGPT in 67% of cases; on the HotPotQA question-only setting, D&Q achieved an F1 score of 59.6%. Our code is available at https://github.com/alkaidpku/DQ-ToolQA.</p>

While large language models exhibit remarkable performance in the Question Answering task, they are susceptible to hallucinations.Challenges arise when these models grapple with understanding multi-hop relations in complex questions or lack the necessary knowledge for a comprehensive response.To address this issue, we introduce the "Decompose-and-Query" framework (D&amp;Q).This framework guides the model to think and utilize external knowledge similar to ReAct, while also restricting its thinking to reliable information, effectively mitigating the risk of hallucinations.Experiments confirm the effectiveness of D&amp;Q: On our ChitChatQA dataset, D&amp;Q does not lose to ChatGPT in 67% of cases; on the Hot-PotQA question-only setting, D&amp;Q achieved an F1 score of 59.6%.Our code is available at https://github.com/alkaidpku/DQ-ToolQA .</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Bard (Google, 2023), have made significant inroads into people's work and daily life, substantially enhancing productivity.For LLMs, to produce highquality response for a complex question relies on two essential capabilities: 1) Understanding multihop reasoning in complex questions; 2) Employing external knowledge.</p>
<p>On the one hand, many questions in our daily lives manifest as multi-hop questions.Individuals often pose intricate questions or instructions within a single sentence, lacking necessary descriptions.This necessitates LLMs to proficiently decompose complex questions into multiple subquestions.One potential solution involves employing a sub-question decomposition approach, such as self-ask (Press et al., 2022), which decomposes the question into sub-questions, resolves them independently, and consolidates the answers.However, this approach relies on LLMs' ability to reasonably decompose questions and is typically more suitable for high-quality prompts, such as HotPotQA (Yang et al., 2018) and 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al., 2020).Challenges may arise when dealing with low-quality or unclear prompts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, large language models are prone to hallucinations (Zhang et al., 2023b) and do not have access to up-to-date knowledge (Mallen et al., 2023).Integrating external tools (search engines, knowledge bases, APIs, and etc) with LLMs is a viable approach to address these challenges.Least-to-most (Zhou et al., 2022) decomposes complex question into sub-questions, ultimately leading to a comprehensive answer.However, answering these sub-questions may also bring hallucinations.ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) bridges the gap of reasoning and action, enabling thoughtful interactions with tools.It is noteworthy that the action space of ReAct is limited, and its effectiveness is relatively modest.Shao et al. (2023a) introduced Iter-RetGen, which iteratively follows a two-step process: retrieving relevant knowledge, and generating answer.The approach of Iter-RetGen bears similarities to Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023).However, Iter-RetGen lacks autonomous termination capabilities.</p>
<p>To this, we have proposed a constrained question decomposition strategy that transforms question decomposition into a "Decompose-and-Query" depthfirst search framework.Specifically, we construct a reliable question-answer base, which consists of high-quality question-answer pairs.The model is required to consult it to generate answers for search efficiency.In case of conflicts between the model's knowledge and the reliable QA base, the base's content takes precedence.</p>
<p>We annotated solution trajectories for fine-tuning the model and subsequent predictions.The supervised fine-tuning phase does not involve tool in-vocation; the model processes static dialogue text, learning strategies for invoking tools.During the prediction phase, the model calls external tools to query a reliable QA base.If the LLM realizes during the search process that it has pursued an incorrect path, it can backtrack to previous steps and initiate a new search.Experiments confirm the effectiveness of D&amp;Q: On our ChitChatQA dataset, D&amp;Q does not lose to ChatGPT in 67% of cases; on the HotPotQA question-only setting, D&amp;Q achieved an F1 score of 59.6%.</p>

<p>Related Works</p>
<p>Reasoning.The capacity for logical reasoning is a significant hallmark of intelligence in large language models.Wei et al. (2022) have proposed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) as an effective means to enhance the reasoning abilities of large language models consistently and efficiently.However, incorrect reasoning paths often lead to incorrect reasoning results.To this, Wang et al. (2022) suggest self-consistency, which samples a diverse set of reasoning paths and selects the most consistent answer.Self-consistency, despite its higher decoding cost compared to CoT, still struggles with challenging problem-solving.Yao et al. (2023) introduce a novel approach by extending CoT into Tree-of-Thought (ToT).At each step, the model engages in self-evaluation and, when necessary, looks ahead or backtracks to enhance decision-making abilities.</p>
<p>Similarly, Graph of Thoughts (GoT) framework models information generated by large language models as a graph, allowing for the combination of various LLM thoughts to yield collaborative results, extract insights from the entire thought network, and employ feedback loops to enhance thinking (Besta et al., 2023).Cumulative reasoning (Zhang et al., 2023a) employs proposers, verifiers, and reporters to store intermediate results, facilitating the accumulation of the reasoning process.So far, the reasoning capabilities of large language models have remained understudied.</p>
<p>Augmented Language Models.Large language models are prone to generating hallucinations and do not have access to up-to-date knowledge.Large language models are likely to make factual errors with long-tail knowledge (Kandpal et al., 2022).As a consequence, more and more research is focusing on the use of external tools to enhance large language models.Retrieval-based language model is a classic augmented language model.The idea is to use discrete or dense retrievers to retrieve related context, and then merge the retrieved context into the input.It is possible to match certain capabilities of some of the largest LMs while having less parameters (Schick et al., 2023;Qin et al., 2023).Along with the research on CoT, many studies have integrated external tools into the chain of thought paradigm (Yao et al., 2022;Paranjape et al., 2023;Feng et al., 2023;Press et al., 2022;Shao et al., 2023b;Trivedi et al., 2022;Gou et al., 2023a,b).Synergizing reasoning and invocation tools in LLMs is an underexplored potential research domain.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>This section presents our methodology.We construct ChitChatQA and the reliable QA base, annotate problem-solving trajectories and train a model to invoke tools.</p>
<p>ChitChatQA dataset</p>
<p>We introduce a novel dataset, ChitChatQA, to assess the capabilities of large language models in handling complex and diverse questions.Specifically, we collected single-turn dialogue data from real scenarios in the KwaiTalk application.The dataset comprises authentic questions posed by users and responses generated by large language models.We denote the original question-answer data as S 0 = (q i , a i ) N 0 .We performed data cleaning on the collected question-answer dataset to eliminate noise.Specifically, we initially utilized a grammatical correction model to filter out questions with low scores, followed by an intent recognition model to screen for questions with ambiguous intent.During the data cleaning process, we applied a lower intent recognition threshold to retain data with unclear intents.The detailed procedure for data cleaning can be found in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 Reliable QA Database Creation Require: S 0 , ϵ 1 , ϵ 2 , GEC, Intent Ensure: S 1: S = new Set() 2: for q i in S 0 do 3:</p>
<p>if GEC(q i ) &gt; ϵ 1 and Intent(q i ) &gt; ϵ 2 then 4:</p>
<p>S.Add(q i ) 5:</p>
<p>end if 6: end for 7: return S</p>
<p>Reliable QA Base</p>
<p>We constructed a reliable question-answer base, which consists of high-quality question-answer pairs.Similar to Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022), all question-answer pairs are considered beyond doubt.The model is required to consult the database to generate answers.In case of conflicts between the model's knowledge and the reliable QA base, the base's content takes precedence.We believe that this makes the model less prone to hallucinations and more robust.</p>
<p>In dialogue system, users may inquire about similar questions, such as "please provide me with a Python code for Bubble Sort" or "tell me the names of the Eight Great Masters of the Tang and Song dynasties".These generic questions are frequent.Preliminary analysis shows that these questions exhibit high quality.Therefore, we selected the top 50,000 questions based on their frequency as benchmark questions for the reliable QA base.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the pretraining data for large language models comprises noise, the outputs for the same question may vary.We categorized the questions into several types.Objective factual questions demand precise and unique responses.For these questions, we employ a majority voting approach to determine the response.Subjective opinion questions pertain to opinions or perspectives on certain matters, and for such questions, we use an opinion aggregation method to determine the response.Consequently, we designed an answer aggregation model to consolidate diverse viewpoints.</p>
<p>The answer aggregation model is essentially a large language model through supervised finetuning.We manually annotated 5,000 answer ag- For examples of answer aggregation, please refer to Appendix A.</p>
<p>Trajectory Annotation</p>
<p>To train the model to invoke external tools, we need gather a sufficient amount of data for supervised fine-tuning.Both ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit excellent performance in data annotation (Ubani et al., 2023).Based on preliminary experiments, the annotation capabilities of ChatGPT are significantly inferior to those of GPT-4.The annotation framework is illustrated in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Adaptive Constraint Question Decomposition</p>
<p>We employ imitation learning using data that involves multiple iterations of calling an external retriever for fine-tuning large language models.We use LLaMA2-13b as base model.The training is conducted in a multi-turn dialogue format, wherein, in each training round, only the output of that round's dialogue is retained, and the rest is masked.For more details, please refer to the Experimental Section.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Our primary experiments consist of two parts.To evaluate question decomposition capability, experiments were conducted on the ChitChatQA dataset.</p>
<p>To assess the effectiveness of our approach in answering multi-hop questions, experiments were conducted using the academic dataset HotPotQA.</p>
<p>ChitChatQA</p>
<p>We utilized a set of 200 training instances and conducted supervised fine-tuning in a multi-turn dialogue format on LLaMA2-13b.The supervised fine-tuning phase does not involve tool invocation; the model processes static dialogue text, learning strategies for invoking tools.During the prediction phase, the model calls external tools to query the reliable QA base.We defined three tools:</p>
<p>[QuestionRetriever] for retrieving related questions from the QA base, [AnswerRetriever] for retrieve answer to a question, and [Finish] indicating task termination.ChitChatQA's data stems from real dialogue interactions with the Kuaishou dialogue model, with a test set comprising 100 instances.We employed the Kuaishou dialogue model's output as a baseline, noted as "KwaiDialog", and compared it with Chat-GPT's output.Model evaluation was conducted through human assessments labeled as win/tie/lose, as shown in  ReAct Utilizes Search and Lookup tools iteratively to provide external information for large language models (Yao et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Self-Ask Requires the model to ask itself and use the answers by the search engine to enhance the model (Press et al., 2022).</p>
<p>IRCoT Decomposes questions through Chain-of-Thought, retrieves results using a retriever, then concatenates the question and reference context to a more robust language model (GPT-3).</p>

<p>We conducted experiments on the HotPotQA dataset.Similar to most baseline models, our configuration was question-only: providing only the question without accompanying references, allowing the model to autonomously invoke external tools for information retrieval.We defined three tools: [ArticleRetriever] for querying entries in Wikipedia, [PageRetriever] for retrieving pages corresponding to the entries, and [Finish] representing task termination.The specific implementations of these tools were achieved through calls to the MediaWiki * API.We utilized 200 training instances and performed supervised fine-tuning in a multi-turn dialogue format on LLaMA2-13b.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the D&amp;Q result of HotPotQA.We can draw the following conclusions: Backtracking enhances the model's retrieval capability.Although ReAct supports acquiring reference information through observation, this approach is, in practice, greedy.Specifically, ReAct does not explicitly backtrack but tends toward random walks.In contrast, D&amp;P stores intermediate states, allowing it to retreat to the previous state in case of retrieval failure, significantly enhancing retrieval capability.</p>
<p>Tool invocation can compensate for parameter limitations.In comparison to IRCoT's GPT-3 (175B), our generative model is LLaMA-13B.Through supervised fine-tuning, D&amp;Q can achieve results comparable to IRCoT.This indicates that smaller models, through supervised fine-tuning to learn tool invocation, can achieve performance comparable to larger models.</p>

<p>Table 3: Recall of retrieval.</p>
<p>We limit the retriever's calls to a maximum of 10, with each call returning up to 5 relevant entries.Therefore, the model can return a maximum * https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Search/ of 50 entries when generating responses.We calculate the recall by retrieving 50 entries using the initial question as a baseline.We tested the recall of D&amp;Q's retrieval ability and compared it with the baseline, resulting in an increase from 52.3% to 68.8%.This indicates that considering context contributes to more accurate tool invocation.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose the "Decompose-and-Query" framework (D&amp;Q) to address the susceptibility of large language models to hallucinations by guiding them to utilize external knowledge within a constrained and reliable context.Through experiments on the ChitChatQA dataset and the Hot-PotQA question-only setting, D&amp;Q demonstrated competitive performance against existing models.Our contributions include the introduction of the ChitChatQA dataset, a novel framework for constrained problem decomposition, and the achievement of a notable F1 score on HotPotQA.These findings underscore the potential of D&amp;Q in enhancing the robustness and performance of large language models in question-answering tasks.</p>
