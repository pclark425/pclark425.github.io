                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Developing non-invasive molecular markers for early risk assessment of Alzheimer’s disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease, with no standard biomarker(s) to detect or confirm its risk at an early stage. The prevalence of AD increases exponentially worldwide in people of ages over 65 and older. Current improvements have unveiled the disease’s pathophysiology and clinical diagnostic tests, targeting the neurological changes (neurodegeneration, amyloid precursor protein metabolism and tangle pathology) with precise PET/MRI imaging and xMAP/SIMOA (Multiplex simultaneous detection/single molecule array) to identify and quantify β-amyloids (Aβ40, Aβ42), total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) proteins in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients. However, their utility for diagnosis in routine clinical practice is still challenging because of cost, accessibility, standardization, procedural limitation, and regulatory approval. Further research is needed to establish affordable, patient-friendly, easy, quick, and robust biomarkers for early AD detection, progression, and therapeutic management. Research on blood-based preclinical diagnosis and clinical practice for AD has advanced significantly in the last decade. Emerging literature supports the importance of new molecular biomarkers and signature genes from blood to detect and predict AD in advance. This review examines the potential applications of these blood-based target biomarkers for early disease detection, co-morbid condition risk prediction, and treatment management of AD.</p>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease, with no standard biomarker(s) to detect or confirm its risk at an early stage.The prevalence of AD increases exponentially worldwide in people of ages over 65 and older.Current improvements have unveiled</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the fastest growing causes of disability and death in elderly persons.It is the sixth leading cause of mortality and the fifth leading cause of death in people 65 years and older in the USA ("2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures, " 2021).More than 50 million people are living with dementia and this number is estimated to triple to 152 million by 2050 worldwide (Vos et al., 2020).The incidence of clinically diagnosed AD varies from 2.0 to 16.8 new cases per thousand in USA, Europe, Japan, and China.The annual regional AD incidence rates were estimated to be 10.5 for North America (Rajan et al., 2019), 8.8 for Western Europe (Niu et al., 2017), 9.2 for Latin America (Gustavsson et al., 2023), and 8.0 for China (Chan et al., 2013) and its western-Pacific neighbors (Montgomery et al., 2018).It is difficult to document the actual prevalence of AD in underdeveloped and low-income countries due to the lack of accurate diagnosis and lack of record keeping in many cases, as most studies are based on a clinical diagnosis, either of dementia, irrespective of etiology, or a clinical diagnosis of probable or possible AD, without biomarker confirmation (Cao et al., 2020) (Fig. 1A).Furthermore, there is a variation in the methods for measuring biomarkers and clinical symptoms, which may explain part of differences in reported prevalence estimates globally (Gauthier et al., 2021) The recent epidemiological studies show that individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) have a much higher risk of developing AD earlier in life than non-diabetic persons (Nguyen et al., 2020;Noreen et al., 2018;Weaver, 2023).T2DM ranks as the seventh most common cause of death.The global diabetes prevalence is estimated to be 9.3 % (463 million people), expected to 10.2 % (578 million) by 2030 and 10.9 % (700 million) by 2045 (CDC, 2024;Saeedi et al., 2019;Vos et al., 2020).In fact, AD and T2DM are common in the elderly, and their mortality has steadily increased (Athanasaki et al., 2022) (Fig. 1B).Recent data has estimated the death rate of AD in the USA was 33.26 and diabetes was 10.58 per 100,000 population, but in Japan it was only 7.87 and 1.35 respectively (CDC, 2024).The death rates due to AD and T2DM in developed and underdeveloped middle-and low-income countries are different, as shown in Fig. 1C.</p>
<p>AD is generally categorized into two clinical subtypes, familial AD, and sporadic AD.According to Alzheimer's Association report, 4.5 % of AD are familial and more than 95 % are sporadic ("2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures, " 2021).Although both types of AD develop similar pathological phenotypes (plaques, tangles, synaptic impairments, and neuronal loss), although the factors triggering the neuronal integrity in the brain are completely different.Clinical manifestations of AD involve progressive decline in memory and other cognitive functions.The pathological accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in familial AD is mainly caused by autosomal-dominant mutations in one of three genes: amyloid precursor -protein (AβPP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), or presenilin-2 (PSEN2).But sporadic AD is a more complicated and multi-factorial disorder caused by an array of genetic, epigenetic, and lifestyle variables (Aubert et al., 2015;Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010).Many sporadic AD patients are elderly individuals who frequently suffer from a variety of co-morbidities like diabetes, stroke, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, depression, chronic liver disease, and renal dysfunctions that can greatly add to the complexity underlying the pathogenesis and disease progression (Baglietto-Vargas et al., 2016;Weaver, 2023).</p>
<p>The pathological hallmarks of AD include the accumulation of extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which proceeds to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal degenerations in the brain, manifested into different clinical stages of the disease (Dubois et al., 2021;Ferguson et al., 2021).Preclinical AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) comprise a long asymptomatic phase (≥20 years), in which the individuals have evidence of AD with no evidence of cognitive or functional decline (Porsteinsson et al., 2021).The US-FDA approved six clinical stages to set guidelines for AD early diagnosis, assessment, and treatment (Edgar et al., 2019).It is difficult to identify clinical dementia without investigating biomarkers, whether the dementia is caused by AD or any other neurodegenerative disease (Fig. 2A).The National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) consortium suggested using in vivo biomarkers (amyloid-β-tauneurodegeneration (ATN)) to determine AD (Jack et al., 2018).ATN status is unequivocally classified as (i) A−T−N− as normal, (ii) A−T−N− as Alzheimer's pathological change, (iii) A+T−N− as AD, (iv) A+T−N + as AD, (v) A+T−N + as Alzheimer's and concomitant suspected non-AD pathological change, (vi) A−T−N− as non-AD pathological change, (vii) A−T−N + as non-AD pathological change, and (viii) A−T + N + as non-AD pathological change (Dubois et al., 2021).ATN status abnormalities can identify AD even in the absence of clinical symptoms (Bouwman et al., 2022).</p>
<p>The ATN classification in the 2018 NIA-AA research framework has been recently modified and updated in response to novel biomarkers that can be used to diagnose and stage AD (Jack et al., 2024).The new framework emphasized Core and non-core fluid analytes and PET imaging for diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical staging̶ addressing biological stages from early onset to late change, including clinical co-pathologies.Core 1 (A-T 1 ) biomarkers embrace Aβ42/40 in CSF/plasma and amyloid PET imaging for Aβ proteinopathy and p-tau181, p-tau231 in CSF, and p-tau217 in plasma for phosphorylated and secreted AD tau.Core 2 (T 2 ) biomarkers include MTBR-tau243 in CSF/plasma and tau PET imaging.Furthermore, NfL (N), GFAP (I) and α-synuclein (S) levels in CSF and plasma, as well as MRI and FDG PET imaging (V) have been advocated for non-specific AD pathogenesis and non-AD co-pathology.These criteria are not meant to give step-by-step clinical practice guidelines or particular treatment protocols, but rather act as general concepts to inform the identification of AD and grading based on the latest research (Jack et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Core 1 fluid biomarkers are more effective thanamyloid PET imaging for early detection of AD in patients without symptoms (Janelidze et al., 2021).Although, accuracy estimates for an amyloid PET or CSF reference standard utilizing a single preselected cut point or area under the receiver operating curve range from 60 % to greater than 90 % (Therriault et al., 2023).CSF biomarkers can detect changes in the disease process in AD earlier than imaging biomarkers.Blood-based biomarkers for AD appeared not accessible, but convincing evidence from novel high-sensitivity tests have emerged with remarkable consistency across diverse cohorts, regardless of the precise analytical method used (Teunissen et al., 2022).Despite significant differences in diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity between plasma ptau and Aβ42/40 tests, p-tau217 accurate plasma assays demonstrated clinical robustness through high-precision tests (Rabe et al., 2023;Thijssen et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Over the last three decades, researchers have identified the APOE gene as the major genetic risk factor for dementia and late-onset AD (sporadic AD), accounting for more than 95 % of cases ("2021 Alzheimer's disease facts and figures, " 2021;Huynh et al., 2017).The APOE gene contains multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter the coding area of the ApoE protein.ApoE has three frequent variants: ApoE2 (cys112, cys158), ApoE3 (cys112,arg158),and ApoE4 (arg112,arg158).In all populations, the ApoE ε3 allele is the most common, with a frequency range of 50-90 %.The risk of AD is 3.7 times higher for a single copy of the ε4 allele compared to ε3/ε3, and 12 times more for two copies.(Zhang et al., 2023;Zhen et al., 2018).APOE genotyping is a useful tool that can assist in diagnosing probable late-onset AD in symptomatic adults.However, it is not recommended to screen asymptomatic people or their family members because many individuals with APOE ε4 alleles never develop AD ("Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Genotype -Clinical test -NIH Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) -NCBI," n.d.).The ApoE protein influences AD pathogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, from its effects on the blood-brain barrier, the innate immune system, and the synaptic function to the excessive accumulation of Aβ (Ando et al., 1999;Silva et al., 2019).The lipid binding capacity of ApoE is influenced by the cholesterol transporter ABCA1, and there is evidence that certain lipids, including unsaturated free fatty acids and cholesterol, may increase the susceptibility to Aβ formation and have been seen in patients with early-stage AD (Kao et al., 2020).The most detrimental to the brain are thought to be Aβ40 and Aβ42, depending on how many amino acids are present in Aβ.The presence of amyloid in PET scans or a low Aβ42 or high Aβ42/40 ratio in CSF differentiates AD from other dementias (Bouwman et al., 2022;Silva et al., 2019).Excessive Aβ also interacts with signaling pathways, causing the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) in the axonal region of the neuron to become hyperphosphorylated.This protein then clumps together to form NFTs in the brain, and thereby leading to declining cognitive performance (Gholami, 2023).The primary factor influencing the early pathogenesis of AD is neuroinflammation, which is mediated by cytokines and chemokines in astrocytes and microglia.Microglia and astrocytes can activate molecular pathways that ultimately result in pathological changes, including axonal damage, synaptic failure, loss of brain plasticity, brain proteinopathies and neurodegeneration (Rajendran and Paolicelli, 2018;Sarkar et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Therefore, it's crucial to concentrate on the preclinical and MCI stages, where early intervention and management of modifiable risk factors could potentially lower the risk of onset or delay the progression of disease.Consequently, it is imperative to focus on the preclinical and MCI phases, since early intervention and treatment of modifiable risk factors may reduce the likelihood of disease onset or postpone its progression (Ferrari and Sorbi, 2021;Heneka et al., 2024).Zhang et al. (2018) reviewed data from 16 cohort studies and reported that NSAID use is moderately protective against early stages of AD compared to control (19 % risk reduction).Recent advances in non-invasive MRI and PET imaging have greatly facilitated study of inflammatory mechanisms in vivo at both pre-clinical and clinical stages of AD (Zhou et al., 2021).Neurodegenerative loss of neurons and synapses causes reduced cortical thickness on MRI and FDG hypometabolism (Liu P et al., 2022).CSF biomarkers that represent additional biological processes in AD, like neuroinflammation (GFAP), axonal damage and synaptic dysfunction (NfL), and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (sPDGFRβ), have recently surfaced (Jack et al., 2024;Zhang Q et al., 2024).These variables may play a role in early AD pathogenesis via synaptic aberrant pruning and rapid abnormal APP metabolism, respectively.During the preclinical stage of AD, elevated GFAP levels in CSF, which imply increased astrocyte reactivity, are an early event (Zheng et al., 2023).Furthermore, some studies have identified elevated CSF cytokines as risk factors for the conversion of MCI to AD or predictors of the rate of cognitive decline and disease progression (Brosseron et al., 2014;Zhang J et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Many approaches have been made over the last 50 years to identify and establish novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and evaluation of AD.It was extremely challenging to identify Aβ, Aβ42/40, and tau protein in the CSF of patients after first separating Aβ plaques from NFTs in the post-mortem brain.The advancement of science also led to the development of new technologies to diagnose and distinguish AD, dementia, and neurodegeneration by PET/MRI imaging and gene expression (Fig. 2B).The recent ATN research framework for AD diagnosis is based on MRI, PET scan, and CSF analysis (Bouwman et al., 2022;Jack et al., 2018;Jack et al., 2024).However, the utilization of these tests in clinical practice is limited, particularly in low-income nations, due to their high cost and lack of necessary infrastructure (Huma et al., 2022).The International Working Group (IWG) recommended that the clinical diagnosis of AD still be based on the patient's clinical phenotypic presentation to circumvent the limitations of the 2018 recommendation (Dubois et al., 2021).The NIA-AA Research Framework stated that the inheritance of an APOE ε4 allele does not identify AD or its pathologic change, nor does it point to a specific stage of the disease (Jack et al., 2018).As a result, it is neither listed nor suggested as a marker for overcoming the misdiagnosis of AD.But research is still ongoing to find reliable blood biomarkers for AD diagnosis.The development of affordable, readily available, and quick diagnostic biomarkers for AD is thus of paramount importance.The goal of this review is to draw attention to the potential of developing molecular and genetic markers from blood</p>
<p>AD and T2DM Crosstalk</p>
<p>The Rotterdam Study (1999), which investigated how T2DM affected the likelihood of dementia and AD, revealed that T2DM nearly doubled the risk of these conditions (Ott et al., 1999).After reviewing eight long-term population-based studies, it has been found that there is a 50 %-100 % greater chance of AD in people with T2DM (Biessels et al., 2006).A subsequent meta-analysis, with a total of 6184 people with diabetes and 38,530 without diabetes, revealed that the overall relative risk of AD for people with T2DM was 1.5 (95 % CI: 1.2-1.8)(Cheng et al., 2012;Li et al., 2015), suggesting an important association.Contemporary epidemiological research suggests that diabetes substantially raises the risk of AD, indicating that diabetes (T2DM) may be a causal component in the pathophysiology of AD (Baglietto-Vargas et al., 2016;Noreen et al., 2018;Weaver, 2023).</p>
<p>Insulin resistance (IR) during T2DM influences the metabolic processes of neurons and glial cells, promotes vascular lesions, sustains chronic inflammation, and leads to dementia (Pakdin et al., 2022).This has led to the supposition that AD is a metabolic disease as research indicates that both diseases have impairments in the brain's ability to use glucose, as well as hyperinsulinemia and hypercholesterolemia (Ağagündüz et al., 2023;Scheltens et al., 2021).Moreover, carriers of the APOE ε4 allele appear to have an exceptionally strong association between these two diseases.ApoE plays a key role in lipid metabolism, intersecting with diabetes by influencing insulin sensitivity, beta cell function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipid homeostasis (by participating in the catabolism of triacylglycerolrich lipoproteins) (Zhang et al., 2023).Based on this, it is hypothesized that AD and T2DM have similar pathophysiology and that AD is more common in T2DM patients.This section provides a brief overview of how the three primary pathogenetic criteria of AD the generation of Aβ, Tau phosphorylation, and brain neurodegeneration and neuronal loss-are affected by T2DM and lipid metabolites and how they exacerbate the disease (Fig. 3).</p>
<p>Amyloid Beta (Aβ)</p>
<p>Aβ peptide is a product (40-42 amino acids) of a proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP).Aβ is involved in several physiological processes including neuronal survival and synaptic plasticity.An imbalance in this peptide's synthesis and clearance leads to excess accumulation in the brain, which might serve as the trigger for the development of AD (Ciccone et al., 2020;Huynh et al., 2017).High blood cholesterol level in metabolic diseases like T2DM, obesity, etc. not only activates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by regulating APP proteolytic secretases but also regulates Aβ metabolism including its fibrillation, transportation, degradation, and clearance processes (Beel et al., 2010;Kao et al., 2020;Martins, 2017).Recent studies in AD patients have demonstrated that Insulin resistance (IR) in brain is a common feature of AD and T2DM, with reduced insulin receptor expression, Insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and signaling (Chatterjee and Mudher, 2018;Salas and De Strooper, 2019).AD postmortem brain has also shown significant decreases in insulin and IGF-1, and ≥ 80 % of AD patients develop T2DM in their lifetime (Zhang et al., 2021).Insulin resistance (IR) affects the metabolic processes of neurons and glial cells, induces vascular lesions, maintains chronic inflammation, and exaggerates Aβ accumulation in the brain (Martins, 2017;Pakdin et al., 2022).There is multiple evidence that APOE gene polymorphism contributes to the development of T2DM and AD by means of its function in lipid metabolism, activation of APP, and cholesterol transport in brain (Varma et al., 2018;Xiao et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Tau Protein</p>
<p>Tau is a neuronal microtubule-associated protein, primarily found in axons.It exerts an essential role in the equilibrium of microtubule-dependent axonal transport of organelles (Fossati et al., 2019).IR and/or impaired insulin-signaling results in a significant decrease in phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway signaling and a subsequent increase in the activation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3β), which leads to tau hyperphosphorylation (p-tau) and self-aggregation (De La Monte, 2012; Kandimalla et al., 2017).In addition to IR, abnormal glucose metabolism plays a role in the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), especially O-GlcNAcylation, which expedite the tau pathophysiology (Akhter et al., 2017;Hobday and Parmar, 2021).Over-regulation of RAGE (AGE receptor) also facilitates the circulating Aβ to pass from blood to brain (influx) while antagonizing lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1)-mediated efflux across the blood-brain barrier (Cai et al., 2016;Prasad, 2019).Moreover, increased p-tau (due to phosphorylation, aggregation, and proteolysis) and Aβ accumulation disrupt the autophagy-lysosome cycle due to reduction of autophagy and mitophagy proteins and result in the proliferation of dysfunctional mitochondria in neurons (neuroplasticity), as extensively reported in AD (Barthélemy et al., 2023;Reddy and Oliver, 2019).</p>
<p>Neurodegeneration</p>
<p>It is now a well-established fact that oxidative stress and neuroinflammation plays a significant role in AD as well as T2DM.Many different mechanisms are involved in the generation of oxidative stress, including IR, glucose auto-oxidation, decreased antioxidant defense enzymes, metabolic anomalies caused by excessive glucose and cholesterol levels, and mitochondrial damage (Akhter et al., 2017;Jha et al., 2017;Weaver, 2023;Xiao et al., 2022).Mitochondrial abnormalities have been proposed as a potential link between T2DM, AD and neurodegeneration (Baglietto-Vargas et al., 2016;Ferguson et al., 2021).The TREM2 gene (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) increased 2.9 % risk ratio for the development of AD (odds ratio, 2.92; 95 % CI reported by Jonsson et al., 2013).Its deficiency impairs the ability of Aβ deposits to be removed (Silva et al., 2019).The TREM2 receptor influences microglial activity by inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines in reaction to Aβ plaques or cytotoxic P-tau (Li and Zhang, 2018;Sarkar et al., 2024;Wang et al., 2015).Epidemiological studies also support that individuals with elevated blood glucose have an increased risk of developing dementia and a rapid conversion from MCI to AD (Athanasaki et al., 2022;Morris et al., 2019;Nho et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Markers in the Early Detection of AD</p>
<p>Clinical symptoms, cognitive testing, and other dementia etiologies (Lewy body dementia, Epileptic dementia, Huntingtons chorea, multiple sclerosis, head trauma etc.) are the main methods of diagnosing AD in most of the countries.The assessment of Aβ40, Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau in CSF shows AD state, while Aβ-PET and tau-PET imaging tests indicate the pathologic changes in the brain in AD patients (Frisoni et al., 2017;Robinson et al., 2015).The NIA-AA (2018) guidelines have established a research framework approach to the diagnosis of AD, comprising three components: Aβ deposition (A), tau pathology (T), and neurodegeneration or neuronal damage (N) (Jack et al., 2018).The development of amyloid PET/MRI imaging and CSF biomarkers has advanced over the past few decades, making it possible to identify amyloid alterations in the brain before death, which is a prerequisite for diagnosing AD (Dubois et al., 2021;Porsteinsson et al., 2021).¹8 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET hypometabolism, T1-weighted MRI atrophy and elevated CSF neurofilament light chain (NFL) protein is now considered as positive neurodegenerative CSF biomarkers (Knopman et al., 2018).These examinations cannot be used for the largescale population screening, due to the lack of high-throughput capacity.Particularly in low-income nations, the lack of infrastructure, high cost of PET and MRI examinations and invasiveness of CSF sampling restrict their utility in clinical practice.Different research groups also use many methods for quantifying PET/MRI images (Hall et al., 2017;Huma et al., 2022;Maass et al., 2017).There is a critical missing opportunity for a simple, radiation-free, less invasive, resource-and time-intensive diagnostic approach to lower the under-and misdiagnosed rates of AD and non-AD dementia in those exhibiting signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment (Hu et al., 2022).The current state of liquid biomarkers for early AD diagnosis and risk prediction, as well as future development prospects, are covered in the next section.</p>
<p>CSF Biomarkers</p>
<p>Ever since their identification in CSF, amyloid protein (Seubert et al., 1992) and the tau protein (Vandermeeren et al., 1993) continue to be considered as the gold standard biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD.CSF is the most valuable biological fluid for expressing cellular functions in the central nervous system due to its direct contact with the extracellular space of the brain tissues.Brain proteins have a lower potential for systemic modification or metabolic breakdown in the CSF than in any other biological fluid (Bouwman et al., 2022;Mankhong et al., 2022).Formerly, Aβ42, P-tau181 (tau hyperphosphorylated at threonine 181), and T-tau (total tau) in the CSF were tests for the detection of AD.Recently, it has been recognized that Aβ42/40 and the P-tau181/Aβ42 ratios and P-tau205 and P-tau217 can accurately identify AD using a variety of advanced techniques, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoassay with electrochemiluminescence detection (ECLIA), chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA), and single molecule array (Simoa) (Barthélemy et al., 2023;Lantero-Rodriguez et al., 2024;Zetterberg and Blennow, 2021) (Table 1).Compared to non-AD individuals, the CSF concentration of Aβ42/40 has decreased, but the concentrations of P-tau181 and P-tau181/Aβ42 remain elevated in AD (Iaccarino et al., 2023).In many nations, the lumbar puncture technique, which is used for collecting CSF, is not always feasible because of a lack of infrastructure, skilled technical personnel, or patient willingness (Huma et al., 2022).Lumbar puncture is also not advisable for elderly patients who have other serious comorbidities, including in the advanced stage of AD.</p>

<p>Table 1 highlights the evaluation and validation of liquid biomarkers in AD using various methodologies.Besides proteinopathies (Aβ and tau pathologies), AD can originate from other disorders that interact and work together to trigger the fastest stages of protein accumulation and rates of cognitive decline.Researchers have identified promising bloodbased biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, severity, and treatment of AD.Peripheral blood contains detectable levels of Aβ, tau, NfL, APOE, BACE1, and miRNA (Mankhong et al., 2022;Mondal et al., 2024;Noreen et al., 2018;Toden et al., 2020).Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have examined Aβ 1-42 measurements in plasma, demonstrating that plasma Aβ peptide concentrations are linked to the occurrence of AD-type dementia, the likelihood of MCI to AD progression, brain Aβ levels, or structural cortical atrophy on MRI scans (Hu et al., 2022;Varma et al., 2018;Verberk et al., 2022;West et al., 2021;Zhang et al., 2023).Blood Aβ42/40 and p-tau (P-tau181, P-tau217) are now being started in several countries to diagnose AD (Fogelman et al., 2023;Monane et al., 2023;Schindler et al., 2019).The PrecivityAD ® test successfully measures the plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and ApoE isoform-specific peptides (to infer the APOE genotype) using a high-resolution liquid chromatography mass spectrometry platform (Kirmess et al., 2021).Hu and his colleagues (2022) examined 253 plasma samples for Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations, as well as ApoE peptides, and the results were validated using PET scans.According to their research, this blood biomarker test may help diagnose AD by differentiating between those whose brain Aβ-positive PET results and people whose brain Aβ-negative PET results.Shen and his group (2021) reported the correlation between brain amyloid, tau PET, FDG PET and plasma p-tau181.Plasma p-tau181 is unquestionably the single blood biomarker that can differentiate AD patients from non-AD dementia (Lewy body dementia, Epileptic dementia, Huntingtons chorea, multiple sclerosis, head trauma etc.).Apart from Aβ, tau, and ApoE, two other biomarkers have been identified in plasma: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL).GFAP and NfL have been linked to multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and non-AD dementia, among other neurodegenerative disorders (Irwin et al., 2017;Verberk et al., 2022).In clinical settings, the lack of reference values substantially limits the use of plasma Aβ40/42, p-tau181, p-tau205, p-tau217, NfL and GFAP as biomarkers for AD (Lantero-Rodriguez et al., 2024;Mankhong et al., 2022;Zecca et al., 2018).Recently, a multi-model blood-based biomarker profile has been proposed for early diagnosis, staging and treatment for AD (Jack et al., 2024).Ultrasensitive methods allow for accurate assessment of CNS proteins in blood.The sensitivity and specificity of detection could be enhanced by a comprehensive multi-model biomarker that incorporates genetics and demographics with core, non-core, and biomarkers of non-AD copathology (Robinson et al., 2021).It would also recognize and treat common age-related brain diseases that explain dementia or cognitive impairment in older adults other than AD (Power et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Gene (Network)-based Biomarkers</p>
<p>The characterization of the autosomal genetic landscape of AD and related dementia offers an exceptional opportunity to gain deeper insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms involved.Additionally, this information is valuable for identifying potential AD risk genes.The APOE gene was first discovered to be linked to AD in 1993.Since then, research has identified APOE, more specifically the increased expression of APOE ε4 as the major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, accounting for more than 99 % of sporadic cases (Huynh et al., 2017;Kao et al., 2020).APOE ε4 upregulation has been linked to elevated cholesterol levels.Individuals with the APOE ε3/ APOE ε4 and APOE ε4/APOE ε4 genotypes are at a higher risk of developing AD than APOE ε4 non-carriers (Zhang et al., 2023;Zhen et al., 2018).Moreover, T2DM patients with one or two APOE ε4 alleles exhibited a considerably increased risk of dementia than those who did not have T2DM or the APOE ε4 allele (Tonyan et al., 2022;Umegaki, 2014).APOE ε4 has been demonstrated to have increased Aβ deposition, which contributes to decreased plaque clearance as well as raised oxidative stress and synaptic dysfunction (Saykin et al., 2015;Silver et al., 2012).It has been responsible for transporting cholesterol and phospholipids in the brain, and elevated cholesterol is the key factor for Aβ formation in the early stages of AD (Raefsky et al., 2018).A blood test with APOE genotyping could be helpful in diagnosing late-onset AD in adults who are showing symptoms.However, having the e4 allele doesn't mean that a person will develop AD, and many patients who don't have the allele also develop the disease later.In fact, the NIA-AA consortium clearly mentioned that the existence of AD cannot be determined only by the analysis of APOE genetic material since APOE ε4 is neither essential nor sufficient for the development of AD (Jack et al., 2018).</p>
<p>In addition to APOE, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have examined the risk factors for AD associated with APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, BACE1, TREM2, CDC27, SORL1, CLU and ABCA7.Excess Aβ and plague formation in the brain is closely linked with APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, and BACE1 ( (Das and Yan, 2017;O'Brien and Wong, 2011;Safieh et al., 2019).SORL1 was lowered in AD patients than normal and overexpression of SORL1 reduced the production of Aβ (Yin et al., 2015).The lipid-sensing function of TREM2 enables it to maintain the microglial response necessary for clustering and may contribute to enhanced plaque phagocytosis to aggravate neurodegeneration (Li and Zhang, 2018;Rauchmann et al., 2019).Aβ production and clearance are directly affected by ABCA7, a regulator gene of cholesterol homeostasis (De Roeck et al., 2019).Moreover, APOE, CLU, SORL1, ABCA7, IGF2BP2, TCF7L2, MC4R, CDC123, and IGF2BP2 are among the genes linked to both lipid homeostasis and T2DM that share common links with AD (Bellenguez et al., 2022;Mondal et al., 2023aMondal et al., , 2024;;Morgan et al., 2022;Noreen et al., 2020;Puthiyedth et al., 2016).Some recent studies reveal disparities in the prevalence and incidence of AD among ethnic groups, with higher risks in African American, Hispanic, Caucasians, and Native Hawaiian and lower risks in Asian American ethnic groups when compared to White groups (Lim et al., 2022).There have been reports of genetic variants on COBL, ABCA7, SLC10A2 and other genes in African Americans (Adelman et al., 2011;Chen and Zissimopoulos, 2018).Additionally, African Americans have a greater susceptibility to T2DM (Ferguson et al., 2021).Differences in ethnicity can be explained by both genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors such as comorbidity and socioeconomic aspects (Ferguson et al., 2020;Morris et al., 2019).Based on this, researchers are working on developing gold-standard biomarkers from these signature genes for the early detection and diagnosis of AD (Table 2).</p>
<p>Assessments of amyloid and tau pathologies and gene-based predictive analysis from blood have also been suggested (Monane et al., 2023).Simple blood tests can determine an individual's APOE alleles, but the results are not enough to predict whether an individual will develop AD or not because too many other factors can also affect the onset and progression of AD (Schindler et al., 2022;West et al., 2021).APOE testing is only used in research settings to identify study participants who may have a higher risk of developing AD (Angioni et al., 2022).Utilizing the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry platform, A42/40, p-tau181, p-tau217, and the APOE genetic prototype (ε2/2, ε2/3, ε2/4, ε3/3, ε3/4, ε4/4) have been reliably and accurately quantified from a single blood sample (Fogelman et al., 2023).Establishing blood biomarkers for screening and early disease detection is a promising new research avenue, and transcriptome studies of tandem risk genes and pathways identified for AD are among them (Mondal et al., 2024;Noreen et al., 2023Noreen et al., , 2018)).These gene network-based biomarkers are now in various stages of validation.Before these tests are widely used, it is necessary to ensure their utility, dependability, and reproducibility.</p>
<p>Current Drugs and Therapeutic Targets for AD</p>
<p>Addressing the symptoms of Alzheimer's the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several medications for treating Alzheimer's disease, which mainly focus on symptom management rather than curing the condition.These drugs are generally most effective during the early to middle stages of the disease (https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-treatment/how-alzheimers-disease-treated).Here's a brief overview of the primary types of FDA-approved drugs for Alzheimer's:</p>
<p>Drugs for Mild to Moderate AD</p>
<p>Cholinesterase Inhibitors: These drugs work by increasing levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and judgment.Since the cholinergic system plays an important role in the regulation of learning and memory processes, it has been targeted for the design of anti-Alzheimer's drugs (Grossberg, 2003).Cholinesterase inhibitors enhance cholinergic transmission directly by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which hydrolyses acetylcholine.Common cholinesterase inhibitors include: Donepezil (approved for all stages of AD), Rivastigmine (approved for mild to moderate Alzheimer's as well as mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease), Galantamine (approved for mild to moderate stages of AD) (Anand and Singh, 2013).</p>
<p>Drugs for Moderate to Severe AD</p>
<p>NMDA Receptor Antagonists: These drugs work by regulating the activity of glutamate, another neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory.Common NMDA receptor antagonists include: Memantine (approved for moderate to severe AD), Namzaric (a combination of memantine and donepezil, approved for moderate to severe AD) (Kabir et al., 2020;Olivares et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Anti-amyloid Drugs</p>
<p>Anti-amyloid treatments function by binding to and eliminating beta-amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brain.They target beta-amyloid at various stages of plaque formation, often focusing on the early, mild stages of AD ("Medications for Memory, Cognition and Dementia-Related Behaviors,").Common anti-amyloid drugs include: Aducanumab (Aduhelm ® ): This anti-amyloid antibody intravenous (IV) infusion therapy is delivered monthly and has received accelerated FDA approval for treating early AD, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's.Aducanumab was the first therapy to demonstrate that removing beta-amyloid from the brain reduces cognitive and functional decline in early Alzheimer's patients (Beshir et al., 2022).Lecanemab (Leqembi ® ): An FDA-approved anti-amyloid antibody IV infusion therapy for early Alzheimer's.Similar to aducanumab, lecanemab targets beta-amyloid to reduce amyloid plaques.Clinical studies showed that lecanemab slowed cognitive decline over 18 months and reduced brain amyloid levels (van Dyck et al., 2023).</p>
<p>While these medications can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life, they do not halt the disease's progression.Ongoing research aims to find more effective treatments that could potentially alter disease progression or offer a cure.Additionally, various nonpharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications can support overall brain health and potentially delay the onset or progression of symptoms.</p>
<p>Early Markers for the Risk of AD: A Proof of Concept</p>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have gained attention recently as an approach to understand the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases.These studies focus on genetically predicted gene expression rather than individual variants (Kunkle et al., 2019;Mondal et al., 2023b;Simhadri et al., 2020).Alternatively, the fields of metabolomics, proteomics, RNA-sequencing, and microarrays have been widely used to discover associations with AD (Diniz Pereira et al., 2021;Lee and Lee, 2020;Wu et al., 2022).Our research team has been using this latter approach, specifically gene expression techniques, in searching for signature genes associated with noncommunicable diseases, including AD and T2DM (Athanasaki et al., 2022;Noreen et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Earlier, we reported global gene expression patterns in T2DM patients with high blood cholesterol in Pakistan (Arif et al., 2022;Noreen et al., 2020).We identified and validated candidate genes linked to lipid metabolic dysfunction and T2DM that were both downregulated (TP53, MYC) and upregulated (APOC, SLC, ARNT, LEPR, and RRAD), using high-throughput qRT-PCR TaqMan Low Density Array (TLDA).IPA analysis revealed: (i) Disease and Disorders Networks were associated with disorders of Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellites, and neuroinflammation; (ii) Physiological System Development and Functions Network emphasized pathways involving the nervous system, endocrine system, and hematological system; and (iii) Canonical Pathways revealed insulin receptor signaling, T2DM signaling, amyloid processing, and neuroinflammation signaling pathways.It was interesting to note that AD was associated with these biological pathways, and with T2DM, especially in hyperlipidemic conditions (Fig. 4A).</p>
<p>In a separate epidemiological study from Pakistan involving of 820 participants, we attempted to identify marker genes linked to AD, with or without T2DM (Ghosh et al., 2020;Noreen et al., 2023).Participants were recruited from outpatient departments of a regional hospital, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computerized Tomography scans confirmed structural changes in brain consistent with AD.Such cases were compared to age-and gender matched healthy participants (controls).The study population included: (a) controls (without AD and T2DM), (b) AD, (c) T2DM, and (d) AD with T2DM.The experiment commenced with the simple extraction of cell-free RNA from venous blood, followed by cf-mRNA sequencing, gene expression, a comparison of the genes (disease vs. control), and finally, a comprehensive Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA).The results suggested upregulation of APP, PSEN, BACE2, SLC, CAPNS2 and downregulation of CAPNS1, IDE1, GLS genes.Considering these genes and their pathways in more depth reveals intriguing molecular pathways linked to an increased risk of metabolic dysfunctions, neurobehavioral disorders, and other life-threatening diseases.These genes, namely, APP, PSEN, BACE2, SLC, CAPNS1 and CAPNS2, are associated with either Aβ fibrillogenesis, tau proteinopathies, or neurodegeneration.This finding supports the theory that diabetes is linked to AD (Fig. 4B).</p>
<p>An additional pilot study in our laboratory revealed that African Americans with chronic T2DM share similar underlying mechanisms that are associated with AD pathogenesis.The study also emphasized that the expression of many genes, such as APP, IL18, PSENEN, and MAPK, is altered, and could theoretically activate APP pathways (Jheannelle Johnson et al., 2022).IPA analysis distinguished genetic associations with AD, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and tauopathy.Canonical Pathways identified insulin receptor signaling, amyloid processing, ERB4 signaling, interleukin signaling, nNOS signaling, and neuroinflammation signaling pathways.</p>
<p>Consistent with our findings, GWAS studies by other teams have also identified upregulated PHLPP2, IL33, APP, CRP, and TAC1 genes in African American AD patients (Fig. 4C).Numerous studies have documented both quantitative and qualitative differences in AD between African Americans and Caucasians.Two novel SNPs, upstream of COBL (loci, rs112404845) and downstream of SLC10A2 (rs16961023), were reported in African Americans (Mez et al., 2017).Others have reported polymorphisms in the ESR gene and variations in microRNAs associated with ethnicity and AD (Ferguson et al., 2021).</p>
<p>A multi-omics approach by another research team was reported to identify a peripheral blood biomarker of Aβ deposition in a cohort of asymptomatic individuals at risk for AD, rather than in patients with familial early-onset AD or sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD).This approach involved the analysis of three different datasets (transcriptomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics), which were obtained from two groups of individuals: Aβ amyloid (positive) and Aβ (negative) (Vergallo et al., 2019).Another transcriptome-wide meta-analysis conducted on LOAD patients (N = 1440) has identified five dysregulated and differentially expressed genes, namely, CREB5, CD46, TMBIM6, IRAK3, and RPAIN (Saykin et al., 2015).Comparing the cf-mRNA sequencing profiles of AD patients and healthy individuals, a clear difference in molecular features was documented (Toden et al., 2020).Strong diagnostic reliability was suggested by AUC values in the range of 0.7-0.9(Lee and Lee, 2020;Zecca et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Transcriptomic studies by other research teams identified the same blood-based genes that we and others have identified (APOE, APP, PSEN, TREM2, BACE1, CDC27, CAPN, SNCA, SORL1, SLC, ABCA7, GSK3B) and highlighted the identical biological pathways (Amyloid Processing, Neuroinflammation Signaling, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Type 2 Diabetes Signaling) and disease biofunctions (Neurological Disease, Psychological Disorders, and Metabolic Disease); of particular signification are the results reported by NIA-AA consortium (Bellenguez et al., 2022;Jack et al., 2018;Morgan et al., 2022;Sarkar et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Based on consistent results between studies, using different study designs and diverse experimental methods, there is strong possibility, yet to be definitively tested, that bloodbased omics analysis can support the detection of AD at the preclinical stage, particularly in individuals with pre-existing diabetes.The prediction of AD in asymptomatic subjects will be less invasive, more accessible, and less costly compared to lumbar puncture or PET studies that are currently used clinically.Rigorous validation studies in large populations from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds will be imperative.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>AD is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that is extremely complex and irreversible.The estimated total cost of healthcare for treating AD is predicted to rise to over $1 trillion.In many instances, despite the advances made in science, early disease diagnosis remains challenging.It can only be reliably confirmed based on clinical criteria such as neuroimaging laboratory tests, including blood and CSF biomarkers, and-the clinical history of the patient.It has been challenging to identify PET imaging landmarks and CSF biomarkers that reliably indicate early-stage disease before quantifiable cognitive impairments occur.Therefore, there is also a great need for new blood biomarkers to improve the prognostic and differential diagnosis of AD.Blood biomarkers will have numerous advantages over CSF and PET biomarkers.Blood tests are widely utilized in clinical and research settings worldwide, implying that the required clinical competencies and laboratory infrastructure are already in place.Blood collections are less invasive, safer, and less expensive than lumbar puncture or PET imaging.The development of blood biomarkers for AD will significantly impact early diagnosis and monitoring.Their advantages in terms of accessibility and patient comfort make them a superior alternative to PET or CSF diagnostic methods.Moreover, blood and gene biomarkers for AD have enormous promise to implement in clinical trials for novel drug development, follow up examinations, population-based screening, and monitoring therapeutic efficacy.Additionally, a single blood sample can be used to assess multiple biomarkers that represent various pathophysiological and co-morbid conditions of AD. A. The global age-wise distribution of Alzheimer's disease -projected through 2050.The bar chart represents the projected increase in the proportion (shifting towards the highest) of the oldest age group with Alzheimer's disease globally between 2040 and 2050.Data were unavailable for estimating the prevalence of AD in ages below 60 (Adopted and modified from Gustavsson et al., 2022).1B.Co-existing trends in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus over time.The global incidence of Alzheimer's disease increased from 24 million in 2000-42 million in 2020 and is projected to reach more than 150 million by 2050.The global diabetes population was 151 million in 2000, 529 million in 2020, and is expected to rise 783 million in 2050.1C.The mortality rates from Alzheimer's disease and diabetes mellitus in different nations.The death rates from AD per 100,000 people are highest in Finland (54.65), followed by the UK (42.70),USA (33.26),and Canada (27.27),and lowest in Japan (7.87).South Africa has an extraordinarily high rate of fatalities caused by diabetes (74.67).The mortality from diabetes is low in most high-income countries (&lt;10 deaths/100,000 people); however, it is high in middle-and low-income countries such as Pakistan (52.40),Sri Lanka (47.34),Bangladesh (25.49),India (25.49),Brazil (24.64) and Iran (20.84).An imbalance in production and clearance of Aβ leads to its excess accumulation in the brain.Increased Aβ fibril accumulation is triggered by high cholesterol, insulin resistance, and mutant APP, PSEN1, or PSEN2 genes.Tau is a neuronal cytoskeleton protein, plays an essential role in the balance of microtubule-dependent axonal transport.In AD, tau is excessively phosphorylated (p-tau), which leads to synaptic dysfunction, cognitive deficits, and neurodegeneration.Disrupted glucose homeostasis plays a causative role in the onset and progression of AD through the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).Neurofilament light (NfL) is a component of the neuronal cytoskeleton and serves as an important indicator of neuronal damage.It can be released from neurons into the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after axonal damage or neurodegeneration.AD risk exhibited considerably higher in T2DM individuals with one or two APOEε4 alleles than in those without T2DM or APOEε4 alleles. A. Network of differentially expressed genes in the global expression data in the T2DM patients, relative to control subjects.The network was generated using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) from QIAGEN, USA, and incorporated the relative gene expression levels measured in the patients' group (Noreen et al., 2020).Connections between differentially expressed genes were analyzed, focusing on those exhibiting a fold change of ≥ 1.5 and pvalue &lt; 0.05.A total number of 31,136 genes were observed to have differential expressions in the T2DM subjects analyzed.Of these, a total of 1657 genes were significantly different between cases and controls (p value &lt; 0.05), among which 61 % (1017 genes) were downregulated, and 39 % (640 genes) were upregulated with a fold change ranging between −189 (downregulation) to + 14 (upregulation).Disease and Disorders Networks were linked to AD, neuroinflammation, and type 2 diabetes.The nervous system, endocrine system, and hematological system are highlighted by Biological Functional Networks.The canonical pathways uncovered signaling pathways related to insulin receptors, T2DM, amyloid processing, and neuroinflammation.Geometric figures in red color denote upregulated genes and those green indicate down regulation.4B.Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling pathways in the Soth-East Asian AD population.The IPA analysis (genes with p value &lt;0.05) revealed important Canonical Pathways, that included, viz., Amyloid Processing, Neuroinflammation Signaling, eNOS Signaling in Neurons, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, and Type 2 Diabetes Signaling Connections between differentially expressed genes were analyzed, focusing on those exhibiting a fold change of ≥ 1.5 and p-value &lt; 0.05.The top disease and biofunctions included Neurological Disease, Psychological Disorders, and Metabolic Disease, and the identification of signature genes, including, APP, APOE, PSEN1, CASP3, IL6, SNCA, GSK3B, TNF (down-regulated), and SLC30A3, SLC18A3, CDC2, APLP1, APBB2, IL1A, NAE1 (up-regulated).Affected genes that are involved in cholesterol biosynthesis were noted, due to the association between high cholesterol (dietary) and increased AD risk.Geometric figures in red color denote upregulated genes and those green indicate down regulation (modified and adapted from Ghosh et al., 2020).4 C. Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling pathways in the AD and T2DM in African American patients.Genes in the network were allowed to grow our pathway with the direct/indirect relationship from the IPA knowledge base.The IPA analysis (genes with p value &lt;0.05) revealed important Canonical Pathways, that included, viz., amyloid processing, ERB4 signaling, interleukin signaling, nNOS signaling, and neuroinflammation signaling pathways (Johnson J, 2022).Depicting the direct connectivity between differential genes and Alzheimer's disease, T2DM, late onset of neurological disorder, and progressive neurological disorders.APP, PHLPP2, IL33, CRP, and TAC1 genes were identified in African Americans AD patients.Geometric figures in red color denote upregulated genes and those green indicate down regulation.Solid interacting lines show the genes that are directly connected, and dotted lines signify the indirect connections between the genes and the cellular functions.Upgradation of liquid biomarkers for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
