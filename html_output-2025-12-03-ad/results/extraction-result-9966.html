                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Consensus on rapid screening for prodromal Alzheimer’s disease in China</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common cause of dementia, characterised by cerebral amyloid-β deposition, pathological tau and neurodegeneration. The prodromal stage of AD (pAD) refers to patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and evidence of AD’s pathology. At this stage, disease-modifying interventions should be used to prevent the progression to dementia. Given the inherent heterogeneity of MCI, more specific biomarkers are needed to elucidate the underlying AD’s pathology. Although the uses of cerebrospinal fluid and positron emission tomography are widely accepted methods for detecting AD’s pathology, their clinical applications are limited by their high costs and invasiveness, particularly in low-income areas in China. Therefore, to improve the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology through cost-effective screening methods, a panel of 45 neurologists, psychiatrists and gerontologists was invited to establish a formal consensus on the screening of pAD in China. The supportive evidence and grades of recommendations are based on a systematic literature review and focus group discussion. National meetings were held to allow participants to review, vote and provide their expert opinions to reach a consensus. A majority (two-thirds) decision was used for questions for which consensus could not be reached. Recommended screening methods are presented in this publication, including neuropsychological assessment, peripheral biomarkers and brain imaging. In addition, a general workflow for screening pAD in China is established, which will help clinicians identify individuals at high risk and determine therapeutic targets.</p>
