                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Machine Learning Application in Horticulture and Prospects for Predicting Fresh Produce Losses and Waste: A Review</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The current review examines the state of knowledge and research on machine learning (ML) applications in horticultural production and the potential for predicting fresh produce losses and waste. Recently, ML has been increasingly applied in horticulture for efficient and accurate operations. Given the health benefits of fresh produce and the need for food and nutrition security, efficient horticultural production and postharvest management are important. This review aims to assess the application of ML in preharvest and postharvest horticulture and the potential of ML in reducing postharvest losses and waste by predicting their magnitude, which is crucial for management practices and policymaking in loss and waste reduction. The review starts by assessing the application of ML in preharvest horticulture. It then presents the application of ML in postharvest handling and processing, and lastly, the prospects for its application in postharvest loss and waste quantification. The findings revealed that several ML algorithms perform satisfactorily in classification and prediction tasks. Based on that, there is a need to further investigate the suitability of more models or a combination of models with a higher potential for classification and prediction. Overall, the review suggested possible future directions for research related to the application of ML in postharvest losses and waste quantification.</p>

The current review examines the state of knowledge and research on machine learning (ML) applications in horticultural production and the potential for predicting fresh produce losses and waste.Recently, ML has been increasingly applied in horticulture for efficient and accurate operations.Given the health benefits of fresh produce and the need for food and nutrition security, efficient horticultural production and postharvest management are important.This review aims to assess the application of ML in preharvest and postharvest horticulture and the potential of ML in reducing postharvest losses and waste by predicting their magnitude, which is crucial for management practices and policymaking in loss and waste reduction.The review starts by assessing the application of ML in preharvest horticulture.It then presents the application of ML in postharvest handling and processing, and lastly, the prospects for its application in postharvest loss and waste quantification.The findings revealed that several ML algorithms perform satisfactorily in classification and prediction tasks.Based on that, there is a need to further investigate the suitability of more models or a combination of models with a higher potential for classification and prediction.Overall, the review suggested possible future directions for research related to the application of ML in postharvest losses and waste quantification.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Horticultural produce is known to contain essential nutritious elements in large quantities [1][2][3].These essential nutrients are vital to maintaining a healthy life and have many benefits for the human body [4].Chronic diseases such as hypertension, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and pulmonary disease are the leading causes of mortality [5].Increasing cases of obesity and malnutrition are also a growing concern worldwide.Research evidence has shown that increased fruit and vegetable consumption decreases the risk of diseases [6].Also, there is a correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and delays in age-related disorders [6,7].Despite the benefits obtained from the consumption of fruit and vegetables, a remarkable amount is still wasted globally throughout the food value chain for several reasons, such as pest and disease infestation, environmental stress, quality issues, and marketing aesthetic standards [8,9].To address these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ML, has emerged as a promising tool in preharvest and postharvest horticulture [10].</p>
<p>Horticulture is critical to supplying fruit and vegetables, which are rich in essential nutrients and contribute significantly to global economies.Despite their importance, horticultural practices in various regions remain rudimentary, often due to barriers such as a lack of modern technology.This is because these farmers are reluctant to use modern technologies for several reasons, such as a lack of skill and the cost of acquiring such technology [11].This results in high preharvest and postharvest losses.Deficiencies in data-driven decision-making related to weather, soil conditions, irrigation, and pest management contribute to inefficiencies that can be addressed through ML technologies.The integration of ML algorithms into the horticultural value chain (Figure 1) can enhance produce quality and optimize resource allocation, thereby increasing the return on investment for stakeholders [12].</p>

<p>Recent technologies in machine vision, sensors, and remote satellite data generation have produced big data at different stages of the food value chain.As a result, the advent of big data technologies has catalyzed the application of ML in various stages of the food value chain.</p>
<p>ML has been widely used in different fields of agriculture and plant science, such as plant breeding [13], in vitro culture [14], stress phenotyping [15], stress physiology [16], plant system biology [17], plant identification [18], plant genetic engineering [19], and pathogen identification [20].Despite the growing body of research on ML in agriculture, there is a noticeable gap in the literature concerning its application in postharvest loss and waste management.The available literature is mainly focused on the application of ML technologies in preharvest horticulture and on the classification of fruit and vegetables for sorting and grading [21][22][23][24][25].A Scopus search with filters for the past decade showed 89 reviews for ML combined with deep learning, AI, and machine vision applications in agriculture and food production.A further investigation shows that only seven reviews included information on the application of ML in postharvest horticulture [26][27][28][29][30][31][32].Given this gap, the present review aims to synthesize the current knowledge on ML applications in preharvest horticulture and extend the discussion to postharvest scenarios, including processing and retail.The review structure is as follows: firstly, an overview of the concept of the ML technique in horticultural production was presented, followed by the application of ML in preharvest horticulture.Further discussion was presented on the application of ML in postharvest handling and processing.In addition, the application of ML in retail was discussed.Lastly, the prospects of the application of ML in postharvest loss and waste quantification and prediction and prospects in the area were discussed.Stages of the horticultural value chain where ML can be applied.Adapted with a slight modification from [11].</p>

<p>The Concept of ML Technique-An Overview</p>
<p>ML is a subset of AI focused on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.While AI is a broader concept that encompasses machines designed to mimic human intelligence, including reasoning, learning, and problem-solving, ML specifically deals with the learning aspect, where machines improve their performance on a task through exposure to data.In essence, all machine learning is AI, but not all AI is machine learning; AI includes rule-based systems, expert systems, and other methods that do not necessarily involve learning from data.</p>
<p>In the current era, vast amounts of data are generated across various domains, presenting opportunities and challenges for data analysis.These data can be used for validation, calibration, classification, verification, prediction, and characterization of variables.However, using manual approaches to process and perform tasks with the generated data has resulted in several challenges due to the size and complexity of the data [33].To resolve this problem, a sub-field of AI known as ML emerged to automatically learn and capture the relationship between various features in data to produce a result used in decision-making.The primary aim of ML is to formulate algorithms capable of autonomously discerning patterns in data and making informed predictions or decisions [34].The process involves feeding ML models with a large amount of data and allowing them to learn the features and patterns within the data.</p>
<p>ML has gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing availability of big data in different fields and the need to harness these data to solve problems [35].ML has been applied in various fields, such as transportation, telecommunication, healthcare, finance, and agriculture.In the agricultural sector, ML has found applications in areas such as crop yield prediction [36,37], pest and disease detection [38], and cultivar classification [39].By leveraging ML, farmers can optimize their production inputs and improve their yields, thereby enhancing food security.</p>
<p>Although ML was initially conceived as a complement to traditional statistical methods, it offers distinct advantages, such as automation and the capacity for self-improvement through iterative learning [40].As defined by Wang et al. [40], ML deals with the development of intelligent models that use algorithms to predict, estimate, and classify a variable.The performance of an ML model is contingent upon the quality of feature analysis, data preprocessing techniques, and the efficacy of the algorithmic methods employed [40].</p>
<p>Machine Learning Models</p>
<p>There are different types of learning in ML models-supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforced learning (Figure 2).The main difference between supervised and other learning types is that the datasets used are labeled with features to known outputs.In semi-supervised learning, the datasets used are both labeled and unlabeled, and usually, the numbers of unlabeled data are higher than the labeled data [41].Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled datasets to learn patterns and predict output.Reinforced learning allows the model to simulate its environment and make predictions based on the state of the environment.ML models like random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), and linear regression (LR) are designed to identify and learn patterns within datasets [43].The predictive accuracy of a machine learning model generally improves with increased exposure to relevant data [44].Models are widely used for predictive analysis as data features are learned and tuned to improve performance.ML models can be broadly categorized into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms as shown in Figure 2. Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, allowing them to make predictions or classifications, whereas unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data to identify underlying patterns or structures [45].In horticultural applications, supervised models like RF and KNN have been effectively used for tasks such as disease detection and yield prediction, while unsupervised models find utility in clustering similar types of produce based on features like size, color, and texture.Other advanced models like SVM and neural networks are also gaining traction in horticultural applications, offering higher accuracy and the ability to model complex relationships in data [37].</p>
<p>The architecture of learning and prediction activities in ML is presented in Figure 3.The original data are usually split into two-a training dataset and a test dataset.In some cases, there is a third dataset for model validation after testing.The training dataset is used to train the model, while the test dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the model.The model makes predictions using the observed pattern in the training dataset without knowing the true target variable.The predictions of the model are then compared to the true target variables, and performance parameters are recorded [40].ML models like random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), and linear regression (LR) are designed to identify and learn patterns within datasets [43].The predictive accuracy of a machine learning model generally improves with increased exposure to relevant data [44].Models are widely used for predictive analysis as data features are learned and tuned to improve performance.ML models can be broadly categorized into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms as shown in Figure 2. Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled datasets, allowing them to make predictions or classifications, whereas unsupervised learning algorithms work with unlabeled data to identify underlying patterns or structures [45].In horticultural applications, supervised models like RF and KNN have been effectively used for tasks such as disease detection and yield prediction, while unsupervised models find utility in clustering similar types of produce based on features like size, color, and texture.Other advanced models like SVM and neural networks are also gaining traction in horticultural applications, offering higher accuracy and the ability to model complex relationships in data [37].</p>

<p>Parameters Used to Evaluate the Performance of an ML Model</p>
<p>The evaluation of an ML model's performance relies on a set of metrics that quantify its accuracy and reliability.According to Raschka [46], the parameter for evaluating an ML model is mostly the all-around performance of the model.This is important in identifying the ideal model to perform a task.Commonly employed metrics for assessing model performance include the confusion matrix, classification accuracy, cross-validation, F1score, precision, and recall [11].In horticultural applications, metrics like precision and recall are particularly important when the cost of false positives and false negatives, such as misclassifying produce quality, can be high.</p>
<p>ML Application in Preharvest Horticulture</p>
<p>While ML has extensive applications in diverse fields like telecommunication and healthcare, its utility in preharvest horticulture is increasingly recognized [40].Recent studies have highlighted the growing role of ML in preharvest horticulture, particularly in areas like disease and weed detection, yield prediction, and crop quality assessment [43,47,48].</p>
<p>Pest and Disease Prediction and Detection</p>
<p>In horticulture, the timely detection of pests and diseases is crucial for implementing effective control measures.This is because it enables farmers to plan mitigation and control measures [49].Disease detection can be time-consuming, especially where traditional laboratory methods are used [50].The methods often come with limitations, such as high costs and time consumption [50].As a result, AI-based techniques that use cameras for image acquisition have recently emerged for disease detection.Emerging AI-based techniques leverage ML and deep learning algorithms to enhance pest and disease recognition accuracy and speed.These technologies allow for early detection and management of pests and diseases to increase yield [51].This is important because pest and disease infestations affect the quality of horticultural products and may lead to losses or waste [49].</p>
<p>A growing body of research has focused on employing ML algorithms to detect and predict pests and diseases in horticulture (Table 1).Pantazi et al. [21] investigated the infection of milk thistle by smut fungus.Three ML models-supervised Kohonen network, counter propagation artificial neural network, and XY-fusion network-were used to identify infected and healthy plants during plant growth.In a similar study, Chung et al. [52] applied the support vector machine (SVM) to classify rice seedlings infected by Bakanae disease from the healthy ones.Maniyath et al.</p>

<p>Parameters Used to Evaluate the Performance of an ML Model</p>
<p>The evaluation of an ML model's performance relies on a set of metrics that quantify its accuracy and reliability.According to Raschka [46], the parameter for evaluating an ML model is mostly the all-around performance of the model.This is important in identifying the ideal model to perform a task.Commonly employed metrics for assessing model performance include the confusion matrix, classification accuracy, cross-validation, F1-score, precision, and recall [11].In horticultural applications, metrics like precision and recall are particularly important when the cost of false positives and false negatives, such as misclassifying produce quality, can be high.</p>
<p>ML Application in Preharvest Horticulture</p>
<p>While ML has extensive applications in diverse fields like telecommunication and healthcare, its utility in preharvest horticulture is increasingly recognized [40].Recent studies have highlighted the growing role of ML in preharvest horticulture, particularly in areas like disease and weed detection, yield prediction, and crop quality assessment [43,47,48].</p>
<p>Pest and Disease Prediction and Detection</p>
<p>In horticulture, the timely detection of pests and diseases is crucial for implementing effective control measures.This is because it enables farmers to plan mitigation and control measures [49].Disease detection can be time-consuming, especially where traditional laboratory methods are used [50].The methods often come with limitations, such as high costs and time consumption [50].As a result, AI-based techniques that use cameras for image acquisition have recently emerged for disease detection.Emerging AI-based techniques leverage ML and deep learning algorithms to enhance pest and disease recognition accuracy and speed.These technologies allow for early detection and management of pests and diseases to increase yield [51].This is important because pest and disease infestations affect the quality of horticultural products and may lead to losses or waste [49].</p>
<p>A growing body of research has focused on employing ML algorithms to detect and predict pests and diseases in horticulture (Table 1).Pantazi et al. [21] investigated the infection of milk thistle by smut fungus.Three ML models-supervised Kohonen network, counter propagation artificial neural network, and XY-fusion network-were used to identify infected and healthy plants during plant growth.In a similar study, Chung et al. [52] applied the support vector machine (SVM) to classify rice seedlings infected by Bakanae disease from the healthy ones.Maniyath et al. [50] applied several ML models to distinguish between healthy and disease-infected papaya leaves.The authors reported that the random forest (RF) model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 70.14%.Kasinathan et al. [51] classified and detected insects in field crops using artificial neural networks (ANNs), SVM, KNN, naïve Bayes (NB), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models.The study was based on the shape features of the insect, and the results showed that the CNN is a suitable classification model for the study in comparison with the other models.Skawsang et al. [49], in another study, applied ML models to forecast the occurrence of pests using metrological and plant phenology data.The study aimed to provide an early warning system for effective pest control.In another study, Javidan et al. [53] developed a method to classify disease-infected and healthy grape leaves.The authors used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the data dimension before subjecting the data to SVM classification.The result showed that the SVM classifier combined with the linear kernel, using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, produced a 98.71% accuracy.Mohammed et al. [54] developed a method of predicting date palm mite infestation on date fruits using meteorological variables and the physicochemical properties of date fruits integrated into LR and decision forest regression (DFR) models.The authors reported that when the meteorological and physicochemical properties were combined, the model was able to predict the date palm mite count on date palm fruits with an accuracy of R 2 = 0.918.Collectively, these studies suggest the potential of ML algorithms to provide accurate and timely predictions, aiding in the development of effective management strategies for pest and disease control.This is important in planning management strategies to avoid fruit and vegetable losses and waste due to pest and disease defects and damage.</p>
<p>Prediction and Detection of Crop Loss Due to Natural Causes</p>
<p>Extreme weather and climatic conditions pose significant risks for on-farm crop loss, often beyond the control of standard farming operations [57].Farmers often rely on agricultural insurance as a financial safety net to mitigate these risks.Insurance institutions perform field evaluations to estimate the yield loss in the event of crop loss through a natural disaster.The accuracy of insurance estimations often hinges on identifying "Homogeneous Damage Zones", which facilitate the extrapolation of localized data to estimate losses across an entire field [57].</p>
<p>Table 2 summarizes various ML applications designed to detect and predict crop loss arising from natural causes.To investigate damaged zones in fields affected by hailstorms, Sosa et al. [57] developed a method that combined sentinel images with damage evaluation data to determine damaged zones in fields affected by hailstorms to help in insurance claims.In a similar study, Li et al. [58] developed a system to investigate drought risk and its effect on wheat production in the North China Plain.The study also aimed to guide agricultural insurance, which could be a serious issue when a natural disaster causes damage to a farm.The authors fed the result of the model to simulate the crop-weather relationship over a large area (MCWLA) into an RF and multiple linear regression (MLR) models to estimate losses due to drought in three different scenarios-mild drought, moderate drought, and severe drought.In another study, Xu et al. [59] applied the SVM model since it performed better than the ANN to predict the distribution of frost damage to tea trees in the Zhejiang Province of China in 2016/2017.The authors used meteorological data to predict the future occurrence of frost events to help farmers in their decision-making.In a recent study, Prodhan et al. [22] estimated future drought and its effect on yield loss in South Asia using an ensemble ML (EML) that was embedded with RF and a gradient boosting machine (GBM).The model performed optimally in predicting yield loss risk for rice, wheat, and maize crops, with a root mean square error (RMSE) lower than that of RF and GBM as stand-alone models.The existing literature Indicates limited studies focused on predicting crop loss due to natural causes, often attributed to the limited availability of comprehensive data.This can be attributed to the limited available data [58].The accurate prediction of crop loss due to natural causes in a wide area mostly relies on historical events as input data, but detailed information on damaged areas and losses is mostly unavailable.Given these challenges, future research should prioritize the characterization of natural events affecting crop production, as accurate predictions are crucial for global food security.</p>
<p>Yield Prediction</p>
<p>Achieving optimum yield in horticultural production is critical, as it directly impacts the farmer's return on investment and broader food security.Within the framework of precision agriculture, accurate yield prediction is indispensable for enabling proactive planning and decision-making by farmers and other stakeholders in the value chain [63].Also, yield prediction is essential for matching demand with supply.Lastly, yield prediction is fundamental to helping farmers know the right harvest time to avoid storage loss [10].However, yield prediction is complicated by various factors, including weather conditions, soil properties, and pest incidence, which introduce significant variability.Given these complexities, developing automated yield prediction systems using machine learning algorithms is increasingly seen as a necessity.</p>
<p>Recent studies have applied different ML models to predict crop yield in different scenarios.Ramos et al. [64] used a machine vision system and an image-processing model to detect and classify fruit.The system developed in the study was used to count coffee fruit on the tree branches and classify the fruit as harvestable or not harvestable.In another study, Sengupta and Lee [65] applied the SVM to identify the number of immature green citrus fruit in a tree canopy.The result showed that the model accurately identified and counted 80.4% of the fruit.Abbas et al. [66] developed a model to predict the yield of potatoes in the Atlantic Region of Canada using LR, elastic net (EN), KNN, and support vector regression (SVR).The result of the study was important for establishing field-specific management practices for potato growers in the area.Similarly, to predict the yield of Irish potatoes and maize in the Musanze district in Rwanda, Kuradusenge et al. [37] applied the RF to determine the effect of temperature and rainfall on crop yield.The study aimed to provide farmers with early information on the expected climatic conditions to mitigate climate change's impact on crop production.In a similar study, Iniyan et al. [36] used several models (LR, decision tree (DT), elastic net, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, partial least square regression (PLSR), gradient boost regression (GBR), and long short-term memory (LSTM)) to predict yield loss based on historical agronomical data gathered in 18 years.The agronomical data used in the study have more variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, soil type, crop type, season, and field area) than most of the published literature, which improves the reliability of the results of the models.Khan et al. [67] describe how plant height, fruit production, slope, leaf loss, and blower damage can be used to predict yield loss during the mechanical harvesting of wild blueberry.The authors applied SVR, LR, and RF to predict losses, and the study's overall result could help optimize the harvesting technique for loss reduction.These studies demonstrated the efficacy of diverse ML algorithms in yield prediction, providing valuable insights for farmer decisionmaking and planning.Compared to other non-regression ML models, regression models such as SVR, LR, and RF have several advantages for prediction, hence their application for yield, pest and disease, and crop loss prediction in the studies.Regression models are used to investigate vital relationships between targeted variables of interest and the predictor variables [68] due to their ability to form associations between dependent and independent variables.Additionally, these models allow prediction through time series data and show the underlying relationship among variables [69].For instance, an LR model easily fits a single parameter (predicted output) and captures a nonlinear relationship between predictor and response variables.This straightforward attribute of LR makes it the most used model for prediction tasks [69].Table 3 summarizes the key studies that have employed ML models for yield prediction.</p>
<p>Crop Quality</p>
<p>The quality assessment of horticultural produce is critical for determining compliance with market standards, thereby influencing marketability and pricing.Therefore, accurate quality classification is pivotal for aligning produce with market standards, optimizing pricing, and minimizing postharvest losses and waste [48,73].Factors such as temperature, humidity, farming method, and packaging affect preharvest and postharvest crop quality [10]; other factors could be contamination due to foreign materials [74].These factors could result in economic loss because of postharvest losses and waste, with a broader implication for natural resources used for food production and the environment.</p>
<p>ML technologies offer a time-efficient and highly accurate approach to quality classification in horticultural produce.Zhang et al. [74] applied linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and SVM to classify foreign material inside cotton lint.The study reported a 95% accuracy in the classification of cotton lint by the SVM model.Zulkifli et al. [75] developed a model that combined a machine vision system with discriminant analysis and the SVM model to predict the ripening stages of papaya.The model performed optimally, with LDA producing the highest result accuracy of 83.5%.In another study, Agarwal et al. [76], designed an SVM, KNN, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and NB method to classify wheat grains into 'fresh' and 'rotten'.The authors reported that SVM produced the highest accuracy of 93% based on color features, while the NB model produced the highest accuracy of 65% based on texture features.The result proved SVM to be a strong discriminatory model as it tended to classify with the highest accuracy with color features, which are regarded as possessing high discriminatory features in comparison to texture features [76].Occhiuzzi et al. [77], developed an RFID-based system that was aimed at controlling the environmental conditions of stored avocado fruits and detecting ripening status.The system fed the data retrieved from the tag reader into an SVM that classified the fruits into "unripe", "stock", "grocery", and "consumer" with more than 85% accuracy.Researchers have prominently used SVM for classification tasks and compared its performance to other classifiers [76,78,79].Their results demonstrated SVM's ability to classify variables with good accuracy.This is due to its generalization ability, robustness, and simple principle, which make it arguably the most popular model for supervised learning [80].The industrial-scale adoption of these machine learning technologies holds significant promise for reducing postharvest losses attributable to suboptimal produce quality.Table 4 summarizes key studies employing machine learning models for quality assessment in horticultural produce.Support vector machine (SVM); linear discriminant analysis (LDA); quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA); linear support vector machine (LSVM); quadratic support vector machine (QSVM); K-nearest neighbor (KNN); multilayer perceptron (MLP); naïve Bayes (NB); linear discriminate analysis (LDA); quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA); quantized support vector machine (QSVM); cubic support vector machine (CSVM); ultra-high frequency (UHF); radio frequency identification (RFID); local binary pattern (LBP); histogram of oriented gradients (HOG); gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM); convolutional neural networks (CNNs), random forest (RF); extreme gradient boost (XGBoost).</p>
<p>ML Application in Postharvest Handling and Processing</p>
<p>The recent literature indicates a growing application of machine learning technologies in postharvest handling and processing, particularly in fresh produce sorting, grading, and cultivar classification.These two postharvest activities are traditionally manual and subjective and are based on physical attributes such as shape, color, and the presence of blemishes [85,86].The labor-intensive and time-consuming nature of traditional manual methods, coupled with their subjectivity, has led to the adoption of machine learning technologies to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Fruit and Vegetable Sorting/Grading</p>
<p>The sorting of fresh produce is a quality classification activity and is greatly affected by the market standard, especially for export commodities [9].According to Opara et al. [9], sorting fruits and vegetables is important because aesthetics is a significant attribute in fresh produce grading, determining the quality and monetary value of such fresh produce.Many traditional sorting processes involve an individual's physical identification of fresh produce based on specific attributes that are sometimes straining, time-consuming, and dependent on the sorter's perception [85][86][87][88].Also, traditional sorting methods are prone to inaccuracy due to fatigue and lack of training [89], and this may contribute to losses [87,90].Adopting ML technologies is thus crucial for enhancing efficiency and productivity in sorting and grading fresh produce.</p>
<p>Table 5 summarizes key studies focused on enhancing the efficiency of sorting and grading systems in postharvest horticultural production through ML technologies.Caladcad et al. [23] developed an acoustic signal system to classify coconut fruit into three groups-pre-mature, mature, and over-mature.The data from the study were subjected to ANN, RF, and SVM models, and the results showed that the RF model outperformed others with 83.48% accuracy.This classification system can significantly benefit the large-scale processing of coconut fruit for mass exportation.Ai et al. [91] applied the RF model to discriminate between premium quality oil (extra virgin olive oil) and inexpensive edible oils.The study was based on the fatty acid methyl esters of the oils.The authors aimed to find a close substitute, a cheap oil with similar nutritional content to the expensive extra virgin olive oil.As with many related studies, Piedad et al. [87] developed a model to sort bananas by tiers rather than by individual fruit.The study classified banana tiers into four classes-extra class, class I, class II, and reject class-using color and size features.In another study, Ireri et al. [85] reported a machine vision system that used color images and the radial basis function-support vector machine (RBF-SVM) classifier to detect healthy tomatoes and those with defects.The study aimed to develop a low-cost grading system to grade tomatoes on the processing line.The system successfully classified tomatoes into four categories using color, texture, shape, and combined features.A recent study by Bhargava et al. [92] proposed an automated system to detect fruit and vegetable types and grade them using various features such as color, texture, and geometrical features.The system utilized LR, the sparse representative classifier (SRC), ANN, and SVM, with SVM producing the highest accuracy for both fruit and vegetable detection and grading.Fruit and vegetable grading and sorting is a classification task mostly performed by classification models (Table 5).The results of the studies depict that several algorithms perform satisfactorily for classification due to the high accuracy achieved in the studies.However, SVM is a binary classifier that performs by finding the best subspace that optimally separates variables into classes [76] and has a high computational efficiency and generalization capability [80].Therefore, the combination of SVM and other models would have a potential for higher accuracy for prediction and classification.SVM is also known for reduced computational time and the ability to use the kernel trick to delineate data into a higher-dimensional space before actual classification [80].</p>

<p>These studies demonstrate the potential for scaling up ML systems in industrial settings to mitigate the challenges associated with traditional manual methods in fresh produce sorting and grading.</p>
<p>Crop Detection and Cultivar Classification</p>
<p>ML models have been increasingly employed to detect and recognize various crop types [97][98][99].Similar technology has also been employed to differentiate fruit and vegetable cultivars according to the specific market and industrial needs [98-101].Accurate classification is crucial for meeting market specifications, thereby minimizing the risk of rejection and subsequent loss or waste.In their study, Filho et al. [97] developed a methodology and model to detect and map rice crops in the field from the Sentinel-1 time series using deep learning (LSTM and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)) models.The performance of deep learning models like LSTM and Bi-LSTM was compared against traditional machine learning models, including SVM, RF, KNN, and NB, to evaluate their efficacy in crop classification.The ML models achieved high accuracy in classifying rice as the LSTM.ML in cultivar classification was reported by Hu et al. [98].The authors differentiated the Korla fragrant pear into two-deciduous-calyx pear and persistent-calyx pear-using successive projection algorithms and SVM to establish classification, with SVM achieving an accuracy of 96.7%.Yang et al. [99] applied DT, KNN, naïve Bayes (NB), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), SVM, and back propagation neural network (BPNN) to classify apricots based on their shape features.The study aimed to develop a model for cultivar classification of apricot fruit using shape features to distinguish the different cultivars.In a similar study, Khatri et al. [101] applied KNN, NB, classification and regression tree (CART), and ensemble methods (EMs) to distinguish wheat seeds into three varieties: Kama, Rosa, and Canadian.Using the physical features of the seeds, the authors reported that the EM produced the highest result with 95% accuracy.Table 6 summarizes key studies that have applied machine learning technologies for crop detection and cultivar classification.</p>
<p>ML Applications during Retail</p>
<p>In retail, sustainable decision-making is crucial for long-term viability and competitive advantage.This means that decisions are made to enhance profitability, return on investment, and minimize risk.To make these decisions, forecasts are made using the past and present trends of activities around the business [108].Many factors influence retail operations, including market dynamics and consumer behavior, making accurate forecasting a challenging yet essential task.ML applications have been deployed to provide techniques to simulate, detect, and predict aspects of the complex retail system for timely decision-making for efficient operation and to reduce food waste generation.Some studies have applied ML techniques to enhance retail operations.For instance, as indicated in Table 7, Myat and Tun [109] used the RF classification model to predict palm oil prices in Myanmar using data obtained from the Myanmar Edible Oil Dealers Association (MEODA).The prediction was conducted to determine whether the price will rise so that imported palm oil can be traded in the local markets.In another study, Valecha et al. [110] used the RF classifier to classify customer behavior to buy products based on attributes such as interpersonal, individual, environmental, and organizational factors based on the shopping pattern (Table 7).Customer behavior prediction was based on data collected from the Kaggle repository, and the study showed 94% accuracy.To predict future sales, Dairu and Shilong [111] proposed a technique developed by applying the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to forecast sales by extracting features from historical sales data.The study found that the XGBoost model yielded superior performance, achieving an RMSE of 0.878, thereby outperforming the LSTM and ARIMA models.In a similar study, Swami et al. [112] predicted the total product and store sales using XGBoost, LSTM, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.The result revealed that the XGBoost outperformed the other models with an RMSE of 0.878.The authors reported that XGBoost is mainly used in Kaggle competitions and efficiently handles different sparsity patterns.</p>
<p>ML Application in Postharvest Loss and Waste Quantification of Fresh Horticultural Produce</p>
<p>Due to their high moisture content and limited shelf life, fruits and vegetables are particularly vulnerable to postharvest losses.Globally, fruit and vegetables account for the highest food commodities lost or wasted.According to the FAO, wastage is as high as 37-55% [117].The successful application of ML for yield prediction [64], disease detection [21], and crop quality evaluation [74] suggests that the application of ML to quantify and predict postharvest wastage along the food value chain would prove fundamental in production planning and policymaking.Despite the apparent use of ML in this domain, there is a noticeable lack of research focusing on its application for quantifying physical postharvest losses in fresh produce.Yu et al. [118] used factors such as family status, income, expenditure, and grain transaction and applied the bias classifier, DT, and SVM models to predict grain losses.The classification result was compared among the three models, and SVM achieved the highest result with an accuracy of 97.30%.A literature search suggests a few studies similar to Yu et al. [118] that used socio-economic factors to classify food loss and mostly used grains.These studies did not include actual physical quantification of the postharvest losses but rather focused on the causes and classification of the problem using secondary data.</p>
<p>Several factors contribute to postharvest losses along the food value chain [8,119,120].Some of the factors are value chain-specific, while others occur throughout the value chain.As a result, to effectively quantify postharvest losses using ML, different types of data are needed, as determined by the hotspot being assessed.The type of data could include data on environmental conditions (such as temperature and relative humidity), data from storage methods (such as freezing and drying), and data during transportation and logistics (such as the rate of impact, vibration, and compression).Also, data collected during physical loss quantification by weighing or counting is believed to be highly accurate and could be used for ML quantification of postharvest losses.</p>
<p>Given the gap in the application of ML for physical postharvest loss and waste quantification, there is an urgent need for research that employs ML techniques to quantify postharvest losses of horticultural produce using physically quantified data.Such an approach would be invaluable for evidence-based policymaking and implementation.</p>
<p>Limitations of Implementing ML Techniques in Horticultural Production and Future Prospects</p>
<p>Although ML techniques improve horticultural production through automation and enhanced efficiency, there are several challenges and limitations associated with their implementation.These challenges arise due to the complexities of horticultural production.One of the major challenges is data availability and variability.Data for horticultural studies come from several sources, such as laboratory experiments, satellite imagery [57], historical data [112,114], and manually collected data (physical quantification) [8,9].Therefore, ensuring the quality of data from several sources is critical for applications using ML models.In some instances, the ML data acquisition process requires specialized skills and a huge cost of acquisition, such as data acquisition through hyperspectral imagining, making it difficult to acquire adequate data for use [73].There is also the problem of the reliability of data due to inconsistencies in data collection methodologies [121].Furthermore, the interaction between horticultural crops and their environment is influenced by weather, farming practices, the prevalence of pests and diseases, and soil composition.These factors vary from time to time and need continuous monitoring.Also, the interpretability of these parameters and knowing how they influence horticultural production require horticultural knowledge, which can pose a limitation to experts in other fields.There is also the problem of scalability in the application of ML in horticultural production.Small-scale trials in the application of ML techniques in horticultural production are usually easier, cheaper, and often show positive results.Scaling these results to larger horticultural operations may involve substantial cost, infrastructural requirements, and suitability to the existing technologies and operations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, another aspect of the limitations of the implementation of ML in horticultural production is the selection of appropriate performance criteria to evaluate model performance.While this review has covered performance metrics for classification tasks in ML, such as F1-score, precision, and recall (as discussed in Section 1.3), it is crucial to also consider some of the metrics used in regression tasks, which are foundational in several ML applications.The commonly used parameters to assess a model's accuracy in regression tasks include R-squared (R 2 ), the root mean squared error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the mean bias error (MBE).R 2 is the coefficient of determination, which indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, providing insight into the explanatory power of the model [37,67].However, according to Clark et al. [122], the R 2 value does not give the overall picture of the performance of a model since it does not evaluate the bias in the predicted result.The RMSE and MAE measure the average magnitude of error between the predicted and actual values, with the RMSE being particularly sensitive to large errors [37,67], making it suitable for applications in tasks where such errors are unacceptable.The MBE assesses the average bias in predictions, helping identify systematic overestimations or underestimations by the model [123].The relationship between RMSE, MAE, and MBE is expressed by the inequalities: MBE ≤ MAE ≤ RMSE ≤ √ nMAE, where MSE and RMSE are preferred if the theoretical analysis on error measure is conducted as opposed to MAE because of the ease of applying analytical measures to MAE [123].From the analysis of the metrics, the choice of evaluation criteria must vary based on the type of task and application in horticultural production.Therefore, the metrics should be carefully selected based on the data characteristics and the implications of different error types in the specific application context.For example, in financial forecasting for ML applications in retail, where outliers can disproportionately affect the model's performance, MAE might be preferred due to its resistance to the influence of large errors.Analyzing these metrics provides a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance, ensuring that their applications are both robust and directly tailored to the specific challenges at each stage of horticultural production.</p>
<p>Having discussed the challenges and limitations associated with implementing ML techniques in horticultural production, possible future research directions could involve considering the integration of ML models with Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as sensors to enable real-time monitoring and control of horticultural environments, which would lead to higher efficiency.Also, there is a need to explore novel ensemble ML algorithms (since they consist of a combination of traditional ML models), to address the unique challenges of horticultural production.Finally, ML experts must collaborate with other horticultural value chain actors such as farmers, processors, transportation, and equipment manufacturers to ensure that the developed models are practical, effective, and aligned with industry needs.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, have significantly reduced manual labor in pre and postharvest activities, transforming the food value chain.The integration of machine learning into horticultural practices has not only revolutionized operations but also enhanced the speed and accuracy of various processes.This review has reported the current knowledge of ML models that predict and classify variables accurately as stand-alone models, such as the SVM, RF, KNN, DT, and LR, and showed that some models achieve better results when combined with other models (ensemble method).Based on the findings of the review, regression models such as LR, SVR, and RF are most promising for future research in prediction and forecasting because they allow prediction through time series and show the underlying relationship among variables.Furthermore, the capability of ensemble methods to boost ML models' accuracy and reduce bias promises a great improvement in the adaptability of these models in postharvest loss quantification.Given the successful application of ML models in different horticultural practices, it could be a game changer for postharvest loss quantification in the near future.However, the application of the techniques on a commercial scale requires specialized skills and can be cost-intensive.As this review has shown, studies relating to the application of ML techniques in quantifying and predicting postharvest losses and waste of horticultural produce are lacking, hence highlighting the importance of this study.The current application of ML technology in horticultural production has been concentrated on pest and disease prediction, yield prediction, and the classification of fruit and vegetables in sorting and grading operations.The critical need for ML in quantifying postharvest losses and waste is evident, especially when considering its potential impact on policy formulation and implementation for food loss and waste reduction.Given these</p>
