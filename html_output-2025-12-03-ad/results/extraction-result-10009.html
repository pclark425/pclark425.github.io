                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Accurate diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's with deep network approach based on multi‐channel feature extraction and selection</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> In this article, we have proposed a multi‐stage in‐depth approach based on the improved VGGNet architecture for automatically and accurately diagnosing dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In this approach, first of all, the learned weights of the VGG16 architecture are frozen, and multichannel attributes are extracted from each pooling layer. Then, these attributes were given to the inputs of the attribute average pooling layers, and one‐dimensional attributes were produced using the flattened layer. Distinctive and effective attributes were selected from these deep attributes by the mRMR algorithm. Finally, the selected attributes are given to the input of the eight‐layer classification model, which includes the Fully connected, Relu, and softmax layers. A publicly available data set consisting of four classes and 6400 images was used to test the correctness of the proposed architecture. In addition, since the number of images belonging to the classes in this data set is unstable, data augmentation methods were used. As a result, a 98.6% accuracy score was produced with the developed architecture. These results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the original VGG16 and previous works.</p>

<p>Accurate diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's with deep network approach based on multi-channel feature extraction and selection
4B7F913149A3C315B5F9FD747EFC149010.1002/ima.23079Received: 13 August 2023 Revised: 14 March 2024 Accepted: 31 March 2024Alzheimer's diseasedeep learningfeature selectionVGGNet architecture
In this article, we have proposed a multi-stage in-depth approach based on the improved VGGNet architecture for automatically and accurately diagnosing dementia and Alzheimer's disease.In this approach, first of all, the learned weights of the VGG16 architecture are frozen, and multichannel attributes are extracted from each pooling layer.Then, these attributes were given to the inputs of the attribute average pooling layers, and one-dimensional attributes were produced using the flattened layer.Distinctive and effective attributes were selected from these deep attributes by the mRMR algorithm.Finally, the selected attributes are given to the input of the eight-layer classification model, which includes the Fully connected, Relu, and softmax layers.A publicly available data set consisting of four classes and 6400 images was used to test the correctness of the proposed architecture.In addition, since the number of images belonging to the classes in this data set is unstable, data augmentation methods were used.As a result, a 98.6% accuracy score was produced with the developed architecture.These results show that the proposed architecture outperforms the original VGG16 and previous works.</p>
<p>| INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>][3] The detection Alzheimer's disease typically involves a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and neuropsychological testing. 4A thorough medical history and physical examination are essential to rule out other potential causes of cognitive impairment, such as depression, medication side effects, or other medical conditions.Laboratory tests, such as blood tests and brain imaging studies, may help identify underlying causes of dementia, such as infections, autoimmune disorders, or other medical conditions.[10] Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns and features in large datasets indicative of cognitive impairment.][12][13] In general, many studies in the literature have used deep learning models for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images.These studies typically involve using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or other deep learning architectures to analyze MRI images and extract features indicative of the disease's presence.These features are then used to train a classifier for accurate diagnosis.Studies have reported high diagnostic accuracy with the use of deep learning models.Some studies in the literature have also investigated the use of other deep learning techniques, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoencoders (AEs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for early detection of Alzheimer's disease and dementia from MRI images.In addition, some studies have explored using multiple modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy, including combining MRI images with other imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).</p>
<p>Furthermore, some studies have also looked at transfer learning, which involves pre-training a deep learning model on a large dataset and then fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset for a specific task.This approach has improved diagnostic accuracy when dealing with limited data.However, it is essential to note that these studies are still ongoing, and further research is needed to improve the generalizability and accuracy of these models and also to be applied in clinical practice.</p>
<p>In summary, detailed information about the models and data sets used in studies published in recent years for the detection of Alzheimer's disease is given in Table 1.These studies generally used datasets consisting of three and four classes.As mentioned in the paragraph above, it has been seen that almost all of the previous studies have used pre-trained deep models based on the transfer learning approach.Additionally, the performance from these models was detected to have an average accuracy score of 93%.Detailed research on these studies is given in the discussion section.</p>
<p>In this study, we present a multi-stage deep approach to automatic, accurate diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.This approach was developed based on the pre-trained VGGNet architecture.In this model, VGG16 architecture is used as a feature extractor, and a distinctive feature is selected with the MrMr algorithm.Then, these features were given to the input of the eight-layer classifier model, and the training was performed.Finally, a publicly available dataset of 4 classes and 6400 MRI images was utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model.Experimental studies have shown T A B L E 1 Previous studies for the detection of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>| MATERIALS AND METHODS</p>
<p>In the study, we proposed a new deep approach based on improved VGGNET architecture to detect Alzheimer's disease.The general representation of the proposed approach improved based on pre-trained VGGNet architecture is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>As can be seen in Figure 1, the proposed model consists of three main stages.In the first stage, feature maps of size M Â N Â C were obtained from the improved VGG16 architecture through pooling layers.Then, these feature maps were reduced to 1 Â C in size using feature average pooling.In the second stage, the features obtained from five feature average pooling layers were combined.A feature selection algorithm (MRMR) was used to select high-performance and effective features from these combined features.In the final stage, the selected features were given to the input of an 8-layer neural network classifier.In this way, the proposed model was designed to successfully perform the image classification task following a complex architecture.More details on the components of the proposed model are given in the sub-sections.</p>
<p>| Dataset</p>
<p>A dataset containing publicly available Alzheimer's disease-based MRI images (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tourist55/alzheimers-dataset-4-class-of-images) was used in our work.This data set consists of 6400 images and 4 classes, namely Non-Dementia, Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia.Sample MRI images belonging to these classes are given in Figure 2. It was observed that the number of images between classes Decayed unevenly in the MRI.Alzheimer's Dataset used in this study.Therefore, data augmentation methods such as rotation, translation, contrast, brightening, and cutting were used to stabilize the data set and solve the problem of overfitting. 26The augmented data and these values are given in Table 2 using this method.In addition, the data set is divided into 80% for training and 20% for testing.These data augmentation methods have been applied only for the training set.</p>
<p>| Feature extraction</p>
<p>VGG16 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was introduced by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford. 279][30] The architecture of VGG16 is characterized by its use of small convolutional filters (3 Â 3) and a large number of convolutional layers (16 in total).It has a total of 138 million parameters.</p>
<p>The VGG16 architecture is made up of a stack of convolutional layers (Conv2D), followed by max-pooling layers (MaxPooling2D) and fully connected layers (Dense) at the end of the network.][33] The architecture of VGG16 can be divided into five main blocks (Table 3).
(A) (B) (C) (D) F I G U R E 2
After the convolutional and max-pooling layers, the output is passed through two fully connected layers of 4096 units and 1000 units (for the 1000-class ImageNet challenge) before the final output layer. 27he current study's first 32 layers of the VGG16 architecture with the pre-trained weights are frozen.Then, features with M Â N size and C number of channels were extracted from each pooling layer of the frozen network architecture.This process is expressed in Equation (1).
feat n ð Þ ¼ activation pretrained weight , image m ð Þ ,pooling n ð Þ m ¼ 1, 2, 3, …, N; n ¼ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5ð1Þ
where m and n represent the number of images in the dataset and the five pooling layers of the proposed architecture.Using Equation ( 1), features with M Â N Â C dimension obtained for each pooling layer are obtained from an image.Later, these features are given as input to the feature average pooling layer and are expressed in Equations (2-4).

C Â 1 feature ð Þ features of each pooling layer were obtained by using Equations (2-4).Finally, these features are given as input to the flattened layer and combined (see Equation 5).As a result, deep features were achieved for each image (m) in the dataset.

<p>| Feature selection</p>
<p>The Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance, called MRMR, is an algorithm for selecting a subset of features that are most relevant to a given classification task while minimizing the redundancy among the selected features. 34It is based on the concept of mutual information and uses a greedy search strategy to identify the best subset of features.][36] The MRMR algorithm starts by initializing an empty feature set and iteratively adding one feature at a time.For each feature, the algorithm calculates two scores: the mutual information (MI) between the feature and the class label and the minimum redundancy (MR) between the feature and the features already in the feature set.The feature with the highest MRMR score (MI-MR) is then added to the feature set.The process is repeated until a pre-specified number of features is reached or until no feature has a positive MRMR score. 34,35,37,38he mathematical formula for the mutual information (MI) between feature M and class label N is 34 :
MI M, N ð Þ¼sum p a, b ð ÞÂlog p a, b ð Þ= p a ð ÞÂp b ð Þ ð Þ ð Þ ð ð6Þ
The mutual information score measures the degree of dependency between the feature and the class label and is used to quantify the relevance of the feature to the classification task.In Equation ( 6), p(a) and p(b) are the marginal probability distributions of M and N, respectively, and p(a,b) is the joint probability distribution of M and N. The minimum redundancy (MR) between feature M and the set of features X is:
MR M, X ð Þ¼min MI M, N ð ÞÀMI M,NjX ð Þ ð Þ ð7Þ
where MI(M,NjX) is the conditional mutual information between M and N given the set of features X.The MRMR score for a feature M is given by:
MRMR M ð Þ¼MI M, N ð ÞÀMR M, X ð Þð8Þ
The feature M with the highest MRMR score is then added to the feature set.In the current study, features obtained from average pooling layers are combined and fed into the MRMR algorithm to select discriminative features with high performance.In this way, it is aimed to achieve higher classification performance with few effective features.This was proven in results from experimental studies.</p>
<p>| Classification</p>
<p>In the last step, the classifier model, which has eight layers including fully connected, ReLu, and softmax layers, uses the selected deep features as input.Detailed information about the layers used in this model is given in Table 4.</p>
<p>| EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</p>
<p>For the experimental work, we used MATLAB 2022a on a workstation computer with 32GB of RAM and an NVI-DIA Quadro P4000 graphics card.This paper presents improved VGGNet architecture for automatically accurately detecting dementia and Alzheimer's disease.The deep learning parameters used in the experimental studies based on this architecture are given in Table 5.</p>
<p>The numerical and visual results of this work are presented below.Furthermore, the performance of traditional feature extractors and pre-trained deep learning architectures are analyzed in detail and compared with the performance of the proposed model in this subsection.</p>
<p>| Results</p>
<p>In this section, the deep network approach based on multi-channel feature extraction and selection developed for the diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's is applied in four different experimental studies and their performances are analyzed.Firstly, classification performance was calculated with pre-trained VGG16 architecture based on a transfer learning approach.In this approach, instead of the last three layers of the pre-trained VGG16 model, 4-class and sequentially fully connected softmax and classification layers are added.This study performs the training process with the deep parameters given in Table 5.The ROC diagram and confusion matrix based on the classification results obtained are presented in Figure 3.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 3, the VGG16 architecture based on the transfer learning approach produced an accuracy score of 94.45%.In addition, moderate demented class recognition success has been achieved as 100%.</p>
<p>In second experimental study, the pre-trained VGG16 model was used as a deep feature extractor.Accordingly, fc6, fc7, and fc8 fully connected layers, which are widely used in studies in the literature, were used as feature extractors, and 4096, 4096, and 1000 features were extracted from each FC layer, respectively.Then, these deep features were given to the input of the neural network classifier model given in Table 4 and the training was performed.Finally, confusion matrices based on the results obtained in these experimental studies using the parameters given in Table 5 are given in Figure 4.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 4, the highest accuracy score among fully connected layers used as feature extractors was 95.23%, with features obtained from fc6.In addition, on the other hand, the fc7 and fc8 layers obtained accuracy scores of 91.95% and 86.33%, respectively.</p>
<p>In the third experimental study, the performance of the VGGNet-based model (see Section 2) developed based on pooling skip layers without feature selection was calculated, and the confusion matrix and roc diagram based on these performance are given in Figure 5.In summary, in this experimental study, the features obtained from the five different pooling layers shown in Figure 1, the features obtained from five different pooling layers are combined.Then, these deep features are given to the input of the neural network classifier given in Table 4 without feature selection.</p>
<p>In Figure 5, the confusion matrix and ROC diagram based on the performance result of the proposed model without the feature selection process are given.According to these results, the proposed approach produced an accuracy score of 97.5%.Additionally, while Moderate Demented class recognition success has been achieved as 100%, in the mild demand class, only 5 images are misclassified.</p>
<p>In the final experimental study, the features obtained from the five pooling layers were combined and the MrMr algorithm was applied to select effective and discriminative features.This represents the model proposed in current study (see Figure 1).Performance results based on these selected features are given in Table 6.</p>
<p>Table 6 shows the performance of selected features with different numbers from the combined deep features obtained from poolinglayers.Based on these results, the highest accuracy score was obtained with 500 selected features.According to this result, the selected features  (500) provided an approximate 1% performance increase compared to the raw features (1472).Figure 6 illustrates that the proposed approach achieved an accuracy score of 98.6%.Notably, it achieved a 100% recognition rate for the Moderate Demented class, while each of the other classes obtained accuracy scores of 98% and above.Additionally, we examined the predictions of the network using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to ensure the interpretability of the model. 39The activation maps for the images of Alzheimer's disease (Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, and Moderate Dementia) are presented in Figure 7.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 7, there are three test images and their corresponding output heat maps.The heatmaps in the red regions represent the features learned by the proposed deep CNN model.</p>

<p>As shown in Table 8, the highest accuracy score among traditional machine learning methods was achieved by the HOG method with 84.53%.Compared to the other methods, the LBP and GLCM methods achieved accuracy scores of 75.70% and 61.41%, respectively.These results reflect the capabilities of traditional machine learning methods in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and classification.On the other hand, it is observed that the proposed model, achieves much higher success than these traditional machine learning methods.As a result, the proposed model seems to provide a significant improvement over traditional machine learning methods and these improvements are promising for developing more effective diagnosis and classification methods for Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>| DISCUSSION</p>
<p>In this section, previous studies on the data sets used in this study are analyzed in detail and the performance of the proposed model is compared.In addition, in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in more detail, another commonly used dataset in the literature is used and compared with previous studies.</p>
<p>| Comparison based on the very set used in this study</p>
<p>Early detection of dementia and Alzheimer's disease is important because it can allow for earlier initiation of treatment and interventions that may aid in slowing the progression of the disease.MRI is a commonly used imaging modality that can produce detailed images of the brain and has been used to diagnose this disease.Machine learning algorithms and deep learning have been developed to analyze MRI data and aid in the early diagnosis of this disease.These algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns and features in the data indicative of this disease and have been shown to have high accuracy in several studies.Table 9 compares the performance results of recent studies on detecting Alzheimer's disease with the proposed model.</p>
<p>In the studies presented in Table 9, the dataset used in this study, as well as studies based on  25 achieved the highest accuracy score at 97.05% among these studies.In other studies, the approach produced an average accuracy score of 95%.In conclusion, the proposed model has been observed to achieve superior performance compared to studies that used the same dataset.</p>
<p>The limitations of the proposed model include:</p>
<p>• A thorough examination is necessary to determine the most practical features using the feature selection method.• Determining the optimal deep parameters for the improved classifier model is a significant limitation on the effectiveness of the study.</p>
<p>| Performance comparisons based on another MRI dataset</p>
<p>1][52] This dataset consists of 5154 MRI images including AD, normal, and mild cognitive impairment categories.This dataset is grouped into 2 and 3 classes and the performance of the proposed model is calculated and compared with the performance of existing studies and these scores are outlined in Table 10.Table 10 summarizes the high-performance studies conducted in recent years using the ADNI dataset.According to the results of these studies, the highest performance for 2-class classification was recorded by Huang and Li (2023) with an accuracy score of 99.59%.For 3-class classification, an accuracy score of 99.79% was achieved by Kumar and Sasikala (2023).In these studies, convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models were generally used.In general, in these recent studies, classification accuracy scores have been observed to be 98% and above on average.On the other hand, the model proposed in this study produced high accuracy scores of 100% and 99.7% for 2-class and 3-class classifications, respectively.These results show that the proposed model performs exceptionally well when compared to previous studies.In conclusion, this study emphasizes that achieving high performance in early detection and classification of Alzheimer's disease has great potential for clinical applications and treatment of patients.These results reflect the importance of advances in diagnostic and classification methods for Alzheimer's disease and may contribute to better care and treatment of patients in the future.</p>
<p>| CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>Early diagnosis of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, is very important.Detection of this disease can help improve the quality of life for individuals and their families.Accordingly, we proposed a multi-stage deep approach to Automatic, accurate diagnosis of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.This approach presents an improved version of the pre-trained VGGNet architecture used as a feature extractor.In addition to this approach, feature selection and classifier models are integrated.The proposed model was tested with a publicly available dataset of 6400 images belonging to mild dementia, moderate dementia, very mild dementia, and non-dementia classes.In experimental works, the improved VGGNet model provides 4% higher performance (accuracy) improvement than the original VGGNet architecture.In addition, the current study showed superior success compared to previous studies.Based on these results, deep features selected from the pooling layers of the pre-trained VGGNet model were observed to be effective in detecting Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Experimental studies have shown that the proposed architecture can assist specialist doctors in quickly and accurately classifying dementia and Alzheimer's disease.This can significantly reduce the time needed for detection.Future research will focus on refining the feature extraction and selection processes using the proposed approach and expanding the dataset to include multiple types of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
