<h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>With the advent of large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, the field of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has surged to new heights of prosperity [12, 65]. LLMs have demonstrated their remarkable capabilities in automatically generating human-like text at scale, resulting in the Internet being inundated with an unprecedented volume of AIGC content [47, 64]. This influx of LLM-generated content has fundamentally reshaped the digital ecosystem, challenging conventional paradigms of content creation, dissemination, and information access on the Internet [2, 75].</p>
<p>Meanwhile, information retrieval (IR) systems have become indispensable for navigating and accessing the Internet's vast information landscape [36, 45]. As illustrated in Figure 1, in the era preceding the widespread emergence of LLMs, IR systems focused on retrieving documents solely from the human-written corpus in response to users' queries [33, 34, 68]. However, the proliferation of AIGC driven by LLMs has expanded the corpus of IR systems to include both human-written and LLM-generated texts. Consequently, this paradigm shift raises a fundamental research question: What is the impact of the proliferation of generated content on IR systems? We aim to explore whether existing retrieval models tend to prioritize LLM-generated text over human-written text, even when both convey similar semantic information. If this holds, LLMs may dominate information access, particularly as their generated content is rapidly growing on the Internet [25].</p>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: The overview evolution of IR paradigm from the Pre-LLM era to the LLM era.</p>
<p>To approach the fundamental research question, we decompose it into four specific research questions. The first question is RQ1: How to construct an environment to evaluate IR models in the LLM era? Given the lack of public retrieval benchmarks encompassing both human-written and LLM-generated texts, we propose an innovative and practical method to create such a realistic evaluation environment without the need of costly human annotation. Specifically, we leverage the original human-written texts as the instruction conditions to prompt LLMs to generate rewritten text copies while preserving the same semantic meaning. In this way, we can confidently assign the same relevancy labels to LLM-generated data according to the original labels. Extensive empirical analysis validates the quality of our constructed environment, demonstrating its effectiveness in mirroring real-world IR scenarios in the LLM era. As a result, we introduce two new benchmarks, SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC, tailored for IR research in the LLM era.</p>
<p>With the constructed environment, we further explore RQ2: Are retrieval models biased towards LLM-generated content? We conduct comprehensive experiments with various representative retrieval models, ranging from traditional lexical models to modern neural models based on pretrained language models (PLMs) [22, 23, 72, 73]. Surprisingly, we uncover that neural retrievers are biased towards LLM-generated texts, i.e., tend to rank LLM-generated texts in higher positions. We refer to this as source bias, as the neural retrievers favor content from specific sources (i.e., LLMgenerated content). Further experiments indicate that the source bias not only extends to the second-stage neural re-rankers from the first-stage retrieval but also manifests more severely. These findings corroborate the prevalence of source bias in neural retrieval models.</p>
<p>Then, what we are curious about is RQ3: Why are neural retrieval models biased towards LLM-generated texts? Inspired by the recent studies positing LLMs as lossless compressors [17], we analyze the cause of source bias from the viewpoint of text compression. Our analysis of singular values [31] in different corpora reveals that LLM-generated texts exhibit more focused semantics with minimal noise, enhancing their suitability for semantic matching. Furthermore, our in-depth perplexity analysis shows that LLM-generated texts consistently achieve lower perplexity scores, which indicates a higher degree of comprehensibility and confidence from the PLM's perspective. These observations collectively suggest that LLM-generated texts are more readily understandable to PLM-based neural retrievers, thereby resulting in source bias.</p>
<p>Finally, we try to answer RQ4: How to mitigate source bias in neural retrieval models? To tackle this, we propose an intuitive yet effective debiased constraint. This constraint is designed to penalize biased samples during the optimization process, thereby shifting the focus of retrieval models from exploiting inherent shortcuts to emphasizing semantic relevance. Besides, our debiased constraint is model-agnostic and can be plugged and played to the ranking optimization objectives of various neural retrieval models. Furthermore, it offers the capability to control the degree of bias removal, offering the flexibility to balance the treatment between the two sources of content based on specific requirements and environmental considerations.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we discuss the potential emerging concerns stemming from source bias, highlighting the risk of human-written content being gradually inaccessible, especially due to the rapidly increasing LLM-generated content on the Internet [8, 25]. Furthermore, source bias could be maliciously exploited to manipulate algorithms and potentially amplify the spread of misinformation, posing a threat to online security. In light of these pressing issues, we hope that our findings serve as a resounding wake-up call to all stakeholders involved in IR systems and beyond.</p>
<p>In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:
(1) We introduce a more realistic paradigm of IR systems considering the growing prosperity of AIGC, where the retrieval corpus consists of both human-written and LLM-generated texts. We then uncover a new inherent bias in both neural retrieves and re-rankers preferring LLM-generated content, termed as source bias.
(2) We provide an in-depth analysis and insights of source bias from a text compression perspective, which indicates that LLMgenerated texts maintain more focused semantics with minimal noise and are more readily comprehensible for neural retrievers.
(3) We propose a debiased constraint to penalize the biased samples during optimization, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating source bias in different degrees.
(4) We also provide two new benchmarks, SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC, which contain both high-quality human-written and various LLM-generated corpus and corresponding relevancy labels. We believe these two benchmarks can serve as valuable resources for facilitating future research of IR in the LLM era.</p>
<h2>2 RQ1: ENVIRONMENT CONSTRUCTION</h2>
<p>With the increasing usage of LLMs in generating texts (e.g., paraphrasing or rewriting), the corpus of IR systems includes both human-written and LLM-generated texts nowadays. Constructing an IR dataset in the LLM era typically involves two steps: collecting both human-written and LLM-generated corpora and then employing human evaluators to annotate relevancy labels for each querydocument pair. Given that LLM-generated content is currently unidentifiable [42] and the significant cost of human annotation,</p>

<p>Figure 2: The overall paradigm of the proposed evaluation framework for IR in the LLM era.
we introduce a natural and practical framework for quantitatively evaluating retrieval models in the LLM era, as shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>To better align with real-world scenarios, the evaluation environments should meet the following three essential criteria. Firstly, it is imperative to distinguish between human-written and LLMgenerated texts within the corpus. Secondly, we need access to relevancy labels for LLM-generated data in response to queries. Thirdly, each human-written text should better have a corresponding LLM-generated counterpart with the same semantics, ensuring the most effective and fair evaluation.</p>
<h3>2.1 Notation</h3>
<p>Formally, in the Pre-LLM era, given a query $q \in \mathcal{Q}$ where $\mathcal{Q}$ is the set of all queries, the traditional IR system aims to retrieve a list of top- $K$ relevant documents $\left{d^{(1)}, d^{(2)}, \ldots, d^{(K)}\right}$ from a corpus $\mathcal{C}^{H}=\left{d_{1}^{H}, d_{2}^{H}, \ldots d_{N}^{H}\right}$ which consists of $N$ human-written documents. However, in the era of LLMs, there is also LLM-generated text in the corpus. To evaluate the IR models in the LLM era, we also create an additional LLM-generated corpus $\mathcal{C}^{G}=\left{d_{1}^{G}, d_{2}^{G}, \ldots, d_{N}^{G}\right}$ where each document is generated by a LLM, e.g., $d_{i}^{G}$ can be created by prompting ChatGPT to rewrite $d_{i}^{H}$ while preserving its original semantics information. Consequently, given a query $q$, the objective of a retriever in the LLM era is to return the top- $K$ relevant documents from the mixed corpus $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}^{H} \cup \mathcal{C}^{G}$.</p>
<h3>2.2 Constructing IR Datasets in the LLM Era</h3>
<p>In this section, we prompt LLMs to rewrite human-written corpus to build two new standard retrieval datasets: SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC. These two new datasets can serve as valuable resources to facilitate future research of IR in the LLM era.
2.2.1 Human-Written Corpus. We first choose two widely used retrieval datasets written by humans in the Pre-LLM era as the seed data: SciFact and NQ320K. SciFact ${ }^{1}$ [57] dataset aims to retrieve evidence from the research literature containing scientific paper abstracts for fact-checking. NQ320K ${ }^{2}$ [32] is based on the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset from Google, where the documents are gathered from Wikipedia pages, and the queries are natural language questions. Following the practice in BEIR benchmark [52],</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>we process these two datasets in a standard format: corpus $\mathcal{C}^{H}$, queries $\mathcal{Q}$, and relevancy labels $\mathcal{R}^{H}=\left{\left(q_{m}, d_{m}^{H}, r_{m}\right)\right}_{m=1}^{M}$, where $M$ is the number of labeled query-document pairs in the dataset.
2.2.2 LLM-Generated Corpus. For the LLM-generated corpus, we repurpose the original human-written corpus as our seed data and instruct LLMs to rewrite each given text from the human-written corpus. As the written text generated by LLM carries almost the same semantic information as the original human-written text, we can assign the same relevancy labels to new <query, LLM-generated document> pairs as those assigned to the original labeled <query, human-written document> pairs.</p>
<p>Our instruction is straightforward: "Please rewrite the following text: [[human-written text]]", as illustrated in the left part of Figure 2. This straightforward instruction enables LLMs to generate text without too many constraints while maintaining semantic equivalence to the original human-written text. Specifically, we choose Llama2 [54] and ChatGPT to rewrite each seed human-written corpus, as Llama2 and ChatGPT are both the most widely-used and nearly the state-of-the-art open-sourced and closed-source LLM, respectively. We only generate texts with ChatGPT corresponding to the texts in SciFact dataset, mainly due to the significant cost involved in processing the larger NQ320K dataset.</p>
<p>For the LLM-generated corpus, we conduct post-processing to remove unrelated parts of the original response from LLM like "Sure, here's a possible rewrite of the text:". As a result, we can obtain two corresponding LLM-generated corpora with SciFact and NQ320K as seed data. After that, we extend the original labels of query and human-written text $\mathcal{R}^{H}=\left{\left(q_{m}, d_{m}^{H}, r_{m}\right)\right}<em m="m">{m=1}^{M}$ to get the corresponding label of LLM-generated text $\mathcal{R}^{G}=\left{\left(q</em>$, we can create two new datasets, denoted as SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the proposed two datasets.}, d_{m}^{G}, r_{m}\right)\right}_{m=1}^{M}$. We will validate the quality of the datasets in the following section. Combining each original human-written corpus $\mathcal{C}^{H}$ with its corresponding LLM-generated corpus $\mathcal{C}^{G}$, original queries $\mathcal{Q}$, and labels $\mathcal{R}^{H} \cup \mathcal{R}^{G</p>
<h3>2.3 Statistics and Quality Validation of Datasets</h3>
<p>Take the Llama2-generated data as an example, we conduct the statistics and quality validation of the constructed datasets. The analysis of ChatGPT-generated datasets shows similar observations and conclusions and is omitted due to the page limitation.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Distribution of term Jaccard similarity and overlap between Llama2-generated and human-written corpora. 2.3.1 Term-based Statistics and Analysis. We first analyze the termbased similarity between the LLM-generated corpus and the humanwritten corpus. Specifically, we compute the Jaccard similarity $\left(\frac{\left(d^{C}\left(\left\lceil d^{H}\right)\right.\right.}{\left(d^{C}\left(\left\lceil d^{H}\right)\right.\right.}\right)$ and the overlap $\left(\frac{\left(d^{C}\left(\left\lceil d^{H}\right)\right.\right.}{\left(d^{H}\right.}\right)$ between each LLM-generated document and orginal human-written document. As shown in Figure 3, both the Jaccard similarity and overlap distributions exhibit normal distribution, with peaks at about 0.6 and 0.8 for SciFact+AIGC, and about 0.4 and 0.6 for NQ320K+AIGC, respectively. These observations suggest that while there is a considerable overlap of terms between the LLM-generated text and the original human-written text, there are also distinct differences, especially noticeable in the NQ320K+AIGC dataset. 2.3.2 Semantic-based Statistics and Analysis. For the LLM-generated texts, a pivotal consideration is whether they faithfully preserve the underlying semantics of the corresponding human-written corpus. If they indeed do so, we then can confidently assign them the same relevancy labels as the labels of their corresponding original human-written texts given each query.</p>
<p>To assess this, we first leverage the OpenAI embedding model ${ }^{3}$ to acquire semantic embeddings for both the LLM-generated and</p>

<p>Figure 5: Distribution of cosine similarity of semantic embedding between Llama2-generated and human-written corpora. human-written texts. Subsequently, we visualize these embeddings through T-SNE [55] in Figure 4. We observe a strikingly close overlap between the Llama2-generated corpus and the human-written corpus in the latent space. This observation strongly suggests that these LLM-generated corpora adeptly preserve the original semantics. Moreover, we delve into the cosine similarity of semantic embeddings between the LLM-generated text and their corresponding human-written counterparts. The results, as shown in Figure 5, also indicate a high degree of similarity, with most values exceeding 0.95 , affirming the faithful preservation of semantics in LLM-generated text. Hence, for each query-document pair $\left(q, d^{C}\right)$, we can confidently assign the relevancy label $r$ to be the same as that of $\left(q, d^{H}\right)$.</p>

<p>2.3.3 Retrieval Performance Evaluation. To further validate the accuracy of the relevancy label assignments, we conduct an evaluation of retrieval models on the human-written corpus and the LLM-generated corpus, respectively. The following representative retrieval models are adopted in the experiments: (1) Lexical Retrieval Models: TF-IDF [46] and BM25 [41] and (2) Neural Retrieval Models: ANCE [67], BERM [70], TAS-B [26], Contriever [28].</p>
<p>The results on each sole source corpus on the proposed two new benchmarks are presented in Table 2. It is evident that all retrieval models exhibit no significant performance discrepancies in terms of various ranking metrics between the human-written and LLMgenerated corpora across all datasets. This observation reinforces the confidence in the quality of our newly constructed datasets.
2.3.4 Human Evaluation. Note that in our constructed datasets, LLMs were instructed to rewrite human-written texts based solely on the original human-written text, without any query-related input, thereby preventing the additional query-specific information during rewriting. Moreover, to further verify this, we conduct a human evaluation. Specifically, we randomly select 50 <query, humanwritten document, LLM-generated document> triples from each dataset. The human annotators, comprising the authors and their highly educated colleagues, are asked to determine which document is more semantically relevant to the given query. The options are "Human", "LLM", or "Equal". During the evaluation, annotators are unaware of the source of each document. Each triple is labeled at least by three different annotators, with the majority vote determining the final label. The results in Table 3, confirm that both sources of texts have almost the same semantic relevance to the given queries, which guarantees the fairness of our following exploration of source bias.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also conduct further human evaluations specifically focused on text quality. The human annotators are asked to determine "Which document exhibits higher quality by considering the following aspects: linguistic fluency, logical coherence, and information density?" The notation process is the same as above, and the results are summarized in Table 3. The results indicate no significant distinction between LLM-generated and human-written content on text quality, demonstrating consistency across both sources. In fact, we also analyze the data cases and find that LLMs typically alter only parts of the vocabulary, leading to minor stylistic differences without impacting the core content, which can be further verified with these human evaluations.</p>
<h2>3 RQ2: UNCOVERING SOURCE BIAS</h2>
<p>In this section, we conduct extensive experiments on the constructed datasets to explore the source bias from various aspects. With the constructed simulated environment, we first introduce the evaluation metrics to quantify the severity of source bias. We then conduct experiments with different retrieval models on both the first-stage retrieval and the second-stage re-ranking.</p>
<h3>3.1 Evaluation Metrics for Source Bias</h3>
<p>To quantitatively explore source bias, we calculate ranking metrics, targeting separately either human-written or LLM-generated corpus. Specifically, for each query, an IR model produces a ranking list that comprises documents from mixed corpora. We then calculate top-K Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@K) and Mean Average Precision (MAP@K), for $K \in{1,3,5}$, independently for each corpus source. When assessing one corpus (e.g., human-written), documents from the other (e.g., LLM-generated) are treated as non-relevant, though the original mixed-source ranking order is maintained. This approach allows us to independently assess the performance of IR models on each corpus source.</p>
<p>To better normalize the difference among different benchmarks, we also introduce the relative percentage difference as follows:
$\operatorname{Relative} \Delta=\frac{\operatorname{Metric}<em _LLM-generated="{LLM-generated" _text="\text">{\text {Human-written }}-\operatorname{Metric}</em>}}}{\frac{1}{2}\left(\operatorname{Metric<em _LLM-generated="{LLM-generated" _text="\text">{\text {Human-written }}+\operatorname{Metric}</em> \times 100 \%$,
where the Metric can be NDCG@K and MAP@K. Note that Relative $\Delta&gt;0$ means retrieval models rank human-written texts higher, and Relative $\Delta&lt;0$ indicates LLM-generated texts are ranked higher. The greater the absolute value of Relative $\Delta$, the greater the ranking performance difference between two sourced content.}}\right)</p>
<h3>3.2 Bias in Neural Retrieval Models</h3>
<p>In our assessment of various retrieval models on SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC datasets, we observe distinct phenomena when evaluating against human-written and LLM-generated corpora, as reported in Table 4. Our key findings are as follows:</p>
<p>Lexical models prefer human-written texts. Lexical models like TF-IDF and BM25 show a tendency to favor human-written texts over LLM-generated texts across most ranking metrics in both datasets. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon lies in the term-based distinctions between text generated by LLMs and human-written content, as evident in Figure 3. Additionally, the queries are crafted by humans and thus exhibit a style more closely aligned with human-written text.</p>
<p>Neural retrievers are biased towards LLM-generated texts. Neural models, which rely on semantic matching with PLMs, demonstrate a pronounced preference for LLM-generated texts, often performing over $30 \%$ better on these compared to human-written texts. These findings suggest an inherent bias in neural retrievers towards LLM-generated text, which we named the source bias. This source bias may stem from PLMs-based neural retrievers and LLMs sharing similar Transformer-based architectures [56] and pretraining approaches, leading to potential exploitation of semantic shortcuts in LLM-generated text during semantic matching. Additionally, LLMs seem to semantically compress information in a manner that makes</p>
<p>Table 4: Performance comparison of retrieval models for mixed human-written and Llama2-generated corpora on SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC dataset. The numbers indicate that retrieval models rank human-written documents in higher positions than LLM-generated documents (i.e., Relative $\Delta&gt;0 \%$ ). Conversely, the numbers mean retrieval models rank LLM-generated documents in higher positions than human-written documents (i.e., Relative $\Delta \leq 0 \%$ ). The intensity of the color reflects the extent of the difference. In the subsequent tables, we will continue with this color scheme.</p>

<p>it more comprehensible to neural models. A deeper exploration into the causes of source bias is presented in the following section.</p>
<p>To strengthen our conclusion that source bias is not limited to any specific LLM, we extend our investigation to include ChatGPT, another widely adopted and nearly state-of-the-art LLM. We employ ChatGPT to generate a corpus using the same prompts as those utilized with Llama2 in the above experiments. Subsequently, in Table 5, we report the evaluation results on the SciFact+AIGC dataset, which contains both human-written and ChatGPT-generated texts. Once again, the results clearly indicate a bias within neural retrieval models, favoring the corpus generated by ChatGPT across all ranking metrics. This observation provides additional substantiation of the presence of source bias within these neural retrieval models.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we also explore the popular InstructGPT-prompts GitHub Repository, which includes several common prompts for</p>

<p>rephrasing passages ${ }^{4}$. The experimental results in Appendix B show varying degrees of source bias, indicating that common prompts can easily trigger source bias with LLM-generated content. These findings highlight the notable presence of source bias in neural retrieval models towards LLM-generated content.</p>
<h3>3.3 Bias in Re-Ranking Stage</h3>
<p>In a typical IR system, there are two primary stages of document filtering. The first stage involves a retriever, responsible for document recall, while the second stage employs a re-ranker, which fine-tunes the ordering of documents within the initially retrieved set. While we have revealed the presence of the source bias in the first stage, a natural pivotal research question remains: does this</p>

<p>Figure 6: Comparision of the relative singular value (SV) of the different corpus after SVD. The singular values are sorted in descending order from left to right.
bias also manifest in the re-ranking stage? To delve into this, we select two representative and state-or-the-art re-ranking models: MiniLM [62] and monoT5 [37] to rerank the top-100 document list retrieved by a first-stage BM25 model.</p>
<p>The results on the SciFact+AIGC dataset with Llama-generated corpus and ChatGPT-generated corpus are presented in Table 6. From the results, while even the first-stage retrievers (BM25) may exhibit a preference for human-written content, the second-stage re-rankers once again demonstrate a bias in favor of LLM-generated content. Remarkably, the bias in re-ranking models appears to be more severe, as evidenced by the relative percentage difference of $-67.3 \%$ and $-59.4 \%$ in NDCG@1 for monoT5, respectively. These findings further confirm the pervasiveness of source bias in neural ranking models that rely on PLMs, regardless of the first retrieval stage or second re-ranking stage.</p>
<h2>4 RQ3: THE CAUSE OF SOURCE BIAS</h2>
<p>In this section, we delve deeper into why neural retrieval models exhibit source bias. Our objective is to determine whether the LLM-generated texts, characterized by reduced noise and more concentrated semantic topics, are inherently easier for neural retrieval models to semantically match. We conduct a series of analyses from the perspective of text compression and provide valuable insights.</p>
<h3>4.1 Viewpoint from Text Compression</h3>
<p>We first explore the cause of source bias from a compression perspective, drawing inspiration from recent studies that suggest LLMs are lossless compressors [17]. We hypothesize that LLMs efficiently focus on essential information, minimizing noise during generation, in contrast to human-written texts, which may include more diverse topics and incidental noise. To verify this, we employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [31] to compare topic concentration and noise in human-written and LLM-generated texts. The dimension of the SVD corresponds to the maximum number of topics, and the singular value associated with each topic represents its strength. High singular values predominantly capture primary topic information, whereas low singular values indicate noise.</p>
<p>Specifically, we utilize the OpenAI embedding model to obtain embedding matrices for each corpus in the SciFact+AIGC dataset and then conduct SVD. The resulting singular values are arranged
<img alt="img-5.jpeg" src="img-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7: Comparision of the PPL of the different corpus.
in descending order, and their comparison to the human-written corpus is visualized in Figure 6. As we can see, LLM-generated texts exhibit larger singular values at the top large singular values, while smaller singular values at the tail small singular values. This observation suggests that LLM-generated texts tend to have more focused semantics with less noise, rendering them more suitable for precise semantic matching. In contrast, human-written texts often contain a wider range of latent topics and higher levels of noise, making them harder for neural retrievers to understand. As a result, this difference in semantic concentration may contribute to the observed source bias in neural retrievers.</p>
<h3>4.2 Further Analysis from Perplexity</h3>
<p>Considering that most modern neural retrievers are grounded on PLMs [23, 72, 73], such as BERT [19], Roberta [35], and T5 [40], we analyze the perplexity of PLMs to further support the conclusion above from the viewpoint of compression that LLM-generated texts can be better understood by PLMs. Perplexity is an important metric for evaluating how well a language model can understand a given text [6, 59]. For a specific language model (LM) and a document $d=$ $\left(d_{0}, d_{1}, \cdots, d_{S}\right)$, the log perplexity is defined as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of each token in the tokenized sequence of $d^{S}$ :</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{PPL}(d)=-\frac{1}{S}\left(\sum_{s=1}^{S} \log P_{\mathrm{LM}}\left(d_{s} \mid \text { context }\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $S$ is the token length of text $d$ and $P_{\mathrm{LM}}\left(d_{s}\right)$ is the predicted likelihood of the $s$-th token conditioned on the context. Lower perplexity suggests more confidence and understanding of LM for text patterns, while higher perplexity implies greater uncertainty in predictions, often arising from complex or unpredictable text patterns.</p>
<p>Using the most widely-used LM, BERT [19], as an example, we employ it to calculate the PPL for different corpus. As BERT is not an autoregressive LM, we follow standard practices [58, 63] to calculate the likelihood of each token conditioned on the other tokens, i.e.,</p>
<p>$$
P_{\mathrm{LM}}\left(d_{s} \mid \text { context }\right):=P_{\mathrm{BERT}}\left(d_{s} \mid d_{\leq S \backslash{s}}\right)
$$</p>
<p>The distribution of perplexity for different corpus in the SciFact+AIGC dataset is shown in Figure 7. Notably, LLM-generated texts consistently exhibit significantly lower perplexity, indicating enhanced comprehensibility and higher confidence from BERT's perspective. Consequently, PLMs-based neural retrievers can more effectively model the semantics of LLM-generated texts, leading to the observed source bias in favor of LLM-generated texts.</p>

<p>In Appendix C, we also provide a theoretical analysis to illustrate and verify the observation in Figure 7 that LLM-generated texts have a smaller perplexity than human-written texts.</p>
<h2>5 RQ4: MITIGATING SOURCE BIAS</h2>
<p>In this section, we propose a simple but effective approach to mitigate source bias by introducing a debiased constraint to the optimization objective. In this way, we can force the neural IR models to focus on modeling semantic relevance rather than the inherent semantic shortcut of the LLM-generated content.</p>
<h3>5.1 Our Method: A Debiased Constraint</h3>
<p>Our earlier findings of source bias indicate that neural retrievers tend to rank LLM-generated documents in higher positions. Thus, the motivation of our debiased method is straightforward, which is to force the retrieval models to focus on modeling the semantic relevance and not assign higher predicted relevance scores to the LLMgenerated documents. Specifically, following the practice in Section 2.2, we first generate the corresponding LLM-generated corpus $C^{G}$ for the original human-written training corpus $C^{H}$. In this way, we can get the new paired training data $\mathcal{D}=\left{\left(q_{m}, d_{m}^{H}, d_{m}^{G}\right)\right}<em m="m">{m=1}^{M}$, where each element $\left(q</em>$ are the corresponding human-written and LLM-generated relevant documents for the query $q$, respectively. Then we introduce the debiased constraint, which can be defined as}, d_{m}^{H}, d_{m}^{G}\right)$ is a $&lt;$ query, human-written document, LLM-generated document&gt; triplet. $d_{m}^{H}$ and $d_{m}^{G</p>
<p>$$
\mathcal{L}<em _left_q__m="\left(q_{m">{\text {debias }}=\sum</em> ; \Theta\right)\right}
$$}, d_{m}^{H}, d_{m}^{G}\right) \in \mathcal{D}} \max \left{0, \hat{r}\left(q, d^{G} ; \Theta\right)-\hat{r}\left(q, d^{H</p>
<p><img alt="img-7.jpeg" src="img-7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9: Performance comparison of neural retrievers on only human-written SciFact dataset with different coefficient $\alpha$ in our proposed debiased method.
where $\hat{r}\left(q, d^{G} ; \Theta\right)$ and $\hat{r}\left(q, d^{H} ; \Theta\right)$ are the predicted relevance scores of $\left(q, d^{G}\right)$ and $\left(q, d^{H}\right)$ by the retrieval models with parameters $\Theta$, respectively. This constraint can penalize biased samples when the predicted relevance score of $\left(q, d^{G}\right)$ is greater than that of $\left(q, d^{H}\right)$.</p>
<p>Based on the debiased constraint defined in (1), we can define the final loss for training an unbiased neural retriever:</p>
<p>$$
\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}<em _debias="{debias" _text="\text">{\text {rank }}+\alpha \mathcal{L}</em>
$$}</p>
<p>where the $\mathcal{L}_{\text {rank }}$ can be any common-used loss for the ranking task, e.g., contrastive loss or regression loss [22, 23, 73]. And $\alpha$ is the debiased co-efficient that can balance the ranking performance and the degree of the source bias. The larger $\alpha$ indicates the greater penalty on the biased samples, leading to the retriever being more likely to rank the human-written texts in higher positions.</p>
<h3>5.2 Results and Analysis</h3>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed debiased method, we equip the debiased constraint defined in Eq. (1) to two representative neural retrievers: ANCE [67] and BERM [70]. In the experiments, we vary the debiased co-efficient $\alpha$ within the range of ${1 e-4,5 e-4,1 e-3,5 e-3,1 e-2}$. The original retrieval models learned without the debiased constraint are denoted as "w/o debias". The results on the SciFact+AIGC dataset are presented in Figure 8.</p>
<p>As we can see, as the debiased co-efficient $\alpha$ increases, the Relative $\Delta$ gradually shifts from negative to positive across almost all metrics and mixed datasets. This trend indicates that the neural retrieval models can rank human-written text higher than LLMgenerated text with large $\alpha$. This can be attributed to the inclusion of our debiased constraint into the learning objective, which can penalize the biased samples and compel the retrieval models not to assign higher predicted relevance scores to LLM-generated content. Moreover, as shown in Figure 9, our method not only maintains the retrieval performance on the sole human-written corpus but also provides improvements, especially with BERM as the backbone. This improvement is likely due to the inclusion of LLM-generated samples, which might enhance the model's ability to discern relevance among similar documents.</p>
<p>In summary, these empirical results have demonstrated the efficacy of our proposed debiased method in mitigating source bias to different extents by adjusting the debiased coefficient $\alpha$. This flexibility allows for customizing debiasing mechanisms to meet diverse perspectives and demands. Notably, the decision to maintain</p>
<p>equality between the two content sources or favor human-written content can be tailored based on specific requirements and environmental considerations. For example, users may not mind the content's source if it is of high quality and fulfills their informational needs. However, bias becomes a significant issue when we aim to credit content providers and encourage more creation, impacting the sustainability of the content creation ecosystem. The optimal strategy for enhancing the sustainable development of the IR ecosystem remains an open question for further exploration.</p>
<h2>6 DISCUSSION: SOUNDING THE ALARM</h2>
<p>Through a rigorous series of experiments and thorough analysis, we have identified that neural retrieval models demonstrate clear preferences for LLM-generated texts, referred to as source bias. This bias, with the burgeoning proliferation of LLMs and AIGC, may raise significant concerns for a variety of aspects.</p>
<p>First, the presence of source bias poses a significant risk of gradually rendering human-written content less accessible, potentially causing a disruption in the content ecosystem. More severely, the concern is escalating with the growing prevalence of LLM-generated content online[8, 25]. Second, there is the risk that source bias may amplify the spread of misinformation, especially considering the potential of LLMs to generate deceptive content, whether intentionally or not [5, 13, 39, 49]. Third, source bias may be maliciously exploited to attack against neural retrieval models within today's search engines, creating a precarious vulnerability that could be weaponized by malicious actors, reminiscent of earlier web spam link attacks against PageRank [24].</p>
<p>As discussed above, since LLMs can be readily instructed to generate texts at scale, source bias presents potential tangible and serious threats to the ecosystem of web content, public trust, and online safety. We hope this discussion will sound the alarm regarding the risks posed by source bias in the LLM era.</p>
<h2>7 RELATED WORK</h2>
<p>Large Language Models for IR. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) [64, 71, 74] has ushered in a transformative era across various research domains, such as natural language processing (NLP) [7, 11], education [21, 38], recommender systems [15, 20], finance [27, 66], and medicine [3, 53]. In the field of IR, much effort has also been made to utilize the remarkable knowledge and capabilities of LLMs to enhance IR systems [2, 75]. In the industry community, an exemplary successful application is New Bing ${ }^{6}$, which is an LLM-powered search assistant that adeptly extracts information from various web pages and delivers concise summarized responses to user queries, thereby improving the search experience. In the research community, there has been a proactive exploration of integrating LLMs into the IR components, including query rewriters [48, 60], retrievers [16, 69], re-rankers [14, 50], and readers [29, 43]. For a more comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in LLMs for IR, please refer to the recent survey [75].
Artificial Intelligence Generated Content. Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) is a rapidly advancing field that involves the creation of content using advanced Generative AI (GAI) [1, 12,</p>
<p><sup id="fnref7:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>65]. Unlike traditional content crafted by humans, AIGC can be generated at scale and in considerably less time [25, 47]. Recently, the development of LLMs and other GAI models has greatly improved the quality of AIGC content than before. For instance, LLMs such as ChatGPT have shown impressive abilities in generating humanlike content [12, 65]. The DALL-E-3 [9], another state-of-the-art text-to-image generation system, can follow user instructions to produce high-quality images. Nevertheless, as AIGC becomes more prevalent across myriad domains, ethical concerns, and potential risks come into sharper focus [51, 61]. In fact, inevitably, the GAI models may generate content with bias and discrimination as the large training data always contain bias and toxicity [8, 18, 76]. Furthermore, researchers have found that LLMs can be manipulated into generating increasingly deceptive misinformation, posing challenges to online safety [13, 30, 49]. In addition, some recent studies indicate that training GAI models with synthetic data could result in the collapse of the next-generation models [4, 10, 44]. Thus, AIGC is a double-edged sword that requires cautious handling.</p>
<h2>8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</h2>
<p>In this paper, we provide a preliminary analysis of the impact of the proliferation of generated content on IR systems, which is a pressing and emerging problem in the LLM era. We first introduce two new benchmarks, SciFact+AIGC and NQ320K+AIGC, and build an environment for evaluating IR models in scenarios where the corpus comprises both human-written and LLM-generated texts. Through extensive experiments within this environment, we uncover an unexpected bias of neural retrieval models favoring LLM-generated text. Moreover, we provide an in-depth analysis of this bias from the perspective of text compression. We also introduce a plug-and-play debiased strategy, which shows the potential to mitigate the source bias to different degrees. Finally, we discuss the crucial concerns and potential risks of this bias to the whole web ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our study offers valuable insights into several promising directions for future research, including exploring source bias in other information systems (e.g., recommender systems and advertising systems) and examining source bias in neural models towards AIGC data across multiple data modalities, not limited to text. Moreover, uncovering the root cause of the source bias and thus further mitigating it are difficult but crucial research directions.</p>

<h2>C THEORETICAL ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS</h2>
<p>In Figure 7, we have compared the PPL for different corpus using the BERT model. In this section, we aim to further provide some theoretical insights into the above observations that LLM-generated texts have a smaller perplexity than human-written texts.</p>
<p>Without loss of generality, we define the PPL in an autoregressive manner. Let $d^{H}$ denote a document written by humans, and $d^{G}$ a document generated by an LLM conditioned on $d^{H}$. For a given document $d$ and BERT model $\mathcal{B}$, PPL is calculated as</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{PPL}(d, \mathcal{B})=-\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \log P_{\mathrm{BERT}}\left(d_{s} \mid d_{&lt;s}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Similarly, we use $\operatorname{PPL}(d, \mathcal{H})$ to represent the PPL of document $d$ when evaluated by humans. The PPL of $d^{G}$ conditioned on $d^{H}$ is denoted as</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right)=-\frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \log P_{\mathrm{BERT}}\left(d_{s}^{G} \mid d_{&lt;s}^{G}, d^{H}\right)
$$</p>
<p>When evaluated by humans, we use $\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)$ to represent the PPL of $d^{G}$ conditioned on $d^{H}$.</p>
<p>In the theorem below, we introduce three assumptions: Semantic Superiority, Conditional Redundancy, and Bounded Perplexity, to theoretically establish the sufficient conditions under which $\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right) \leq \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right)$ holds. Semantic Superiority suggests that the perplexity of human-written texts, when evaluated by humans, is lower than when evaluated by BERT. Conditional Redundancy implies that the perplexity of $d^{G}$, given $d^{H}$, is lower than the perplexity of $d^{H}$ when evaluated directly. This is intuitively true when the information added in generating from $d^{H}$ to $d^{G}$ doesn't exceed the original information in $d^{H}$. Bounded perplexity assumes that there exists an upper bound $\epsilon$ on the increase in perplexity when evaluating $d^{G}$ directly, compared to evaluating $d^{G}$ conditioned on $d^{H}$. Then we have the following theorem:</p>
<p>Theorem C.1. Given the following conditions:</p>
<p><sup id="fnref8:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>- Semantic Superiority: human beings outperform BERT in understanding human-written texts, i.e.,</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right) \geq 0
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>Conditional Redundancy: generating $d^{G}$ from $d^{H}$ adds less perplexity than $d^{H}$ itself, i.e.,</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right) \geq 0
$$</p>
<ul>
<li>Bounded Perplexity: there exists a bounded non-negative difference $\epsilon$ in BERT's perplexity for $d^{G}$ with or without $d^{H}$, i.e.,</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right) \leq \epsilon
$$</p>
<p>If LLM aligns more closely with BERT than with humans when predicting $d^{G}$ given $d^{H}$, such that for any $s \in[S]$,</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P_{\text {LLM }}\left(d_{s}^{G} \mid d_{&lt;s}^{G}, d^{H}\right) | P_{\text {BERT }}\left(d_{s}^{G} \mid d_{&lt;s}^{G}, d^{H}\right)\right)+\epsilon \
&amp; \leq D_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P_{\text {LLM }}\left(d_{s}^{G} \mid d_{&lt;s}^{G}, d^{H}\right) | P_{\text {Human }}\left(d_{s}^{G} \mid d_{&lt;s}^{G}, d^{H}\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>it follows that</p>
<p>$$
\mathbb{E}<em _LLM="{LLM" _text="\text">{P</em>\right)\right] \leq 0
$$}}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}\right)}\left[\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{B</p>
<p>In Theorem C.1, the KL divergence is used to compare the distributions of the document $d^{G}$ conditioned on $d^{H}$ according to the LLM, BERT model, and humans. It is worth emphasizing that inequation (3) is not the assumption on the understanding capabilities of BERT, LLM, and humans. Instead, this inequation assumes that when predicting $d^{G}$ given $d^{H}$, the predictions by LLM are more closely aligned with those of BERT.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that, when inequation (3) is satisfied, the perplexity (evaluated by PLMs such as BERT) of $d^{G}$ is lower than that of $d^{H}$. We'd like to emphasize that it is reasonable to expect that inequation (3) holds true because both LLM and BERT are Transformer-based models that use similar pretraining paradigms. The commonality in model structure and learning paradigms may lead to similar inherent biases in text prediction, making their predictions more aligned with each other.</p>
<p>The proof for Theorem C. 1 is provided as follows:
Proof. We start by introducing the term $\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)$ :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right) \
&amp; =\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)+\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right) \
&amp; \leq \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where the last step follows from the Semantic Superiority condition.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{B}\right) \leq \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right) \
&amp; =\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G}, \mathcal{B}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right) \
&amp; +\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Next, we provide upper bounds of $\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)$ :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right) \
&amp; =\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right) \
&amp; +\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right) \
&amp; \leq \operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where the inequality follows from the Conditional Redundancy. Taking expectation on $\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{G}\right)-\operatorname{PPL}\left(d^{G} \mid d^{H}, \mathcal{H}\right)$ :</p>
