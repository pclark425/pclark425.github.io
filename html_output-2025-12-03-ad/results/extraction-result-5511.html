                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> It is shown how, within the framework of general relativity and without the introduction of wormholes, it is possible to modify a spacetime in a way that allows a spaceship to travel with an arbitrarily large speed. By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it, motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible. The resulting distortion is reminiscent of the ``warp drive'' of science fiction. However, just as it happens with wormholes, exotic matter will be needed in order to generate a distortion of spacetime like the one discussed here.</p>

            "required_technology": "Ability to produce and sustain an engineered, localized spacetime curvature (a warp bubble) of radius R with a prescribed shift vector/metric profile; macroscopic 'exotic' matter or fields producing negative energy density (violating the weak, dominant, and strong energy conditions); precise control of the stress-energy distribution around the vessel; means to switch the bubble on/off and to shape the f(r) profile; engineering to manage tidal gradients (bubble size R large compared with ship size).",

            "engineering_challenges": "Requires exotic matter with negative energy density (classical energy conditions are violated); no known classical matter produces the required stress-energy; potential requirement of enormous total (and localized negative) energy densities; tidal forces can be large in regions where the bubble radius is comparable to ship size; maintaining and shaping the spacetime bubble and switching it on/off are unspecified; possibility of causal pathologies (the paper notes it may be straightforward to construct related spacetimes with closed causal curves); practical generation and manipulation of the necessary stress-energy distribution is not addressed.",
            "proposed_solutions": "Paper points out that quantum field theory allows localized negative energy densities in special circumstances (e.g., Casimir effect), suggesting quantum effects might supply the needed exotic stress-energy; recommends making the warp-bubble radius R larger than the ship size to reduce tidal forces and arranging symmetric acceleration/deceleration phases so external stars remain unperturbed; no concrete engineering mechanisms or energy-source designs are proposed.",
            "experimental_or_simulation_results": "None reported; the paper provides analytic metric construction and mathematical analysis (expansion scalar, energy-density sign from Einstein tensor), but no laboratory experiments or numerical simulations are described.",
            "feasibility_assessment": "Author's assessment: The metric demonstrates mathematical possibility within general relativity (i.e., not forbidden by the formalisms used), but the concept requires exotic matter that violates standard energy conditions; while quantum field theory permits negative energy densities in special cases, this does not by itself establish practical feasibility—overall feasibility is therefore highly uncertain and contingent on obtaining and controlling exotic stress-energy.",
            "counterarguments_or_critiques": "The constructed metric violates the weak, dominant, and strong energy conditions (the energy density measured by Eulerian observers is everywhere negative); creation of the required stress-energy may be physically unattainable with known classical matter; potential for large tidal forces unless the bubble is much larger than the ship; the author notes the possibility of constructing related spacetimes with closed causal curves, which raises causality concerns; no concrete mechanism is given to produce or sustain the necessary negative-energy distribution, so practical viability is questioned.",

<p>H ere I w i sh to di scuss a si m pl e exam pl e that show s how thi s can be done.

T hi s doesn' t m ean that our observers w i l lbe travel l i ng faster than l i ght: they al ways m ove i nsi de thei r l ocall i ght-cones.

In the sam e way,one can use a contracti on ofspaceti m e to approach an objectatany speed. T hi si sthe basi softhe m odelforhyperfast space travelthat I w i sh to present here: create a l ocaldi storti on ofspaceti m e that w i l lproduce an expansi on behi nd the spaceshi p, and an opposi te contracti on ahead of i t. In thi s way,the spaceshi p w i l lbe pushed away from the Earth and pul l ed towards a di stant star by spaceti m e i tsel f. O ne can then i nvert the process to com e back to Earth, taki ng an arbi trari l y sm al lti m e to com pl ete the round tri p.</p>
<p>Iw i l lnow i ntroduce a si m pl e m etri c thathaspreci sel y the characteri sti cs m enti oned above. Iw i l ldo thi s usi ng the l anguage ofthe 3+ 1 form al i sm ofgeneralrel ati vi ty [ 1,2] , because i t w i l lperm i t a cl ear i nterpretati on ofthe resul ts. In thi s form al i sm ,spaceti m e i s descri bed by a fol i ati on ofspacel i ke hypersurfaces ofconstant coordi nate ti m e t. T he geom etry ofspaceti m e i sthen gi ven i n term softhe fol l ow i ng quanti ti es: the 3-m etri c ij ofthe hypersurfaces,the l apse functi on thatgi ves the i ntervalofproper ti m e between nearby hypersurfaces asm easured by the \Eul eri an" observers (those w hose four-vel oci ty i snorm alto thehypersurfaces),and the shi ftvector i thatrel atesthe spati alcoordi nate system s on di erent hypersurfaces. U si ng these quanti ti es,the m etri c ofspaceti m e can be w ri tten as: 2
ds 2 = d 2 = g dx dx = 2 i i dt 2 + 2 i dx i dt + ij dx i dx j :(1)
N oti ce that as l ong as the m etri c ij i s posi ti ve de ni te for al lval ues of t (as i t shoul d i n order for i t to be a spati alm etri c),the spaceti m e i s guaranteed to be gl obal l y hyperbol i c. A ny spaceti m e that can be descri bed i n the l anguage ofthe 3+ 1 form al i sm w i l ltherefore have no cl osed causalcurves.</p>
<p>Let us now assum e thatour spaceshi p m oves al ong the x axi s ofa cartesi an coordinate system . W e want to nd a m etri c that w i l l\push" the spaceshi p al ong a trajectory descri bed by an arbi trary functi on ofti m e x s (t).A m etri c thathasthi sproperty i sgi ven by (G = c = 1):

<p>Fi rst,from equati on (5) we see that the 3-geom etry ofthe hypersurfaces i s al ways at.</p>
<p>M oreover, the fact that the l apse i s gi ven by = 1 i m pl i es that the ti m el i ke curves norm alto these hypersurfaces are geodesi cs,i . e. ,the Eul eri an observers are i n free fal l .</p>
<p>Spaceti m e,however,i s not at due to the presence ofa non-uni form shi ft. N everthel ess, si nce the shi ft vector vani shes for r s R ,we see that at any ti m e t spaceti m e w i l lbe essenti al l y at everyw here except w i thi n a regi on w i th a radi us oforder R ,centered at the poi nt (x s (t);0;0).</p>

w here D i denotes covari ant di erenti ati on w i th respect to the 3-m etri c ij . From the form of and ij ,i s not di cul t to see that thi s expressi on reduces to:

From thi s expressi on i t i s not di cul t to show that:

It i s at thi s poi nt that a di sturbance of spaceti m e of the type descri bed, centered at the spaceshi p' s posi ti on, rst appears. T hi s di sturbance i s such that the spaceshi p i s pushed away from A w i th a coordi nate accel erati on that changes rapi dl y from 0 to a constant val ue a.

It i s then easy to see that for the spaceshi p' s trajectory we w i l lhave:d = dt :(13)T hi s i m pl i es not onl y that the spaceshi p m oves on a ti m el i ke curve, but al so that i ts properti m e i sequalto coordi nate ti m e. Si nce coordi nate ti m e i sal so equalto the proper ti m e ofdi stantobserversi n the atregi on,we concl ude thatthe spaceshi p su ersno ti m e di l ati on as i t m oves. It i s al so strai ghtforward to prove that the spaceshi p m oves on a geodesi c. T hi s m eans that even though the coordi nate accel erati on can be an arbi trary functi on ofti m e,the proper accel erati on al ong the spaceshi p' s path w i l lal ways be zero. M oreover,i t i s not di cul t to convi nce onesel fthat w hen the param eter i s l arge,the ti dalforcesi n the i m m edi ate vi ci ni ty ofthe spaceshi p are very sm al l(provi ded that R i s l arger than the si ze ofthe spaceshi p). O fcourse,i n the regi on w here r s ' R the ti dal forces can be very l arge i ndeed. To see how one can use thi s m etri c to m ake a round tri p to a di stant star i n an arbi trary sm al l ti m e, l et us consi der the fol l ow i ng si tuati on: T wo stars A and B are separated by a di stance D i n atspaceti m e.

<p>star A after an arbi trari l y sm al lproper ti m e,both from the poi nt ofvi ew ofthe spaceshi p and from the poi nt ofvi ew ofthe star. T he spaceshi p w i l lthen be abl e to travelm uch faster than the speed ofl i ght. H owever,as we have seen,i t w i l lal ways rem ai n on a ti m el i ke trajectory, that i s, i nsi de i ts l ocall i ght-cone: l i ght i tsel f i s al so bei ng pushed by the di storti on of spaceti m e. A propul si on m echani sm based on such a l ocaldi storti on of spaceti m e just begs to be gi ven the fam i l i ar nam e ofthe \warp dri ve" ofsci ence cti on. T he m etri c I have just descri bed has one i m portant draw back,however: i t vi ol ates al l three energy condi ti ons (weak, dom i nant and strong [ 3] ). Both the weak and the dom i nant energy condi ti ons requi re the energy densi ty to be posi ti ve for all observers.If one cal cul ates the Ei nstei n tensor from the m etri c (8), and uses the fact that the four-vel oci ty ofthe Eul eri an observers i s gi ven by:</p>
<p>T
he factthatthi s expressi on i severyw here negati ve i m pl i es thatthe weak and dom i nant energy condi ti ons are vi ol ated. In a si m i l ar way one can show that the strong energy condi ti on i s al so vi ol ated. W e see then that, just as i t happens w i th worm hol es, one needs exoti c m atter to travelfaster than the speed ofl i ght. H owever,even i fone bel i eves that exoti c m atter i s forbi dden cl assi cal l y,i t i s wel lknow n that quantum el d theory perm i ts the exi stence of regi ons w i th negati ve energy densi ti es i n som e speci alci rcum stances (as,for exam pl e,i n the C asi m i r e ect [ 4] ). T he need ofexoti c m atter therefore doesn' t necessari l y el i m i nate the possi bi l i ty ofusi ng a spaceti m e di storti on l i ke the one descri bed above for hyper-fast i nterstel l ar travel . A s a nal com m ent, I w i l l just m enti on the fact that even though the spaceti m e descri bed by the m etri c (8) i s gl obal l y hyperbol i c,and hence contai ns no cl osed causal curves,i t i s probabl y not very di cul t to construct a spaceti m e that does contai n such curves usi ng a si m i l ar i dea to the one presented here.
