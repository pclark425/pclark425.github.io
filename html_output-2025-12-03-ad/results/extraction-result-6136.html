                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Detection of Alzheimer’s by Machine Learning-assisted Vibrational Spectroscopy in Human Cerebrospinal Fluid</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Nowadays, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is a complex process that involves several clinical tests. Cerebrospinal fluid contains common Alzheimer-related biomarkers that include amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and tau proteins. In this work, we propose vibrational spectroscopy techniques supported by machine learning for the detection of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid that are related with Alzheimer’s by prediction models. Vibrational spectroscopy provides the entire biochemical composition of the body fluid, and thus, small but typical physiological changes related with the pathology can be ascertained. Within a machine learning framework, Raman and FTIR spectra were analyzed, which were taken from samples of healthy volunteers in comparison with samples from patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. We find that a logistic regression model can discriminate between healthy control and Alzheimer’s patients with a precision of 98%, when the input for the model combines data from both vibrational spectroscopy methods. Our approach shows high discriminative capabilities and constitutes a proof of concept for an alternative and accurate tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Nowadays, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is a complex process that involves several clinical tests. Cerebrospinal fluid contains common Alzheimer-related biomarkers that include amyloid beta 1-42 (Aβ1-42) and tau proteins. In this work, we propose vibrational spectroscopy techniques supported by machine learning for the detection of biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid that are related with Alzheimer's by prediction models. Vibrational spectroscopy provides the entire biochemical composition of the body fluid, and thus, small but typical physiological changes related with the pathology can be ascertained. Within a machine learning framework, Raman and FTIR spectra were analyzed, which were taken from samples of healthy volunteers in comparison with samples from patients clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's. We find that a logistic regression model can discriminate between healthy control and Alzheimer's patients with a precision of 98%, when the input for the model combines data from both vibrational spectroscopy methods. Our approach shows high discriminative capabilities and constitutes a proof of concept for an alternative and accurate tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The continuing extension of life expectancy leads to an increase in the number of people suffering from different types of neurodegenerative diseases. According to the WHO (World Health Organization), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia in people over the age of 65 [1]. To date there is no known cure, and current AD diagnoses are based on clinical assessments and neuropsychological tests that are only efficient in the later stages of the disease [2]. Early and accurate diagnosis of AD will provide strong opportunities for preventive treatment that contribute to cognitive impairment, such as apathy, anxiety, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, and the development of disease-modifying drugs. Throughout the last few decades, many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of AD, and various biomarkers have been investigated by different methods [3][4][5][6].</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that in the earliest stages of the disease, amyloid-beta proteins (Aβ) become abnormal in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), even before it is detected by positron emission tomography (PET) and before neurodegeneration with symptoms occurs [7][8][9]. Further research shows that the distinguishing biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease are Aβ proteins and both total and the 2 phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (t-tau and p-tau, respectively). Changes in the levels of those markers reflect pathological changes in the biochemical composition and lead to neuronal death and eventually, obstruct normal cognitive functions [10][11][12][13]. Ongoing research shows that there are many other components of CSF that could affect AD development, as for example, phospholipids, fatty acids, or apolipoprotein [14][15][16]. Considering not only single well-known biomarkers, but the entire biochemical composition of body fluids could be highly beneficial and effective for the early detection of AD.</p>
<p>A simple, universal, and low-cost method, sensitive to changes in chemical and structural alterations at the molecular level, is vibrational spectroscopy, which can provide details of the chemical composition and molecular structure of analyzed samples. Raman and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies have been successfully explored in recent decades as non-destructive approaches that don't require any reagents, moreover, these two methods differ in the physical mechanism, providing specific advantages in biological applications [17]. Although many changes due to the disease are inconspicuous, studies show that combining vibrational spectroscopy with machine learning issues high discriminative power and yields successful results that allow for the differentiation between AD and healthy control [18][19][20]. The present study aims at investigating the potential of complementarily combining Raman and FTIR techniques with machine learning algorithms to differentiate CSF samples of healthy control from AD patients and allowing the development of a model that extracts characteristic spectral fingerprints of several AD biomarkers in a unified way. Applying the chemometric analysis to the whole spectrum, considers all changes in CSF, resulting in improved and accurate detection and high sensitivity. This study represents a proof-ofconcept of an efficient, precise, and rapid tool for the diagnosis of AD.</p>
<p>Methods and Materials</p>
<p>In this study, CSF samples from volunteers with an average age of approximately 60 years were used, of which some were clinically diagnosed as AD patients. CSF samples were collected by lumbar puncture for diagnostic purpose and stored in plastic tubes at -80ºC until usage. Before each experiment, the samples were thawed at room temperature for 10-15 min, then proteins in the CSF samples were concentrated using an Amicon® ultra-0.5 centrifugal filter device with a cut-off membrane of 3 kDa molecular weight [21].</p>
<p>Filters contain traces of glycerin that can interfere with the analysis, accordingly a rinsing and washing procedure was done following reference [22]. 0.5 mL of NaOH (0.1 M) is added to the filters and the centrifugation is applied for 30 min at 14000 g followed by spinning with the filter upside down at 1000 g for 2 min to remove any residual solution contained in the filter. This step is repeated three times. After the filter is cleaned, the protein enrichment within the sample is realized by spinning at 14000 g for 30 min. The filtered liquid is disposable, the filter is inverted, and the centrifugation is spun at 1000 g for 2 min. The initial volume of CSF is around 500 μl, and the final volume around 15 -20 μl. The original protein concentration in CSF is around 0.2 mg/ml, so at the end the final protein concentration is around 5 mg/ml.</p>
<p>The total sample was divided in two aliquots, for Raman and FTIR measurements, respectively. For the Raman measurements, 1 μL of each concentrated CSF sample was transferred by careful pipetting to a standard quartz substrate and dried completely under vacuum for 5 min. Dried samples were then removed from the vacuum and another 1 µL drop of CSF was deposited on top of the previously dried drop. This process was repeated until 5 µL of CSF had been used up. The measurements were done with the Alpha 300R Witec Confocal Raman spectrometer using 532 nm laser excitation wavelength at 10 mW power, 50x microscope objective, a grating with 600 lines/mm, acquisition time of 1 s and 100 accumulations each. Due to the inhomogeneity of the dried sample, the drop was scanned at several spatial regions to capture the complete variability of each patient's sample. A photobleaching process is done for 10 min to reduce photoluminescence.</p>
<p>For the FTIR measurements, 2 µL of the sample were put onto an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) crystal and dried in air for 20 min. The FTIR measurements were performed with a Bruker BioCell II ATR chamber installed in a Bruker Vertex 70 FT-IR spectrometer, with a resolution of 4 cm -1 , performing 100 scans, and four measurements were repeated for each sample. This step was repeated for at least 3 subsamples per subject, yielding a minimum of 12 spectra per patient.</p>
<p>The step of splitting the sample in two aliquots for the two separate measurement types, Raman and FTIR, can be avoided by using an instrument that combines both methods, measuring FTIR and Raman spectra simultaneously, as proposed in [23].</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>A total of 22 samples from volunteers were studied, of which five were clinically diagnosed with AD. A dataset with 610 spectra, including Raman and FTIR, were analyzed within a machine learning framework. Figure 1 shows the spectral differences between control (N for normal) and AD patients (A) for both Raman and FTIR spectra. In the figure, the first derivative is presented to more clearly highlight the observed differences. The average spectrum of each class, N and A, is shown as well as its standard deviation represented by a lighter shadow.</p>
<p>Before machine learning, the dataset is preprocessed by various steps: smoothing with a Savitzky-Golay filter of 7-point window and 3rd degree polynomial sampling at 3.67 cm -1 , for reduction of noise; a baseline correction by means of the asymmetric least squares (ALS) method; and a normalization that consists of subtracting the mean of the spectrum and dividing by its standard deviation. In Figure 1 subtle spectral differences between the two classes (A and N) can be observed for both spectroscopy techniques. Moreover, the differences are observed throughout the entire spectral range, meaning that the whole biochemical composition of the sample contributes to the differentiation of the two classes, as other researchers have reported [24]. In the measured spectra, some important bands corresponding to protein vibration, mostly amides, can be seen. Table 1 shows the assignation of some bands to the particular amide vibration presented  [24][25][26][27].</p>
<p>Another way to visualize the data is through a PCA (principal component analysis) representation [28]. This algorithm reduces the dimension of the problem by representing the data in terms of new uncorrelated variables. The original data has 1600 points in each spectrum for the Raman data and 1800 for the FTIR data. When a PCA algorithm is applied, this number of variables can be reduced to a much lower optimal number. Figure 2 shows the projected data in some of the main components for the FTIR dataset (Figure 2a), Raman dataset (Figure 2b), and the combination of Raman and FTIR (Figure 2c). The percentage of variance explained for each principal component is described in the figure. A clear trend for separating the classes in those components can be observed. In particular, when FTIR and Raman data are combined, the separation of the classes becomes visually clearer and will allow for successful definition of prediction models. To create a prediction model, a machine learning framework is used, which consists of two stages. In the first step, the prediction model is built and calibrated with a training dataset, and in the second step, the model is validated with a test dataset. In supervised machine learning, it is required that the classes or labels of all data are known. In our case, the labels were assigned by medical doctors. The entire database is randomly divided into two sets as follows, 80% for training data and 20% for test data. That way, we split the dataset by patients, that means that all spectra from one patient belong to only one group, training or test set, thereby avoiding bias in datasets and possible overfitting.</p>
<p>For the calibration of the model with the training data, the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation method was used, consisting of several cycles in which the dataset of one subject is left out for testing, and all other data build the training set. In each cycle, the test subject is exchanged, hence, a statistical analysis is performed that determines the optimal settings of the model. With the optimal parameters of the model, the prediction error for each well-known test set can be calculated. Since in our case the classes are unbalanced, the confusion matrix is used to determine the prediction error, where precision and sensitivity are calculated.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the method described, different classifiers were tested. Each classifier has different regularization parameters that can be adjusted for finding optimum parameters for best classification. The result of this process is shown in Figure 3 for the Raman and the FTIR dataset, where the recall (sensitivity) of different models is reported together with its standard deviation. The recall, which is defined as the relative number of items correctly identified as true positives, tells the performance of the classifier with respect to false negatives. For minimizing false negatives, the recall should be as high as possible. For that reason, we chose the classifiers with maximum recall. A high classification accuracy is obtained with some of the classifiers tested, like logistic regression, support vector machine or linear discriminant. For instance, logistic regression produces very high precision and recall of 95% and 96%, respectively, for the FTIR data. For the Raman data, a precision of 96% and a recall of 98% results by using a support vector machine. ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves and corresponding AUC (area under the curve) for some classifiers confirm the high classification performance of the model, as Figure 3c demonstrates for FTIR data and Figure 3d for Raman data. Moreover, by combining Raman and infrared spectral data, the discrimination precision increases to 98% and the recall to 99%. These results demonstrate the great potential of combining data from both vibrational spectroscopy techniques, Raman and FTIR, for the detection of AD through machine learning classification algorithms.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We developed a high discriminative method for detecting biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in cerebrospinal fluid with a precision of 96% (Raman) and 95% (FTIR). Moreover, the combination of Raman and FTIR techniques increases the precision up to 98%. The opportunity for the future is that we can easily increase the size of the data set to establish even more reliable and stable classification models. Further, the method can be tested with other types of biofluids to provide a less invasive or non-invasive method, using for example serum or tears.</p>
