                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Large language and reasoning models have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation of scientifically informed hypotheses. However, current foundation models often struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible. One reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task. In this paper, we introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is the resulting counterproposal. HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to Flip. We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses. Our evaluation employs automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment. We show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty, feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses. The HypoGen dataset is publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.</p>

Generating novel and creative scientific hypotheses is a cornerstone in achieving Artificial General Intelligence.Large language and reasoning models have the potential to aid in the systematic creation, selection, and validation of scientifically informed hypotheses.However, current foundation models often struggle to produce scientific ideas that are both novel and feasible.One reason is the lack of a dedicated dataset that frames Scientific Hypothesis Generation (SHG) as a Natural Language Generation (NLG) task.In this paper, we introduce HypoGen, the first dataset of approximately 5500 structured problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences structured with a Bit-Flip-Spark schema, where the Bit is the conventional assumption, the Spark is the key insight or conceptual leap, and the Flip is the resulting counterproposal.HypoGen uniquely integrates an explicit Chain-of-Reasoning component that reflects the intellectual process from Bit to Flip.We demonstrate that framing hypothesis generation as conditional language modelling, with the model fine-tuned on Bit-Flip-Spark and the Chain-of-Reasoning (and where, at inference, we only provide the Bit), leads to improvements in the overall quality of the hypotheses.Our evaluation employs automated metrics and LLM judge rankings for overall quality assessment.We show that by fine-tuning on our HypoGen dataset we improve the novelty, feasibility, and overall quality of the generated hypotheses.The HypoGen dataset is publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/UniverseTBD/hypogen-dr1.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Hypothesis generation is the first step of the scientific process and its de facto foundation.Creative and innovative ideas have long enabled scientists to model and predict the behaviour of complex systems, from neuroscience to astrophysics.Recently, the impressive capabilities of large language models have prompted researchers to explore their potential to advance the generation of scientific ideas (Ziems et al., 2023;Birhane et al., 2023;Xie et al., 2023;Noever &amp; McKee, 2023;Si et al., 2024;Kumar et al., 2024;Xiong et al., 2024b;Zhou et al., 2024b;Cohrs et al., 2025).Not only do these models excel in understanding and generating human language (e.g., Devlin et al., 2018;Brown et al., 2020;Team et al., 2023;Grattafiori et al., 2024), but they also demonstrate a remarkable ability to make nuanced deductions and establish relationships across varied contexts (Elkins &amp; Chun, 2020), rendering them an ideal basis for the generation of semantic hypotheses.Recent work has evaluated LLMs on the entire scientific discovery process, from hypothesis generation to running experiments, analyzing the results, and even writing a paper (Lu et al., 2024a;Chan et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024;Gottweis et al., 2025;Nathani et al., 2025;Schmidgall et al., 2025;Schmidgall &amp; Moor, 2025).However, most works highlight limitations of current models when applied to open research problems, particularly with respect to generating novel, creative, diverse, feasible, actionable, interesting, and useful ideas or hypotheses (Nathani et al., 2025).</p>
<p>LLMs face significant challenges when applied to scientific ideation.These models are prone to hallucinations, often producing non-factual content due to their token likelihood maximization objective (Manakul et al., 2023;McKenna et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023;Zhang, 2023;Tonmoy et al., 2024;Lu et al., 2024a).Recent benchmarks highlight that such inaccuracies can be difficult to detect, as LLMs often present them with high confidence (Qi et al., 2023;Zhou et al., 2024a).Additionally, probability-maximizing decoding strategies (e.g., greedy or high-beam search) can lead to text that lacks lexical diversity, a problem that persists even in models with hundreds of billions of parameters (Holtzman et al., 2019;Li et al., 2022;Meister et al., 2022;Su et al., 2022;Zhou et al., 2024a).</p>
<p>The design of a validation scheme to rigorously test these machine-generated hypotheses poses additional challenges (Alaa et al., 2021;Si et al., 2024;Luo et al., 2025).To be effective, scientific hypotheses not only require creative insight drawn from a broad understanding of the domain at hand, but also must be rooted in the existing literature to ensure their novelty and relevance (Simonton, 2004;Runco &amp; Jaeger, 2012;Doboli et al., 2014;Strøm, 2018;Wang et al., 2023).In addition, it is difficult to determine in an automated fashion to what extent a certain idea already exists in the literature, which is particularly problematic due to the tendency of LLMs to copy subsets of their training data in generation (McCoy et al., 2021;Liu &amp; Hulden, 2021).Given that validation is integral to the scientific method, the closed-box nature of LLMs requires a careful and nuanced approach to ensure that the results are replicable and robust.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we introduce HypoGen, a dataset comprising approximately 5500 structured problem-hypothesis pairs extracted from top-tier computer science conferences.This dataset represents a significant step forward in framing scientific hypothesis generation as a conditional language modeling problem.By conditioning hypotheses on a clear formulation of the problem (the Bit), our approach provides a robust foundation for developing and evaluating LLMs in the context of scientific discovery.Importantly, HypoGen incorporates a detailed Chain-of-Reasoning narrative that mirrors the iterative and reflective process used by human scientists to transition from conventional wisdom to innovative counterproposals, thus improving both the quality and the trustworthiness of the generated hypotheses.</p>
<p>Our key contributions include the development of the HypoGen dataset and the novel framing of scientific hypothesis generation as a conditional language modeling problem enriched with an explicit reasoning chain.We present baseline performance measures of an LLaMA-based model on a hypothesis generation task after being fine-tuned on the HypoGen dataset.We employ a straightforward evaluation framework that assesses hypotheses along the dimensions of novelty and feasibility, incorporating automated metrics and LLM judgements.By capturing the full chain of reasoning, our approach provides valuable insights into the thought processes underlying scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Several approaches factor the decision process into sub-stages.In the proposal stage, reasoning and sometimes retrieval are used to generate candidate actions or hypotheses (Chen et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2022).The evaluation stage then scores these candidates (for example, perplexity (Ahn et al., 2022) or learned reward functions (Yao et al., 2020)), identifying which candidates are the most promising.Techniques such as ToT (Yao et al., 2023) and RAP (Hao et al., 2023) use tree search paradigms to propose and evaluate multiple solution paths in a structured manner.Reflexive approaches such as Shinn et al. (2023) and Lindes &amp; Peter (2023) explicitly incorporate iterative self-correction of hypothesized actions.The work of Zhou et al. (2024a) with HypoGeniC expands this process with iterative reinforcement learning with human feedback.These advances stress the need for benchmarks that realistically reflect the capacity of LLMs to generate, validate, and refine scientific hypotheses (e.g., Kumar et al., 2024;Majumder et al., 2024;Luo et al., 2025).For example, the "Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas" or KG-CoI system (Xiong et al., 2024a) removes specific links from a biomedical knowledge graph and asks LLMs to propose plausible missing relations.Because these links are derived from previously held information, LLM-generated hypotheses can be validated against known ground truths.Such tasks resemble real-world discovery scenarios, where a laboratory of AI agents can interact with human experts, document interactions, and call tools to achieve a particular task, for example, to design a novel protein binder (e.g., Swanson et al., 2024).Other innovative evaluation environments, such as Discovery World (Jansen et al., 2024) or AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024b), provide virtual environments where an AI agent can propose hypotheses and conduct simulated experiments, opening the possibility of end-to-end science.</p>
<p>However, there remains a lack of standardized "frontier" benchmarks designed to evaluate hypothesis generation capabilities, especially in the context of agentic AI systems, which rely on highly interconnected modules that require complex reasoning (Shao et al., 2024).To this end, we introduce HypoGen, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to address current deficits in the evaluation of the generation of scientific hypotheses.In contrast to existing benchmarks, HypoGen explicitly emphasizes Chain-of-Reasoning: each hypothesis includes a transparent abductive logic trail that mirrors the thought process of a human expert.Our method uses a structured Bit-Flip-Spark + Chain-of-Reasoning format to capture the conceptual progression from an initial problem statement (Bit), to a key insight (Spark), and finally to a refined idea (Flip).By incorporating a detailed reasoning chain, HypoGen helps mitigate the risk of hallucination (Tonmoy et al., 2024), while simultaneously providing researchers with a reproducible step-by-step notebook of how a new idea was generated.</p>
<p>Methodology and the Bit-Flip-Spark+Chain-of-Reasoning Format</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the overall pipeline of HypoGen1 , which is designed to extract structured information from scientific papers using the Bit-Flip-Spark+Chain-of-Reasoning format.The Stanford Bit-Flip schema2 serves as a concise and structured hypothesis formulation technique designed to encapsulate the core intellectual contribution of a research paper.The Bit identifies the prevailing belief or assumption in the research domain that the paper aims to challenge.The Flip articulates the novel approach or counterargument that the paper introduces to advance the field.In addition, we introduce a novel concept, Spark, which contains the "essence of an idea", formalized as a conceptual leap.We provide an example extracted from Bahdanau et al. (2015) and the full prompt to obtain this representation in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Example HypoGen Hypothesis</p>
<p>Bit: Conventional neural machine translation encodes the entire source sentence into a single fixed-length vector.This approach imposes a bottleneck, because crucial contextual information can be lost in the compression process.Spark: Soft alignment for flexible translation.Flip: An idea was introduced that enables the model to automatically search for relevant parts of the source sentence at each decoding step.This removes the need for a single fixed-length representation by allowing a soft-alignment mechanism that dynamically focuses on important source information.Chain-of-Reasoning: I started by considering that traditionally neural machine translation relies on a single fixed-length vector to encode an entire source sentence before generating the target sequence, and that this rigid bottleneck can lose important contextual information, limiting translation quality and flexibility.I questioned whether a more dynamic way to capture contextual cues was needed, especially for longer sequences.Instead, I introduced a learnable (soft) search mechanism that dynamically aligns each target word with the most relevant parts of the source sentence, shifting away from a fixed-length encoding to attend to context more flexibly and generate higher-quality translations.I trained a bidirectional encoderdecoder on a large bilingual corpus, used a thirty-thousand-word vocabulary, and optimized it via minibatch gradient methods while testing different hidden-layer sizes.How did we confirm that the new approach was identifying correct alignments?I visualized alignment weights and observed that the decoder selectively focused on relevant source words, substantially improving clarity and accuracy.A follow-up question examined how to handle unknown or rare terms, prompting an exploration of further lexical coverage strategies.I recognized a turning point when it became evident that soft attention preserved essential details for both short and long inputs.I validated performance on held-out test sets, noting that the model equaled or surpassed phrase-based benchmarks and maintained robustness on lengthy sentences.This integrated reasoning closed the gap between the original limitation and the dynamic alignment concept, paving the way for more context-aware neural translation.</p>
<p>The objective is to distill the complex ideas within a paper into a simplified yet rigorous representation, allowing for clear communication of both the problem being tackled (Flip) and the proposed solution (Bit).This approach is grounded in the understanding that a wellarticulated hypothesis is the cornerstone of impactful research.Although this structured representation of hypotheses is subjective and is merely one of many options, we found that it worked well for the generation of a solution (i.e.Flip) conditioned on a problem (i.e., the Bit).Finally, the Chain-of-Reasoning presents a detailed narrative that captures the scientist's ideation process that connects the Bit to the Flip.</p>
<p>Preprocessing and Dataset Construction</p>
<p>We compile our dataset from papers accepted at the two top-tier computer science conferences, NeurIPS 2023 (3218 papers) and ICLR 2024 (2260 papers), resulting in 5478 distinct samples.We then used OpenAI's o1 model for the structured extraction step.For each paper, we first extract the Bit, Flip, and Spark components from the abstract.We prompted o1 to identify the conventional assumption, the innovative approach, and a concise 4-6-word summary of the core insight.We then used a robust parallel processing approach with a retry mechanism with up to three attempts per extraction to ensure high-quality output.</p>
<p>For papers with available full text, we extract the Chain-of-Reasoning component using a separate prompt that guides the model to recreate the intellectual progression from Bit to Flip.This step removes the abstract section from the full text to prevent redundancy.It then processes the paper to generate a first-person narrative detailing the scientist's ideation process.We store the output in JSON format and include metadata such as the paper ID, title, authors, venue, year, and citation information.We construct an independent test set of 50 hypotheses from the authors' recent submissions and relevant work between 2024 and 2025.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning and Inference Pipeline</p>
<p>Our baseline models include Meta LLaMA 3.1 8B and R1-distilled LLaMA 3.1 8B.These models are trained on extensive corpora with a context window of 128,000 tokens and employ byte-pair encoding for tokenization (Sennrich et al., 2015;Kudo &amp; Richardson, 2018), incorporating a vocabulary of 128,000 tokens.The R1-distilled LLaMA 3.1 8B is a specialized model with knowledge transferred from the larger DeepSeek-R1 model with 671B parameters.This substantial pre-training provides robust language understanding capabilities essential for scientific hypothesis generation.</p>
<p>We leverage our curated dataset of structured problem-hypothesis pairs for fine-tuning, employing the causal language modeling objective.The process utilizes four NVIDIA H100 GPUs, each with 80GB of VRAM.We implement 4-bit quantization and deploy LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) with hyperparameters: α = 16 and a dropout rate of 0.1.The models are loaded with 4-bit precision base loading, using appropriate compute precision (bf16 where supported otherwise fp16).We use the AdamW 8-bit optimizer (Loshchilov &amp; Hutter, 2017) with a weight decay of 0.01, a batch size of 32, and a learning rate of 2 × 10 −4 .The training follows a linear scheduler with 5 warmup steps and proceeds for approximately 60 total steps, with logging at each step.During inference, only the Bit is provided to the model.The model then generates the corresponding Spark along with a detailed Chain-of-Reasoning.We use the ollama LLM framework for the LLaMA one-shot inference.</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
<p>The task of evaluating generative models tailored for the generation of scientific hypotheses is challenging, given the inherently subjective nature of scientific research.In this paper, we focus on a dual evaluation framework that primarily incorporates traditional automated metrics and LLM-based judges.</p>
<p>Our evaluation strategy relies on a test set of 50 hypotheses extracted from the recent literature from primarily 2024 and 2025.It combines automated metrics with an LLM Judge module that assesses novelty, feasibility, and overall quality from pairwise comparisons.We further test the robustness of our approach with a second LLM judge.For a subset of our evaluation set, we also use human evaluation to assess whether fine-tuning LLaMA-base models on our HypoGen dataset improves the quality of the hypotheses.</p>
<p>Automated Evaluation Metrics</p>
<p>Perplexity is used as a preliminary metric to assess the fluency and coherence of the hypotheses generated (Chen et al., 1998).It is defined as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood of a given token sequence X = (x 0 , x 1 , . . .x t ).</p>
<p>Mathematically, this is expressed as:
PPL(X) = exp − 1 t t ∑ i log p θ (x i | x &lt;i ) (1)
Here, log p θ (x i |x &lt;i ) denotes the log-likelihood of the i-th token conditioned on its preceding tokens according to the model.The metric serves as an indicator of the predictive performance of the model, with lower values suggesting better generalization.</p>
<p>IAScore quantifies alignment between LLM-generated hypotheses and expert-proposed research ideas.For each paper j, the IAScore computes the average alignment between author-proposed future research ideas (AP-FRI j ) and each generated idea I ij using an IdeaMatcher (IM) model (Kumar et al., 2024):
AvgScore j = 1 N j N j ∑ i=1 IM(AP-FRI j , I ij )(2)
The domain-wide IAScore for model M is then calculated by averaging across all P papers:
IAScore domain,M = 1 P P ∑ j=1
AvgScore j</p>
<p>(3) Kumar et al. (2024) employed GPT as the IdeaMatcher due to its superior performance (91.8% accuracy) compared to Natural Language Inference using RoBERTa MNLI and BERTScore in determining if a generated idea is contained within the author's proposals.Higher IAScore values indicate greater alignment between LLM-generated ideas and author perspectives across the domain.</p>
<p>Idea Distinctiveness Index evaluates the semantic diversity between the hypotheses generated using embedding-based similarity rather than textual differences at the surface level.For a set of ideas I, each idea id i is embedded into vector v i using a pre-trained BERT model (Kumar et al., 2024).The distinctness between ideas id i and id j is defined as
D ij = 1 − sim(v i , v j )
, where sim is cosine similarity.The overall distinctiveness for a set of n ideas is:
D I = 1 n(n − 1) n ∑ i=1 n ∑ j=1 j̸ =i D ij (4)
To assess the performance of a model within a domain, we can calculate the Idea Distinctness Index D I p M for all ideas generated by model M for each paper p, then average across all m papers:
D domain,M = 1 m m ∑ p=1 D I p M(5)
Higher D domain,M values signify greater idea diversity, indicating the model's ability to generate semantically varied hypotheses within the domain.</p>
<p>LLM Evaluation</p>
<p>To evaluate the quality of the hypotheses in our evaluation set, we employed Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet-Thinking model as the automated evaluator.We perform a pairwise evaluation on each dataset consisting of 50 problems and proposals of paired solutions generated by two LLMs for each evaluation experiment.We have nine experiments corresponding to LLaMA 3.1-8B-FT (LLaMA-8B-FT for brevity) vs Human, LlaMA 3.1-8B-FT (LLaMA-8B-FT) vs an o1 model with one example (1shot), followed by an R1-distilled-LlaMA-3.1-8B-FT (R1-distilled-LlaMA-FT) vs Human and o1-1shot, LLaMA-8b-FT vs R1-distilled-LLaMA-8b-FT, Human vs o1-1shot, R1-distilled-LlaMA-8b-1shot vs R1-distilled-LLaMA-8b-FT, LLaMA-8B-1shot vs LLaMA-8B-FT and LLaMA-8B-1shot vs R1-distilled-LLaMA-8B-1shot (R1-distilled-LlaMA-1shot).We provide our results in Fig. 2. The Human hypotheses are the o1 structured hypotheses generated from the evaluation set.</p>
<p>For each Bit, the LLM evaluator was asked to evaluate which proposal (Spark + Chain-of-Reasoning) provided the overall better proposal, taking into account novelty and feasibility.We randomize the presentation order of the solutions to mitigate order effects.After each evaluation experiment, we obtain whether proposal A wins in novelty, feasibility, and overall, with an option for a tie.The model's "thinking" is further enabled with an 8,000 token budget to encourage thorough deliberation.</p>
<p>The LLM-based evaluation provides consistency and scalability; however, it comes at the cost of robustness and verifiability.To account for some of these challenges, we rerun our experimental analysis with the OpenAI o3-mini model as a judge to see the degree of agreement.In addition, we conducted a blind human evaluation with 20 hypothesis pairs evaluated by one of the authors.We provide our complete prompts in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Results from Automated Metrics Table 1 shows that human-generated hypotheses have much higher perplexity values than their LLM counterparts.In particular, LLaMA base models exhibit values between 16.70 and 34.98 compared to human ones (89.31).This could point to the semantic creativity present in human-generated ideas.Although perplexity remains lower overall, fine-tuning increases the perplexity score of the LLaMA models, indicating increased "unpredictability" as it stands to ideation.</p>
<p>Secondly, fine-tuning improves idea alignment with the target domain, as shown by the significant improvement in IAScore for the standard LLaMA model (0.2781 → 0.6746).This result could mean that the structured Bit-Flip-Spark+Chain-of-Reasoning training enables models to generate hypotheses that better align with expert-level scientific thinking.The fact that we do not see this effect to the same extent in the distilled LLaMA model may hint at the effectiveness of knowledge transfer.</p>
<p>The inverse relationship between IAScore improvements and Idea Distinctness Index reductions, which are particularly notable in the R1 Distilled LLaMA with a reduction from 0.7146 → 0.6288, indicates a possible trade-off in hypothesis generation: as models better align with expert scientific thinking patterns, they may produce less semantically diverse outputs.</p>
<p>Pairwise Comparison using LLM Judges</p>
<p>As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2, finetuning consistently improves overall hypothesis quality relative to one-shot variants of the same architecture (86-92% preference for fine-tuned versions), despite the reduction in novelty scores.This indicates that fine-tuning on HypoGen steers models toward generating more practical hypotheses.</p>
<p>The LLM evaluation results in 2 reveal a consistent trade-off between novelty and feasibility in the different experiments.Models that excel in creativity metrics seem to underperform in feasibility and vice versa.Human-generated hypotheses win overall in quality assessments compared to LLM-generated alternatives, with human ideas preferred in 80-90% of the comparisons.However, fine-tuned models demonstrate comparable feasibility scores relative to the human set (A=62-64% vs. B=36-38%).Rerunning our analysis with o3-mini as the LLM judge shows consistent behaviour across most experiment: agreement on the key novelty-feasibility trade-off in fine-tuned versus one-shot models and confirming the win of human hypotheses for overall quality.We show our results in Fig. 3 in Appendix B.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Results</p>
<p>The results of the small-scale human evaluation trace the observed patterns with the Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking model.For the R1-distilled LLaMA comparison, the human evaluator preferred fine-tuned model outputs for novelty (95% vs. 5%) and feasibility (70% vs. 30%), with an overall preference for fine-tuned outputs (70% preference, 25% tie, 5% base model).The standard LLaMA-8B comparison revealed more competitive performance, with the fine-tuned model maintaining modest advantages in novelty (47.6% vs 42.9%, 9. 5% tie) and feasibility (52.4% vs 42.9%, 4. 8% tie), resulting in a narrower overall preference (42.9% fine-tuned, 33.3% one shot, 23.8% tie).The human evaluation provides further evidence that fine-tuning on structured Bit-Flip-Spark+Chainof-Reasoning data improves hypothesis quality, with particularly dramatic improvements observed in the R1-distilled architecture.However, further human evaluation is needed.</p>
<p>Discussion and Future Work</p>
<p>We introduced the HypoGen dataset for the generation of scientific hypothesis that extends the conventional Bit-Flip-Spark format by incorporating a detailed Chain-of-Reasoning component.We showed that fine-tuning on HypoGen enables the LLaMA 3.1-8B and R1-distilled-LLaMA 3.1-8B models to improve their hypotheses.This demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning in the intermediate steps of an idea, which provides more transparency and interpretability.We release HypoGen under an MIT license to encourage the development of AI agents capable of supporting human experts in the ideation process.</p>
<p>The primary limitation of HypoGen is that it uses LLMs to evaluate the hypotheses generated.</p>
<p>Although LLM-as-a-judge modules can perform robustly under certain conditions (Lu et al., 2024a), they may be biased by their training regime in highly non-trivial ways.To mitigate these unexpected effects, we plan to perform an extensive human evaluation to determine the degree to which human and LLM align on a particular judgement.These findings will guide the construction of more robust reward models that align closely with human expertise, further strengthening HypoGens applicability in real-world scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, we want to examine how our approach with HypoGen generalizes to other scientific domains.Our evaluation focused on computer science, and it remains an open question how well the fine-tuning on one domain generalizes to another.We also plan to expand our dataset to fields such as astrophysics, biology, and materials science, where hypothesis generation could accelerate scientific discoveries in fundamentally different fields.This work aims to enable interdisciplinary AI teammates that collaborate with human experts on challenging scientific tasks (Swanson et al., 2024), with the overarching goal of democratising science.</p>

<p>Conventional information retrieval methods rely on large labeled datasets for finetuning, which can be expensive or impractical to obtain.Moreover, even when such datasets are available, their effectiveness rapidly decreases in new domains due to distributional shifts.</p>
<p>A.5.1 LLaMA-8B-1shot</p>
<p>I started by considering the limitations of conventional information retrieval methods.They heavily rely on large labeled datasets, which can be expensive or impractical to obtain in some cases.Moreover, even when such datasets are available, their effectiveness rapidly decreases in new domains due to distributional shifts.This led me to wonder: how might I address these challenges without breaking the bank or requiring extensive data annotation?I explored whether utilizing self-supervised learning techniques could help bridge this gap.By generating pseudo-labels from unlabeled data and using them for fine-tuning, I asked: could we leverage weakly supervised or even unsupervised methods to adapt conventional retrieval models more efficiently?Another question that arose was: might we tap into the strengths of pre-trained language models by leveraging their rich contextual representations?This led me to ponder whether augmenting these representations with domain-specific knowledge graphs could enhance the model's robustness and generalizability across diverse domains.As I delved deeper, I began to consider the potential benefits of meta-learning.By training a model on multiple tasks or datasets simultaneously, it might learn more transferable and flexible representations that can adapt quickly to novel environments.This sparked another question: how would we evaluate the performance of such models in real-world settings?Upon further reflection, I realized that addressing these challenges may involve a multidisciplinary approach.By integrating insights from natural language processing (NLP), graph neural networks (GNNs), and meta-learning, we could potentially develop more adaptive and domainagnostic retrieval methods.</p>
<p>A.5.2 LLaMA-8B-FT</p>
<p>I began by asking whether large labeled datasets were necessary to fine-tune a retrieval model, and I found that in many cases, they are not.I tested a method that learns to rank from unlabeled data and confirmed that it outperformed standard fine-tuning approaches on several benchmarks.I then questioned how to ensure that the model generalizes well in new domains, and I introduced a domain-specific pretraining stage to adapt the model to different distributions.I asked how to measure the impact of this pre-training, so I performed extensive experiments that showed consistent improvements across diverse domains.I also examined how to validate that the model's rankings were robust, and I measured the correlation between the predicted rankings and true relevance scores.I found that the pre-training stage effectively bridged the gap between different distributions, and I wondered if further hyperparameter tuning would yield even better performance.I tested different data augmentation strategies and found that they further enhanced the model's adaptability.I reflected on whether this approach could scale to larger datasets, and I confirmed that it maintained its effectiveness even with millions of unlabeled examples.Finally, I concluded that domain-specific pre-training on unlabeled data can greatly reduce reliance on labeled data and enable more efficient retrieval in new domains.</p>
