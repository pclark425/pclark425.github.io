                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common cause of dementia in older adults and an important public health problem. The purpose of this review article is to provide a brief introduction to A D and the related concept of mild cognitive impairment (M C I) and may throw light on the prevalence, causes, treatment, diagnosis and prevention. Vast knowledge regarding disease and disorders will help people take precautions for not getting effected by it. This will help reduce the number of Alzheimer’s disease. Since the exact curative treatment has not been established for AD. AD is a complex disorder with environmental and genetic components. There are two major types of Alzheimer’s disease, early on set and the more common late onset. The genetics of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease are largely understood with variants in three different genes leading to AD disease. In contrast, with several common alleles associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, including APOE, have been identified using association studies, the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease are not fully understood. Continuing efforts are still required. This includes development of medicines that would slow progression, halt, or prevent AD and other dementias from occurring.  Studies are currently underway to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and new therapeutical agents to prevent or slow down disease progression. 
Keywords: Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, neuro-degeneration, mild cognitive impairment.</p>

<meta name="DC.Description" xml:lang="en" content="Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common cause of dementia in older adults and an important public health problem. The purpose of this review article is to provide a brief introduction to A D and the related concept of mild cognitive impairment (M C I) and may throw light on the prevalence, causes, treatment, diagnosis and prevention. Vast knowledge regarding disease and disorders will help people take precautions for not getting effected by it. This will help reduce the number of Alzheimer’s disease. Since the exact curative treatment has not been established for AD. AD is a complex disorder with environmental and genetic components. There are two major types of Alzheimer’s disease, early on set and the more common late onset. The genetics of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease are largely understood with variants in three different genes leading to AD disease. In contrast, with several common alleles associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, including APOE, have been identified using association studies, the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease are not fully understood. Continuing efforts are still required. This includes development of medicines that would slow progression, halt, or prevent AD and other dementias from occurring.&amp;nbsp; Studies are currently underway to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and new therapeutical agents to prevent or slow down disease progression.

                    <p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common cause of dementia in older adults and an important public health problem. The purpose of this review article is to provide a brief introduction to A D and the related concept of mild cognitive impairment (M C I) and may throw light on the prevalence, causes, treatment, diagnosis and prevention. Vast knowledge regarding disease and disorders will help people take precautions for not getting effected by it. This will help reduce the number of Alzheimer’s disease. Since the exact curative treatment has not been established for AD. AD is a complex disorder with environmental and genetic components. There are two major types of Alzheimer’s disease, early on set and the more common late onset. The genetics of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease are largely understood with variants in three different genes leading to AD disease. In contrast, with several common alleles associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, including APOE, have been identified using association studies, the genetics of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease are not fully understood. Continuing efforts are still required. This includes development of medicines that would slow progression, halt, or prevent AD and other dementias from occurring.  Studies are currently underway to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and new therapeutical agents to prevent or slow down disease progression.</p>
