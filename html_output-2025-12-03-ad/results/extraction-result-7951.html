<h1>2 SUMMARY</h1>
<h2>3 Background</h2>
<p>4 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers of amyloid- $\beta$ $(A \beta)$ and tau are accurate for detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology but invasiveness, high-
6 cost, and limited availability hamper widespread clinical diagnostic use. CSF phosphorylatedtau181 (p-tau181) is highly specific for Alzheimer's disease pathology. We aimed to assess
8 whether blood p-tau181 can differentiate Alzheimer's disease dementia from unimpaired
9 cognitive function, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease, and other
10 neurodegenerative diseases; detect whether a tau or amyloid PET scan is abnormal; and predict
11 future cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy.</p>
<h2>12 Methods</h2>
<p>13 We developed and validated an ultrasensitive blood immunoassay for p-tau181. Assay performance was evaluated in four clinic-based prospective cohorts. The discovery cohort comprised 19 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 18 age-matched controls. Two validation cohorts (TRIAD, $n=226$ and BioFINDER-2, $n=763$ ) included cognitively unimpaired elderly people aged 63-69 years, patients with MCI, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia, as well as healthy young adults (mean age 23 years) in TRIAD and patients with other neurodegenerative disorders in BiOFINDER-2. The final primary-care cohort comprised 105 controls from the community without a diagnosis of a neurological condition and patients referred from primary care physicians for specialist care. Concentrations of plasma p-tau181 were compared with established CSF and PET biomarkers and longitudinal measurements, using Spearman correlation, area under the curve (AUC), and linear regression analyses.</p>
<h1>Findings</h1>
<p>Plasma p-tau181 showed gradual increases along the Alzheimer's disease continuum, from A $\beta$ negative young adults and cognitively unimpaired (CU)-elderly over A $\beta$-positive CU-elderly and mild-cognitive impaired (MCI) cases to A $\beta$-positive MCI and Alzheimer's disease dementia ( $P&lt;0.0001$, Alzheimer's disease versus all others). Plasma p-tau181 distinguished Alzheimer's disease dementia from A $\beta$-negative young adults ( $\mathrm{AUC}=99.40 \%$ ) and CU-elderly (AUC=90$\cdot$21\%-98.24\%), as well as other neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia (AUC=82$\cdot$76-100\%), vascular dementia (AUC=92$\cdot$13\%), progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal syndrome (AUC=88.47\%), and Parkinson's disease/multiple systems atrophy (AUC=84$\cdot$81\%). Plasma p-tau181 was associated with PET-measured cerebral tau (AUC=82.37-93.11\%) and A $\beta$ (AUC=76.14-88.09\%) pathologies, and one-year cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy ( $P&lt;0.05$ ). In primary-care, plasma p-tau181 discriminated Alzheimer's disease from young adults ( $\mathrm{AUC}=100 \%$ ) and CU-elderly ( $\mathrm{AUC}=84 \cdot 44 \%$ ). Plasma p-tau181 outperformed each of age, $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ genotype carriage, age and $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ combined, and other plasma biomarkers (total-tau, $\mathrm{A} \beta_{1-42}, \mathrm{~A} \beta_{1-42} / \mathrm{A} \beta_{1-40}$ and total-tau/ $\mathrm{A} \beta_{1-42}$ ) in predicting each of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, tau PET and A $\beta$ PET positivity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Blood p-tau181 predicts tau and $\mathrm{A} \beta$ pathologies, differentiates Alzheimer's from other neurodegenerative disorders, and identifies Alzheimer's disease across the clinical continuum in both primary-care and specialist settings. Blood p-tau181 may be a simple, accessible and scalable test for screening and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<h2>RESEARCH IN CONTEXT</h2>
<h2>Evidence before this study</h2>
<p>Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease is challenging, partly due to the closely related pathological features shared with other neurodegenerative diseases. Presently, a definite diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can only be established by post mortem pathological examination focusing on two main pathological hallmarks: (i) amyloid plaques consisting of aggregated amyloid beta (A $\beta$ ) peptides, and (ii) neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein. In living individuals, Alzheimer's disease diagnosis relies on two main approaches: (i) imaging of the accumulation of tau tangles and $A \beta$ plaques in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET), and (ii) measuring brain-specific biochemical changes in CSF reflecting tau and $A \beta$ pathophysiology. However, tau PET is expensive and only available in specialised medical centres. In 1995, our group developed two immunoassays for quantifying tau in CSF, one for measuring pathological tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau181) and the other for the neuronal injury marker "total tau." These assays, targeting mid-region tau species, were subsequently developed into commercial kit assays, and have recently been approved by the United States Food and Drugs Administration to support diagnosis and candidate drug testing. The assays have been used in hundreds of published independent clinical studies. In reviewing</p>
<p>such previous work, we searched PubMed for all articles published from database inception to January 20, 2020, without language restrictions, using the keywords "tau", "phosphorylated tau", "CSF tau", "CSF biomarker", "Alzheimer's disease", "plasma tau", "amyloid", "MRI", "PET", "cognitive decline" and "hippocampal atrophy". We found that CSF p-tau181, but not "total tau," is highly specific for Alzheimer's disease; this biomarker is not altered in neurodegenerative diseases without Alzheimer co-pathology. Moreover, CSF p-tau181 correlates strongly with cognitive impairment, hippocampal atrophy, $\mathrm{A} \beta$ and tau PET. However, the usability of CSF p-tau181 is restricted by the need of a lumbar puncture. Due to this shortcoming, there is a need for an easily accessible p-tau181 blood test that can reliably detect key Alzheimer's disease pathophysiological processes to enable research, diagnosis and drug development. Nonetheless, attempts to develop a reliable a blood p-tau181 assay have been challenging due to the very low concentrations in blood samples. Furthermore, initial unsuccessful efforts were concentrated on applying the established mid-region CSF p-tau181 immunoassays directly on blood. Recent evidence has shown that tau in blood and CSF may be processed differently, with mainly N-terminal forms of tau present in measurable quantities in blood. A few studies, each targeting different tau species, have described blood p-tau181 immunoassays showing encouraging results in limited patient cohorts. However, some of these assays lack the analytical sensitivity for examining cognitively unimpaired individuals some of whom may be in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, it is unclear if the published blood p-tau181 assays detect either Alzheimer-specific tau pathology similar to CSF p -tau181 or tau pathology that is common to all neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of pathological tau.</p>
<h1>Added value of this study</h1>
<p>In this study, we present a blood-based immunoassay measuring p-tau181 on a novel N-terminal form of tau that is distinct from the mid-region forms targeted by the established CSF assays. This assay was validated to be specific for the p -tau181 site, does not capture non-</p>
<p>phosphorylated tau species, and shows excellent diagnostic performance for Alzheimer's disease in both plasma and serum. Due to its high-sensitivity, the assay was able to measure blood p-tau181 in 1,131 study participants, including healthy young adults aged $\sim 23$ years. Blood p-tau181 was measurable in CSF, and correlated strongly with both mid-region CSF ptau181 and tau PET, indicating that all three methods recognise brain-derived tau. The blood ptau181 assay identified incipient Alzheimer's disease at the very early stages by differentiating between cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly individuals without brain $A \beta$ aggregates from $C U$ elderly with $A \beta$-pathology. Furthermore, plasma p-tau181 demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease, showing stepwise increases along the whole Alzheimer's disease continuum; the assay discriminated $A \beta$-positive $C U$ elderly and $A \beta$-positive mild cognitive impaired (MCI) cases from $A \beta$-negative CU elderly and young adults. Importantly, replication of the excellent diagnostic performance of blood p-tau181 to identify Alzheimer's disease in independent cohorts classified differently (either using CSF core biomarkers only, clinical diagnosis only, or clinical diagnosis in addition to CSF core biomarkers as well as tau and $A \beta$ PET) suggests that plasma p -tau181 has robust performance irrespective of the classification method used. Similar to mid-region CSF p-tau181, our blood p-tau181 appeared specific to Alzheimer's disease, differentiating it from other neurodegenerative diseases with high accuracy. In addition, blood p-tau181 predicted cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy over a period of one-year, making it suitable as an Alzheimer's disease progression marker that can also be used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. Furthermore, plasma p-tau181 performed better than the most well-known Alzheimer's disease risk factors, that is, age and APOE $\varepsilon 4$ - both singly and combined - as well as other plasma biomarkers (total tau, $A \beta_{1-42}$, $A \beta_{1-42} / A \beta_{1-40}$ and total-tau/ $A \beta_{1-42}$ ) in predicting each of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, as well as increased tau PET and $A \beta$ PET.</p>
<p>The blood p-tau181 assay described in this study may represent the first simple, practical and scalable test for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. This technology has immediate applications for diagnosis and recruitment for disease-modifying trials. This assay has the potential to be incorporated in clinical practice as a rapid screening test to identify or rule out Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and guide therapy and clinical management of patients with suspected neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>With over 50 million sufferers worldwide, the cost of dementia care reached a trillion US dollars in $2018^{1}$. Amyloid $-\beta(\mathrm{A} \beta)$ and tau pathology are the defining pathological features of Alzheimer's disease ${ }^{2}$. In vivo detection of these processes is central to disease diagnosis ${ }^{3}$, its biological definition ${ }^{4}$, and for selecting individuals for clinical trials ${ }^{5}$. Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers of $A \beta$ and tau are highly accurate for detecting Alzheimer's disease pathology, their costs and limited availability hamper their feasibility for use in clinical diagnostic practice and for screening in clinical trials ${ }^{6}$.</p>
<p>The accessibility and cost-effectiveness of blood-based biomarkers make them highly attractive for first-line clinical use and to facilitate clinical trial recruitment and monitoring ${ }^{7}$ Blood neurofilament light chain, a marker of neuronal injury, is increased in Alzheimer's disease ${ }^{8}$, but this biomarker has low specificity, since abnormal increases are reported also in several other neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, corticobasal syndrome, and progressive supranuclear palsy ${ }^{9}$.</p>
<p>Other advances include mass spectrometry-based assays for plasma $A \beta\left(A \beta_{1-42} / A \beta_{1-40}\right)$, that reflect brain amyloidosis ${ }^{10,11}$. However, these assays have limitations, including substantial peripheral $A \beta$ expression ${ }^{12}$ giving less pronounced decreases and larger overlap of $A \beta_{1-42} / A \beta_{1-}$ 40 in plasma than in CSF between $A \beta$-PET positive and negative individuals ${ }^{10}$. Furthermore, brain amyloidosis is present in 10-30\% of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals ${ }^{13}$. On the contrary, CSF phosphorylated-taul81 (p-taul81) is a highly specific pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease that remains normal in other dementias ${ }^{14}$. Thus, a blood test for p-taul81 would be a major advance for diagnostics. Some previous studies using immunoassays targeting distinct tau species reported promising results for blood p -tau181 as a biomarker for Alzheimer's disease ${ }^{15-18}$. However, some of these assays lack the analytical sensitivity for examining preclinical and CU individuals, and it is unclear if Alzheimer-specific tau pathology is detected. In this study, we report, in four independent populations, the performance of an ultra-sensitive immunoassay for blood p -tau181 that can be implemented for a practical assessment of in vivo Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. We studied whether blood ptau181 can: (i) differentiate Alzheimer's disease dementia from CU, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases; (ii) detect whether a tau or amyloid PET scan is abnormal; and (iii) predict future cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<h2>Study participants</h2>
<p>We used four independent clinic-based prospective cohorts recruiting consecutive cases. The discovery cohort included Alzheimer's disease patients ( $n=19$ ) with typical Alzheimer's disease core CSF biomarkers profile (specifically CSF $A \beta_{1-42}&lt;530 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}, \mathrm{p}$-tau181 $&gt;60 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}$, and total$\tan &gt;350 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{L}^{19}$ ), and age-matched controls ( $n=18$ ) who were patients examined at the memory</p>
<p>or neurology clinics for minor neurological or psychiatric symptoms, and with both basic and core CSF biomarkers levels within normal ranges.</p>
<p>Two independent validation cohorts were evaluated, from the TRIAD ( $n=226$, McGill University, Canada) and the Swedish BioFINDER-2 ( $n=763$, Lund University, Sweden) studies. Participants in both cohorts underwent detailed assessments including CSF ( $\mathrm{A} \beta_{1-42}$, ptau181, and total-tau), and PET (tau and $\mathrm{A} \beta$ ) biomarkers, as well as detailed clinical and cognitive evaluations. Both cohorts included CU elderly, MCI, Alzheimer's disease dementia, and frontotemporal dementia patients. In addition, TRIAD included young adults while BiOFINDER-2 had other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested the feasibility of using the assay as a rapid screening tool in a primary-care cohort $(n=105)$ that included controls from the community without diagnosis of a neurological condition and patients referred from primary care physicians for specialist care. These patients had received clinical diagnosis in the primary-care setting, but were yet to undergo biomarker and clinical assessments in specialist centers.</p>
<p>All studies were approved by the relevant ethical committees, and written informed consent obtained for all participants where necessary. For further details about the study participants, see the appendix (pp 5-6).</p>
<h1>Outcomes</h1>
<p>In the discovery cohort, CSF p-tau181, total tau and $\mathrm{A} \beta_{1-42}$ were measured during February to March 2019 using the established Innotest ${ }^{\circledR}$ ELISA assays from Fujirebio, as described previously ${ }^{20}$. Biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease diagnosis was achieved using previously-defined cut-offs ${ }^{19}$. The fully-automated LUMIPULSE ${ }^{\circledR}$ G1200 (Fujirebio) was used</p>
<p>to measure CSF p-tau181, total-tau and $A \beta_{1-42}$ for the TRIAD and the primary-care cohorts during August to December 2019. For BioFINDER-2, the Mesoscale Discovery assays were used to measure CSF $A \beta_{1-42}$ and $A \beta_{1-40}$.</p>
<p>In the TRIAD cohort, individuals were assessed using 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as $\mathrm{A} \beta\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ AZD4694 PET and tau $\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ MK-6240 PET during April 2017 to June 2019. In the BioFINDER-2 cohort, individuals had MRI, $A \beta\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ flutemetamol PET, and tau [ $\left.{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ RO948 PET during May 2017 to October 2019. Postmortem Braak staging suggests that the accumulation of tau neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease follows a typical pattern that begins in the transentorhinal cortex (stage I-II), spreading to limbic (III-IV), and isocortical (V-VI) regions ${ }^{21}$. We segregated individuals into Braak-staged groups based on in vivo tau PET deposition in regions corresponding to Braak I-II, Braak III-IV, and Braak V-VI. Tau PET SUVR was measured regionally in the transentorhinal (stage I-II), limbic (III-IV), and isocortical (V-VI) Braak regions, as previously described ${ }^{22}$, as well as globally in a composite area including the whole cortex (Braak stage I-VI regions), and tau positivity defined as 2.5 standard deviations (SD) higher than the mean SUVR of $A \beta$-negative cognitively unimpaired (CU) elderly. Further details are available in the appendix (pp 6-7).</p>
<p>In individuals in TRIAD $(n=88)$ who had baseline plasma p -tau181 measures as well as both baseline and one-year follow-up Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and structural MRI assessments, we evaluated the associations between baseline plasma p-tau181 concentrations and one-year longitudinal change in cognitive function and neurodegeneration, using linear regression analyses. MMSE is a neuropsychiatric test of cognitive function whilst structural MRI provides insights into brain atrophy. Brain atrophy was measured with the analysis of gray matter density on T1-weighted MRI images using voxel-based morphometry.</p>
<p>The linear regression analyses accounted for the following potential confounding variables: age, gender, $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ genotype carriage, and years of education.</p>
<h1>Predictors</h1>
<p>Plasma p-tau181 for the four cohorts was measured during May to December 2019 (one run for each cohort) in a blinded manner, on the Simoa HD-1 (Quanterix). The AT270 mouse monoclonal antibody (#MN1050, Invitrogen) specific for the threonine-181 phosphorylation site ${ }^{23}$ was coupled to paramagnetic beads (#103207, Quanterix) and used for capture. This antibody recognizes the tau sequence 176-PPAPKT(p)P-182 phosphorylated specifically at threonine-181 ${ }^{24}$. As detector, we used the anti-tau mouse monoclonal antibody Tau12 (#806502, BioLegend), which binds the N-terminal epitope 6-QEFEVMEDHAGT-18 on human tau protein ${ }^{25}$. Both amino acid numbering follow that of full-length tau 1-441 (Uniprot ID #P10636-8). The detection antibody was conjugated to biotin (#A3959, Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Full-length recombinant tau-441 phosphorylated in vitro by glycogen synthase kinase $3 \beta$ (#TO8-50FN, SignalChem) was used as the calibrator. For detailed analytical procedures and assay validation, see the appendix (pp 7-9).</p>
<p>We used area under the curve (AUC) analyses to compare the ability of plasma p-tau181 and two of the most well-known risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (age and APOE $\varepsilon 4$ genotype carriage) to correctly identify: (i) Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, (ii) increased A $\beta$ PET, and (iii) elevated tau PET uptake. APOE $\varepsilon 4$ genotyping was performed using the TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay externally at Applied Biosystems (California, United States of America). Furthermore, the performance of plasma p-tau181 to accurately identify Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and increased $A \beta$ and tau PET was compared with other plasma biomarkers (total-tau, $\mathrm{A} \beta_{1-42}, \mathrm{~A} \beta_{1-42} / \mathrm{A} \beta_{1-40}$ and total-tau $/ \mathrm{A} \beta_{1-42}$ ) using AUC analyses.

<h1>Statistics</h1>
<p>The prospective clinical cohorts are continuously recruiting patients, and for this study we included all individuals and patients with samples available for analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using R v3.1.2, MATLAB v9.2 with VoxelStats package ${ }^{28}$, and SPSS v26. Only individuals with complete data were included in each specific analysis. Unpaired t-test and analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test were used to compare continuous variables between groups. Chi-square test was used to compare dichotomous variables between groups. Receiver operating curves (ROC) contrasting groups provided the area under the curve (AUC) for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or biomarker positivity. AUC, sensitivity, specificity and the representative best value for accuracy at an optimal cutoff value were used to determine biomarker performance. Spearman's rank correlation tested associations between biomarkers. No covariates were used in the aforementioned models. Linear regression models tested the associations between plasma p-tau181 and baseline and one-year change in cognition (MMSE score) and structural imaging (hippocampus gray matter density) data. The linear regressions were corrected for age, gender, APOE $\varepsilon 4$ status and years of formal education. Significance was reported if $P&lt;0.05$. Further details may be found in the appendix (p 9).</p>

<h1>RESULTS</h1>
<p>We studied 37 individuals in the discovery cohort, 226 and 763 in the first and second validation cohorts, respectively, and a further 105 in the primary-care cohort ( $n=1,131$ individuals). Blood p-tau181 concentrations were not affected by gender $(P&gt;0.05)$. Demographics of the discovery and primary-care cohorts are available in Table 1. Demographic characteristics of the TRIAD and BioFINDER-2 populations are presented in Table 2 as well as Tables S1 and S2 (appendix pp 19-20).</p>
<p>The blood p-tau181 assay (Figure S1; appendix p 10) demonstrated high analytical performance (Table S3; appendix p 21), with high precision within and between runs, and between different batches of reagents (Tables S4 and S5; appendix pp 22-24). Mass spectrometric studies showed that the assay specifically measures N -terminal to mid-domain forms of tau phosphorylated at threonine-181, and does not recognise non-phosphorylated forms of tau (Figure S2; appendix p 11).</p>
<p>In the discovery cohort, the mean p -tau181 in paired serum and plasma were approximately two- and three-fold increased in CSF biomarker-positive Alzheimer's disease patients compared with controls, respectively ( $P&lt;0.0001$; Figure 1A). P-tau181 concentrations in paired serum and plasma correlated well with one another ( $\mathrm{r}=0.8150, P&lt;0.0001$; Figure S3; appendix p 12). P-tau181 in blood showed high performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (serum, AUC $=95.91 \%$; plasma, $\mathrm{AUC}=90.06 \%$; Figure 1B and Figure S4; appendix p 13), suggesting that plasma and serum are equally suitable for p -tau181 analysis.</p>
<p>In TRIAD, plasma p-tau181 was increased in the CSF A $\beta$-positive Alzheimer's disease dementia group compared to all other diagnostic groups ( $P&lt;0.0001$; Figure 1C). Plasma p-</p>
<p>tau181 concentrations in $\mathrm{A} \beta$-positive CU elderly as well as $\mathrm{A} \beta$-negative and $\mathrm{A} \beta$-positive MCIs were higher than in the young, frontotemporal dementia and $\mathrm{A} \beta$-negative CU elderly cases ( $P&lt;0.05$; Figure 1C and Table S1; appendix p 19). Plasma p-tau181 discriminated Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal dementia ( $\mathrm{AUC}=100 \%$ ), young and CU elderly (AUC and accuracy $&gt;95 \%$ ), and MCI (AUC $&gt;85 \%$ and accuracy $&gt;80 \%$; Figure 1D and Figure S4; appendix p 13). Plasma p-tau181 distinguished $\mathrm{A} \beta$-positive CU elderly from $\mathrm{A} \beta$-negative CU elderly (AUC=81$\cdot$02\%), and young adults (AUC=89$\cdot$90\%) (Figure S5; appendix p 14).</p>
<p>In BioFINDER-2, plasma p-tau181 levels gradually increased across the entire Alzheimer's disease clinical continuum, being lowest in the CSF A $\beta$-negative CU elderly and $\mathrm{A} \beta$-negative MCI groups followed by the $\mathrm{A} \beta$-positive CU elderly and $\mathrm{A} \beta$-positive MCI groups, and then the (CSF A $\beta$-positive) Alzheimer's disease dementia group (Figure 1E). Plasma p-tau181 was increased in Alzheimer's disease dementia compared with each of the MCI and CU elderly groups ( $P&lt;0.0001$ ), and discriminated Alzheimer's disease from $\mathrm{A} \beta$-negative CU elderly and A $\beta$-negative MCI (AUC=90$\cdot$21\% and $86 \cdot 51 \%$, respectively (Figure IF). Moreover, plasma ptau181 was increased in Alzheimer's disease compared with other (A $\beta$-negative) neurodegenerative disorders ( $P&lt;0.0001$ ). Plasma p-tau181 concentrations separated Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementia (AUC=92$\cdot$13\%), progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal syndrome (AUC=88$\cdot$47\%), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia/primary progressive aphasia (AUC=82$\cdot$76\%), and Parkinson's disease/multiple systems atrophy (AUC=81$\cdot$90\%; Figure 1F). Data when including clinically diagnosed nonAlzheimer's disease cases who proved to be $\mathrm{A} \beta$-positive (i.e., having concomitant Alzheimer's disease-type pathology) are shown in Figure S6 (appendix p 15).</p>
<p>In the primary-care cohort, plasma p-tau181 concentration increased progressively from young to CU elderly, MCI, and clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients with unknown CSF</p>
<p>and PET biomarker status (Figure 1G). Plasma p-tau181 discriminated Alzheimer's disease dementia from young individuals (accuracy $=100 \%$ ), CU elderly ( $\mathrm{AUC}=84 \cdot 44 \%$ and accuracy $&gt;90 \%$ ), but not from MCI (AUC=55$\cdot$00\%) (Figure 1H and Figure S4; appendix p 13).</p>
<p>In TRIAD, plasma p-tau181 strongly correlated with tau $\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ MK-6240 PET across the cortex with the highest association in the temporal lobe (Figure 2A), and also with $\mathrm{A} \beta\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ AZD4694 PET across the cortex with the highest association in the precuneus, frontal cortex, and striatum (Figure 2B). Plasma p-tau181 strongly predicted [ $\left.{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ MK-6240 PET positivity (AUC and accuracy $&gt;90 \%$, Figure 3A) and [ $\left.{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ AZD4694 PET positivity (AUC $=88 \cdot 09 \%$ and accuracy $&gt;80 \%$, Figure 3B). Additionally, plasma p-tau181 discriminated individuals positive for both [ $\left.{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ MK-6240 and $\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ AZD4694 from individuals negative for at least one of the PET biomarkers (AUC and accuracy $&gt;90 \%$,Figure 3C). Plasma p-tau181 correlated with tau PET uptake across all Braak stages (Figure S7; appendix p 16). Plasma p-tau181 correlated better with both tau PET and $A \beta$ PET in $A \beta$-positive cases than in $A \beta$-negative individuals (see legend to Figure 2). Plasma p-tau181 correlation with tau and $A \beta$ PET stratified by clinical diagnosis are shown in Table S6 (appendix p 25). Plasma p-tau181 increased with disease severity measured by tau PET uptake (Figure 3D), and also correlated with duration of symptoms within the Alzheimer's disease dementia group, calculated as age at blood collection minus age of onset ( $\mathrm{r}=0 \cdot 3627, P=0 \cdot 0252$ ). Importantly, among tau PET-negative individuals (Braak 0), plasma p-tau181 distinguished $A \beta$-positive from $A \beta$-negative cases ( $\mathrm{AUC}=84 \cdot 82 \%$; Figure 3E).</p>
<p>In BioFINDER-2, plasma p-tau181 correlated with [ $\left.{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ RO948 in $A \beta$-positive cases (i) Braak I-II ROI ( $\mathrm{r}=0 \cdot 445, P&lt;0 \cdot 001$ ), ii) Braak III-IV ( $\mathrm{r}=0 \cdot 488, P&lt;0 \cdot 001$ ), iii) Braak V-IV ( $\mathrm{r}=0 \cdot 446, P&lt;0 \cdot 001$ ). Plasma p-tau181 differentiated tau PET-positive individuals from tau PETnegative participants with high accuracy ( $\mathrm{AUC}=83 \cdot 08 \%, 85 \cdot 08 \%$ and $84 \cdot 70 \%$ for tau PET</p>
<p>360 Braak I-II, III-IV and V-VI ROI respectively; Figure S8, appendix p 17). Additionally, plasma p-tau181 was higher for $A \beta$ PET-positive cases than $A \beta$ PET-negative participants ( $P&lt;0.0001$ ).</p>
<p>In the discovery cohort, plasma and serum p-tau181 (Simoa) were highly correlated with Innotest CSF p-tau181 ( $\mathrm{r}=0.7055-0.7937, P&lt;0.0001$;Fig. S9A) and CSF A $\beta_{1-42}(\mathrm{r}=-0.5936-$ 0.6830, $P&lt;0.0001$; Figure S9A, appendix p 18). In TRIAD, plasma p-tau181 correlated well with CSF p-tau181, measured with either Lumipulse or Simoa; for details see Figure S9B (appendix p 18). Simoa and Lumipulse CSF p-tau181 correlated strongly ( $\mathrm{r}=0.8666, P$ $&lt;0.0001$;Figure S9B; appendix p 18). Simoa p-tau181 measured in paired plasma and CSF from the same individuals (Figure S9B; appendix p 18) gave mean plasma p-tau181 to CSF p-tau181 ratio of $\sim 5 \%$.</p>
<p>Plasma p-tau181 was a better predictor of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and increased A $\beta$ PET than each of age, $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ allele, and age and $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ carriage combined. Adding age and $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ status provided only marginal or no improvements to the predictive accuracies of plasma p-tau181 (Tables S7-S8; appendix p 25). Similarly, plasma p-tau181 predicted elevated tau PET better than each of age, $A P O E \varepsilon 4$, and age and $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ status combined in all Braak ROI when considering the entire cohort, as well as within the Alzheimer's disease cases, and the non-demented groups (Braak III-IV and V-VI; Tables S9-S11, appendix p 26). In APOE $\varepsilon 4$ stratified analysis, plasma p-tau181 remained a much better predictor of Alzheimer's disease as well as increased $A \beta$ PET and tau PET than age, in both carriers and non-carriers (Tables S7S11; appendix pp 25-26).</p>
<p>Plasma p-tau181 was a more accurate predictor of: (i) Alzheimer's disease, (ii) increased $A \beta$ PET, and (iii) elevated tau PET (Braak I-VI), than each of plasma $A \beta_{1-42}, A \beta_{1-42} / A \beta_{1-40}$, totaltau, and total-tau/A $\beta_{1-42}$ (Table S12; appendix p 27).</p>
<p>A subset of individuals in TRIAD $(n=88)$ had one-year follow-up structural MRI and cognitive assessment. After correcting for age, gender, $A P O E \varepsilon 4$ and years of education, plasma p-tau181 correlated with one-year worsening in MMSE ( $P \leq 0.0015$,Figure 4A-B), and with both baseline and one-year change hippocampal atrophy ( $P&lt;0.0001$ and 0.05 respectively, Figure 4C-D; for analysis by diagnostic group, see Table S13; appendix p 27).</p>
<h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
<p>We report a high-performance blood p -tau181 assay that identified brain tau pathology and showed increased levels in individuals having $A \beta$ pathology but were still tau PET-negative. Moreover, plasma p-tau181 demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for Alzheimer's disease in four independent cohorts, discriminated $A \beta$-positive $C U$ elderly and $A \beta$-positive MCI cases from $A \beta$-negative $C U$ elderly and young adults, and also showed high performance to identify clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients with unknown brain amyloid status in the primary-care setting. Furthermore, blood p-tau181 differentiated Alzheimer's disease from several other neurodegenerative diseases with high performance. In addition, blood p-tau181 predicted cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy over a period of one-year.</p>
<p>The specificity of p -tau181 to Alzheimer's disease, as shown in $\mathrm{CSF}^{14}$, corroborated also in blood in the present study, makes it highly desirable biomarker for clinical use. Previous studies, using plasma p-tau181 assays developed on different technology platforms, have reported moderate accuracy of plasma p-tau181 in discriminating Alzheimer's disease from nondemented controls ${ }^{15-18}$. However, these assays have not been applied to large, independent cohorts including non-Alzheimer neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it is unclear if any of these assays, each targeting a distinct form of tau, is specific to tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease; one assay has shown similar increases in frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy ${ }^{26}$. Two assays were not sensitive</p>
<p>enough for measuring p -tau181 levels in many participants, including control patients ${ }^{16,18}$. In addition, some assays were validated specifically for plasma ${ }^{16,17}$, limiting the choice of matrix. The ultra-sensitive assay presented in this study measures specific N -terminal p -tau181 species, as verified by mass spectrometry experiments, and the detection in CSF and strong correlations between blood and CSF levels of CSF p-tau181 support that it specifically measures brainderived p-tau181. Importantly, blood p-tau181 discriminated A $\beta$-negative CU elderly cases from $A \beta$-positive $C U$ elderly and $A \beta$-positive MCI cases, suggesting that plasma p -tau181 can model the whole Alzheimer's disease continuum. Furthermore, similar to CSF p-tau181 ${ }^{27}$, blood p-tau181 separated Alzheimer's disease from other neurodegenerative disorders with high accuracy, indicating that this assay may be a specific marker of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, the assay distinguished Alzheimer's disease from phenotypes of primary tauopathies including progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome, both with concomitant tau pathology also seen in Alzheimer's disease. Together, the results indicate that blood p -tau181 has the specificity and scalability required for effective population screening in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The blood p-tau181 test displayed high accuracy for predicting in vivo tau tangles and a predictive power to detect $A \beta$ plaque-positive cases comparable to high-performance mass spectrometry-based $A \beta$ plasma assays ${ }^{10,11}$. Notably, blood p -tau181 identifies individuals with brain tau and $A \beta$ pathology with up to $&gt;90 \%$ AUC. The strong correlation between plasma ptau181 and A $\beta$ PET (Figure 2) together with the increased plasma p-tau181 in A $\beta$ PET-positive but tau PET-negative (Braak 0) individuals suggests that this new test detects Alzheimer's disease-type pathology in the very early disease stages. This finding also suggests potential biological links between tau production and $A \beta$ plaques, in that plasma p -tau181 may detect a neuronal reaction to initial $A \beta$ aggregation ${ }^{28}$, supporting the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Significantly, the high accuracy of our blood assay to identify brain tangle and plaque</p>
<p>pathologies, both singly and jointly, makes it an ideal biomarker satisfying biological and clinical definitions of Alzheimer's disease ${ }^{4}$. The blood p-tau181 assay thus constitutes an unprecedented advance for rapidly identifying in vivo Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, and could become a cost- and time-saving first-line test for the evaluation of patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease, irrespective of disease stage. The overlap between MCI and Alzheimer disease participants in the primary-care cohort may likely be driven by MCI patients already having Alzheimer disease dementia phenotypes, which cannot be excluded in this cohort without detailed PET or CSF biomarker data. The multi-centric design, the larger and more diverse population (compared to the other cohorts) and the different PET ligands used in BioFINDER-2 may account for the slightly lower AUCs for this cohort. Nonetheless, this cohort likely reflects the heterogeneous patient populations seen in the primary-care clinic. The overall excellent performance of blood p -tau181 in all cohorts studied indicates that this test is useful for supporting Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.</p>
<p>The association between baseline blood p -tau181 and one-year cognitive deterioration as well as rate of hippocampal atrophy suggest that the new p -tau181 blood test also can serve as a predictor of disease progression, and thus may be used to select individuals most likely to progress during the typically short clinical trial periods. The correlation between plasma ptau181 and $\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ MK-6240 tau PET in the TRIAD cohort showed almost a bi-modal distribution, with p -tau181 increasing rather steeply within CU and MCI cases, and then plateauing in Alzheimer's disease dementia cases, despite increasing tau PET ligand retention. These findings suggest that plasma p -tau181 increases during the very early stages of tau pathology accumulation, supported by the high plasma p -tau181 in $\mathrm{A} \beta$ PET-positive individuals who were still tau PET-negative (Braak stage 0; Figure 3E). However, plasma p-tau181 does not appear to increase further in cases with moderate to severe tau pathology. Similar observations were made in a previous study, reporting a poor correlation between p-tau181 and $\left[{ }^{18} \mathrm{~F}\right]$ AV1451 tau</p>            </div>
