                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> In quantum field theory, there exist states in which the expectation value of the energy density for a quantized field is negative. These negative energy densities lead to several problems such as the failure of the classical energy conditions, the production of closed timelike curves and faster than light travel, violations of the second law of thermodynamics, and the possible production of naked singularities. Although quantum field theory introduces negative energies, it also provides constraints in the form of quantum inequalities (QI’s). These uncertainty principle-type relations limit the magnitude and duration of any negative energy. We derive a general form of the QI on the energy density for both the quantized scalar and electromagnetic fields in static curved spacetimes. In the case of the scalar field, the QI can be written as the Euclidean wave operator acting on the Euclidean Green’s function. Additionally, a small distance expansion on the Green’s function is used to derive the QI in the short sampling time limit. It is found that the QI in this limit reduces to the flat space form with subdominant correction terms which depend on the spacetime geometry. Several example spacetimes are studied in which exact forms of the QI’s can be found. These include the three- and four-dimensional static Robertson-Walker spacetimes, flat space with perfectly reflecting mirrors, Rindler and static de Sitter space, and the spacetime outside a black hole. In all of the above cases, we find that the quantum inequalities give a lower limit on how much negative energy may be observed relative to the vacuum energy density of the spacetime. For the particular case of the black hole, it is found that the quantum inequality on the energy density is measured relative to the Boulware vacuum. Finally, the application of the quantum inequalities to the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime leads to strict constraints on the thickness of the negative energy region needed to maintain the warp drive. Under these constraints, we discover that the total negative energy required exceeds the total mass of the visible universe by a hundred billion times, making warp drive an impractical form of transportation.</p>

            <div class="paper-content"><h1>Quantum Inequality Restrictions on Negative Energy Densities in Curved Spacetimes</h1>
<p>A dissertation submitted by<br>Michael John Pfenning ${ }^{1}$<br>In partial fulfillment of the requirements<br>for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the<br>Department of Physics and Astronomy,<br>TUFTS UNIVERSITY<br>Medford, Massachusetts 02155<br>Advisor: Lawrence H. Ford ${ }^{2}$</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In quantum field theory, there exist states in which the expectation value of the energy density for a quantized field is negative. These negative energy densities lead to several problems such as the failure of the classical energy conditions, the production of closed timelike curves and faster than light travel, violations of the second law of thermodynamics, and the possible production of naked singularities.</p>
<p>Although quantum field theory introduces negative energies, it also provides constraints in the form of quantum inequalities (QI's). These uncertainty principle-type relations limit the magnitude and duration of any negative energy. We derive a general form of the QI on the energy density for both the quantized scalar and electromagnetic fields in static curved spacetimes. In the case of the scalar field, the QI can be written as the Euclidean wave operator acting on the Euclidean Green's function. Additionally, a small distance expansion on the Green's function is used to derive the QI in the short sampling time limit. It is found that the QI in this limit reduces to the flat space form with subdominant correction terms which depend on the spacetime geometry.</p>
<p>Several example spacetimes are studied in which exact forms of the QI's can be found. These include the three- and four-dimensional static Robertson-Walker spacetimes, flat space with perfectly reflecting mirrors, Rindler and static de Sitter space, and the spacetime outside a black hole. In all of the above cases, we find that the quantum inequalities give a lower limit on how much negative energy may be observed relative to the vacuum energy density of the spacetime. For the particular case of the black hole, it is found that the quantum inequality on the energy density is measured relative to the Boulware vacuum.</p>
<p>Finally, the application of the quantum inequalities to the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime leads to strict constraints on the thickness of the negative energy region needed to maintain the warp drive. Under these constraints, we discover that the total negative energy required exceeds the total mass of the visible universe by a hundred billion times, making warp drive an impractical form of transportation.</p>

<h2>Energy Conditions in General Relativity</h2>
<h3>1.1 The Classical Energy Conditions</h3>
<p>The most powerful and intriguing tool in cosmology is Einstein's equation,</p>
<p>$$
G_{\mu \nu} \equiv R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu}=8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}
$$</p>
<p>Here we have chosen the spacetime metric to have a $(-,+,+,+)$ signature and the definitions of the Riemann and Ricci tensors in the convention of Misner, Thorne and Wheeler [1]. Einstein's equation relates the spacetime geometry on the left with the matter source terms on the right. The equation is interesting in that it admits a large number of solutions. If there are no physical constraints on the metric or the stress-tensor, then Einstein's equation is vacuous since any metric would be a "solution" corresponding to some distribution of the stress-energy. We could then have "designer spacetimes" which could exhibit any behavior that one likes. Therefore, if we can place any limitations upon the equation, or on terms in the equation, we could limit the search for physically realizable solutions.</p>
<p>The most trivial condition comes from the Bianchi identities, that the covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor must vanish:</p>
<p>$$
\nabla_{\mu} G^{\mu \nu}=0
$$</p>
<p>From Einstein's equation, this leads to the condition on the stress-energy tensor of</p>
<p>$$
\nabla_{\mu} T^{\mu \nu}=0
$$</p>
<p>This is the covariant form of the conservation of energy in general relativity.
The next condition which is generally considered reasonable for all classical matter is that the energy density seen by an observer should be non-negative. Consider an observer who moves along the geodesic $\gamma^{\mu}(\tau)$. Then his four-velocity,</p>
<p>$$
u^{\mu}(\tau) \equiv \frac{d}{d \tau} \gamma^{\mu}(\tau)
$$</p>
<p>is everywhere timelike and tangent to the curve $\gamma^{\mu}(\tau)$. In the observer's frame, the statement that the energy density should be non-negative is</p>
<p>$$
T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu}(\tau) u^{\nu}(\tau) \geq 0, \quad \text { for all timelike } u^{\nu}(\tau)
$$</p>
<p>This is typically called the Weak Energy Condition (WEC). This condition was an important assumption in the proof of the singularity theorem developed by Penrose [2]. In the early part of this century, it was known that a spherically symmetric object that underwent gravitational collapse would form a black hole, with a singularity at the center. However, relativists were unsure if the same would be true for a more generic distribution of matter. Penrose's original singularity theorem showed that the end product of gravitational collapse would always be a singularity without assuming any special symmetries of the matter distribution. The WEC is used in the proof of the singularity theorem in the Raychaudhuri equation to ensure focusing of a congruence of null geodesics. An additional assumption sometimes used in the proof of the singularity theorems is the Strong Energy Condition (SEC),</p>
<p>$$
\left(T_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2} T g_{\mu \nu}\right) u^{\mu}(\tau) u^{\nu}(\tau) \geq 0, \quad \text { for all timelike } u^{\nu}(\tau)
$$</p>
<p>Here $T=T_{\mu}{ }^{\mu}$ is the contraction of the stress-tensor. If the SEC is satisfied, then it ensures that gravity is always an attractive force. The SEC is "stronger" than the WEC only in the sense that it is a more restrictive condition, and therefore it is much easier to violate the SEC than the WEC.</p>
<p>Immediately following the successes of Penrose's singularity theorem for black holes, Hawking $[3,4]$ developed a similar theorem for the open Friedman-Robertson-Walker universe which showed that there had to exist an essential, initial singularity from which the universe was born. Nearly thirty years later, singularity theorems are still being proven for various spacetimes. For example, Borde and Vilenkin have proven the existence of initial singularities for inflationary cosmologies and for certain classes of closed universes $[5,6]$.</p>
<p>For completeness, we also mention two other classical energy conditions. The first is the Null Energy Condition (NEC),</p>
<p>$$
T_{\mu \nu} K^{\mu} K^{\nu} \geq 0, \quad \text { for all } K^{\nu}
$$</p>
<p>where $K^{\mu}$ is the tangent to a null curve. The NEC follows by continuity from both the WEC (1.5) and the SEC (1.6) in the limit when $u^{\mu}$ becomes a null vector. The second condition is a little different from the previous ones. Let us assume, as we did above, that $u^{\nu}$ is a future-directed timelike vector. It follows that the product, $-T^{\mu}{ }_{\nu} u^{\nu}$, should also be a future-directed timelike or null vector. This is known as the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) and can be interpreted to mean that the speed of energy flow of matter should always be less than the speed of light.</p>
<p>We see that the energy conditions at the classical level are an extremely useful tool that have yielded some remarkable results in the form of the singularity theorems and positive mass theorems. However, many of the energy conditions are doomed to failure when quantum field theoretic matter is introduced as the source of gravity. A first approximation to a "quantum theory of gravity" is achieved via the semiclassical equation</p>
<p>$$
G_{\mu \nu}=8 \pi G\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>We are still treating the spacetime as a "smooth" classical background, but we have replaced the classical stress-tensor with its renormalized quantum expectation value. It is presumed that the field equation should be valid in the test field limit where the mass and/or the energy of the quantized field is not so large as to cause significant back-reaction on the spacetime. However, the replacement of the classical stress-tensor with its quantum expectation value is not without difficulty. At the same time that Penrose and Hawking were introducing the singularity theorems, Epstein, Glaser and Jaffe [7] were demonstrating that the local energy density in a quantized field theory was not always positive definite. We will see in Chapter 2 that it is possible to construct specific quantum states in which the energy density is negative along some part of an observer's</p>
<p>worldline. The simplest example, discussed in Section 2.1, is a state in which the particle content of the theory is a superposition of the vacuum plus two particle state. Another example is the squeezed states of light which have been produced and observed experimentally [8], although it is unclear at this time whether it is possible to measure the negative energy densities that exist for these two cases. However, there is the interesting case of the Casimir vacuum energy density for the quantized electromagnetic field between two perfectly conducting parallel plates [9]. Here the vacuum energy between the plates is found to be a constant and everywhere negative. Indirect effects of the negative vacuum energy, in the form of the Casimir force which causes the plates to be attracted to one another, has been measured experimentally $[10,11]$. It has even been suggested that the Casimir force may play a role in the measurement limitations in electron force microscopy $[12]$.</p>
<p>Related to the Casimir vacuum energy is the vacuum energy of a quantized field in curved spacetime, which we will discuss further in Section 2.3. An example is the static closed universe, where the vacuum energy for the conformally coupled field is positive [13, 14], while that of the minimally coupled field is negative [15]. Instances of non-zero vacuum energies in the semiclassical theory of gravity seem to be extremely widespread. The most well known, and probably most carefully studied, is the vacuum energy around a black hole. Hawking has shown that this causes the black hole to evaporate, with a flux of positive energy particles being radiated outward. In this case both the WEC and the NEC are violated [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22].</p>
<p>In terms of a consistent mathematical theory of semiclassical gravity, the existence of negative energy densities is not necessarily a problem. On the contrary, it could be viewed as beneficial because it would allow spacetimes in which time travel would be possible, or where mankind could construct spacecraft which could warp spacetime around them in order to travel around the universe faster than the speed of light. Even wormholes would be allowed as self-consistent solutions to Einstein's equation.</p>
<p>Objections to negative energies are raised for several reasons such as violations of the second law of thermodynamics, the possibility of creating naked singularities by violating cosmic censorship, and the loss of the positive mass theorems. On the more philosophical side, if time travel, space or time warps, wormholes and any other exotic solution that physicists can dream up were allowed, then we would have to deal with a new set of complexities, such as problems with causality and the notion of free will. Visser's [23] description of four possible schools of thought on how to build an entirely self-consistent theory of physics with regard to time travel is quoted here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The radical rewrite conjecture: One might make one's peace with the notion of time travel and proceed to rewrite all of physics (and logic) from the ground up. This is a very painful procedure, not to be undertaken lightly.</li>
<li>Novikov's consistency conjecture: This is a slightly more modest way of making one's peace with the notion of time travel. One simply asserts that the universe is consistent, so that whatever temporal transpositions and trips one undertakes, events must conspire in such a way that the overall result is consistent. (A more aggressive version of the consistency conjecture attempts to derive this "principle of self-consistency" from some appropriate micro-physical assumptions.)</li>
<li>
<p>Hawking's chronology protection conjecture: Hawking has conjectured that the cosmos works in such a way that time travel is completely and utterly forbidden. Loosely speaking, "thou shalt not travel in time," or "suffer not a time machine exist." The chronology protection conjecture permits spacewarps/wormholes but forbids timewarps/time machines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The boring physics conjecture: This conjecture states, roughly: "A pox upon all nonstandard speculative physics. There are no wormholes and/or spacewarps. There are no time machines/timewarps. Stop speculating. Get back to something we know something about."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides the philosophical reasons, there is one particularly important mathematical result of the classical theory of gravity that would fail if negative energies did exist and were widespread. These are the singularity theorems which establish the existence of singularities in general relativity, particularly for gravitational collapse and at the initial "big bang."</p>
<h1>1.2 The Averaged Energy Conditions</h1>
<p>In the 1970's and 1980's, several approaches were proposed to study the extent to which quantum fields may violate the weak energy condition, primarily with the hope of restoring some, if not all, of the classical general relativity results. In 1978, Tipler suggested averaging the pointwise conditions over an observer's geodesic [24]. Subsequent work by various authors [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31] eventually led to what is presently called the Averaged Weak Energy Condition (AWEC),</p>
<p>$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle d \tau \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>where $u^{\mu}$ is the tangent to a timelike geodesic and $\tau$ is the observer's proper time. Here the energy density of the observer is not measured at a single point, but is averaged over the entire observer's worldline. Unlike the WEC, the AWEC allows for the existence of negative energy densities so long as there is compensating positive energy elsewhere along the observer's worldline.</p>
<p>There is also an Averaged Null Energy Condition (ANEC),</p>
<p>$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} K^{\mu} K^{\nu}\right\rangle d \lambda \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>where $K^{\mu}$ is the tangent to a null geodesic, and $\lambda$ is the affine parameter along that null curve. Roman $[28,29]$ has demonstrated in a series of papers that the singularity theorem developed by Penrose will still hold if the weak energy condition is replaced by the averaged null energy condition. Therefore, within the limits of the semiclassical theory there exists the possibility of recovering some, if not all, of the classical singularity theorems.</p>
<p>The ANEC is somewhat unique in that it follows directly from quantum field theory. Wald and Yurtsever [31] showed that the ANEC could be proven to hold in two dimensions for any Hadamard state along a complete, achronal null geodesic. They also showed that the same result held in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime as well. The results in two-dimensional flat spacetime were confirmed by way of an entirely different method by Ford and Roman [32]. The question of whether back-reaction would enforce the averaged null energy condition in semiclassical gravity has been addressed recently by Flanagan and Wald [33]. Their work seems to indicate that if violations of the ANEC do occur for self-consistent solutions of the semiclassical equations, then they cannot be macroscopic, but are limited to the Planck scale. On such a tiny scale, we do not know if the semiclassical theory is reliable. It is expected that at the Planck scale the effects of a full quantum theory of gravity would be important.</p>
<p>At first the averaged energy conditions seem like a vast improvement. If the averaged energy conditions hold in general spacetimes, there is hope that we can restore the singularity theorems and gain a new class of energy conditions better suited for dealing with quantum fields. However, it is straightforward to show that both the AWEC and the ANEC are violated for any observer</p>
<p>when the quantum field is in the vacuum state in certain spacetimes. The simplest example is an observer who sits at rest between two uncharged, perfectly conducting plates. Casimir [9] showed for the quantized electromagnetic field that the vacuum energy between the plates is negative. Therefore, over any time interval which we average, the AWEC will fail. Similar effects can occur in curved spacetime for the vacuum state. Examples are the various vacuum states outside a black hole $[17,18,19,20,21,22]$. It appears that a difference between an arbitrary state and the vacuum state often obeys a type of AWEC, which can be written as</p>
<p>$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\langle\psi| T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}|\psi\rangle-\left\langle 0_{c}\right| T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\left|0_{c}\right\rangle\right] d \tau \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>This equation, which has been called the Quantum Averaged Weak Energy Condition (QAWEC) is derived in Section 3.2. It holds for a certain class of observers in any static spacetime [32, 34, 35, 36] and is the result of the infinite sampling time limit of the quantum inequalities, which will be defined below.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the averaged energy conditions is that there are a number of "designer" spacetimes where they are necessarily violated. Three examples of particular interest are: the traversable wormhole [37, 38], the Alcubierre "warp drive" [39, 40], and the Krasnikov tube [41, 42]. All three require negative energy densities to maintain the spacetime. Likewise, all three have similar problems in that slight modifications of these spacetimes would lead to closed timelike curves, and would allow backward time travel [43]. Thus, these spacetimes may be entirely unphysical in the first place. It has also been shown by various researchers that if warp drives and wormholes exist, then they must be limited to the Planck size [40, 42, 44]; otherwise extreme differences in the scales which characterize them would exist. In Chapter 5 we will discuss the example of the macroscopic warp drive, where we find that the warp bubble's radius can be on the order of tens or hundreds of meters, but the bubble's walls are constrained to be near the Planck scale. Similar results have been found for wormholes and the Krasnikov tube.</p>
<p>There is also a limitation in the averaged energy conditions. The AWEC and the ANEC say nothing about the distribution or magnitude of the negative energy that may exist in a spacetime. It is possible to have extremely large quantities of negative energy over a very large region, but the AWEC would still hold if the observer's worldline passes through a region of compensating positive energy. If we can have large negative energies for an arbitrary time, it would be possible to violate the second law of thermodynamics or causality over a macroscopic region [45]. Also, within the negative energy regions the stress-tensor has been shown to have quantum fluctuations on the order of the magnitude of the negative energy density [46]. This could mean that the metric of the spacetime in the negative energy region would also be fluctuating, and we may lose the notion of a "smooth" classical background.</p>
<h1>1.3 The Quantum Inequalities</h1>
<p>A new set of energy constraints were pioneered by Ford in the late 1970's [45], eventually leading to constraints on negative energy fluxes in 1991 [47]. He derived, directly from quantum field theory, a strict constraint on the magnitude of the negative energy flux that an observer might measure. It was shown that if one does not average over the entire worldline of the observer as is the case with the AWEC, but weights the integral with a sampling function of characteristic width $t_{0}$, then the observer could at most see negative energy fluxes, $\hat{F}_{x}$, in four-dimensional Minkowski space bounded below by</p>
<p>$$
\hat{F}<em 0="0">{x} \equiv \frac{t</em>
$$}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T^{x t}\right\rangle}{t^{2}+t_{0}^{2}} d t \geq-\frac{3}{32 \pi t_{0}^{4}</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, if a negative energy flux exists for a time $t_{0}$, then its magnitude must be less than about $t_{0}^{-4}$. We see that the specific sampling function chosen in this case, $t_{0} / \pi\left(t^{2}+t_{0}^{2}\right)$, is a Lorentzian with a characteristic width $t_{0}$ and a time integral of unity. Ford and Roman also probed the possibility of creating naked singularities by injecting a flux of negative energy into a maximally charged Reissner-Nordström black hole [16]. The idea was to use the negative energy flux to reduce the black hole's mass below the magnitude of the charge. They found that if the black hole's mass was reduced by an amount $\Delta M$, then the naked singularity produced could only exist for a time $\Delta T&lt;|\Delta M|^{-1}$.</p>
<p>Ford and Roman introduced the Quantum Inequalities (QI's) on the energy density in 1995 [32]. These uncertainty principle-type relations constrain the magnitude and duration of negative energy densities in the same manner as negative energy fluxes. Originally proven in four-dimensional Minkowski space, the quantum inequality for free, quantized, massless scalar fields can be written in its covariant form as</p>
<p>$$
\hat{\rho}=\frac{\tau_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle}{\tau^{2}+\tau_{0}^{2}} d \tau \geq-\frac{3}{32 \pi^{2} \tau_{0}^{4}}, \quad \text { for all } \tau_{0}
$$</p>
<p>Here $u^{\mu}$ is the tangent to a geodesic observer's worldline and $\tau$ is the observer's proper time. The expectation value $\rangle$ is taken with respect to an arbitrary state $|\psi\rangle$, and $\tau_{0}$ is the characteristic width of the Lorentzian sampling function. Such inequalities limit the magnitude of the negative energy violations and the time for which they are allowed to exist. In addition, such QI relations reduce to the usual AWEC type conditions in the infinite sampling time limit.</p>
<p>Flat space quantum inequality-type relations of this form were first applied to curved spacetime by Ford and Roman [44] in a paper which discusses Morris-Thorne wormhole geometries. It was argued that if the sampling time was kept small, then the spacetime region over which an observer samples the energy density would be approximately flat and the flat space quantum inequality should hold. Under this restriction they showed that wormholes are either on the order of a few thousand Planck lengths in size or there is a great disparity between the length scales that characterize the wormhole. Inherent in this argument is what should characterize a "small" sampling time? In their case, they restricted the sampling time to be less than the minimal "characteristic" curvature radius of the geometry and/or the proper distance to any boundaries. When a small sampling time expansion of the quantum inequality is performed in a general curved spacetime, such an assumption is indeed born out mathematically. This short sampling time technique is particularly useful in nonstatic spacetimes where exact quantum inequalities have yet to be proven exactly.</p>
<h1>1.4 Curved Spacetime Quantum Inequalities</h1>
<p>Although the method of small sampling times is useful, it does not address the question of how the curvature will enter into the quantum inequalities for arbitrarily long sampling times. This is the main thrust behind the present work. In Chapter 3 we will derive, for an arbitrarily curved static spacetime, a formulation for finding exact quantum inequalities which will be valid for all sampling times. For the scalar field, we find that the quantum inequality can be written in one of two forms, either as a sum of mode functions defined with positive frequency on the curved background,</p>
<p>$$
\Delta \hat{\rho} \equiv \frac{t_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle: T_{t t}: / g_{t t}\right\rangle}{t^{2}+t_{0}^{2}} d t \geq-\sum_{\lambda}\left(\frac{\omega_{\lambda}^{2}}{\left|g_{t t}\right|}+\frac{1}{4} \nabla^{j} \nabla_{j}\right)\left|U_{\lambda}(\mathbf{x})\right|^{2} \mathrm{e}^{-2 \omega_{\lambda} t_{0}}
$$</p>
<p>or as the Euclidean wave operator acting on the Euclidean Green's function (two-point functions)</p>
<p>$$
\Delta \hat{\rho} \geq-\frac{1}{4} \square_{E} G_{E}\left(\mathbf{x},-t_{0} ; \mathbf{x},+t_{0}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Both forms are functionally equivalent, but the Euclidean Green's function method is often much easier to use if the Feynman or Wightman Green's function is already known in a given spacetime. If the Green's function is inserted into the expression above, we can find the general form of the quantum inequality. In three dimensions it is given by</p>
<p>$$
\Delta \hat{\rho} \geq-\frac{1}{16 \pi \tau_{0}^{3}}{ }^{(3)} \mathcal{S}\left(m, \tau_{0}, g_{\alpha \beta}\right)
$$</p>
<p>and in four dimensions,</p>
<p>$$
\Delta \hat{\rho} \geq-\frac{3}{32 \pi^{2} \tau_{0}^{4}}{ }^{(4)} \mathcal{S}\left(m, \tau_{0}, g_{\alpha \beta}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Here, $\tau_{0}=\left|g_{t t}\right|^{1 / 2} t_{0}$ is the proper sampling time of a static observer, $g_{\alpha \beta}$ is the metric for the static spacetime, $m$ is the mass of the scalar particle, and ${ }^{(3)} \mathcal{S}$ and ${ }^{(4)} \mathcal{S}$ are called the "scale" functions. They determine how the flat space quantum inequalities are modified in curved spacetimes and/or for massive particles.</p>
<p>In Section 3.2 we will show that in the infinite sampling time limit, the quantum inequality will in general reduce to the condition</p>
<p>$$
\lim <em 0="0">{\tau</em>
$$} \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\tau_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle_{\text {Ren }}}{\tau^{2}+\tau_{0}^{2}} d \tau \geq \rho_{\text {vacuum }</p>
<p>Here we are taking the expectation value of the renormalized energy density on the left-hand side with respect to some arbitrary particle state $|\psi\rangle$, and $\rho_{\text {vacuum }}$ is the energy density of the vacuum defined by the timelike Killing vector. This is a modification of the classical AWEC inequality by the addition of the vacuum energy term.</p>
<p>In Section 3.3 we will proceed with a small sampling time expansion of the Green's function to obtain an asymptotic form for the quantum inequalities. In this limit we find that the expansion of the quantum inequality reduces to the flat space form, with subdominant terms dependent upon the curvature.</p>
<p>In Section 3.4, we will develop the quantum inequality for the quantized electromagnetic field in a curved spacetime. The flat space quantum inequality was originally derived by Ford and Roman [48], and takes an especially simple form</p>
<p>$$
\hat{\rho} \geq-\frac{3}{16 \pi^{2} \tau_{0}^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>The difference of a factor of two between the scalar field and electromagnetic field quantum inequalities occurs because the photons have two spin degrees of freedom, while the scalar particles have only one. As we will see, the electromagnetic field quantum inequality in static curved spacetimes can also be written as a mode sum, very similar to the mode sum form of the quantum inequality for the scalar field. At present, it is not known if there also exists a Green's function approach for the formulation of the quantum inequalities for the quantized electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4 we will apply the quantum inequality to several examples of curved spacetimes in two, three, and four dimensions. In two dimensions, the quantum inequality on the scalar field for static observers will be shown to have the general form</p>
<p>$$
\Delta \hat{\rho} \geq-\frac{1}{8 \pi \tau_{0}^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>Again, $\tau_{0}$ is the proper sampling time of the observer. This is the inequality in all two-dimensional spacetimes. In Section 4.1 we will see that this occurs because of the conformal equivalence between all two-dimensional spacetimes.</p>
<p>In Section 4.2 we will find the exact quantum inequalities for the three-dimensional equivalent of the closed and flat static Robertson-Walker spacetimes. In this way, the explicit form for the scale function in Eq. (1.16) will be determined, and we will examine its behavior. This will be followed by the application of the quantum inequalities in four-dimensional static Robertson-Walker spacetimes. In all of the above cases, the process of renormalization will be important for the determination of the renormalized quantum inequality. In four-dimensional static spacetimes, such as those mentioned above, the renormalized quantum inequality is given by</p>
<p>$$
\frac{t_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T_{t t} / g_{t t}\right\rangle_{\text {Ren. }}}{t^{2}+t_{0}^{2}} d t \geq-\frac{3}{32 \pi^{2} \tau_{0}^{4}}{ }^{(4)} \mathcal{S}\left(\mu, \tau_{0}, g_{\alpha \beta}\right)+\rho_{\text {vacuum }}
$$</p>
<p>Here the vacuum energy, $\rho_{\text {vacuum }}$, is important in determining what the absolute lower bound may be on any measurement of the renormalized energy density.</p>
<p>In Section 4.4 we will consider the particular case of the quantum inequalities in flat spacetimes in which there exist perfectly reflecting mirrors. Both for a single mirror and for parallel plates, we will find that the quantum inequality is modified from the flat space form due to boundary effects. Not only is the spacetime curvature important in determining the form of the quantum inequality, but so is the presence of a boundary. We will continue along these lines by looking at spacetimes in which there are horizons. In Section 4.5 we will look at quantum inequalities in Rindler and de Sitter spacetimes.</p>
<p>In Section 4.6 quantum inequalities will be found for two- and four-dimensional black holes. For the black hole in two dimensions, we find the exact renormalized quantum inequality to be</p>
<p>$$
\hat{\rho}<em 0="0">{\text {Ren. }} \geq-\frac{1}{8 \pi(1-2 M / r) t</em>
$$}^{2}}+\rho_{\text {Boulware }</p>
<p>The first term is the standard result for two-dimensional spacetime where the proper time is given by the relation $\tau=(1-2 M / r)^{1 / 2} t$. The remarkable thing about the above expression is the second term. It is known that there are three possible vacuums around a black hole that could be chosen for renormalization: the Boulware, Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states. However, the way in which the quantum inequality is developed picks out the Boulware vacuum. The mode functions that are used in deriving the quantum inequality are defined to have positive frequency with respect to the timelike Killing vector. This is also the condition for defining the Boulware vacuum state. The same is true for the four-dimensional black hole where the renormalized quantum inequality again selects the four-dimensional Boulware vacuum.</p>
<p>Finally, in Chapter 5 we will look at the dynamic spacetime of the Alcubierre "warp drive" [39] in the short sampling time limit. We will show for superluminal bubbles of macroscopically useful size that the bubble wall thickness must be on the order of only a few hundred Planck lengths [40]. Under this restriction, the total required negative energy (the energy density integrated over all space) is 100 billion times larger than the entire mass of the visible universe. This would seem to dash any hope of using such a spacetime for superluminal travel.</p>
<p>It comes as no surprise that similar results are found for the Krasnikov spacetime [41, 42]. In this spacetime, a starship traveling to a distant star at subluminal velocity, creates a tube of negative energy behind it, altering the spacetime as it goes. A good analogy here is the digging of a subway tunnel. When the ship reaches its destination it can then turn around and return home through the tube. To observers who remain stationary at the point of departure, the amount of</p>
<p>time that elapses between the departure and return of the spaceship can be made arbitrarily small, or even zero. Everett and Roman [42] showed that when the quantum inequality is applied to this spacetime in the short sampling time limit, the negative energy is constrained in a wall whose thickness is again only on the order of a few Planck lengths.</p>
<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<h2>How Negative Energies Arise in QFT</h2>
<p>In quantum field theory, there are certain states in which the local energy density is negative [7], thus violating the weak energy condition [49]. One example is the vacuum plus two particle state for the quantized scalar field. Another is the squeezed states of light for the quantized electromagnetic field. We will look closely at both cases in Section 2.1.</p>
<p>Specific states in which the quantized fermion field can yield negative energy densities are just beginning to emerge. Vollick has recently demonstrated that the energy density can become negative when the particle content is a superposition of two single particle states traveling in different directions [50]. In Section 2.2, we will demonstrate that the energy density for the fermion field is negative when the state is a superposition of the vacuum and a particle-antiparticle pair.</p>
<p>In Section 2.3, the negative vacuum energy density associated with the Casimir effect for a quantized field near perfectly reflecting boundaries will be discussed. For the quantized electromagnetic field, this gives rise to an attractive force between two parallel perfectly conducting planar plates. We will also look at how non-zero energy densities arise for the vacuum state in curved spacetimes.</p>
<h3>2.1 Quantized Scalar Field</h3>
<p>We begin our discussion of negative energy densities with the quantized scalar field in Minkowski spacetime. This model demonstrates many of the significant points about negative energy in quantum field theory.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we have a massive, quantized scalar field $\phi(x)$ which resides in Minkowski spacetime and satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation</p>
<p>$$
-\partial_{t}^{2} \phi(x)+\nabla^{2} \phi(x)-m^{2} \phi(x)=0
$$</p>
<p>The field $\phi(x)$ can be Fourier expanded in terms of a complete set of plane wave mode functions</p>
<p>$$
f_{\mathbf{k}}(x)=\left(2 \omega L^{3}\right)^{-1 / 2} e^{i \mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}-i \omega t}
$$</p>
<p>each of which individually satisfies the wave equation (2.1) for any choice of the mode label $\mathbf{k}=$ $\left(k_{x}, k_{y}, k_{z}\right)$. Note, we are using box normalization of the mode functions. The general solution to the wave equation above is given by</p>
<p>$$
\phi(x)=\sum_{\mathbf{k}}\left[a_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}}(x)+a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} f_{\mathbf{k}}^{*}(x)\right]
$$</p>
<p>In the rest frame of an observer, the energy density is the time component of the stress-energy tensor,</p>
<p>$$
\rho=T_{t t}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\partial_{t} \phi(x)\right)^{2}+\nabla \phi(x) \cdot \nabla \phi(x)+m^{2} \phi^{2}(x)\right]
$$</p>
<p>where we have chosen to use minimal coupling of the scalar field. Similar effects could be proven in general for any form of the coupling in Minkowski space. If we now insert the mode function expansion of the scalar field, we arrive at</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{t t}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathbf{k k}^{\prime}} &amp; \left{\left(\omega \omega^{\prime}+\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right)\left[f_{\mathbf{k}}^{<em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}-f_{\mathbf{k}}^{</em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{<em>} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}-f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{</em>} a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right]\right. \
&amp; \left.+m^{2}\left[f_{\mathbf{k}}^{<em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+f_{\mathbf{k}}^{</em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{<em>} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}+f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{</em>} a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}\right]\right}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>This particular equation has a divergence for any quantum state for which we may choose to evaluate its expectation value. The problem stems from the $a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}$ terms of the above expression. For example, in the vacuum $|0\rangle$, the stress-tensor reduces to</p>
<p>$$
\langle 0| T_{t t}|0\rangle=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathbf{k k}^{\prime}}\left(\omega \omega^{\prime}+\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k}^{\prime}+m^{2}\right) f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{*}\langle 0| a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle=\frac{1}{2 L^{3}} \sum_{\mathbf{k}}\left(|\mathbf{k}|^{2}+m^{2}\right)^{1 / 2}
$$</p>
<p>Here we have made use of the standard definitions of the creation and annihilation operators such that when they act on the vacuum state, they have the values</p>
<p>$$
a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}|0\rangle=\left|1_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle \quad \text { and } \quad a_{\mathbf{k}}|0\rangle=0
$$</p>
<p>respectively. In addition, when they act on a number eigenstate they become</p>
<p>$$
a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}\left|n_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle=\sqrt{n+1}\left|n+1_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle \quad \text { and } \quad a_{\mathbf{k}}\left|n_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle=\sqrt{n}\left|n-1_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>We see once the summation is carried out in Eq. (2.6) that the answer is infinite. This divergence seems to indicate that the vacuum itself contains an infinite density of energy. In non-gravitational physics, absolute values of the energy are not measurable, only energy differences. It has become standard practice to renormalize the energy density (as well as the energy) by measuring all energies relative to the infinite background energy. Typically this is achieved by normal ordering such that all of the annihilation operators stand to the right of the creation operators within the expectation value. Then, we subtract away all of the divergent vacuum energy terms. For example, if we make use of the commutation relation for the $a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}$ terms in Eq. (2.5), we find</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{t t}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\mathbf{k k}^{\prime}} &amp; \left{\left(\omega \omega^{\prime}+\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{k}^{\prime}\right)\left[f_{\mathbf{k}}^{<em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}-f_{\mathbf{k}}^{</em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{<em>} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}-f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{</em>} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}}\right]\right. \
&amp; \left.+m^{2}\left[f_{\mathbf{k}}^{<em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+f_{\mathbf{k}}^{</em>} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{<em>} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}+f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}} a_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+f_{\mathbf{k}} f_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{</em>} a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}}\right]\right}+\frac{1}{2 L^{3}} \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \omega
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The last term is the infinite vacuum energy, and is subtracted away to complete normal ordering. We define the normal ordered energy density as</p>
<dl>
<dt>$$</dt>
<dd>T_{t t}:=T_{t t}-\langle 0| T_{t t}|0\rangle
$$</dd>
</dl>
<p>which produces a finite expectation value for physically allowable states.</p>
<h1>2.1.1 Vacuum Plus Two Particle State</h1>
<p>We can now address how negative energy densities can be found. Let us consider the particle content to be defined by the superposition of two number eigenstates, e.g.,</p>
<p>$$
|\psi\rangle=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|0\rangle+\frac{1}{2}\left|2_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>If we look at the expectation value of the energy density we find,</p>
<p>$$
\langle\psi|: T_{t t}:|\psi\rangle=\frac{\omega}{2 L^{3}}\left[1-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2} \cos 2(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}-\omega t)\right]
$$</p>
<p>where we have also assumed that the field is massless. We see that the energy density oscillates at twice the frequency of the mode that composes the state. We also see that once during every cycle the energy density becomes negative for a brief period of time. A plot of this is shown in Figure 2.1.
<img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2.1: Time evolution of the energy density for the vacuum plus two particle state. Note that during every oscillation, the energy density dips below zero for a brief portion of the cycle. By manipulating the quantum state, it is possible to drive the energy density to increasingly negative values. Units on the vertical axis are in multiples of $\omega / 2 L^{3}$.</p>
<p>Actually, there are an infinite set of vacuum plus two particle states that give rise to negative energy densities. To show this, let us begin with a general superposition of an $n$ and an $n+2$ state,</p>
<p>$$
|\psi\rangle=c_{n}\left|n_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle+c_{n+2}\left|n+2_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>where the normalization of the state is expressed by the condition</p>
<p>$$
\left|c_{n}\right|^{2}+\left|c_{n+2}\right|^{2}=1
$$</p>
<p>There is an additional restriction that $\left|c_{n}\right| \neq 1$. This corresponds to a pure number eigenstate because the unit normalization would cause $c_{n+2}=0$.</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2.2: A plot showing the two conditions necessary to obtain negative energy densities for the vacuum plus two particle state. The normalization condition for the coefficients $c_{0}$ and $c_{2}$ is the unit circle. The necessary condition for negative energy $\left|c_{0}\right|&gt;\sqrt{2}\left|c_{2}\right|$ is represented by the light gray region. The set of all possible states that meet both of these conditions is denoted by the bold curve at the top and bottom of the circle. The states with $\left|c_{0}\right|=1$ must be excluded because they correspond to the vacuum state, where the energy density is zero.</p>
<p>For a superposition of the $n$ and $n+2$ particle states, the energy density is given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\langle\psi|: T_{t t}:|\psi\rangle= &amp; \frac{\omega}{L^{3}}\left(n+2\left|c_{n+2}\right|^{2}\right)-\frac{\omega^{2}-m^{2}}{\omega L^{3}} \sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)} \times \
&amp; {\left[\operatorname{Re}\left(c_{n}^{<em>} c_{n+2}\right) \cos 2(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}-\omega t)-\left|\operatorname{Im}\left(c_{n}^{</em>} c_{n+2}\right)\right| \sin 2(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}-\omega t)\right] }
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>In order to simplify our calculations, let us take $c_{n}$ and $c_{n+2}$ to be real. Then, in order to have negative energy densities, we must satisfy the condition</p>
<p>$$
\left|c_{n}\right|&gt;\frac{\omega^{2}}{\omega^{2}-m^{2}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{(n+1)(n+2)}}\left(2\left|c_{n+2}\right|+\frac{n}{\left|c_{n+2}\right|}\right)
$$</p>
<p>In addition, we must satisfy the normalization condition (2.14), which for real coefficients is the equation for a unit circle in the $\left(c_{n}, c_{n+2}\right)$ plane.</p>
<p>For the massless $(m=0)$ scalar field in the vacuum plus two particle state $(n=0)$, the condition to obtain negative energy densities, Eq. (2.16), reduces to</p>
<p>$$
\left|c_{0}\right|&gt;\sqrt{2}\left|c_{2}\right|
$$</p>
<p>We can see from Figure 2.2 that any state, except $\left|c_{0}\right|=1$, that lies on the bold sections of the circle will satisfy both the above condition to obtain negative energy densities and the unit normalization condition. For real coefficients, $c_{n}$ and $c_{n+2}$, only the vacuum plus two particle state can generate negative energy densities. If we plot the condition to find negative energy densities, Eq. (2.16), for $c_{n}$ and $c_{n+2}$ real and $n \geq 1$, we find that the range of values that would allow negative energy densities is incompatible with the unit normalization condition.</p>
<h1>2.1.2 Squeezed States</h1>
<p>The squeezed states in quantum field theory can also produce negative energies. The squeezed states of light have been extensively investigated in the field of quantum optics and are realized experimentally. We will confine ourselves to the squeezed states of the quantized scalar field, although the treatment would be the same for the electromagnetic field.</p>
<p>We begin with the definition of two additional operators. The first, introduced by Glauber [51], is the displacement operator</p>
<p>$$
D_{\mathbf{k}}(z) \equiv \exp \left(z a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}-z^{<em>} a_{\mathbf{k}}\right)=e^{-|z|^{2} / 2} e^{z a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}} e^{-z^{</em>} a_{\mathbf{k}}}
$$</p>
<p>which satisfies the commutation relations</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}, D_{\mathbf{k}}(z)\right] } &amp; =a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}+z \delta_{\mathbf{k} \mathbf{k}^{\prime}} \
{\left[a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}, D_{\mathbf{k}}(z)\right] } &amp; =a_{\mathbf{k}^{\prime}}^{\dagger}+z^{*} \delta_{\mathbf{k} \mathbf{k}^{\prime}}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The second is the squeeze operator</p>
<p>$$
S_{\mathbf{k}}(\zeta) \equiv \exp \left[\frac{1}{2} \zeta^{*} a_{\mathbf{k}}^{2}-\frac{1}{2} \zeta\left(a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}\right)^{2}\right]
$$</p>
<p>which satisfies the relations</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; S_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}(\zeta) a_{\mathbf{k}} S_{\mathbf{k}}(\zeta)=a_{\mathbf{k}} \cosh r-a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} e^{i \delta} \sinh r \
&amp; S_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger}(\zeta) a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} S_{\mathbf{k}}(\zeta)=a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger} \cosh r-a_{\mathbf{k}} e^{-i \delta} \sinh r
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The complex parameters $z$ and $\zeta$ may be written in terms of their magnitude and phases as</p>
<p>$$
z=s e^{i \gamma} \quad \text { and } \quad \zeta=r e^{i \delta}
$$</p>
<p>We can write a general squeezed state for a single mode as [52]</p>
<p>$$
\left|{z, \zeta}<em _mathbf_k="\mathbf{k">{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle=D</em>(\zeta)|0\rangle
$$}}(z) S_{\mathbf{k}</p>
<p>It has been shown that for a massless scalar field the expectation value of the energy density for the above squeezed state is given by [46]</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho &amp; \equiv\left\langle{z, \zeta}<em t="t">{\mathbf{k}}\right|: T</em>\right\rangle \
&amp; =\frac{\omega}{L^{3}}\left{\sinh r \cosh r \cos (2 \theta+\delta)+\sinh ^{2} r+s^{2}[1-\cos 2(\theta+\gamma)]\right}
\end{aligned}
$$}:\left|{z, \zeta}_{\mathbf{k}</p>
<p>where $\theta=\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{x}-\omega t$. When $\zeta=0$, the squeezed state reduces to a coherent state and the expectation value of the energy density is always positive definite. The coherent states are interpreted as the quantum states that describe classical field excitations. Thus, the production of only positive energy in coherent states is consistent with classical sources for gravity obeying the WEC.</p>
<p>A different case, known as the squeezed vacuum state, is defined when $z=0$. Such states result from quantum mechanical particle creation. An example is second harmonic generation in non-linear optical media. For the squeezed vacuum state, the energy density is given by</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle{0, \zeta}<em t="t">{\mathbf{k}}\right|: T</em> \sinh r[\sinh r+\cosh r \cos (2 \theta+\delta)]
$$}:\left|{0, \zeta}_{\mathbf{k}}\right\rangle=\frac{\omega}{L^{3}</p>
<p>The squeezed vacuum energy density will have the same negative energy density behavior as the vacuum plus two particle state above, with the energy density falling below zero once every cycle if the condition</p>
<p>$$
\cosh r&gt;\sinh r
$$</p>
<p>is met. This happens to be true for every nonzero value of $r$, so the energy density becomes negative at some point in the cycle for a general squeezed vacuum state. In a more general state which is both squeezed and displaced, the energy density will become negative at some point in the cycle if $s \ll r$.</p>
<p>There are other interesting aspects of these states as well. When the quantum state is very close to a coherent state, we have seen that the energy density is usually not negative. In addition, fluctuations in the stress-tensor for these states are small compared to the expectation value of the stress-tensor in that state. On the other hand when the state is close to a squeezed vacuum state, there will almost always be some negative energy densities present, and the fluctuations in the expectation value of the stress-tensor start to become nearly as large as the expectation value itself. This seems to indicate that the semiclassical theory is beginning to break down [46].</p>
<h1>2.2 The Quantized Fermion Field</h1>
<p>In this section we will show that it is possible to generate negative energy densities using the fermion field. Therefore it does appear possible to use fermions to violate the weak energy condition. One example of a fermion state that produces negative energies has been demonstrated by Vollick [50] for a superposition of two single particle states traveling in different directions. The particular example that we will demonstrate has a particle content which is a superposition of the vacuum plus a particle-antiparticle pair. However the occurrence of negative energy densities for the above</p>
<p>particle states can be a frame-dependent phenomenon. If the particle-antiparticle pair is traveling in the same direction, but with differing momenta, then it is possible for the energy density to become negative. However, in the center of mass frame of the particle-antiparticle pair, the local energy density always has a positive definite value.</p>
<p>The fermion field, denoted by $\psi(x)$, is the solution to the Dirac equation,</p>
<p>$$
i \gamma^{\mu} \nabla_{\mu} \psi(x)-m \psi(x)=0
$$</p>
<p>where $m$ is the mass of the spin- $\frac{1}{2}$ particle, and the $\gamma^{\mu}$ are the the Dirac matrices in flat spacetime, which satisfy the anticommutation relations</p>
<p>$$
\left{\gamma^{\mu}, \gamma^{\nu}\right}=2 g^{\mu \nu}
$$</p>
<p>The general solution of $\psi(x)$ can then be expanded in plane wave modes as</p>
<p>$$
\psi(x)=\sum_{s} \int \frac{d^{3} p}{(2 \pi)^{3 / 2}} \sqrt{\frac{m}{E_{p}}}\left[b(p, s) u(p, s) e^{-i p_{\mu} x^{\mu}}+d^{\dagger}(p, s) v(p, s) e^{i p_{\mu} x^{\mu}}\right]
$$</p>
<p>Here $b(p, s)$ and its hermitian conjugate $b^{\dagger}(p, s)$ are the annihilation and creation operators for the electron (fermion), respectively, while $d(p, s)$ and its hermitian conjugate $d^{\dagger}(p, s)$ are the respective annihilation and creation operators for the positron. All four operators anticommute except in the case</p>
<p>$$
\left{b(p, s), b^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right)\right}=\delta_{s s^{\prime}} \delta^{3}\left(p-p^{\prime}\right)=\left{d(p, s), d^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right)\right}
$$</p>
<p>The annihilation and creation operators for spin- $\frac{1}{2}$ particles satisfy the anticommutation relations as opposed to the commutation relations for the scalar field because the fermions must obey the Pauli exclusion principle.</p>
<p>For the fermion field, the stress-tensor is given by [53]</p>
<p>$$
T_{\mu \nu}=\frac{i}{2}\left[\bar{\psi} \gamma_{(\mu} \nabla_{\nu)} \psi-\left(\nabla_{(\mu} \bar{\psi}\right) \gamma_{\nu)} \psi\right]
$$</p>
<p>Inserting the mode function expansion into the energy density, and then normal ordering by making use of the anticommutation relations, we find</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{t t}= &amp; \frac{1}{2(2 \pi)^{3}} \sum_{s s^{\prime}} \int d^{3} p d^{3} p^{\prime} \frac{m}{\sqrt{E_{p} E_{p^{\prime}}}}\left(E_{p}+E_{p^{\prime}}\right) \times \
&amp; \times\left[b^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) b(p, s) u^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) u(p, s) e^{-i\left(p_{\mu}-p_{\mu}^{\prime}\right) x^{\mu}}+d^{\dagger}(p, s) d\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) v^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) v(p, s) e^{+i\left(p_{\mu}-p_{\mu}^{\prime}\right) x^{\mu}}\right] \
&amp; +\frac{1}{2(2 \pi)^{3}} \sum_{s s^{\prime}} \int d^{3} p d^{3} p^{\prime} \frac{m}{\sqrt{E_{p} E_{p^{\prime}}}}\left(E_{p}-E_{p^{\prime}}\right) \times \
&amp; \times\left[d\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) b(p, s) v^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) u(p, s) e^{-i\left(p_{\mu}+p_{\mu}^{\prime}\right) x^{\mu}}-b^{\dagger}(p, s) d^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) u^{\dagger}\left(p^{\prime}, s^{\prime}\right) v(p, s) e^{+i\left(p_{\mu}+p_{\mu}^{\prime}\right) x^{\mu}}\right] \
&amp; -\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{3}} \sum_{s} \int d^{3} p E_{p}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Unlike the vacuum energy density for the scalar field, we see that the fermion field has an infinite negative energy density that must be removed by renormalization. Thus we again look at the fully normal ordered quantity,</p>
