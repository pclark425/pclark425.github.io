<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Generative AI represents a branch of artificial intelligence that harnesses comprehensive data models to produce novel content, spanning text, images, audio, and videos.Key examples include ChatGPT, which specializes in text generation, alongside models like DALL-E and Midjourney, which are focused on image creation.These models are categorized based on their output, with advancements moving towards multi-modal models capable of handling text and images concurrently.IDC outlines generative AI's scope, encompassing unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms enabling computers to respond to prompts and create content using previously generated material.Over recent years, generative AI has evolved rapidly, unlocking new opportunities across various sectors.Unlike conventional methods that analyze existing data, generative AI takes a fresh approach, learning patterns from extensive datasets to generate outputs resembling the training data.</p>
<p>Generative AI relies on generative modeling, which differs mathematically from discriminative modeling often seen in data-driven decision support.Discriminative modeling aims to classify data points into distinct classes by learning decision boundaries, while generative modeling seeks to understand the underlying data distribution.This can involve determining the joint probability distribution of inputs and outputs or just the probability distribution of outputs, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.Generative models can generate new synthetic samples, such as creating new observation-target pairs or generating observations based on target values.</p>
<p>Expanding on this concept, a generative AI model utilizes generative modeling instantiated with a machine learning architecture, like a deep neural network, enabling the creation of new data samples based on learned patterns.Moreover, a generative AI system encompasses the entire infrastructure, including model, data processing, and user interface components.The model acts as the central element facilitating interaction and application within a broader context.Generative AI applications involve practical uses and implementations of these systems, such as generating SEO content or code, addressing real-world issues, and fostering innovation across diverse domains.Figure 1 illustrates the systematization of generative AI across different data modalities (e.g., text, image, audio) and perspectives at the model, system, and application levels, detailed further in the subsequent section.Generative AI, a facet of artificial intelligence, leverages extensively trained data models to produce original content spanning text, images, audio, and videos.Notable instances include ChatGPT, a language model service trained on vast datasets, and models like DALL-E and Midjourney, which specialize in image generation.The classification of generative AI models varies based on their output, categorizing them into language, image, or video models.However, there's a growing trend toward multi-modal models capable of simultaneous learning from text and images, positioning them as foundational models.In the realm of AI, IDC delineates generative AI, encompassing unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms enabling computers to generate new content in response to short prompts, drawing from previously generated content like text, audio, video, images, and code illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<p>In recent years, generative AI technology has advanced rapidly, unlocking fresh opportunities across diverse industries.Unlike conventional methods limited to processing or analyzing existing data, generative AI adopts an innovative approach to produce original and imaginative content.These models learn intricate patterns from extensive datasets, enabling them to generate new outputs akin to the training data.In recent years, particularly in 2023, there has been significant and swift progress in ultra-large AI technology.Table 2 outlines the latest developments in the release of generative AI models.OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March, while Google unveiled PaLM2 in May.Despite these new iterations having fewer parameters than their predecessors, they have been trained on approximately five times more text data tokens, leading to enhanced real-world performance.Additionally, major companies like Samsung Electronics are either in the process of developing their own generative AI models or contemplating doing so.</p>
<p>There is also a growing interest in open-source LLMs [Benedetti et al. 2019], such as Meta LLaMA and Falcon, which prioritize learning capacity over model size.NVIDIA is exploring the concept of an "AI Factory," which entails integrating AI models into corporate data centers.They are also working on small Large Language Models (sLLMs) aimed at reducing costs and offering easily deployable models for businesses.</p>
<p>In a notable development, Naver Cloud introduced "HyperCLOVA X," an ultra-large AI model focused on Korea, in August.HyperCLOVA [Benedetti et al. 2019] X is tailored for various sectors, including e-commerce, finance, law, and education.It can be customized to a company's specific data and domain and deployed using an API or Neuro Cloud approach.This progression suggests that the LLM market is shifting from a focus on performance competition to a more specialized competition, marking a new phase in its evolution.</p>
<p>Since the debut of Alpaca, open-source LLMs have gained momentum, leveraging the LLaMA architecture as their foundation.Subsequent to Alpaca's launch, a series of LLMs like GPT4All have emerged.GPT4All, specifically built upon the LLaMA 7B model and inspired by Alpaca, amassed 800,000 prompt-response pairs from the GPT-3.5-Turbomodel, covering code, conversations, and narratives.Notably, around 430,000 pairs were structured in an assistant-style prompt-response format, making the dataset roughly 16 times larger than Alpaca's.A significant advantage of this model is its capacity to operate on CPUs without requiring GPUs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, startups are making strides in developing sLLMs.Traditional LLMs face hardware constraints and costs due to their extensive parameter count for training.Conversely, sLLMs aim to tackle these challenges by concentrating on specific domains and languages, training on substantial datasets, and offering performance tailored to particular areas like everyday conversations and domain-specific terminology.This development is viewed as a potential remedy to the constraints of conventional LLMs [5].</p>
<p>The proliferation of AI models from various companies is broadening the scope of applications for generative AI.Generative AI is already finding utility across diverse sectors such as art, gaming, and entertainment.Recently, its application has expanded into various industries.In healthcare, it can aid in diagnosing medical conditions and devising new drugs or treatments.In manufacturing, it can facilitate the creation of novel product designs and streamline production processes.In finance, generative AI can support the development of innovative financial products and the management of transaction-related risks.This illustrates the expanding utilization of generative AI across multiple sectors, including healthcare, manufacturing, and finance.</p>
<p>Large Language Model (LLM)</p>
<p>A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence model designed to understand and generate human-like text.These models are characterized by their vast size and complexity, typically containing millions or even billions of parameters.The training process for an LLM involves feeding it large amounts of text data, such as books, articles, and internet content, to learn the patterns and structures of human language.During training, the model adjusts its parameters through a process called backpropagation, where it compares its generated output with the actual text and updates its parameters to minimize the difference between them.This iterative process continues until the model achieves a satisfactory level of performance, allowing it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.</p>
<p>Data Collection and Preprocessing</p>
<p>The initial phase involves gathering the training dataset, which acts as the primary source for the LLM's learning process.Data can be obtained from various sources such as books, websites, articles, and publicly available datasets, among others.Pre-existing text datasets are often utilized to develop an effective LLM.These datasets can be categorized into two main types: general data and domain-specific data.General data, such as web pages, books, and conversational texts, are vast and diverse, making them widely used in many LLMs to enhance language modeling and generalization capabilities.Additionally, some studies extend LLM training by incorporating specialized datasets like multilingual data, scientific data, and code to equip LLMs with task-specific abilities.Figure 3 illustrates the typical process of data gathering and pre-training for LLMs.</p>
<p>Figure 3 illustrates the typical process of data gathering and pre-training for LLMs.</p>
<p>Model Selection and Configuration</p>
<p>Major models like Google's BERT and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 typically adopt the Transformer deep learning architecture, which has become a dominant choice for advanced NLP tasks in recent times.Configuring the Transformer neural network involves specifying elements such as the number of layers in the Transformer block, the count of attention heads, the selection of loss function, and hyperparameters.The model's configuration can vary depending on the intended application and training data, significantly impacting the model's training duration.</p>
<p>Model Training</p>
<p>The model undergoes supervised learning using preprocessed text data.During training, the model is presented with a sequence of words and learns to predict the subsequent word in the sequence.By comparing its predictions with the actual next word, the model adjusts its weights accordingly.This iterative process continues millions of times until the model achieves satisfactory performance.Given the model's size and the volume of data, training requires substantial computational resources, often employing techniques like model parallelism to expedite the training process.Training a large-scale language model from scratch demands significant investment; hence, a more cost-effective approach involves fine-tuning an existing language model for specific applications.</p>
<p>Evaluation and Fine-tuning</p>
<p>Following training, the model's performance is assessed using a separate test dataset that was not used during training.Based on the evaluation outcomes, fine-tuning may be necessary to enhance the model's performance.This could entail adjusting hyperparameters, modifying the architecture, or further training on additional data.The objective is to refine the model's capabilities based on insights gleaned from the evaluation process.</p>
