                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> People have long hoped for a conversational system that can assist in real-life situations, and recent progress on large language models (LLMs) is bringing this idea closer to reality. While LLMs are often impressive in performance, their efficacy in real-world scenarios that demand expert knowledge remains unclear. LLMs are believed to hold the most potential and value in education, especially in the development of Artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual teachers capable of facilitating language learning. Our focus is centered on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in the realm of education, specifically in the areas of spoken language learning which encompass phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition. We introduce a new multiple-choice question dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the aforementioned scenarios, including understanding and application of spoken language knowledge. In addition, we investigate the influence of various prompting techniques such as zero- and few-shot method (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars), chain-of-thought (CoT, think step-by-step), in-domain exampler and external tools (Google, Wikipedia). We conducted large-scale evaluation on popular LLMs (20 distinct models) using these methods. We achieved significant performance improvements compared to the zero-shot baseline in the practical questions reasoning (GPT-3.5, 49.1% ->63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% ->48.6%). We found that models of different sizes have good understanding of concepts in phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition, but show limitations in reasoning for real-world problems. Additionally, we also explore preliminary findings on conversational communication.</p>

<p>Spoken Language Intelligence of Large Language Models for Language Learning
28 Aug 2023
People have long hoped for a conversational system that can assist in real-life situations, and recent progress on large language models (LLMs) is bringing this idea closer to reality. While LLMs are often impressive in performance, their efficacy in real-world scenarios that demand expert knowledge remains unclear. LLMs are believed to hold the most potential and value in education, especially in the development of Artificial intelligence (AI) based virtual teachers capable of facilitating language learning. Our focus is centered on evaluating the efficacy of LLMs in the realm of education, specifically in the areas of spoken language learning which encompass phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition. We introduce a new multiple-choice question dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in the aforementioned scenarios, including understanding and application of spoken language knowledge. In addition, we investigate the influence of various prompting techniques such as zero-and few-shot method (prepending the question with question-answer exemplars), chain-of-thought (CoT, think step-by-step), indomain exampler and external tools (Google, Wikipedia). We conducted large-scale evaluation on popular LLMs (20 distinct models) using these methods. We achieved significant performance improvements compared to the zero-shot baseline in the practical questions reasoning (GPT-3.5, 49.1% -&gt; 63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% -&gt; 48.6%). We found that models of different sizes have good understanding of concepts in phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition, but show limitations in reasoning for real-world problems. Additionally, we also explore preliminary findings on conversational communication. Elepaño, Maria Madriaga, Rimel Aggabao, Giezel Diaz-Candido, James Maningo, and Victor Tseng.

<p>Introducation</p>
<p>The highly parallelizable Transformer architecture [1] with massively parallel computation hardware and the self-supervised learning technique promise to leverage the vast quantity of raw data (e.g., text, images, audio) to learn general-purpose deep contextualized representations [1,2,3]. These pre-trained context-aware representations are now ubiquitous in natural language processing and very effective as general-purpose semantic features, which have largely raised the performance bar of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.</p>
<p>Preprint.</p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) Language models have revolutionized NLP in recent years. Researchers find that scaling Pre-trained Languge Model (PLM) (e.g., training compute, model parameters, etc.) often leads to better performance [4,5]. A number of studies have explored to push the limit of performance by training an ever larger PLM (e.g., the 175B-parameter GPT-3 [6] and the 540B parameter PaLM [7]). A remarkable success of LLMs is ChatGPT 1 , developed by OpenAI, that adapts the LLMs from the GPT series for dialogue, which presents an amazing conversation ability with humans, which triggered a community-wide enthusiasm to build various imaginative and fantastic applications. Microsoft AI scientists have recently explored the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 [8], a more powerful large language model and claimed that GPT-4 demonstrates "sparks" of human-level intelligence, or artificial general intelligence (AGI) [9]. Evaluate before use -There have been a number of research efforts aiming at evaluating ChatGPT and other LLMs from different aspects, encompassing a range of factors such as natural language tasks, reasoning, robustness, trustworthiness, ethical considerations and some sepecific applications (e.g. natural science, social science, engineering, medical application, education, etc.) [10,11,12,13,14,15,16]. The broad applicability of LLMs underscores the evaluation of emergent intelligence in expert domain.</p>
<p>Spoken Language Intelligence (SLI) Our world is inherently multimodal, and we engage with our environment through a variety of mediums, including text, images, sounds, and sensory experiences. There exist numerous multimodal methods that exhibit exceptional problem-solving capabilities across various scenarios, with text-based semantics frequently serving as the key agent, either explicitly or implicitly [17,18]. For example, we aspire to empower machines to comprehend an image or video and articulate its meaning in words [19]. Conversely, we create specialized text prompts to generate images with the creativity of professional painters [20]. In the realm of speech, Automatic Speech recognition (ASR) technology is capable of extracting corresponding text from speech signals even in complex speaking scenarios. Conversely, Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can realistically produce speech sounds that correspond to a given piece of text, mimicking the nuances of human speech. The powerful capabilities of LLM make it easy to integrate these systems together, for example, to build a voice assistants. Thanks to the unified Transformer structure, in addition to simple cascading, they can also be completely integrated in an end-to-end manner [21]. LLMs have the ability to replace the LM module in ASR, decode discretized representations directly, or even replace the intricate TTS text frontend, resulting in more expressive speech generation [22]. Recent work, AudioPaLM [23] fuses text-based and speech-based language models to inherit the capability to preserve paralinguistic information and intonation from AudioLM [24] and the linguistic knowledge present in text LLMs of PaLM-2 [25]. It outperforms existing systems for speech translation tasks and has the ability to perform zero-shot speech-to-text translation for many languages. We acknowledged that LLMs have the potential to exhibit SLI; however, their capabilities are still in question when it can match the expertise of phonetics specialists or serve as effective language learning assessors. To begin exploring this question, we propose a challenging sub-question: Do LLMs possess adequate Spoken Language Intelligence to perform reasoning questions that require the expertise of human phonetic professionals?</p>
<p>Spoken Language Learning Spoken language learning is the process of acquiring the ability to communicate verbally in a new language. It involves developing skills such as listening, speaking, pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and discourse [26]. Spoken language learning can be accomplished through diverse methods, including formal instruction, self-study, immersion, interaction, and technology. One of the integration of technology into spoken language learning is referred to as CAPT (computer-assisted pronunciation training, a subfield of computer-assisted language training) [27,28]. It mainly involves assessment of pronunciation errors; detection and correction of prosody errors; Most current systems focus on the pronunciation of phonemes. Evaluating prosody has always been a challenging task since precise prosody can only be comprehended by grasping the context, which was beyond the capability of previous models [29]. To help language learners develop their spoken language skills, an open and unconstrained 2 language learning system is necessary, allowing them to freely express themselves. LLMs are poised to make this dream a reality with the ability to evaluate the emotions, prosody, and even rhythm of a sentence in any given context.</p>
<p>Prompting Engineering Prompting provides a natural and intuitive interface for humans to interact with LLMs, allowing users to design and supply tailored prompts to guide LLMs in generating desired responses or completing specific tasks. A typical prompting method is In-Context Learning (ICL) [6], which utilizes natural language text to formulates the task description and/or demonstrations, enabling LLMs to recognize and perform a new task by learning from a few given examples. Furthermore, to further improve ICL, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [30] incorporate a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps into prompts. Instead of simply constructing the prompts with input-output pairs as in ICL, CoT incorporates intermediate reasoning steps that guide the LLM's reasoning process from the input to the final output within the prompts. Once appropriately designed, CoT prompts can effectively stimulate the reasoning skills of LLMs. In fact, using diverse CoTs (i.e., sample multiple reasoning paths for one problem) has been shown to be a direct and effective approach to enhance their performance [31]. What's more, LLMs are not limited to their internal knowledge and can use external tools when needed. Previous research has demonstrated the use of API calls to integrate various tools, such as search engines, calculators, and compilers, improves the performance of LLMs on specific tasks [32,33,34].</p>
<p>Deploying LLMs To apply LLMs to real-life scenarios, additional safeguards should be implemented. Language models may amplify social biases present in their training data, may generate incorrect information [35]. In reality, similar issues have been observed in various language evaluation scenarios, such as native speaker judgments of non-native speakers' speech, which are notoriously biased. This phenomenon is known as reverse linguistic stereotyping, whereby a person's speaking performance is evaluated based on the stereotypes associated with their social identity [36]. Therefore, deploying LLMs in sensitive areas such as education must be approached with great care [37,38]. While LLMs have been tested on large benchmarks, such as MMLU [11] and BIG-bench [39], further studies are necessary to apply them to the domain of spoken language learning.</p>
<p>Contributions This paper investigates the performances, interpretability, and limitations of prompting methods in spoken language question answering. We have collected a composite dataset that includes a set of concepts mainly designed to test the large models' knowledge of spoken language and application questions toward industrial production. We utilized the GPT [8], LLaMA [40,41], FLAN-T5 [42], UL2 [43] and Pythia [44] series for our research, which is conducted in two rounds. We comprehensively review their performance on a large scale and consider two prompting strategies: direct and CoT prompting, under both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. In the second round, we meticulously analyze representative models with advanced optimized methods. The main contributions of this paper are:</p>
<p>• We have introduced a dataset about spoken language intelligence that serves as a substantial benchmark for speech and language learning scenarios, providing valuable supplementation to existing large benchmarks. • We conduct a study on various prompt variations (such as zero-shot, few-shot, direct/CoT, domain-specific sampler, and external tools) and analyze their performance in multiplechoice question form. • We demonstrate that in-domain example sampling techniques can consistently improve performance on domain-specific data. • We conducted an expert evaluation of a small set of multi-turn conversation generated by GPT-3.5 3 . Errors analysis indicates that GPT-3.5 has potential to enhance conversational spoken language learning.</p>
<p>Dataset</p>
<p>Even though benchmarks for general abilities and some professional fields are widely used, there is still a scarcity of evaluation datasets on SLI and SLI for language learning. We introduce a new dataset SLIQ-LL 4 (Spoken Language Intelligence Questions for Language Learning) that covers topics of phonetics, phonology, and second language acquisition, which are frequently addressed in language learning education. The dataset consists of two parts 5 :</p>
<p>• Knowledge &amp; Concept: A set of concepts that are mainly designed to test the large models' knowledge of spoken language, such as "what is language transfer" and "how many classifications of consonants are there for the manner of articulation?" It is mainly sampled from [45]. • Application Questions: To address the ever-changing personalized problems, it is necessary to utilize knowledge of phonetics or linguistics to make complex reasoning. For example, different contexts call for different appropriate stress patterns, which is fundamental to automatic personalized language learning system. We designed this section of data by considering aspects such as pronunciation, pauses, stress, and intonation. An example about pronunciation is shown in the Figure 1.</p>
<p>[] QUESTION</p>
<p>Use this space to write a description sound. This can cause confusion or misunderstanding when they pronounce words like "thin" and "sin", or "think" and "sink".</p>
<p>So the answer is C. Figure 1: Answering a SLIQ-LL Application Question using zero-shot CoT prompting "Let's think step by step" [46]. Selected example.</p>
<p>We collected and designed a total of 445 questions, including 144 Knowledge &amp; Concept and 301 Application Questions. Figure 2 (left) shows the type distribution of Application Questions, with pronunciation accounting for 60% 6 . In the context of language learning, during our initial preparations, we discovered that intermediate-level learners need to focus more on fundamental pronunciation issues, as opposed to suprasegmental features like stress, break, intonation. To present this data, we have formulated multiple-choice questions, each with only one correct answer. We uniformly assigned their answers, and Figure 2 (right) shows the statistics.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>This paper delves into various prompt engineering methods for spoken language question answering, with the aim of gaining a comprehensive understanding of the genuine performance of diverse models. The prompt templates are summarized in Table 1   Therefore, the answer is <answer> Therefore, the answer is <answer> ‹ T P tPronunciation, Stress, Break, Intonationu.</p>
<p>Zero-shot We adopt zero-shot as the benchmark for our experiment. This approach involves simply posing a question and requesting an answer, which is the most straightforward and widely used way to leverage LLMs. However, a foundation model that has not been fine-tuned on any task or instruction fine-tuned, particularly one with a limited parameter size, may not generate meaningful responses to user inputs. Nonetheless, as our test data are presented in the form of multiple-choice questions, which aligns with many LLM benchmarks [11,48,49], this technique is relatively user-friendly and practical [50].</p>
<p>Few-shot We inserted multiple examples in both the task description and the question-answer pairs, each of which is structured as a zero-shot setting. Additionally, the CoT few-shot configuration includes an explanation component for each example.</p>
<p>CoT We have incorporated reasoning chains in the prompts, whereby a "Let's think step by step" prompt is added to the end of the prompt in the zero-shot setting. This is followed by a statement to draw the conclusion: "Therefore, the answer is <completions>". In the few-shot setting, each example is formatted as a zero-shot setting based on the zero-shot baseline and subsequently added.</p>
<p>In Domain exampler When selecting example samples for each question, we match them with more relevant examples based on the type of question. For example, in the Application Question subset, if the current question type is related to pronunciation, then the question type used to construct the current examples will also be related to pronunciation. After all, when you ask for the pronunciation of a word, it's better to provide an example of the pronunciation of another word than an example discussing the intonation and rhythm of a sentence or, far worse, an example of a physics problem involving acceleration. The configuration is based on few-shot CoT.</p>
<p>Self-Consistency CoT prompting offers more options to deduce the answer to a given question, with a primary focus on generating multiple lines of reasoning and striving to find a consensus among the resulting answers (such as selecting the most consistent answer through voting among these paths) [31,51]. Self-consistency can even improve certain tasks where CoT prompting traditionally falls short of standard prompting [31]. [52] discovered that diverse reasoning paths are the critical factor in improving CoT reasoning performance. The integration of this method into CoT prompting can readily enhance performance without requiring additional training. Here we utilize multiple answers generated by CoT to obtain self-consistency results through majority voting.</p>
<p>Tool Augmentation Although LLMs can memorize some of the knowledge ingrained in the training data, they may still struggle to utilize this knowledge efficiently during inference. To enhance the performance of language models, a branch of research such as the exploration of external tools and retrieval of relevant information from a knowledge base has be considered [32,33,34,53,54]. We utilize Google and Wikipedia as external tools to assist in answering the question. We use langchain toolkit 7 to conduct the experiment and this prompt is only tested in the zeor-shot learning setting. Implementation details We conduct our experiment in two rounds. In the first round, we perform a comprehensive performance review on a large scale. We consider two prompting strategies, including the direct and CoT prompting, under both zero-shot and few-shot (3-shot) learning paradigms. In the second round, we carefully analyze representative models with advanced prompt methods. All reasoning is done using the parameters {max_new_tokens: 512, temperature: 0, top_p: 1} to obtain the most deterministic results. We write five develop examples with thought chains for Concept and Aapplications Questions, respectively, and unless specified, few-shot examples are sampled from these five questions. We manually review certain answers that cannot be identified by regular expressions. This process also demonstrates the model's ability to follow instructions.</p>
<p>Results and Analysis</p>
<p>Zero-Shot &amp; Few-Shot Benchmark</p>
<p>We present the full results of the first round in Table 8 in Appendix B. For the convenience of observation, Figure 3 demonstrates the model's ability by showing the best performance among four prompting methods. Overall, models with larger parameter sizes show better overall performance. Despite this, Pythia struggle with generating reasonable responses. The performance of the best prompting strategy is still below the level of random guessing. In contrast, GPT-4 displays exceptional performance with a significant advantage. Surprisingly, Flan-T5 has comparable performance to models with several times their parameter size and the 70B version of LLaMA2 also achieves competitive performance to GPT-3.5. The current best performance of open-source models stands at 61.6%, highlighting the potential for further optimization. To gain a more precise understanding of these models' performance, we conduct a more in-depth analysis of various aspects, as outlined below. 7 https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain 8 The API we used has a suffix of "0613", i.e. GPT-4-0613.</p>
<p>6 random-guessing level  Models with more parameters tend to have better performance and stability in subsets As we examine the two data subsets more closely (as depicted in Figure 4), we can draw a similar conclusion as the above. Notably, regarding Knowledge &amp; Concept, models with a parameter size exceeding 20B display reduced performance variation, signifying heightened stability in their performance.</p>
<p>LLM excels in concept memorization but has weaker ability in applying knowledge for reasoning Even on a relatively small model (7B), the accuracy of concept memorization can reach nearly 80%, and a model with a size of around 11B can achieve the level of GPT-3.5. At around 20B, LLMs reach performance saturation in Knowledge &amp; Concepts. However, for reasoning Application Questions, even the most powerful LLaMA2 models with sizes of 70B and the GPT series models still perform relatively low accuracy (42.6%, 64.3%).</p>
<p>Knowledge preference We analyse whether these models exhibit any specific preferences for certain types of knowledge. Figure 5 demonstrates that these models display no significant differences in accuracy among different types of questions. Furthermore, their performance on the question type break is near to random guessing.</p>
<p>Answer Bias We selected several models and conducted corresponding distribution analysis of generated answers in Table 2. It can be observed that, apart from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the other models exhibit apparent answer bias.  Averaged using t0, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30u shots and 1 " 9 shots CoT results. Part of the experimental data (i.e., CoT) comes from Section 5.2.</p>
<p>Advanced Prompt Analysis</p>
<p>In our large-scale experiment, we have utilized an empirical value of k " 3 as the number of shots and have designed them for two subsets. In this section, we are exploring additional possibilities.</p>
<p>Few-shots &amp; CoT</p>
<p>In Figure 6, we present the results of direct few-shot and CoT few-shot using different numbers of examples. Based on the results, we can see that: Increasing the number of examples can improve performance to a limited extent; Increasing the examples of the reasoning chain will have a more significant and stable effect on models above 70B (LLaMA2-chat, GPT-4). However, for smaller models, these prompts may already exceed their capabilities, resulting in degradation of performance.</p>
<p>In-Domain Prompt v.s. Out Of Domain Prompt We used prompts from different domains for two models capable of responding to CoT. In most cases, most examples are not carefully selected or designed. We used domain-specific prompts for different types of questions. In Figure 7, our approach has shown significant advantages compared to more common examples. In the process of increasing examples, the model not only learned how to answer multiple-choice questions, but also gained some insights.</p>
<p>Self-Consistency</p>
<p>Although the solution to these phonological problems does not have as many reasoning paths as mathematical reasoning questions, we found that self-consistency can improve performance on the GPT-3.5 model (as shown in Table 3). However, for LLaMA2-70b-chat, its  Augmented Language Models On the internet, individuals actively share their language learning experiences. By effectively using this external knowledge, LLMs can improve credibility and mitigate hallucination issues. We provided two tools for use by GPT-3.5, but did not get better results (Table 4). One piece of good news is that models using the tools can recognize their limitations and refuse to answer questions they are uncertain about, although this ability still seems relatively limited (Table 5).  </p>
<p>Expert evaluation of the Chat interface</p>
<p>Compared to single-turn Q&amp;A, people prefer interacting through dialogue interfaces. Here, we conducted a more challenging evaluation in the context of language learning, specifically CAPT. We sampled 20 sentences from Chinese English learners' speech with an average score ranging from 0 to 100. The mispronunciation, context, and prosodic information of each sentence were included. We organized this information as input for a chat model, and then engaged in discussions about improving pronunciation based on this information. This evaluation is designed to assess the ability of the model to analyze and reason a given question using knowledge acquired through phonetics and second language acquisition in a longer contextualized setting. In Appendix D, we present examples and the evaluation methodology. We evaluate the model's answers from the following perspectives.</p>
<p>RATING-A:</p>
<p>The response is both valid and satisfactory, and is relevant to the evaluation prompt. RATING-B: The response is acceptable, but with minor errors or imperfections.</p>
<p>RATING-C: Although the response is relevant and addresses the instruction, it contains significant errors in its content. RATING-D: The response is either irrelevant to the evaluation prompt or entirely invalid for current topic.</p>
<p>In Table 6, we report the results of expert evaluation. GPT-3.5 achieves high performance and reliability. If we consider rating A and B as acceptable responses, its accuracy reaches 83.4%, which is nearly identical to its performance on SLIQ-LL. In contrast, despite using relatively fixed prompts, this still posed a challenge for promising model LLaMA2-70B-chat, it only achieved acceptable performance in 54% of cases.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>In this paper, we conducted several experiments based on prompt engineering. Our designed extraction of conceptual knowledge posed little challenge for these LLMs. However, the models  encountered some difficulties when using this knowledge for inference. For some small models, due to excellent instruction fine-tuning, their responses were almost always valid (meaning they could generate responses similar to "So the answer is A"). The more valid responses, the more likely the correct answers were. However, for many small or even relatively large models, their performance on the application datasets was worse than random guessing (see Appendix B). This was largely because they could not generate valid outputs following instructions. Therefore, we declare that results we reported are actually a comprehensive reflection of both SLI and the models' ability to follow instructions (which is why we reported the best results of the models in different prompt modes in Figure 3). Some widely proven effective methods combined with the domain-specific examples we designed resulted in significant performance improvements for the models (GPT-3.5, 49.1% -&gt; 63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% -&gt; 48.6%). However, these performance improvements were limited to larger models. In most cases, appending more examples in direct and CoT scenarios did not seem to yield stable performance improvements. Given that the number of consumed tokens is increasing, we consider 3 " 5 shots a reasonable choice.</p>
<p>We conduct an investigation using external tools. GPT-3.5, after leveraging knowledge from Google and Wikipedia, successfully achieves performance comparable to zeroshot. This outcome suggests that these questions are not easily resolved through internet searches. A reliable alternative approach is to establish a dedicated knowledge repository as an additional source of information.</p>
<p>During our evaluation in dialogue mode, we have observed that GPT-3.5 demonstrates a high level of usability. It maintains a strong focus on the subject and content of the conversation, showing minimal tendency to veer off-topic as the dialogue progresses (see Sample 13). Its reasoning abilities remain consistent, comparable to its performance in single-turn tests. In contrast, LLaMA2-70b-chat often becomes perplexed by its own generated responses, digressing into self-referential narratives and forgetting to prioritize the user's input (see Sample 15). The interactive nature of dialogue-based language interaction continues to be a captivating approach, especially in the field of language learning, consistently attracting the interest of researchers and developers in the industry.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We explored zero-shot, few-shot, direct, and CoT prompts to phonology-related questions answering. These models all have strong conceptual knowledge and can achieve high accuracy with simple zeroshot and few-shot learning. For practical questions reasoning, we achieved significant performance improvements compared to the zero-shot baseline(GPT-3.5, 49.1% -&gt; 63.1%; LLaMA2-70B-Chat, 42.2% -&gt; 48.6%). However, the strongest GPT-4 achieved 77.4% accuracy. This means there is significant room for improvement in their performance in real-world scenarios. These performances highlight the impressive Spoken Language Intelligence exhibited by LLMs, and Chatbots based on large language models possess significant potential to enhance conversational spoken language learning.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>As described in the introduction 1, it is important to conduct multimodal evaluation for SLI. However, the evaluation of LLMs presented in this paper only utilizes textual data and does not investigate the performance of multimodal models, including those based on speech or images. [56] constructed a benchmark dataset to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM). However, the evaluation benchmark, particularly for the speech modality, is still quite limited. In theory, the measurement of SLI should place greater emphasis on acoustic features. For instance, when presented with a speech segment from a conversation, it is important to determine if a LLM equipped with speech input can accurately identify which vowel is being spoken at any given moment, along with associated parameters such as the sampling rate, duration, F1, F2, and other relevant downstream information. To differentiate from ASR, prompts like "Is this a high or low vowel?", "Is there background piano music?" or "How many speakers are present?" might be utilized.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in language learning settings, it is important to consider performance in multilingual scenarios. For instance, Chinese English learners may prefer feedback presented in their native language rather than English. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention to such factors and cater to the needs of learners to ensure effective language acquisition.</p>
<p>A Statistics of LLMs we used Table 7: Statistics of large language models used in this work, including the capacity evaluation, pre-training data scale (either in the number of tokens or storage size) and hardware resource costs. The term "Adaptation" refers to whether the model has been with subsequent fine-tuning: IT denotes instruction tuning and RLHF denotes reinforcement learning with human feedback. "Evaluation" indicates whether the model has been evaluated with corresponding abilities in their original paper: ICL representing in-context learning and CoT representing chain-of-thought. Most of the model checkpoints can be publicly accessible while except GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. GPT-3.5 is an upgraded version of GPT-3 with RLHF and GPT-3.5-turbo belongs GPT-3.5 series, which is the interface to invoke Chat-GPT. Mar-2023

<p>B Summary of the results</p>
<p>In Table 8, We are presenting the results of large-scale evaluation using the SLIQ-LL dataset. We are using horizontal lines to categorize the different model types based on their size and base model. We report the zero-shot, few-shot(k " 3), and CoT results of these models, and separately providing the results for the subset. The performance gap between this experiment and the zero-shot experiment is represented by ∆. Some marks are utilized to signify that the model's evaluation has failed for different reasons, leading to subpar performance. Mark #1 represents that he achieved the best performance among models of the same level. ; The response repeats prompts question without providing new information.</p>
<p>C Self-Consistency CoT Samples</p>
<p>Allowing the model to utilize different reasoning paths is actually a more comprehensive evaluation method, as it reflects the sampling of answers generated by the model for the given problem. If many paths are incorrect, it indicates that the model is unlikely to perform correct reasoning for the problem. We conduct a thorough analysis of the samples in the self-consistency experiment. Similar to [15], we considered three general skills that we expect are required to be mastered to answer phonological questions: (i) performing non-trivial reasoning steps, (ii) recalling knowledge that is not provided in the context and (iii) the ability to comprehend the question and the context. Based on the three skills, three success patterns (A, B, C) and three failure patterns (D, E, F) are defined.</p>
<p>• Table 9 illustrates how GPT-3.5 recover from occasional errors by utilizing various chains of reasoning.</p>
<p>• Table 10 highlights that LLaMA2 is unable to perform correct reasoning due to the generation of excessive erroneous paths.</p>
<p>D CAPT examples and Promt templates for Chat Interface</p>
<p>In Table 11, we present a complete dialogue flow. Firstly, we give the model a system prompt where the data structure of the CAPT results is explained. Then, the example is input as the current object of analysis and a series of questions are posed. We present a multi-turn conversaion example of GPT-3.5 in Table 13, an example of LLaMA2-70B-chat in Table 14 and a failed example of LLaMA2-70B-chat in Table 15. The annotated ranking label for each response is indicated before the answer.</p>
<p>Additional information about the CAPT data The age range of the speakers is between 15 and 30 years old, and the length of the reference text is between 5 and 15 words. We use the Kaldi toolkit [60] to obtain the GOP [61] score as the phoneme score through forced alignment. The word score is obtained by averaging the phoneme scores. The ASR system used is Whisper [62] Large, and fluency, liaison, break, stress, intonation, and other information are annotated by human experts.

<p>What is a reasonable way to use filled pauses among the following sentences? A) "Emm let me think" B) Well I er think that um the movie was uh very good C) Uh my name is er Li and I am from um Beijing D) Um I uh like er reading books ✓ Let's think step by step.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Filled pauses, such as "um," "uh," "er," are natural and common in spoken language. they are often used when the speaker is pausing to gather their thoughts or to indicate hesitation. At the options given, all of them contain filled pauses. however, it is important to use them in a way that sounds natural in speech. option a: "emmm let me think" -this is an acceptable use of a filled pause before the statement. option b: "well i er think that um the movie was uh very good" -this contains multiple filled pauses in a row, which may sound unnatural. it would be better to use just one or two filled pauses in this sentence. option c: "uh my name is er li and i am from um beijing" -this sentence also contains multiple filled pauses in a row. it would be better to use just one or two filled pauses in this sentence as well. option d: "um i uh like er reading books" -this sentence contains multiple filled pauses in a row. it would be better to use just one or two filled pauses in this sentence. Based on this analysis, option a is the most naturally sounding use of filled pauses. So the answer is A.</p>
<p>✗ Let's think step by step.</p>
<p>Filled pauses, such as "uh," "um," "er," or "well," are often used in speech as hesitation devices or to fill in gaps while the speaker is thinking or searching for words. Among the given sentences, the most reasonable use of filled pauses would be in sentence b. "well i er think that um the movie was uh very good. In this sentence, the filled pauses are used naturally to indicate hesitation or to fill in gaps while the speaker is expressing their thoughts about the movie. The other sentences do not naturally require the use of filled pauses or have excessive use of them, making them less appropriate in a typical conversation. So the answer is B. well i er think that um the movie was uh very good.</p>
<p>✓ Let's think step by step.</p>
<p>Filled pauses, such as "um," "uh," "er," and "uhm," are often used in speech to fill gaps or pauses when the speaker is thinking or hesitant. filled pauses can also convey uncertainty, lack of fluency, or a need for additional time to gather thoughts. Looking at the given sentences: a. "emm let me think" -this sentence does not contain any filled pauses. b. "well i er think that um the movie was uh very good" -this sentence uses filled pauses appropriately. the filled pauses ("er," "um," and "uh") indicate hesitancy or a need for additional time to express thoughts. c. "uh my name is er li and i am from um beijing" -this sentence also uses filled pauses appropriately. the filled pauses ("uh," "er," and "um") convey hesitancy or a need for additional time to convey information. d. "um i uh like er reading books" -this sentence uses filled pauses appropriately. the filled pauses ("um," "uh," and "er") indicate hesitancy or a need for additional time to express thoughts. Therefore, all the sentences except for a. demonstrate appropriate use of filled pauses. So the answer is A.  : His uncle sent him to school. If you read this sentence with school on the high tone, followed by a sharp fall, what is implied? A) his uncle did not send him away from school to work at home or anywhere else -on the contrary, he sent him to school B) he was sent to school, not to any other institution. C) his uncle did send him to school -no doubt about that; D) I was sent to school by his uncle, not his brother or sister;</p>
<p>✗ Let's think step by step.</p>
<p>The correct answer is C. his uncle did send him to schoolno doubt about that. When the wordschoolïs stressed and followed by a sharp fall in tone, it implies that the speaker is emphasizing that the person was indeed sent to school, and that there is no question or doubt about it. This tone can be used to convey a sense of certainty or confidence in the statement being made. The other options do not accurately convey the meaning of the sentence with the given intonation pattern: A. his uncle did not send him away from school to work at home or anywhere else -on the contrary, he sent him to school; -This option implies a contrast between going to school and staying at home or working elsewhere, which is not implied by the given sentence. B. he was sent to school, not to any other institution. -This option implies that the person was sent to school instead of some other institution, which is not implied by the given sentence. D. I was sent to school by his uncle, not his brother or sister; -This option implies that the speaker is distinguishing between being sent to school by their uncle versus being sent by their brother or sister, which is not implied by the given sentence So the answer is C.</p>
<p>✗ Let's think step by step.</p>
<p>The correct answer is C. his uncle did send him to schoolno doubt about that. When the sentenceḦis uncle sent him to schoolïs read with the word schoolön a high tone followed by a sharp fall, it implies that the speaker is emphasizing the fact that the person was sent to school by their uncle, and that there is no doubt or question about it. The falling tone after the high tone suggests a sense of certainty or finality, indicating that the matter is settled and there is no need for further discussion. The other options do not accurately convey the same meaning. Option A suggests that the person was sent to school instead of being sent away from school, which is not necessarily implied by the sentence. Option B simply states that the person was sent to school, without emphasizing the fact that it was the uncle who sent them. Option D suggests that the speaker is clarifying who sent them to school, which is not necessarily implied by the sentence. So the answer is C.</p>
<p>✓ Let's think step by step.</p>
<p>The correct answer is B. he was sent to school, not to any other institution. When the wordschoolïs stressed with a high tone followed by a sharp fall, it implies that the speaker is emphasizing that the person was sent to school and not to any other institution or place.</p>
<p>The stress onschooldraws attention to the specific location where the person was sent, implying that it was a deliberate choice made by the uncle. The other options do not convey the same meaning. Option A implies that the person was sent to school but also implies that there was a possibility of being sent elsewhere. Option C simply states that the person was sent to school without any additional emphasis or implication. Option D implies that the person was sent to school by the uncle, but also implies that there may have been other people involved in the decision. So the answer is B.  </p>

<p>[RATING-B] GPT3.5-turbo: to improve the pronunciation, here are some specific suggestions for the mispronounced words: -"month": the /T/ sound in "month" should be pronounced as a voiceless "th" sound, like in "think" or "thought," rather than a voiced "th" sound like in "this" or "that." -"anything": the vowel sound in "anything" should be /I/ as in "sit" or "bit," instead of /@/ as in "about" or "above." additionally, pay attention to the stress patterns in the sentence. emphasize the stressed syllables or words, such as "month" and "found," to help convey the meaning effectively. practice these corrections by listening to native speakers, repeating the words and sentences aloud, and using resources like online pronunciation guides or language-learning apps. regular practice and feedback will help you improve your pronunciation and sound more natural in your spoken english. User: please tell me whether the grammar is correct, fluent and standard.</p>
<p>[RATING-A] GPT3.5-turbo: based on the given sentence "he did this every day for a month, but he never found anything," the grammar is correct, fluent, and standard. the sentence follows standard english grammar rules and is structurally sound. the tenses are used appropriately, and there are no noticeable grammar errors or inconsistencies. the sentence flows smoothly and naturally, conveying the intended meaning effectively. overall, the grammar in the sentence is accurate, fluent, and in line with standard english usage. User: Please provide an example to correct my mistake.</p>
<p>[RATING-B] GPT3.5-turbo: certainly! here's an example to further illustrate the correct grammar, fluency, and standard usage: original sentence: "he did this every day for a month, but he never found anything." explanation: in this sentence, the subject "he" is followed by the past tense verb "did," indicating an action that occurred in the past. the adverb "every day" describes the frequency of the action. the preposition "for" is used to indicate the duration of time, followed by the noun phrase "a month." the coordinating conjunction "but" connects the two independent clauses in the sentence. the verb "found" is in the past tense, and the pronoun "anything" functions as the object of the verb. example: "she studied english diligently for a year, but she never achieved fluency." explanation: in this example, the subject "she" is followed by the past tense verb "studied," indicating a past action. the adverb "diligently" describes how she studied. the preposition "for" is used to indicate the duration of time, followed by the noun phrase "a year." the coordinating conjunction "but" connects the two independent clauses. the verb "achieved" is in the past tense, and the noun "fluency" functions as the object of the verb. in both the original sentence and the example, the grammar is correct, the sentence flows smoothly, and the usage is standard in english.

User: Please provide two examples to correct my mistake.</p>
<p>[RATING-B] GPT3.5-turbo: certainly! here are two examples to further illustrate effective, positive, and polite communication: example 1: original: "your pronunciation needs improvement. it's not good enough." effective, positive, and polite: "your pronunciation is clear, and with a little more practice, you can make it even better." explanation: in the original statement, the feedback is direct and critical. however, in the effective, positive, and polite version, the focus is on acknowledging the existing strengths "your pronunciation is clear" and offering encouragement for improvement "with a little more practice, you can make it even better". this approach maintains a positive and supportive tone while still addressing the need for improvement. example 2: original: "your grammar is wrong. you made several mistakes." effective, positive, and polite: "your grammar is generally accurate. a few minor adjustments will help you further enhance your language skills." explanation: the original statement is direct and highlights the mistakes without offering any positive feedback. in the effective, positive, and polite version, the focus is on acknowledging the overall accuracy of the grammar "your grammar is generally accurate" and offering constructive feedback "a few minor adjustments will help you further enhance your language skills. this approach encourages improvement while maintaining a positive and supportive tone. in both examples, the effective, positive, and polite communication approach emphasizes the existing strengths, provides specific areas for improvement, and offers encouragement and support to the learner.  11. please tell me whether the intonation conforms to the rules and habits of English pronunciation and expression.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>[RATING-C] LLaMa2-70B-chat: The intonation of the sentence does not conform to the rules and habits of English pronunciation and expression. In English, the intonation of a sentence typically follows a pattern of rising and falling pitch. The sentence "He did this every day for a month but he never found anything" should have a rising intonation on the phrase "He did this every day for a month" and a falling intonation on the phrase "but he never found anything". However, in the given sentence, the intonation is rising on both phrases, which is not typical in English. Additionally, the rise in pitch on the first phrase is quite steep, which may give the impression that the speaker is asking a question or expressing surprise, rather than making a statement. Furthermore, the falling intonation on the second phrase is not very pronounced, which may make the sentence sound less emphatic or conclusive than it should be. To improve the intonation, the speaker could try to make the rising intonation on the first phrase less steep and more gradual, and to emphasize the falling intonation on the second phrase more, to make the sentence sound more natural and emphatic. User: please tell me whether the pronunciation is clear, accurate and natural.</p>
<p>[RATING-B] LLaMa2-70B-chat: I'm happy to help! Here's my evaluation of the pronunciation in the sentence you provided: * The pronunciation of "He did this every day for a month" is generally clear and accurate. The speaker's production of the individual sounds and syllables is good, and the words are well-articulated. * However, there are a few aspects of the pronunciation that could be improved upon: + The vowel sound in "month" is pronounced a bit too open, almost like "mownth" instead of "month". To improve this, the speaker could try to make the vowel sound a bit more closed, like "muh-nth". + The consonant sound in "but" is pronounced a bit too voiced, almost like "buh-ut" instead of "but". To improve this, the speaker could try to make the consonant sound more voiceless, like "bat". + The stress on the sentence is generally good, but the speaker could try to put a bit more emphasis on the word "month" to make the sentence sound more natural. * The pronunciation of "but he never found anything" is generally natural and well-pronounced. The speaker's production of the individual sounds and syllables is good, and the words are well-articulated. * The intonation of the sentence is generally rising, which is appropriate for a sentence that is asking a question. However, the rise in pitch could be a bit more gradual, especially on the first phrase "He did this every day for a month". Overall, the pronunciation in the sentence you provided is generally clear and accurate, but there are a few aspects that could be improved upon to make it sound more natural and polished. User: Please tell me how to pronounce it correctly.</p>
<p>[RATING-B] LLaMa2-70B-chat: Sure, I'd be happy to help! The word "month" can be a bit tricky to pronounce for non-native speakers, but here's how to do it correctly: 1. Start by saying the letter "m" as in "map" or "mat". Make sure your lips are together and your tongue is touching the roof of your mouth just behind your front teeth. 2. Next, move on to the "o" sound. For this sound, your tongue should be in the same position as it was for the "m" sound, but you should round your lips a bit more. Try to make your mouth shape like a small "o" shape. 3. Now, say the letter "n" as in "sing" or "sink". Your tongue should move back a bit from the roof of your mouth, and your lips should be relaxed. 4. Finally, say the letter "th" as in "this" or "thin". For this sound, your tongue should be between your teeth, and your lips should be relaxed. Putting it all together, "month" should sound like "muh-nth". Make sure to pay attention to the stress on the first syllable (muh) and the slight dip in pitch on the second syllable (nth). Here's a breakdown of the phonetic transcription of "month": /m/ (the letter "m" as in "map") /u/ (the letter "o" as in "hot") /n/ (the letter "n" as in "sing") /T/ (the letter "th" as in "this") I hope this helps! Remember to practice saying "month" a few times to get a feel for the correct pronunciation. Good luck! User: please tell me whether the grammar is correct, fluent and standard.</p>
<p>[RATING-A] LLaMa2-70B-chat: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my evaluation of the grammar, fluency, and standardness of the sentence you provided: Grammar: * The sentence is grammatically correct. It has a clear subject-verb-object structure, with "He" as the subject, "did" as the verb, and "this" as the object. * The use of the present tense "does" is appropriate for a general truth or a habitual action. * The sentence does not contain any grammatical errors, such as subject-verb agreement issues or incorrect word order. Fluency: * The sentence flows well and is easy to understand. * The use of the present tense "does" helps to convey a sense of routine or habit, which is appropriate for a sentence about something that happens every day. * The sentence is concise and to the point, without any unnecessary words or phrases that might disrupt the flow. Standardness: * The sentence uses standard English vocabulary and grammar. * The sentence does not contain any nonstandard or regional dialect features that might make it difficult to understand for native English speakers. * The sentence is written in a neutral style, without any overly formal or informal language that might make it sound out of place in different contexts. Overall, the sentence you provided is grammatically correct, fluent, and standard. It effectively conveys a simple statement about a person's daily routine in a clear and concise way. User: Please provide an example to correct my mistake.</p>
<p>[RATING-A] LLaMa2-70B-chat: Sure, here's an example to illustrate the difference between a grammatically correct sentence and a grammatically correct sentence that also sounds natural and fluent:Grammatically correct sentence:"The dog chased the cat, but it got away."This sentence is grammatically correct because it follows the rules of English grammar. It has a subject (the dog), a verb (chased), an object (the cat), and a sentence structure (SVO) that is commonly used in English.However, this sentence may not sound very natural or fluent to native English speakers, especially in informal contexts. Here's why:<em> The sentence is quite formal, and the use of "but" to connect the two clauses can sound a bit stilted in everyday conversation.</em> The verb tense is inconsistent. The sentence starts in the past tense ("the dog chased") but then switches to the present tense ("it got away"). This can make the sentence sound a bit disjointed.Now, here's a revised version of the sentence that is both grammatically correct and sounds more natural and fluent:Revised sentence:"The dog chased the cat, but it managed to escape."In this revised sentence, we've kept the basic structure of the sentence the same (SVO), but we've made a few changes to make it sound more natural and fluent:<em> We've replaced "but" with "but it managed to escape," which is a more common way to connect two clauses in informal speech.</em> We've changed the verb tense to be consistent throughout the sentence. Both clauses are now in the past tense, which makes the sentence sound more cohesive.This revised sentence still conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, but it sounds more natural and fluent, and could easily be used in everyday conversation. User: please tell me whether the communication is effective, positive and polite.</p>
<p>[RATING-C] LLaMa2-70B-chat: The communication in the revised sentence is effective, positive, and polite. Effective: The revised sentence effectively conveys the intended meaning of the original sentence while also addressing the issues of formality and verb tense consistency.Positive: The revised sentence uses positive language and avoids any negative or critical tone. It focuses on the action of the dog chasing the cat, rather than the cat's ability to escape.Polite: The revised sentence is polite and respectful in tone, using phrases such as "managed to escape" instead of "got away." It also avoids any harsh or abrupt language, making it suitable for use in a professional or formal setting." User: Please provide two examples to correct my mistake.</p>
<p>[RATING-A] LLaMa2-70B-chat: Sure, here are two examples to help illustrate the difference between a grammatically correct sentence and a grammatically correct sentence that also sounds natural and fluent:Example 1:Grammatically correct sentence:"The employee worked diligently for 10 hours, completing numerous tasks and exceeding expectations."Natural and fluent sentence:"The employee put in a solid 10 hours of work, knocking out task after task and exceeding expectations left and right."In this example, the first sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds a bit stilted and formal. The second sentence, on the other hand, uses more informal language and a more natural sentence structure, making it sound more like the way a native English speaker would actually speak.Example 2:Grammatically correct sentence:"The company will initiate a new marketing campaign next quarter, utilizing various digital platforms and strategies."Natural and fluent sentence:"Next quarter, the company's launching a fresh marketing push, leveraging social media, email, and other digital channels to get the word out."In this example, the first sentence is grammatically correct, but it sounds a bit formal and jargony. The second sentence, on the other hand, uses more natural language and a more conversational tone, making it sound more like the way a native English speaker would actually speak.I hope these examples help illustrate the difference between a grammatically correct sentence and a grammatically correct sentence that also sounds natural and fluent.

<p>The sounds [ ] and [s] are both voiceless fricatives, which means they are produced by creating a narrow passage of air through the mouth and making a hissing noise. However, they differ in their place of articulation, which is the location where the airflow is obstructed. The sound [ ] is a dental fricative, which means it is produced by placing the tip of the tongue between the upper and lower teeth. The sound [s] is an alveolar fricative, which means it is produced by placing the tip of the tongue behind the upper teeth, near the alveolar ridge. Some speakers of other languages, such as Spanish or Mandarin, may not have the sound [ ] in their native language and may substitute it with [s] or another similarWhich type of pronunciation issue does it fall under 
when [ ] and [s] are pronounced in an indistinguishable manner? 
A) You do not differentiate between fricatives and affricates. 
B) You do not differentiate between voiceless and voiced consonants. 
C) You do not differentiate between dental and alveolar places of articulation. 
D) You do not differentiate between stops and continuants. </p>

<p>https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ 2 The content for pronunciation training does not need to be pre-set. Users are free to choose and switch between topics at their leisure. What we are discussing here is not the ethical problem and bias of LLMs.
Unless otherwise specified, the results mentioned in this paper regarding GPT-3.5 are based on the GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 model.4 Available in Github:https://github.com/vocaliodmiku/SLI-LL
Some concepts that are crucial for application are placed in the Application Questions subset rather than in the Knowledge &amp; Concept subset. They are usually of lower difficulty in the Knowledge &amp; Concept subset.6 A few decades ago Gimson and Ramsaran[47] considered that achievement in acquiring a language comprised nearly 100% understanding of its pronunciation, 50 " 90% of its grammar, and only 1% of its vocabulary.

However, in the given sentence, the intonation pattern is flat, with no clear rise or fall in pitch. Additionally, the sentence does not have a clear stress pattern, which is also a characteristic of English pronunciation and expression. In a declarative sentence like "B is for bounce", the stress would typically fall on the most important word, which in this case would be "bounce". However, the given sentence does not have a clear stress pattern, with the pitch remaining relatively flat throughout.
