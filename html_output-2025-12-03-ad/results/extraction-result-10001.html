                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Air Pollution as an Environmental Risk Factor for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a leading cause of morbidity in our aging populations. Although influenced by genetic factors, fewer than 5% of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia cases are due solely to genetic causes. There is growing scientific consensus that these dementias arise from complex gene by environment interactions. The 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care identified 12 modifiable risk factors of dementia, including lifestyle, educational background, comorbidities, and environmental exposures to environmental contaminants. In this review, we summarize the current understanding and data gaps regarding the role(s) of environmental pollutants in the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias with a focus on air pollution. In addition to summarizing findings from epidemiological and experimental animal studies that link airborne exposures to environmental contaminants to increased risk and/or severity of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, we discuss currently hypothesized mechanism(s) underlying these associations, including peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation and epigenetic changes. Key data gaps in this rapidly expanding investigative field and approaches for addressing these gaps are also addressed.</p>

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are a leading cause of morbidity in our aging populations.Although influenced by genetic factors, fewer than 5% of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia cases are due solely to genetic causes.There is growing scientific consensus that these dementias arise from complex gene by environment interactions.The 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care identified 12 modifiable risk factors of dementia, including lifestyle, educational background, comorbidities, and environmental exposures to environmental contaminants.In this review, we summarize the current understanding and data gaps regarding the role(s) of environmental pollutants in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias with a focus on air pollution.In addition to summarizing findings from epidemiological and experimental animal studies that link airborne exposures to environmental contaminants to increased risk and/or severity of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, we discuss currently hypothesized mechanism(s) underlying these associations, including peripheral inflammation, neuroinflammation and epigenetic changes.Key data gaps in this rapidly expanding investigative field and approaches for addressing these gaps are also addressed.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (ADRD) are global public health concerns.The worldwide prevalence of ADRD is projected to rise from 57.4 million affected individuals in 2019 to 152.8 million by 2050 1 .Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are the most prevalent type of progressive neurodegenerative disease that is pathologically characterized by amyloid beta plaques (Aβ), phosphorylated neurofibrillary tau tangles (NFT), and persistent neuroinflammation [2][3][4][5] .Clinical studies have identified that AD pathology develops years and often decades prior to the onset of AD symptoms 6,7 .</p>
<p>Mild cognitive impairment is a transitional phase of cognitive decline that progresses to dementia in approximately 30% of cases 8,9 .Currently, there are no definitive preventative or therapeutic interventions that effectively mitigate AD and ADRD risks or that prevent or reverse cognitive impairment.Given the increasing awareness that much of AD/ ADRD, particularly late-onset forms, arises from complex gene × environmental (G × E) interactions, significant research effort is being devoted to identifying environmental risk factors for AD/ADRD and understanding how they modify disease risk and/or severity [10][11][12] .This is because currently it is much easier to modify our environment than our genes.</p>
<p>HETEROGENEITY OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND RELATED DEMENTIAS</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease was initially described as a presenile dementia occurring in individuals between 45 and 65 years old, but in 1977 it was determined that the neuropathological findings of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are the hallmark pathologies of AD were very similar in AD of early-and late-onset.However, it became increasingly recognized that with aging, late-onset AD brains frequently exhibited additional neuropathological findings, and these became categorized as ADRD.Before discussing environmental and genetic risk factors that contribute to AD and ADRD, it is important to explain terminologies used in this field.</p>
<p>Dementia describes a range of neurological conditions causing progressive deterioration of cognition and can be accompanied by additional neurological dysfunction.Alzheimer's disease and related dementias are distinguished from other dementing illness by clinical assessment, neuroradiology, neuropathology, and biomarkers.Clinical assessment based on neurological and cognitive functional testing is least sensitive and least accurate at early stages of AD, and clinical confirmation utilizes other diagnostic tools including brain imaging modalities and blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid biomarker testing for amyloid and phosphorylated tau isoforms 13 .The current evolution of increasingly selective and sensitive biomarkers for AD is necessary to accurately distinguish AD from other dementias and to evaluate treatments for AD/ADRD whose pathology develops decades before clinical symptomatology 14 .Biomarker selectivity that distinguish between the different types of dementias will greatly assist with the identification of genetic and other specific risk factors, but currently consensus has not been reached on future AD/ADRD classifications.For this review, we are summarizing prior literature based on current AD/ADRD classifications and guidelines.</p>
<p>In the current U.S. National plan to address AD, ADRD includes frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia, and mixed dementias (including cerebrovascular disease or Lewy bodies) 15 .Each of these dementias share progressive neuronal loss, cognitive and behavioral decline, impaired daily function, and aberrant protein accumulation (e.g., Aβ, tau, or α-synuclein) 16,17 .The heterogeneity of AD/ADRD complicates the task of identifying the interplay between specific genetic and environmental risk factors.While it has been easier to include ADRDs with AD when identifying environmental risk factors, it is acknowledged that this inclusive categorization increases the likelihood of "masking" specific G × E interactions that drive individual risk for specific forms of AD/ADRD.</p>
<p>GENE BY ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION IN ALZHEIMER's DISEASE AND RELATED DEMENTIAS ETIOLOGY</p>
<p>Twin studies have provided further evidence in support of the contribution of environmental factors to AD/ADRD etiology 27,28 .Specifically, genetically identical monozygotic twins have been compared to explore the effects of non-shared environmental risk factors.In one twin study, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify tau deposition in the entorhinal cortex and neocortical brain regions, revealed similar intensity and deposition of tau pathology 27 , suggesting that genetics was the predominant driver.However, when non-shared environmental risk factors were compared in twin pairs, differences in tau deposition strongly correlated with differences in depressive behaviors, social isolation, and physical inactivity 27 .Similarly, another study of monozygotic twins found that individuals exposed to higher levels of air pollution had lower structural integrity of the locus coeruleus, which is a brain region involved in the early stages of AD 28 .These results suggest that while similarities in the development of AD-relevant pathologies between monozygotic twin pairs may be explained by identical genetic composition, different trajectories of ADRD pathologies may arise from exposure to non-shared environmental factors.In a different study, analysis of the AD polygenic risk score in monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggested that total genetic contribution to AD risk accounted for 71%, while the remaining 29% was attributed to environmental factors 29 .This finding can help explain cases of discordant development of ADRD pathologies in monozygotic twins despite their genetic uniformity 30 and highlights the importance of identifying and studying the impact of environmental risk factors that can modify ADRD outcomes (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Environmental risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias</p>
<p>The 2020 Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care identified 12 modifiable environmental AD/ADRD risk factors based on meta-analyses and systemic reviews of the available literature 12 .The report highlighted that these 12 modifiable risk factors contributed to 40% of global prevalence of dementia, suggesting that 40% of dementia cases worldwide might potentially be prevented or slowed by modifying individual exposures 12 .The risk factors identified by the Lancet Commission included various comorbid medical conditions (hypertension, diabetes, hearing impairment, obesity, depression, and traumatic brain injury), lifestyles (physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, social isolation, smoking), less educational background, and exposure to air pollution.Medical and public health strategies targeting comorbidity or lifestyles heavily depend on individual motivation, and these applications have been limited in success at the population level 31 .Many of these factors are strongly influenced by environmental contaminants, and environmental exposures represent a class of risk factors that can be changed by public policy, and thus have population-level impacts 31 .</p>
<p>The contribution of environmental contaminants to the development of neurodegenerative diseases has been primarily studied in the context of occupational exposure to pesticides among agricultural workers. 32Individuals occupationally exposed to pesticides, such as organophosphate insecticides [33][34][35] and fungicides that contain manganese 36- 38 , were reported to have lower cognitive function and increased risk of developing and NO x 52,75,[94][95][96][97][98][99] ; and a small number of studies found a positive association between O 3 level and risk of dementia 58,82,93 .</p>
<p>When records of dementia diagnoses are more specifically stratified, differential correlations between various types of air pollutants and subtypes of dementia emerge.In an analysis of data from the UK Biobank, authors reported that exposure to combined levels of NO x , PM 2.5 , and PM 10 were significantly associated with all-cause dementia, AD, vascular dementia (VaD), and mild cognitive impairment.Yet, when each air pollutant was compared separately, VaD was no longer associated with PM 2.5,10 but only influenced by NO x , while all-cause dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment remained significantly associated with both PM 2.5,10, and NO x 83 .Another study leveraging the UK Biobank data found similar associations of PM 2.5,10 , and NO x with all-cause dementia and AD but not with VaD 66 .In line with these findings, other studies reported the association of PM 2.5 to be more pronounced with AD than with non-AD or VaD 61,64,65,74 , but contrary results showed more significant association with non-AD or VaD than with AD 82,84,100 .These mixed findings may reflect differences across studies in modeling methods, cohort characteristics, exposure duration, confounding co-exposures, source of air pollution data, and dementia ascertainments.Due to the heterogeneity of dementia etiology and disease progression, inconsistent clinical diagnoses and records may have been used across different studies with participants from a wide range of cohorts.Additionally, the outcome measurements mainly derived from medical records may not be an accurate representation of the entire population because of underlying socioeconomic disparities in quality and accessibility of medical care 101,102 .This could be a critical confounding factor because studies have shown that social disadvantage can increase vulnerability to air pollution and air pollution-mediated risk of AD/ADRD 101,103 .</p>
<p>Despite these mixed results, long-term exposure to higher levels of PM 2.5 and NO x was still consistently found to be associated with increased risk of AD and ADRD in most studies (Table 3).Long-term exposure to higher levels of PM 2.5 and NO x was associated with greater extent of AD-relevant structural changes in the brain, which were assessed using PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify amyloid deposition and cortical atrophy 28,53,[104][105][106][107] .Individuals who were exposed to higher levels of PM 2.5 and NO 2 exhibited higher amyloid PET positivity and cortical atrophy 53,[104][105][106][107] .In smaller cohorts, AD-relevant biomarkers, such as Aβ 42/40 and neurofilament light levels in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, were positively associated with PM 2.5 and NO x exposure levels 54,104,108 .There were a few post-mortem autopsy studies that reported increased expression of histological biomarkers of AD/ADRD, including hyperphosphorylated tau, Aβ deposition, nanoparticle inclusions, and glial activation in the hippocampus, cortex, and olfactory bulbs of young and old individuals who lived in areas with high levels of air pollution [109][110][111][112][113] .Another outcome measurement was cognitive performance, which was assessed by a battery of cognitive tests to quantify memory, verbal fluency, and executive functions [114][115][116][117][118] .While some studies reported an inverse correlation between cognitive test scores and exposure to PM 2.5 and NO x in cognitively unimpaired and impaired populations 106,[115][116][117][118][119][120][121][122][123][124] , other studies found the relationship to be not significant 98,105,114,125 .</p>
<p>LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>All epidemiological studies are limited by several factors.In the studies described, synergistic effects between air pollution and other genetic 59,126 , lifestyle 87,101,122,[126][127][128][129] , and environmental 65,78,101,103,105,128,[130][131][132][133] risk factors may not have been completely adjusted for in the analyses.Although carrying the APOE ε4 gene is a significant AD risk factor [134][135][136] , results from studies assessing whether it has a modifying effects on the association between air pollution and AD are inconclusive: some showed the AD/ ADRD risk associated with air pollution exposure to be more pronounced in APOE ε4 carriers 59,72,104,116,119,121 while others did not 62,66,73,77,104,105 .Genetic susceptibilities other than APOE ε4 status that can change the trajectory of AD pathogenesis were not taken into consideration for most studies.Moreover, other lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, exposure to traffic noise, sleeping patterns, and socioeconomic status, all of which are known to influence AD etiology 87,129,[137][138][139][140] may not have been well reflected or adjusted for in most studies.Since the G × E interactions that lead to AD/ADRD progression are complicated and not well understood, it is challenging for epidemiological studies to fully capture the true impact of air pollution on AD/ADRD.Nevertheless, consistent epidemiological findings across different cohorts and countries that show a robust association between air pollution and ADRD provide strong justification for further experimental investigation of the underlying mechanisms by which air pollution increases AD/ADRD risk.</p>
<p>Experimental animal studies: The challenge of replicating human exposures to air pollution</p>
<p>To investigate the impact of air pollution on AD/ADRD pathogenesis, experimental animal studies have primarily used wildtype or transgenic rodent models that express human AD risk genes to determine whether exposure to air pollution decreases the time to onset or the severity of AD-relevant phenotypes.</p>
<p>A major challenge of studying air pollution toxicology in an experimental animal model is replicating human-relevant exposures to air pollution 141,142 .Most earlier studies employed acute exposures to high concentrations of diesel exhaust particles (DEP) or PM 2.5 administered to rodents via intratracheal 143 or intranasal 144 instillation, or, alternatively, oropharyngeal aspiration 145 of ambient PM 2.5 samples extracted from filtered media and resuspended in a delivery vehicle.The advantages of these instillation or aspiration exposure routes are that the composition of particles, dosage, and site of delivery are easier to control in testing the toxicity of a known amount and composition of air pollutants in a cost-effective way 146 .However, there are several critical shortcomings of these exposure paradigms in terms of replicating human exposure, including: (1) inaccurate reproduction of human-relevant exposure route, composition, pattern, and dosage of air pollutants 142 ; and (2) omission of gaseous co-pollutants 141 .These factors can influence the toxicity of air pollutants and induce inconsistent biological responses even to the same air pollutants 142,147,148 .Hence, many recent studies have utilized in vivo whole-body inhalation exposures to aerosols of air pollutants to test toxicity in a manner that more closely replicates human exposure [149][150][151][152][153][154][155][156][157][158][159][160][161] .Some studies exposed animals to laboratory-generated aerosols of concentrated PM 2.5 , UFPM, or O 3 [149][150][151][152][153][154] , while other studies implemented variations of concentrated ambient particle (CAP) systems to collect real-world ambient air and concentrate PM 2.5 or UFPM for direct delivery to animals [155][156][157][158] .The CAP systems allow more accurate representation of real-world compositions of PM, yet because CAPs methodology only concentrates particles and not gases, understanding combined effects of PM and gases on biological outcomes is not possible 141,159 .Lastly, both laboratorygenerated and CAP-generated aerosols do not effectively emulate chronic real-life exposure dynamics, which vary hourly, weekly, monthly and seasonally 141 .</p>
<p>A few in vivo studies have developed methods for collecting ambient polluted air and delivering it to animals unchanged and in real-time at ambient concentrations via wholebody inhalation 141,[160][161][162] .For example, in one study, ambient traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) was collected from a heavily trafficked freeway tunnel in northern California, USA, for subsequent delivery in real-time to animals housed in an adjacent vivarium 141 .This study demonstrated that chronic life-time exposure to ambient TRAP exacerbated ADrelevant phenotypes in wildtype Fischer rats and transgenic TgF344-AD rats that expressed human AD risk genes 160 .Another study in Taipei, Taiwan used the Taipei Air Pollutant Exposure System (TAPES) to sample and deliver outdoor ambient air mixture directly to 3xTg-AD mice housed in an exposure chamber.Transgenic mice exposed to ambient air pollution exhibited increased AD neuropathologies relative to filtered air controls 161 .These novel exposure methods in rodent models increase the translational value of experimental animal studies and provide corroborative evidence to support the epidemiological findings.</p>
<p>Experimental animal studies: Chronic exposure to air pollution exacerbates</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease pathology</p>
<p>A number of experimental animal studies have quantified Aβ plaques, NFT, tau phosphorylation, neuronal cell loss, and cognitive behavior deficits in both wildtype and transgenic rodent models after exposure to air pollution (Table 4).In most of these studies, the exposure paradigms were short-term or subchronic exposures to PM 2.5 and UFPM that ranged from 2-13 weeks [149][150][151][152][155][156][157][158]161 . Only a few sudies examined the neurological impacts of chronic exposures, ranging from 5-14 months 109,153,154,160,162 .Results from these studies are mixed depending on the exposure paradigm and animal model.Studies with more chronic exposure durations (Table 4) more consistently reported air pollution-induced increases in Aβ/NFT loads, tau hyperphosphorylation, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and neuronal atrophy.Exposures longer than 3 months at either concentrated or ambient levels of UFPM, PM 2.5 , or O 3 were shown to increase Aβ plaque load, tau phosphorylation, gliosis, and worsen learning and memory in transgenic AD rodent models 109,150,153,157,158,160 .Some short-term exposure studies (2-3 weeks) in rodents reported increased Aβ plaques, tau phosphorylation, neuronal atrophy, and memory deficits 153,155,163 , while others did not observe those changes 149,161,164 or observed contrary results of reduced Aβ plaques with increased microgliosis 156 .The mixed results may be partially attributed to varying degrees of neuroinflammation caused by air pollution, as discussed below.</p>
<p>Prevailing hypothesis: Air pollution promotes Alzheimer's disease-related dementias phenotypes via inflammatory mechanisms CHRONIC NEUROINFLAMMATION IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATHOGENESIS</p>
<p>Persistent neuroinflammation has been posited as a key mechanism responsible for progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including ADRD 165 , based on accumulating evidence from human post-mortem [166][167][168] and experimental animal studies 169,170 .</p>
<p>Aggregates of misfolded proteins like Aβ and NFT, which are neurotoxic, have been shown to trigger neuroinflammation 171,172 .Neuroinflammatory responses are mainly orchestrated by resident brain immune cells -microglia and astrocytes -that protect the brain microenvironment not only by phagocytosing cellular damage, but also regulating neurogenesis and synapse number 173,174 .While microglia-mediated amyloid clearance 169,175 and pruning of axosomatic inhibitory synapses following injuries 176,177 likely provide neuroprotection, dysregulation of these microglial functions is observed in AD/ADRD, and an increasing number of studies report that pro-inflammatory or diseaseassociated microglial phenotypes are associated with worse neurotoxic outcomes and increased severity of AD/ADRD neuropathology 169,[178][179][180][181][182] .</p>
<p>EXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION PROMOTES NEUROINFLAMMATION</p>
<p>Glial activation in response to PM exposure has been quantified by immunohistochemical analyses in many experimental animal studies.Most studies used IBA-1 as a biomarker of microglia 183,184 and GFAP as a biomarker of astrocytes 185,186 , and some studies colocalized IBA-1 with CD68, a marker of phagocytic cells.Numerous studies have reported that PM induced recruitment of microglia and astrocytes to the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of rodents 158,160,187 .However, PM-induced microglial activation varied across different studies depending on the exposure paradigm, sex, age, genotype, and brain region.In one study, wildtype mice exhibited increased IBA-1 + expression with more amoeboid microglial morphology in the olfactory bulb after 4-8 weeks of exposure to concentrated PM 2.5 187 , whereas in another study, APP/PS1 mice, but not wildtype mice, exhibited increased microglial activation in the hippocampus following a 3-month exposure 158 .A more chronic exposure to ambient TRAP induced microglial phagocytosis (increased ratio of CD68 + / IBA-1 + ) in the hippocampus of both wildtype and TgF344-AD female rats after 2 months of exposure, while male wildtype and TgF344-AD rats did not exhibit TRAP-induced microglial activation until after 14 months of exposure 160 .Interestingly, in contrast to male rats, female rats exhibited a dampened microglial phagocytic response to TRAP after 14 months of exposure 160 .A different study reported that 2 weeks of UFPM exposure reduced microglial activation with more ramified microglial morphology in 3xTgAD mice compared to filtered air-exposed controls 156 .Like microglia, observations regarding the impacts of PM on astrocytic activation (GFAP + immunoreactivity) varied across studies.While some studies reported PM-induced astrocytic recruitment and activation in the hippocampus 152,158,188 , hypothalamus 189 , and striatum 190 , other studies reported no significant effects of PM on astrocytic activation in any of the brain regions examined 156,160 .</p>
<p>These variable observations suggest that the glial responses to air pollution are complex.The functional impact of these changes also is not clear since it is now appreciated that glial activation may either exacerbate 169,[178][179][180][181][182] or protect 169,[191][192][193] against synapse loss and neurodegeneration.To better understand how air pollution disrupts neuroinflammatory homeostasis, more recent studies have distinguished glial phenotypes using molecular biomarkers of pro-vs.anti-inflammatory phenotypes or biomarkers of disease-associated microglia (DAM).Following 12 weeks of exposure to UFPM, TMEM119 + microglia, which are considered homeostatic, that were not associated with amyloid plaques were reduced, while ferritin + DAM microglia, which are associated with senescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS), were increased in both wildtype and App NL-G-F/+ -KI mice 157 .The same study also showed that UFPM increased the number of highly inflammatory, neurotoxic C3 + DAM astrocytes in the cortex of both genotypes 157 .In vitro studies also have characterized glial phenotypes after PM treatment.Primary coculture of microglia and astrocytes exhibited upregulated expression of DAM astrocytic markers (C3 protein and DAM-specific transcripts) in response to PM 2.5 treatment 194 .In addition, PM 2.5 altered interactions between neurons and glial cells in a triculture of neuron, astrocyte, and microglia human cell lines by promoting polarization of DAM microglia characterized by CD11b, CD86, and iNOS expression 195 .Based on these results, the type of glial activation or polarization following PM exposure may be important in either resolving inflammation or driving it towards persistent neuroinflammation and glial dysfunction, which can further exacerbate AD pathologies and neuronal atrophy.</p>
<p>These observations raise important questions regarding the mechanism(s) by which air pollutants alter glial phenotypes.Microglia and astrocytes are activated by autocrine and paracrine signals in the forms of: (1) cytokines and chemokines, which are small immune signaling molecules 196 , and (2) reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which are byproducts of cellular oxidative metabolism that carry unstable oxygen radicals 197 .Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, such as H 2 O 2 , NO x , and superoxides, serve as short-lived paracrine signals that play important physiological roles in immune defense and maintenance of cellular homeostasis 197 .Due to the highly reactive property of ROS, the cellular and extracellular levels of ROS are tightly regulated by cellular and enzymatic antioxidants that reduce and stabilize ROS to maintain homeostatic levels of ROS 197 .However, an imbalanced and persistent increase of ROS beyond the physiological range depletes the normal antioxidant capacity, resulting in oxidative stress when ROS react with cellular components to cause lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial damage, protein oxidative damage, DNA damage, and cellular death 197 .Additionally, subtler changes in cellular ROS levels can alter physiological redox signaling and consequently, result in cellular dysfunctions in microglia 198 .</p>
<p>In vitro, short-term (2-3 weeks) exposure to concentrated PM or subchronic (3 months) exposure to ambient level of PM 2.5 was sufficient to cause oxidative stress in the olfactory bulb and hippocampus of rodents as evidenced by increased lipid peroxidation 152,161,[199][200][201] , dysregulated antioxidant metabolism 149,152,202 , DNA damage and epigenetic modifications consistent with oxidative stress 109 .These findings demonstrate that air pollution can cause oxidative stress that may trigger neuroinflammation via microglia activation.In tissue culture models, PM 2.5 or DEP has been shown to increase ROS followed by microglial activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines in microglial monoculture 201,203,204 , neuron-glia coculture 195,205 and microglia-endothelial cell coculture 206 .Interestingly, it has been reported that complement 3 (C3)-mediated microglial activation resulted in aggravated Aβ deposition, synaptic loss, and neuronal degeneration 182,[207][208][209][210] via NADPH oxidase activation 208,209 , which increases ROS production.In an independent study, NADPH oxidase activation was found to induce DAM microglial polarization 211 .</p>
<p>Exposure to air pollution has also been shown to cause proinflammatory cytokine release in the rodent hippocampus 149,150,152,158,162,164,200,[212][213][214] .Across different studies, the main proinflammatory cytokines that were consistently upregulated by PM exposure were TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ.However, whether and how PM-induced proinflammatory cytokines mediate DAM glial polarization and neuronal cell death are still poorly understood.Several recent in vitro studies suggest several potential mechanisms.For example, in a neuron-astrocyte coculture of human cell lines, PM 2.5 treatment caused the release of chemokines (CCL1, CCL2) that can recruit microglia, as well as cytokines (IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-8) that can polarize microglia into DAM phenotypes 195 .Monocultured microglia were polarized to the DAM phenotype (CD86 + , iNOS + with increased NO release) when exposed to conditioned media from astrocyteneuron coculture exposed to PM 2.5 ; and antibody neutralization of IL-1β, IFN-γ, CCL1, and CCL2 in the conditioned media significantly reduced DAM polarization.Interestingly, when monocultured microglia were directly exposed to PM 2.5 they did not polarize to a DAM phenotype, but instead became phagocytic and anti-inflammatory (TREM2 + , LC3b + , CD86 − ), which resulted in effective clearance of PM 2.5 .These authors further demonstrated that microglia and astrocytes both contributed to PM-induced synaptic impairment while DAM microglia primarily drove PM-induced neuronal cell death and tau-phosphorylation 195 .These findings suggest that PM-induced glial polarization occurs through bidirectional crosstalk between microglia and astrocytes in which cytokines act as mediators to not only shift glial responses, but also to cause neuronal atrophy.An independent study further confirmed these results by showing that PM 0.2 -induced neuronal synaptic atrophy was mainly driven via C3 signals released by DAM astrocytes that were polarized by activated microglia.Disease-associated astrocyte polarization was reversed when microglia were inhibited by minocycline even with the PM 0.2 treatment, and this further reduced synaptic damages 194 .</p>
<p>The role of IL-1β has also been investigated in the context of inflammasome activation.The inflammasome is a multiprotein intracellular immune signaling complex that detects pathogen-and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) to initiate proinflammatory responses and has been increasingly reported and discussed as a pathogenic mechanism of AD 215 .In a neuron-microglia coculture, co-exposure to oligomeric Aβ and PM 2.5 augmented the microglial response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), evidenced as increased ROS and IL-1β production, resulting in activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent neuronal apoptosis.Pretreating the coculture with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and/or caspase-1 inhibitor before oligomeric Aβ and PM 2.5 exposure significantly ameliorated neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation mediate the neurotoxic effects of oligomeric Aβ and PM 2.5 205 .</p>
<p>Results from animal studies and in vitro studies corroborate epidemiological findings and provide a better understanding of the molecular and cellular responses to air pollution that include oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and aggravation of AD/ADRD pathologies.While there is ongoing progression towards identifying how air pollutants perturb brain health, mechanistic links that integrate the neuropathological processes triggered by air pollution need further investigation.It is experimentally challenging to recreate realistic air pollution exposure paradigms, but recent development of exposure systems that allow better recapitulation of human-relevant exposures will enable significant advancements in the field of air pollution and ADRD research possible.Nevertheless, discrepancies in exposure paradigms and animal models between studies has led to large variabilities in neurologic outcomes.Therefore, follow-up studies with more standardized exposures using genetically modified animal models with inclusion of both sexes are necessary to validate observations reported across different studies.</p>
<p>Outstanding data gap: Direct vs. indirect effects of air pollution on the brain</p>
<p>While in vitro studies demonstrate that PM from polluted air can directly trigger responses in neurons and glial cells, whether and how gases associated with air pollution directly affect these cell types is largely unknown.Similarly, there remains considerable uncertainty as to whether in vivo brain responses to air pollution arise from direct interactions with air pollutants or rather are the indirect consequence of air pollution effects on peripheral organs.There is experimental evidence, albeit limited, to support both possibilities, which likely are not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>DIRECT PATHWAY</p>
<p>The direct pathway infers translocation of PM to the brain, where it can directly activate microglia.Translocation of PM to brain parenchyma may occur through retrograde transport of PM from olfactory epithelium to the olfactory cortex via olfactory nerves or via the trigeminal nerve to the brain [216][217][218] (Figure 3A).Particulate matter inclusions in the olfactory bulbs and prefrontal cortex have been observed and associated with impaired olfactory function in both mice and humans 109,110,112,113,155,160,161,187,219,220 .Alternatively, PM may enter the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) from the systemic circulation.Inhaled fine particles that are deposited in the distal airways and alveoli can readily cross the air-blood barrier to enter the systemic circulation and cross other biological barriers like the BBB [221][222][223][224][225] .Studies using a 3-D human BBB organotypic chip have shown that PM can cross the BBB 225 .Moreover, an in vivo study in which transgenic AD animals were exposed to ambient levels of PM, extensive PM deposition was observed in the hippocampus, which is vulnerable to BBB leakage in AD, with minimal PM detected in the frontal cortex 160 , supporting this as the primary mechanism by which inhaled PM may be reaching the brain under conditions of exposure to ambient TRAP levels.Blood-brain barrier impairment is a known AD pathology [226][227][228] that may be both a causal factor and a result of air pollution-induced AD exacerbation because PM and circulating mediators can cross an impaired BBB 229 and air pollution can break down components of the neurovascular unit that forms the BBB 199,230,231 .Phagocytosis of PM by activated microglia has been well characterized in many in vitro studies 195,205,206,[232][233][234] , and neurotoxic materials, such as metals, endotoxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, adhered to PM have been shown to cause neuroinflammation in the brain parenchyma 115,[235][236][237] .Although there are less studies on PM-induced astrocytic activation 189,194,195 , results indicate that the microglia-astrocyte crosstalk can lead to bidirectional responses in both glial cells to promote neuroinflammation 194,195,210,238,239 .</p>

<p>The indirect pathway infers that air pollution-associated neuroinflammation is a consequence of inflammation induced by air pollution in peripheral targets.The respiratory toxicology of air pollution has been extensively studied, and it is well-established that inhaled air pollutants reduce lung function and increase respiratory disease susceptibility and mortality by inducing and disrupting pulmonary inflammatory responses [240][241][242][243] .Air pollution also causes consequent systemic inflammation, and increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, dysfunctional fibrinolysis, oxidative stress, and activation of circulating immune cells 41,[244][245][246][247][248] .With growing evidence suggesting that systemic inflammation can promote neuroinflammation [249][250][251][252][253][254] and that higher risks of dementia and cognitive deficits are associated with impaired lung function [255][256][257][258] , the lung-brain axis has been proposed as a potential indirect pathway by which chronic exposure to air pollution induces persistent neuroinflammation that promotes AD/ADRD pathogenesis (Figure 3B).While the direct pathway proposes a valid explanation for PM-induced neuroinflammation, it does not adequately explain neuroinflammatory effects of gaseous components like NO x and O 3 150 .A research group from Indiana University has conducted a series of studies demonstrating how O 3 -induced systemic circulating factors regulate microglial and astrocytic activation 150,151,259 .An acute exposure to O 3 caused persistent microglial activation in rats 24 hours post-exposure, and the same study showed that the addition of serum from O 3 -exposed animals can prime microglia in vitro to augment their response to LPS treatment. 259The group's more recent studies show that O 3 reduced the number of peri-plaque TREM2 + microglia but increased peri-plaque colocalization of microglia and astrocytes 151 with altered transcriptomic profiles shifting glial cells to more disease-associated states (lower Trem2 and higher Serpinea3n gene expressions) in 5xFAD mice 150 .They also reported that O 3 increased the level of circulating high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which is a DAMP signal that enhances both innate and adaptive immune responses 150 .Deleting HMGB1 only in peripheral myeloid cells, but not in microglia by using Hmgb1 fl/fl LysM-Cre + mouse strain, reversed O 3 -induced changes in glial expressions and returned Trem2 and Serpinea3n transcript levels back to the filtered air control baseline 150,151 .An in vitro study from a different group showed that in comparison to directly adding DEP alone to microglia, adding conditioned medium from DEP-stimulated alveolar macrophages caused a higher activation of microglial CD14, which is a pattern recognition receptor that induces DAMP signaling 234 .These findings and those from other studies [260][261][262] with similar results suggest that the lung-brain axis may indirectly mediate neuroinflammatory effects of air pollution independent of the direct pathway.However, more experimental studies are needed to further investigate the lung-brain axis in different exposure paradigms that not only test acute effects of exclusive air pollutants, but also test long-term effects of exposure to combined air pollutants.</p>
<p>Epigenetics, Environment, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias</p>
<p>Epigenetic factors, which mediate gene and environment interactions, may serve as a mechanism underlying G × E interactions and explain a portion of the missing heritability of AD/ADRD. 83Epigenetic control is highly complex, with at least 28 known histone, 53 DNA, and 160 RNA modifications, as well as non-coding RNAs, that work in concert to regulate chromatin accessibility, gene expression, mRNA stability, and mRNA translation [263][264][265] .The location and context-dependent function of these modifications further adds to their complexity but also enables their targeted use as biomarkers and targeted therapeutics [266][267][268] .Here, while we do not cover the full breadth of epigenetic modifications and their functions, we do summarize recent findings related to their association with and potential functional link between air pollution and AD/ADRD pathogenicity.</p>
<p>Prior experimental and population-based epigenetic studies characterizing G × E interactions identified dynamic and disease-associated epigenetic modifications and transcriptional profiles that varied in response to environmental factors 268 .The modifiable nature of epigenetic modifications and their control over gene expression positions them as prime tools and targets for therapeutic intervention.Additionally, their dynamism makes them well suited to function as biomarkers indicative of disease predisposition, pathological outcomes and disease susceptibility, or of environmental exposures.</p>
<p>Generally, epigenetic modifications, whether located on histones, DNA, or RNA, are regulated by writer and erasers and interpreted by reader proteins or protein/RNA complexes.The expression of these regulatory factors enables fine control over tissue and cell-type specific spatiotemporal expressional programming [269][270][271][272] .Dysregulation of epigenetic control, either through the alteration of specific markers or the abundance of the readers/writers/erasers serves as an additional mechanism of control and potential contributor towards disease state.</p>
<p>DNA MODIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Recent work characterizing the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors in the development and progression of AD highlighted epigenetic modifications as critical mediators of G × E interactions.In a cohort of older women from the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), it was found that nanoparticles exposure increased the risk of cognitive decline by 81% and all-cause dementia by 92% in a dose-dependent manner for APOE ε4 carriers 273 .Following up on these findings, the authors utilized the 5xFAD mouse model and found that exposure to nanoparticles was associated with greater AD pathology and the APOE status of the exposed individual functioned as a response modifier.In the 5xFAD mouse model, over the course of 15 weeks of nanoparticles exposure, the presence of ApoE ε4 +/+ over ApoE ε3 +/+ alleles significantly increased amyloid plaque pathology, reduced hippocampal CA1 neurites, and decreased the glutamate GluR1 subunit.In a similar study investigating the G × E interaction between cadmium exposure and ApoE ε4 dosage, 14 weeks of cadmium exposure in the ApoE knock-in mouse model identified accelerated cognitive impairment and reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in ApoE ε4 carriers relative to their ApoE ε3 counterparts, indicating G × E interactions modulate AD pathogenicity 274 .In effort to explore the missing heritability observed in AD, Panitch, et al. recently investigated the relationship between APOE DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine; 5mC) and ε4 carrier status and found differential methylation at 25 CpG sites in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 36 CpG sites in blood, with the majority of sites being hypomethylated 275 .Furthermore, this group identified seven CpG sites in the APOE region (including TOMM40, APOE, and APOC1 genes) that significantly differed between APOE ε4 carriers and non-carriers in brain and blood (P&lt;5×10 −8 ), with three sites in the APOE gene showing hypermethylation in ε4 carriers and a nominal association with APOE expression in the brain (P&lt;10 −5 ) 275 .One of the three genes that contained differentially methylated CpG sites in APOE ε4 carriers relative to control was TET1, a 5mC eraser and DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5hmC) writer.In the same family of Ten-Eleven Translocation proteins, TET2, a 5mC eraser and 5hmC writer, was also found to be moderately differentially methylated in APOE ε4 carriers relative to control (p = 7.6×10 −6 ) 275 .Interestingly, both TET1 and TET2 function in similar but distinct capacities, and prior sequencing studies have identified an enrichment of TET1 and TET2 variants associated with EOAD/frontotemporal dementia 276,277 .Lastly, utilizing an APP mouse model, tethering the de novo 5mC writer, Dnmt3a, to dCas9 targeted to APP was sufficient to methylate the APP gene, reduce APP expression and amyloid pathology, and ameliorate cognitive and behavioral impairment 278 .</p>
<p>HISTONE MODIFICATIONS</p>
<p>In addition to DNA modifications, histone modifications have emerged as crucial players in the pathogenesis of AD and often function with DNA modifications to regulate gene expression 279,280 .Recent studies reveal links between air pollution and histone modifications.Zheng et al. explored how different components of air pollution (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , black carbon, and elemental components (potassium, sulfur, iron, silicon, aluminum, zinc, calcium, and titanium)) influenced various histone modifications (H3K9ac, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H3K36me3) in the blood leukocytes of exposed truck drivers and office workers in Beijing 281 .Their group identified differential associations between pollutants and various histone markers.Specifically, they noted an increase in ambient PM 10 associated with lower H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 levels.They also observed that office workers had a stronger association between black carbon and H3K9ac and H3K36me3 than truck drivers, and that the association between black carbon exposure and H3K9ac and H3K9me3 status was sex-dependent 281 .</p>
<p>Similarly, exposure to air pollutants, particularly PM 2.5 and PM 10 , induced significant epigenetic alterations in rat blood and lung tissue in a dose-dependent manner 282 .This study revealed that increased exposure to PM 2.5 and PM 10 generally led to decreased DNA methylation of LINE-1 and iNOS, while simultaneously increasing histone acetylation (H3K9ac) in both blood and lung tissue.Interestingly, PM 2.5 exposure was also associated with increased methylation of p16CDKN2A and APC promoters.The effects of NO x were more variable, showing mixed impacts on methylation patterns.Notably, these epigenetic changes were often more pronounced in blood compared to lung tissue, with H3K9ac consistently increasing in response to PM 2.5 and PM 10 exposure in both tissue types 282 .</p>
<p>RNA MODIFICATIONS</p>
<p>RNA N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most studied and prevalent RNA modification, it is highly enriched in the brain, and associated with a suite of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. m 6 A influences transcript splicing, stability, translation, nuclear export, and RNA structure 283,284 .There is evidence that environmental exposure influences RNA modifications and subsequently, AD pathophysiology 285 Li et al., 2023 found that exposure to PM 2.5 is associated with a greater prevalence of m 6 A modifications, a global increase in gene expression, and a significant increase in the expression of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), which is involved in synthesizing the prostaglandin inflammation signaling molecules 286 .</p>
<p>Recent research shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of PM 2.5 exposure on lung cells 287 .In the A549 lung cell line, PM 2.5 exposure upregulated m 6 A RNA methylation coincident with increased expression of TGF-β, SMAD3, and the methyltransferases METTL3 and METTL14 (m 6 A writers).Importantly, inhibition of TGFβ reversed the PM 2.5 -induced changes, suggesting a pivotal role for the TGF-β signaling pathway in regulating m 6 A RNA methylation following PM 2.5 exposure 287 .These findings revealed a potential mechanism by which lung inflammation triggered by PM 2.5 exposure leads to m 6 A modifications observed in AD.</p>
<p>Using postmortem AD patient data, another study identified significantly reduced expression and soluble protein levels of METTL3, and no significant changes for METTL14 in the hippocampus 288 .Notably, insoluble fractions of AD brain samples had accumulated METTL3 that positively correlated with insoluble tau protein levels, although no direct interaction between METTL3 and tau was observed 288 .This research suggests that while tau pathology is a better predictor of disrupted m 6 A signaling than Aβ load, it likely does not directly cause the altered METTL3 expression seen in AD hippocampal neurons.</p>
<p>These findings were corroborated in a study of individuals diagnosed with AD vs. controls that reported a marked decrease in m 6 A modifications and METTL3, METTL14, WTAP, FTO, and YTHDF protein levels in cortex and hippocampus tissue with AD.The functional significance of this observation is suggested by experimental animal studies: knockdown of METTL3 in mouse hippocampus significantly increased memory loss, neurodegeneration, gliosis, oxidative stress, and apoptotic processes 289 .Knocking down METTL3, METTL14, and YTHDF in flies expressing TauR406W was found to worsen eye phenotype and reduce motor function, highlighting that reduced expression of m 6 A or the ability to read m 6 A is associated with worsened AD-associated phenotypes 290 .</p>
<p>Collectively, these studies suggest that the regulation of RNA writers, readers and erasers is a critical component for mediating G × E interactions, and aberrant regulation of these proteins has a large knock-on effect, influencing pathological outcomes.</p>
<p>NON-CODING RNA</p>
<p>A separate class of RNAs, non-coding RNAs, exert epigenetic control via control of transcription, transcript stability, and translation efficiency.These molecules are highly dynamic, and their expression and stability can be influenced by exposure to environmental factors [291][292][293][294] .</p>
<p>To determine whether DEP induces pulmonary inflammatory response, Wang and colleagues explored the involvement of RNA binding protein LIN28B and non-coding microRNA Iet7 axis in the inflammatory response to DEP exposure in mice 295 .Let7-d and Iet7-g were significantly downregulated, while LIN28B protein levels were elevated from 6 to 24 hours after DEP exposure.Furthermore, they found that LIN28B is responsible for the downregulation of Iet7, subsequently increasing expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 295 .A study involving a protein of the same class, LIN28A, in a VaD rat model, where VaD was introduced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, found that treatment with Lin28a siRNA ameliorated cognitive impairment, as well as upregulated expression of GFAP, and IBA-1 glial markers 296 .Moreover, treatment with siRNA alleviated BBB damage as measured by expression of PECAM-1, PDGFRβ, occludin, claudin-9, and ZO-1, and Ccr6 296 .</p>
<p>Furthering the link between environmental exposure, non-coding RNAs and modulation of inflammation, microarray analyses of blood samples from foundry workers exposed to metal-rich PM identified significantly increased expression of miR-421, miR-146a, miR-29a, and let-7g after 3 days of work exposure relative to baseline (first day of the work week after two days off). 297In addition to sampling miRNA expression, PCR was performed on 18 inflammatory genes, including TGFß1, TGFß2, TNF, ITGA2, ITGAX, NFKB1, NOS2, CCL2, CCL5.Significant differences were found in individual miRNAs and inflammatory genes that have differing targets and regulatory activity.This included miR-421 associated with NOS2 expression; miR-146a with TGFß1, CCL2 and CCL5 expression; and let-7g with TGFß1, ITGAX, and NFKß1 expression 297 .</p>
<p>Additional research exploring the relationship between PM 2.5 exposure and expression of non-coding RNAs has identified increased expression of the long non-coding RNA, HCG18, in the lung.HCG18 suppresses miR-195 expression and leads to upregulated ATG14 expression and increased autophagy and progression of lung adenocarcinoma 298 .In addition to playing a significant role in the development of lung pathologies, reduced mir-195 expression is observed with human aging and in AD progression, while increased mir-195 prevalence is associated with improved cognitive performance and negatively correlated with cerebrospinal fluid tau levels.Human expression patterns of mir-195 are mirrored in ApoE ε4 +/+ mice when compared with ApoE ε3 +/+ mice.Furthermore, elevating miR-195 levels was found to reduce amyloid burden and tau hyper-phosphorylation and improve cognitive impairment.Lastly, when cortical neurons and astrocytes generated from inducible pluripotent stem cells derived from ApoE ε4 +/+ mice were co-cultured, miR-195 inhibition exacerbated AD-associated lysosomal phenotypes 299 .</p>
<p>In this section, we highlighted epigenetic mechanisms by which air pollutants may contribute to cognitive impairment and AD-associated pathologies.These studies underscore the crucial role of epigenetics as a mediator of G × E interactions in AD.Importantly, they indicate that the development of epigenetic markers of air pollution exposure may advance the identification of specific air pollutants that promote AD/ADRD-associated risk and progression.Epigenetic analyses also hold the promise of providing targets for therapeutic interventions, offering modifiable pathways to potentially reduce AD pathophysiology.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Consistent with previous epidemiological findings regarding the association between air pollution and ADRD, recent epidemiological studies have largely reported positive correlations between air pollution and AD/ADRD.This association is mostly substantiated by experimental animal studies.Although there is general consensus that air pollution is an environmental risk factor for AD/ADRD, associations between specific air pollutants and ADRD subtypes are variable across different studies.This variability in part stems from the complexity of mixed ADRD pathologies and equivocal etiological links between genetic status, pathological manifestation, cognitive impairment, and clinical diagnoses.Currently, the field is reassessing diagnostic criteria utilizing biomarkers that more accurately delineate between AD and related dementias to better characterize pathology-specific disease progression.These refinements in diagnostic precision will improve efforts to identify environmental factors that modify risk and severity of AD/ADRD.Elucidating ADRD stratification and G × E contributions implicated in the development of ADRD will inform effective public health regulations and guidelines for air pollution and other environmental contaminants, with the aim of preventing and minimizing adverse neurological health outcomes.</p>
<p>Box 1.</p>
<p>Air pollution composition, toxicology and regulations</p>
<p>Six criteria air pollutants are monitored and regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Ambient Air Quality Standards and the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines.These include: (1) coarse and fine particulate matter (PM 10 , PMzs); (2) nitrogen dioxide (NOz); (3) ground-level ozone (03): (4) carbon monoxide (CO); (5) sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ); and ( 6) lead (Pb) (Figure 2).The composition and toxicity of these pollutants are determined in large part by their sources. 222Sources of these pollutants include industrial pollution, near roadway traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), wildfire, and agriculture 51,60,317,318 .</p>
<p>Amongst the six criteria air pollutants, PM has been most intensively monitored and studied as a health hazard because it deposits in the respiratory system, and the finer particles can enter the systemic circulation and be distributed to all organs in the body, including the brain 219,222,224,[319][320][321] .Particulate matter ranges in size from coarse (PM 10 with an aerodynamic diameter &lt;10 μm) to fine (PM 2.5, diameter &lt;2.5 μm) to ultrafine (UFPM, diameter &lt;0.1 μm) (Figure 2).Fine PM 0.1-2.5 are considered more toxic than coarse PM 10 because of a higher penetrance into the lung parenchyma with smaller sizes.Fine PM 2.5 from agriculture, TRAP, coal combustion and wildfire were found to be significant risk modifiers for dementia, including AD 49,51,221,318,322,323 .A wide range of organic and inorganic compounds from different sources of agriculture, wildfire, and TRAP can adsorb to PM 2.5 and cause negative health outcomes in the lung and the brain. 124,324,325Likewise, the composition of gases in polluted air also depends on the source of emission.Traffic-related air pollution is one of the main sources of NO x , CO, benzene, and other volatile organic compounds (Figure 2), yet industrial boilers, gas stoves, and other fuel combustion processes also contribute to emissions of these gases.Traffic-related air pollution as a source of SO 2 emissions has declined with the global transition to using low sulfur fuels for automobiles 326 .Yet, other sources like wildfire smoke, industrial sources, and ship emissions still contribute to the release of SO 2 327 .</p>
<p>Ground-level O 3 is a gaseous secondary air pollutant that forms from photochemical reactions with radicals derived from NO x and volatile organic compounds in the warm ambient atmosphere 328 .Air pollutants consist of gaseous and particulate matter (PM) fractions with heterogenous sources, compositions, and sizes, all of which influence toxicity to the respiratory system and the brain.Created with BioRender.com.↑ 36 studies reported positive association [50][51][52] ∅ 5 studies reported no association [95][96][97][98][99] PM 10 ↑ 4 studies reported positive association 54,104- 106 ↑ 4 studies reported positive association 106,121,123,314 ∅ 3 studies reported no association 98,105,125 ↑ 9 studies reported positive association 67,[70][71][72]80,82,85,87,100 ∅ 1 study reported no association 98</p>
