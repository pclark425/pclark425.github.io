                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> An increasing amount of research in Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on the application and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities. Despite their success, however, LLMs are still prone to factual errors and inconsistencies in their explanations, offering limited control and interpretability for inference in complex domains. In this paper, we focus on ethical NLI, investigating how hybrid neuro-symbolic techniques can enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs. Specifically, we present an abductive-deductive framework named Logic-Explainer, which integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine step-wise natural language explanations and jointly verify their correctness, reduce incompleteness and minimise redundancy. An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that Logic-Explainer can improve explanations generated via in-context learning methods and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) on challenging ethical NLI tasks, while, at the same time, producing formal proofs describing and supporting models’ reasoning. As ethical NLI requires commonsense reasoning to identify underlying moral violations, our results suggest the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic methods for multi-step NLI more broadly, opening new opportunities to enhance the logical consistency, reliability, and alignment of LLMs.</p>

An increasing amount of research in Natural Language Inference (NLI) focuses on the application and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their reasoning capabilities.Despite their success, however, LLMs are still prone to factual errors and inconsistencies in their explanations, offering limited control and interpretability for inference in complex domains.In this paper, we focus on ethical NLI, investigating how hybrid neurosymbolic techniques can enhance the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations produced by LLMs.Specifically, we present an abductive-deductive framework named Logic-Explainer, which integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver to refine step-wise natural language explanations and jointly verify their correctness, reduce incompleteness and minimise redundancy.An extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that Logic-Explainer can improve explanations generated via in-context learning methods and Chainof-Thought (CoT) on challenging ethical NLI tasks, while, at the same time, producing formal proofs describing and supporting models' reasoning.As ethical NLI requires commonsense reasoning to identify underlying moral violations, our results suggest the effectiveness of neuro-symbolic methods for multi-step NLI more broadly, opening new opportunities to enhance the logical consistency, reliability, and alignment of LLMs.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a given premise entails a hypothesis (Qin et al., 2022;Gupta et al., 2020;Mathur et al., 2022).In general, NLI in complex domains requires multi-step reasoning alongside the ability to select and combine multiple premises to support or reject a given hypothesis (Liu et al., 2020;Ji et al., 2020;Shi et al., 2021b; Wang and</p>

<p>Logically valid, complete and nonredundant.</p>
<p>Figure 1: How can we improve LLMs ethical reasoning and its alignment to underlying moral principles?</p>
<p>We propose a neuro-symbolic framework, named Logic-Explainer, to verify and enhance the logical validity, completeness and non-redundancy of ethical explanations via iterative symbolic refinement.Pan, 2022;Yavuz et al., 2022).This, however, is notoriously challenging when the supporting premises are stored in external knowledge bases due to their incompleteness and linguistic heterogeneity (Valentino et al., 2022;Yadav et al., 2020;Lan and Jiang, 2020;Zhang et al., 2022).Large Language Models (LLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019;Liu et al., 2019;Chowdhery et al., 2022), on the other side, offer an opportunity to address those challenges thanks to their generative capabilities (Brown et al., 2020;Ouyang et al., 2022).Several prompting and in-context learning strategies, in fact, have been proposed to facilitate transferring knowledge to downstream tasks and elicit multistep reasoning in different domains (Deng et al., 2022;Wei et al., 2023).Despite their success, however, LLMs still suffer from several limitations, ranging from poor flexibility and controllability in the generation process to hallucination, factual errors, and inference inconsistencies observable in their underlying explanations (Yang et al., 2022;Gu et al., 2022;Sanyal et al., 2022).</p>
<p>In this work, we focus on ethical NLI as a representative task to assess reasoning in LLMs and explore novel methodologies to improve logical validity and alignment (Hendrycks et al., 2021;Jiang et al., 2022).In particular, we focus on the problem of explaining why a given ethical statement is morally unacceptable and generate ethical explanations linking the statements to underlying moral principles (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>Specifically, we propose Logic-Explainer, a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages LLMs to deduce hypotheses of moral violations and generate supporting ethical explanations.Logic-Explainer instantiates an iterative symbolic refinement methodology that integrates LLMs with a backward-chaining solver (Weber et al., 2019) through autoformalization (Wu et al., 2022) to automatically verify the logical correctness of the explanations.By iteratively dropping irrelevant facts from previous steps and generating missing premises through abductive inference, Logic-Explainer attempts to construct a complete and nonredundant explanation via the generation of a formal logical proof.</p>
<p>We evaluate Logic-Explainer on ethical NLI benchmarks requiring commonsense reasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2021).First, in order to assess the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we conduct experiments on the identification of underlying moral violations for ethical statements.In addition, we inspect the proof constructed through the external symbolic solver to investigate the quality of the generated explanations.We found that Logic-Explainer can significantly improve the accuracy in the identification of underlying moral violations when compared to in-context learning (+22%) and Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) (+5%) methods.Moreover, Logic-Explainer can increase the logical validity of ethical explanations from 22.9% to 65.1% and 10.3% to 55.2% on easy and hard settings, respectively.Finally, we found that the redundancy of the constructed explanations is reduced from 86.6% to 4.6% and 78.3% to 6.2% after three refinement cycles.</p>

<p>Explanations for Ethical NLI</p>
<p>Ethical NLI involves reasoning about everyday scenarios in which individuals perform actions that can positively or negatively affect others (Hendrycks et al., 2021).One of the challenges of ethical explanations is the ability to perform abstractive commonsense reasoning (Thayaparan et al., 2020) to connect statements about concrete situations to foundational and unifying moral principles.In this work, we focus on the task of generating logically valid, complete and non-redundant explanations to determine underlying moral violations of ethical statements.Formally, given a statement s i , we want to determine whether s i is morally acceptable through the construction of an explanation E i composed of a set of facts {f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n }.In particular, we want the explanation E i to identify one of a set of moral violations V = {v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n } that are related to core moral principles such that E i ∪ {s i } |= v j .An explanation E i is considered to be valid and non-redundant if all the facts in E i are necessary and sufficient for the entailment
E i ∪ {s i } |= v j to hold.</p>
<p>Logic-Explainer</p>
<p>To construct an explanation E i for s i , we present a neuro-symbolic model that integrates an LLM with an external symbolic reasoner, adopting a refinement strategy for a fixed number t of iterations.The pipeline of Logic-Explainer is composed of several intermediate stages (Figure 2).In the first stage (a), we apply a semantic prompting strategy (see section 3.1), using the LLM to generate the initial explanation and a hypothesis Moral Statement ... violate_care_physical(X,Y) :-physical_harm(X),animal(Y).= 1.0 violate_authority_disobedience(X,Y ) :-disobedience(X), traditional_authority_figure(Y).= 1.0 … authority_figure(X) :-parents(X).= 1.0 violation_of_law(X) :-theft(X).= 1.0 theft(X) :-lifting_credit_card_without_permission(X).= 1.0 parents(X).= 1.0 laid(X).= 1.0 … valid and non-redundant</p>

<p>Step (a)</p>
<p>Step (b)</p>
<p>As my parents laid in bed, I lifted their credit cards.Step a) involves constructing the initial explanation and identifying the hypothesis of moral violation via the LLM.</p>
<p>Agents</p>
<p>Step b) instantiates an iterative symbolic refinement process that verifies the logical correctness of previously generated explanations.This involves autoformalization and the adoption of a symbolic solver to construct a formal proof.In case the explanation is not valid or redundant, both explanation and hypothesis are refined through abductive and deductive inference to start a new iteration.</p>
<p>of moral violation {E i , h i }.The semantic prompting is constructed through the identification of the predicate-argument structure of the sentence, including its set of semantic roles for the statement s i (e.g.agent, patient, action and other semantic roles) (Shi and Lin, 2019).</p>
<p>In the second stage (b), we perform an iterative refinement of the generated explanation by first converting the generated facts, moral principles and semantic roles into rules and atoms in a formal language through autoformalization (i.e., Prolog), and then using a symbolic solver to validate the explanation.The solver employs backward-chaining to attempt to build a proof entailing one of the moral violations in V from the converted facts.If the moral violation entailed by the symbolic solver coincides with the hypothesis h i , we assume E i to be logically valid and terminate the refinement step.Moreover, if all the generated facts appear in the proof, we consider the explanation to be valid and non-redundant.If the conditions above are not respected or no proof can be constructed, we consider the explanation to be incomplete and perform a new refinement step.This is done by selecting only the facts that appear in the proof and prompting the LLM to generate missing premises {f missing |f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n , h i } (abductive inference) and subsequently revise the hypothesis of moral violation {h new |f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n } (deductive inference).The refined explanation and hypothesis are then used as input for the next iteration (see Algorithm 1 for a formal description of the workflow).</p>
<p>We implement Logic-Explainer using GPT-3.5turbo(Brown et al., 2020) as the LLM and NLProlog (Weber et al., 2019) as a differentiable symbolic solver.We chose NLProlog to allow for a degree of robustness to lexical variability in the generated proofs through semantic similarity models (see Section 3.2).</p>
<p>Semantic Prompting</p>
<p>As generative language models possess a wide range of commonsense and, up to a certain extent, domain-specific knowledge, effective prompting strategies can help generate facts for the specific task at hand.In the ethical domain, moral statements mostly describe daily activities.Therefore, to elicit an explicit interpretation of actions and their participating roles, the moral statements (e.g., I crushed the frog) can be converted into a neo-davidsonian logical form (e.g., ∃e(crushed(e) ∧ Agent(I, e)∧Patient(the frog, e))) that describes the action (i.e., crushed), the agent performing the action (i.e., I) and the patient receiving the action (i.e., the frog).</p>
<p>We then can adopt this formalism to construct a prompt for an LLM through the extraction of semantic roles from the target moral statements.To this end, we first include a set of rules describing possible violations of moral foundations (e.g. the norm of fairness is violated if there is a free-riding behaviour, the norm of care is violated if there is a physical harm made to animals), then we provide a set of annotated examples and instructions in line with existing in-context learning methodologies (Brown et al., 2020;Wei et al., 2023).Finally, we include the moral statement, extracting the semantic roles via the semantic role labelling (SRL) model from AllenNLP (Shi and Lin, 2019).Example of prompts for generating the initial explanation are described in Appendix B.3.</p>
<p>Explanation Verification Model</p>
<p>Autoformalization.In order to leverage an external symbolic solver for explanation validation, it is necessary to translate the moral principles, the set of generated facts and semantic roles into a formal language.Autoformalization in this context consists on the use of the Neo-Daviasonian parsing as mechanism to explicitly guide the formalisation, together with the injection of high-level prompt constraints about abstract moral principles, to guide the LLM to ground its reasoning within a set of well defined ethical frameworks.In this work we chose Prolog as a formal representation as it can be easily integrated with existing logical solvers.Here, the rules are clauses that indicate an implication between premises:
p 1 (X) ⇐ p2(X), p 1 (X, Y ) ⇐ p 2 (X), p 3 (Y ) and p 1 (X, Z) ⇐ p 2 (X, Y ), p 3 (Y, Z
). X typically represents the actions, Y represents the patient and p stands for the predicates that represents the relation between X and Y .To perform the autoformalization, we use GPT-3.5-turbo.The prompts for converting natural language sentences into Prolog can be found in Appendix B.4. Symbolic Solver.The solver used in the validation step is NLProlog (Weber et al., 2019).NLProlog is a differentiable solver that adopts backwardchaining to prove a given goal atom g by recursively deriving sub-goals.The solver then attempts to unify the initial goal with all predicates in the head of the remaining rules.Differently from standard Prolog solvers, NLProlog adopts a weak unification mechanism calculating the cosine similarity between the embeddings of two predicates, enabling a degree of robustness to lexical variability in the process of constructing a proof (see Algorithm 2).In our approach, the goals are represented by a series of atoms describing the conditions of violations of moral foundations involving an action and a patient.
goal ⇐ violate_care_physical(action, patient) | • • • | violate_liberty(action, patient).
The differentiable solver will attempt to prove each goal separately.To this end, for each possible moral violation, a set of rules are provided as prior knowledge, for example:
violate_care_physical(X, Y ) :- physical_harm(X),animal(Y ). = 1.0
The above rule specifies that the principle of physical care is violated when there is physical harm made to an animal.A rule with a score of 1.0 represents a true fact.For constructing a proof starting from the generated explanations, the remaining rules and atoms are derived from the facts generated by the LLM.For instance: compression(X) :-crush(X).= 1.0 animal(X) :-frog(X).= 1.0 pushing_force(X) :-compression(X).= 1.0</p>
<p>The solver will then attempt to unify the predicates of compression, animal, pushing force with physical harm and animal respectively.physical_harm(X) :-crush(X).= 0.672 physical_harm(X) :-compression(X).= 0.776 physical_harm(X) :-pushing_force(X).= 0.823</p>
<p>The unification score of these rules is represented by the textual similarity between two predicates.In this case, as physical_harm(X) has the highest unification score with pushing_force(X), pushing_force(X) is derived from crush(X) in a backward-chaining manner.The backwardchaining algorithm with weak unification continues until the target goal atom is met.As the model can construct multiple proofs for each goal, we derive the final output by considering the proof with the best overall unification score (Weber et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Abductive and Deductive Inference</p>
<p>After the validation step, if no proof can be constructed, or the entailed goal differs from the hypothesis predicted by the LLM, we consider the explanation to be incomplete.Therefore, Logic-Explainer uses abduction through the LLM to attempt to refine the explanation.In particular, we refer to abductive inference as a repair mechanism that searches for the missing facts in the explanation E i such that E i ∪ {h i } |= v j (Banerjee et al., 2019;Sprague et al., 2022).To this end, we employ the LLM to generate missing premises from the hypothesis and the explanatory facts that appeared in the previously constructed proof, if any (see Appendix B.6 for additional details).</p>
<p>Subsequently, to revise the hypothesis predicted in the previous iteration, we reuse the LLM to deduce a new hypothesis of moral violation from the explanation refined via abductive inference (Additional details can be found in Appendix B.5).The new hypothesis and explanations are then used as input for the next refinement step.</p>
<p>Empirical Evaluation</p>
<p>We evaluated Logic-Explainer on ethical NLI benchmarks.Specifically, we adopt the ETHICS dataset (Hendrycks et al., 2021), which provides moral questions centred around human ethical judgments in everyday scenarios.We applied three human annotators to re-annotate the dataset for multi-label classification of moral violations (for more details, see Appendix E), within an average inter-annotator agreement α = 0.705.From the annotated corpus, we sampled 166 easy and 145 challenging moral statements, which are distributed across six moral foundations.</p>
<p>Symbolic Solver</p>
<p>For the NLProlog solver, we found that a threshold of 0.5 for weak unification function and 0.13 for the proof score produces the best results.The proof score is calculated based on the aggregated product of the unification scores between the predicates (Weber et al., 2019).We applied Glove (Pennington et al., 2014) as pre-trained word embeddings for weak unification, calculating the unification score via the cosine similarity between predicates.</p>
<p>Validation Metrics</p>
<p>To accurately assess the logical validity of a generated explanation, we adopted a set of categories, inspired by the metrics proposed by Valentino et al. (2021a).The logical validity is computed automatically by comparing the hypothesis derived from the logic solver with the hypothesis inferred by the LLM.For valid explanations, we further classified them as non-redundant or redundant.Specifically, if all the premises generated by the LLM appear in the proof tree, the explanation is regarded as non-redundant.Otherwise, the explanation is redundant.For invalid explanations, we classified them as either missing plausible premises or having no discernible arguments.An explanation classified as missing plausible premises could become valid by adding reasonable premises while keeping the overall argument unaltered.No discernible arguments indicate that the generated explanation is logically invalid and cannot be rectified through the addition of premises or additional refinement.The distinction between missing plausible premises and no discernible argument is determined using human evaluation.Specially, we initially leverage the neuro-symbolic solver to automatically assess the logical correctness through the autoformalization process and construction of formal proofs.For the aspects that cannot be automatically evaluated, we further complemented this with a human evaluation, focusing on metrics such as missing plausible premises and the presence of discernible arguments.</p>
<p>Baselines</p>
<p>We compare Logic-Explainer with general incontext learning methods and Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2023).We cast the problem of identifying moral violations into a multiplechoice question-answering task to measure the performance of the models.To maintain consistency, we provide two in-context examples for both Chain-Of-Thought and Logic-Explainer.The API settings for GPT-3.5-turbo are listed in Appendix B.</p>

<p>External symbolic solvers elicit valid and complete reasoning.To understand how the solver impacts the construction of explanations, we compared the quality of the explanations produced by Logic-Explainer with Chain-of-Thought.We found that the percentage of logically valid explanations produced by Chain-of-Thought is notably low when compared to Logic-Explainer (Figure 3, Table 1 and 2).Specifically, the results show that explanations from Chain-of-Thought tend to include more general facts rather than describing the detailed reasoning process leading to its predictions.Moreover, the tables show a significant improvement in logical correctness in both settings (+24.7% and +23.5%) when comparing Logic-Explainer after 0 and 3 iterations, demonstrating the impact of multiple iterations on the quality of the explanations.In addition, we found that the symbolic reasoner can help to drastically reduce the redundancy of the explanations.LLMs with semantic prompting tend to generate redundant premises at the initial stage, with a percentage of 86.6% and 78.3% of facts not strictly necessary for the inference.While Chain-of-Thought shows less redundancy than Logic-Explainer without refinement, the results show that the symbolic solver and the constraints induced by the formal proofs can help reduce redundancy by 82% and 72.1% respectively.</p>

<p>and challenging settings.</p>
<p>Incomplete explanations impact LLMs' performance.To understand the effect of the abductive inference step on Logic-Explainer, we compare the performance at different iteration steps.We found that accuracy on moral foundations can improve from 0.528 to 0.576 in the easy setting and 0.583 to 0.591 in the hard setting after additional premises are added to the generated explanation.While Chain-of-Thought prompting also generates premises to support a given hypothesis, Logic-Explainer can improve the performance by 5.7% and 9.2% in the respective tasks.</p>
<p>The number of iterations is not linearly correlated with performance gain.Logic-Explainer shows a general trend of positively impacting logical validity, non-redundancy, completeness and correctness.However, further increasing the number of iterations does not lead to significant improvements.Specifically, the increment in logical    (Valentino et al., 2021a).</p>
<p>validity from iteration 2 to 3 is marginal, showing a 3.1% increase in the easy setting and a 3.5% increase in the hard setting.This contrasts with the more substantial improvements observed between iterations 1 and 2, where the increases were 8.4% and 10.3% in the easy and hard settings (Table 1 and Table 2).We consistently observed an improvement over the model with 0 iterations on the effect of the interaction between abductive and deductive inference, while the best results are achieved with 1 and 2 iterations in the hard settings, as shown in Table 3.This behaviour is mainly caused by the inability of LLMs to interpret increasingly complex feedback cycles for longer explanatory chains, and the inability to find new missing facts via abductive inference for completing the explanatory argument after a certain number of iterations, with performance peaking at 2-3 iterations.</p>
<p>Neo-Davidsonian semantics enhances logical consistency in complex sentence representation.</p>
<p>Logic-Explainer with no iterations significantly outperforms Chain-of-Thought, as shown in both Table 1 and Table 2. Chain-of-Thought prompting often fails to incorporate all critical information during the explanation generation process, especially for long and complex explanatory sentences.This outperformance highlights the effectiveness of representing these sentences using Neo-Davidsonian event semantics with a formal predicate-argument structure, which preserves information content and the fidelity of translation from natural language to formal language.The representation aligns well with the target corpus, as a significant number of ethical explanation sentences refer to frames that are closely aligned with the features of this formalism.</p>
<p>Logical invalidity is mainly caused by missing premises.We conducted a human evaluation of invalid explanations produced by the model by randomly sampling 30% of statements for each moral violation, classifying invalid explanations into two categories: (a) missing plausible premises and, (b) no discernible arguments according to the classification proposed by Valentino et al. (2021a).On average, we found that 82.1% of invalid explanations are classified as missing plausible premises.These results suggest that while in-context learning can elicit the identification of coherent arguments to support a given hypothesis, LLMs still suffer from incompleteness in their reasoning process.This highlights the effectiveness and importance of our work in making explanations produced by LLMs more explicit and, therefore, more easily verifiable.</p>
<p>Case Study</p>
<p>Table 5 presents examples of explanations generated at each iteration by Logic-Explainer for the statement "I left from the prison without checking out".Initially, Logic-Explainer generates an explanation based on the semantic roles, indicating that prison is an institution of authority.However, the solver is unable to construct a proof from these facts due to a missing plausible premise which states the act as a disobedient behaviour.Subsequently, the model employs an abductive inference step to discover missing premises for the entailment to hold.The generated explanations are then proven as valid but redundant as there are irrelevant premises in the explanation.The logic rea- Premises: Prisons are institutions established by the government to punish and rehabilitate criminals.Leaving a prison without permission or proper checkout procedures is considered a breach of prison rules.The prison authorities have the legal power to detain and control the movements of inmates.Failure to follow the proper checkout procedures can lead to security risks and potential harm to both inmates and the public.The act of leaving a prison without permission can be considered a form of disobedience towards the authority figures who run the prison, such as the guards and administrators.Disrespect towards authority figures and institutions can lead to legal consequences and social stigma.The act of leaving a prison without permission can be seen as a challenge to the authority and legitimacy of the justice system.Hypothesis: Violate the norm of authority Valid but redundant 2 Iteration I left from the prison without checking out.</p>

<p>Corpus: ExplainEthics</p>
<p>To encourage future research in the field, we augmented the corpus of ETHICS (Hendrycks et al., 2021) with logically structured explanations for morally unacceptable statements constructed by Logic-Explainer and released a corpus containing a total of 311 statements with generated explanations and annotated moral violations.Specifically, we generated the corpus adopting Logic-Explainer to generate and verify logical correctness in the explanations, providing the model with the correct moral foundation annotated by humans and then iteratively verifying the explanation using the symbolic solver.Once the explanatory chain is verified by the hybrid framework, we add the instance to the corpus.247 out of 311 instances were successfully verified by the symbolic solver within a maximum of 4 iterations.For the remaining examples, we manually added explanatory sentences to make them logically valid.These explanations exhibit high lexical overlap and logical coherence, potentially supporting future work on multi-hop reasoning and explanation evaluation.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Multi-Hop Reasoning.Multi-hop reasoning has been widely studied in explanation regeneration (Valentino et al., 2021b), open domain question answering (Dua et al., 2021;Fu et al., 2021;Xu et al., 2021) and fact retrieving (Lee et al., 2022;Shi et al., 2021a) tasks.Sprague et al. (2022) proposed a bidirectional framework that applies deductive inference to deduce the goal and uses abductive inference to find missing premises to reach the maximum coverage of the premises for a hypothesis.Jung et al. (2022) also proposed Maieutic Prompting that abductively induce explanations to recursively maintain the logical consistency.Our task applied an abductive-deductive framework to iteratively find missing premises and automatically drop irrelevant facts in the search space to maintain the coherency and non-redundancy of the generated explanation.</p>
<p>Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning.Neuro-symbolic models are methods that integrate neural networks with symbolic logic solvers to enhance the inference ability of rule-based models, allowing them to work with larger datasets while maintaining interpretable inference.Several models (Liu et al., 2020;Jiang and Bansal, 2019;Weber et al., 2019;Thayaparan et al., 2022) have been introduced for performing multi-step logical inference in multihop reasoning tasks, using neural networks to improve robustness.Moreover, (Pan et al., 2023a;Lyu et al., 2023;Olausson et al., 2023) have proposed the integration of LLMs with symbolic solvers to enhance the faithfulness and reliability of reasoning processes in the domain of mathematical reasoning, multi-hop reasoning, and commonsense reasoning.Yang et al. (2022) applied neuro-symbolic reasoning as a validation model with the aim to generate logically valid inferences.Our approach involves extracting knowledge from LLMs and using a Prolog solver to automatically verify the logical correctness of the formed explanation without additional human annotation.</p>
<p>LLMs Self-Refinements.Self-refinement strategies for addressing the challenges of hallucination and unfaithful reasoning in LLMs have been broadly studied in recent works, both through internal (Madaan et al., 2023;Gero et al., 2023) and external feedback (Akyurek et al., 2023;Gao et al., 2023;Yan et al., 2023).Internal feedback uses the LLM itself to iteratively refine the output from previous steps until a gold standard is reached.External feedback refines the outputs based on the feedback from external tools, external knowledge sources or external metrics, either in the format of scalar values or natural language sentences (Pan et al., 2023b).We refine the quality of the generated outputs using external feedback on solvability and symbolic information from the constructed proof of a neuro-symbolic reasoner.This ensures the logical consistency, completeness and absence of redundancy in downstream tasks by processing symbolic self-refinement on the generated outputs.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework for ethical reasoning integrating in-context learning and external solvers.We introduced a validation model to verify the logical correctness of generated explanations.Our proposed model iteratively refines the explanations for ethical questions, resulting in logically valid, more complete, and non-redundant explanations that can form a coherent reasoning chain supporting a hypothesis.We have significantly reduced the instances of hallucination and redundancy in LLMs, effectively demonstrating the benefits of integrating LLMs with logical/symbolic reasoning.In future work, we aspire to enhance the model's inference capabilities concerning challenging moral questions and further improve its capacity for building coherent explanations.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>In-context learning has limited capabilities when performing more challenging and nuanced ethical reasoning tasks.While the proposed framework has significantly increased logical correctness and decreased redundancy, there are still major areas for further investigation, including in settings which deliberate over diverse ethical perspectives.The current differentiable solver reasons through implication rules such as "p1(X, Y ) ⇐ p2(X), p3(Y )" and does not provide a complete logical-linguistic representation for more complex ethical/explanatory reasoning.Despite the fact that the proposed model can make zero-shot inferences for ethically related questions following the rules of moral foundations, it cannot precisely reason on complex moral scenarios and dilemmas, which need careful philosophical consideration.</p>
<p>While the ethical domain is wide-ranging, the current scenarios of our target dataset were written in English and annotated by people in the field of sociology, natural language processing and management science.However, people from different cultures may interpret the same moral-related statement differently.Thus, a broader inter-annotator study reflecting diverse cultural perspectives is also desirable for evaluating ethical statements in future work.</p>
<p>Ethics Statement</p>
<p>The proposed framework is designed to enhance the logical consistency of explanations generated for ethically-related scenarios.The dataset we used is publicly available and has previously undergone an ethical assessment.Additionally, this dataset was annotated by augmenting a classification of moral foundations for covering more concrete scenarios, along with automatically verified explana-tory sentences.The moral foundations were annotated by human annotators.We conducted an inter-annotator agreement process to minimise bias in the classification of moral foundations.However, some potential bias in classifying these foundations may still exist.</p>
<p>A Algorithm</p>
<p>Algorithm 1 formalises the pipeline of Logic-Explainer.The input statement s is a natural language sentence that describes an everyday scenario related to moral judgement (i.e.I throw the garbage to my neighbor's house).The logic reasoner r is the differentiable logic solver that will build a proof and attempt to entail a hypothesis.The argumentation model A is the model applied to convert a fact (i.e.neighbor are friends) to Prolog (i.e.friend(X):-neighbor(X). = 1.0) based on the rule of p 1 (X) ⇐ p2(X), p 1 (X, Y ) ⇐ p 2 (X), p 3 (Y ) and p 1 (X, Z) ⇐ p 2 (X, Y ), p 3 (Y, Z).The moral principles P describe the definitions of moral violations in terms of moral foundation.The semantic inference model m s generate the initial explanation and hypothesis of the input statement.</p>

<p>C Scalability</p>
<p>We also measured the scalability of Logic-Explainer, as shown in Figure 10.Experiments were conducted to compare the inference time of the neuro-symbolic logic reasoner against the number of facts and rules in the reasoner's knowledge base, within a threshold of similarity function of 0.5 and 0.13 for the proof score.To evaluate the model's scalability, we selected facts and rules that are both solvable and unsolvable, including some relevant but unused facts and rules in the knowledge base.As the number of facts and rules increased to 1000, the inference time remained under 0.5 seconds.The right diagram in Figure 10

<p>E Moral Foundations and Inter-Annotator Agreement</p>
<p>The original dataset only provides information about binary morality classification.These scenarios are constructed using human-annotated sentences from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).</p>
<p>For the multi-label classification of moral violations, we applied three human annotators to assign labels based on the norms of care, fairness, authority, sanctity, loyalty, and liberty (Clifford et al., 2015).The three human annotators are students from the UK in the field of sociology, natural language processing and management science recruited according to the university regulations.The complete definitions of these moral violations are listed in the table 7, which stands for the abstract explanation of the related moral principles.Table 6 shows the inter-annotator agreement of the multilabel classification task, calculated using Krippendorff's Alpha.Figures 12 and 13 show screenshots of the instructions for the human annotator to annotate the dataset.</p>
