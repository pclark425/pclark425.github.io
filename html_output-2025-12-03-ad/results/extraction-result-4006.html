                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs, is developed, a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document which exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.</p>

<h2>OpenAI*</h2>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top $10 \%$ of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformerbased model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than $1 / 1,000$ th the compute of GPT-4.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>This technical report presents GPT-4, a large multimodal model capable of processing image and text inputs and producing text outputs. Such models are an important area of study as they have the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, such as dialogue systems, text summarization, and machine translation. As such, they have been the subject of substantial interest and progress in recent years $[1-34]$.
One of the main goals of developing such models is to improve their ability to understand and generate natural language text, particularly in more complex and nuanced scenarios. To test its capabilities in such scenarios, GPT-4 was evaluated on a variety of exams originally designed for humans. In these evaluations it performs quite well and often outscores the vast majority of human test takers. For example, on a simulated bar exam, GPT-4 achieves a score that falls in the top $10 \%$ of test takers. This contrasts with GPT-3.5, which scores in the bottom $10 \%$.</p>
<p>On a suite of traditional NLP benchmarks, GPT-4 outperforms both previous large language models and most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark [35, 36], an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4 not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages. On translated variants of MMLU, GPT-4 surpasses the English-language state-of-the-art in 24 of 26 languages considered. We discuss these model capability results, as well as model safety improvements and results, in more detail in later sections.</p>
<p>This report also discusses a key challenge of the project, developing deep learning infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to make predictions about the expected performance of GPT-4 (based on small runs trained in similar ways) that were tested against the final run to increase confidence in our training.
Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations to earlier GPT models [1, 37, 38]: it is not fully reliable (e.g. can suffer from "hallucinations"), has a limited context window, and does not learn</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>from experience. Care should be taken when using the outputs of GPT-4, particularly in contexts where reliability is important.</p>
<p>GPT-4's capabilities and limitations create significant and novel safety challenges, and we believe careful study of these challenges is an important area of research given the potential societal impact. This report includes an extensive system card (after the Appendix) describing some of the risks we foresee around bias, disinformation, over-reliance, privacy, cybersecurity, proliferation, and more. It also describes interventions we made to mitigate potential harms from the deployment of GPT-4, including adversarial testing with domain experts, and a model-assisted safety pipeline.</p>
<h1>2 Scope and Limitations of this Technical Report</h1>
<p>This report focuses on the capabilities, limitations, and safety properties of GPT-4. GPT-4 is a Transformer-style model [39] pre-trained to predict the next token in a document, using both publicly available data (such as internet data) and data licensed from third-party providers. The model was then fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [40]. Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of large-scale models like GPT-4, this report contains no further details about the architecture (including model size), hardware, training compute, dataset construction, training method, or similar.</p>
<p>We are committed to independent auditing of our technologies, and shared some initial steps and ideas in this area in the system card accompanying this release. ${ }^{2}$ We plan to make further technical details available to additional third parties who can advise us on how to weigh the competitive and safety considerations above against the scientific value of further transparency.</p>
<h2>3 Predictable Scaling</h2>
<p>A large focus of the GPT-4 project was building a deep learning stack that scales predictably. The primary reason is that for very large training runs like GPT-4, it is not feasible to do extensive model-specific tuning. To address this, we developed infrastructure and optimization methods that have very predictable behavior across multiple scales. These improvements allowed us to reliably predict some aspects of the performance of GPT-4 from smaller models trained using $1,000 \times-$ $10,000 \times$ less compute.</p>
<h3>3.1 Loss Prediction</h3>
<p>The final loss of properly-trained large language models is thought to be well approximated by power laws in the amount of compute used to train the model [41, 42, 2, 14, 15].</p>
<p>To verify the scalability of our optimization infrastructure, we predicted GPT-4's final loss on our internal codebase (not part of the training set) by fitting a scaling law with an irreducible loss term (as in Henighan et al. [15]): $L(C)=a C^{b}+c$, from models trained using the same methodology but using at most 10,000x less compute than GPT-4. This prediction was made shortly after the run started, without use of any partial results. The fitted scaling law predicted GPT-4's final loss with high accuracy (Figure 1).</p>
<h3>3.2 Scaling of Capabilities on HumanEval</h3>
<p>Having a sense of the capabilities of a model before training can improve decisions around alignment, safety, and deployment. In addition to predicting final loss, we developed methodology to predict more interpretable metrics of capability. One such metric is pass rate on the HumanEval dataset [43], which measures the ability to synthesize Python functions of varying complexity. We successfully predicted the pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset by extrapolating from models trained with at most $1,000 \times$ less compute (Figure 2).</p>
<p>For an individual problem in HumanEval, performance may occasionally worsen with scale. Despite these challenges, we find an approximate power law relationship $-\mathrm{E}_{P}[\log ($ pass_rate(C) $)]=\alpha * \mathrm{C}^{-k}$</p>

<p>Figure 1. Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models. The metric is final loss on a dataset derived from our internal codebase. This is a convenient, large dataset of code tokens which is not contained in the training set. We chose to look at loss because it tends to be less noisy than other measures across different amounts of training compute. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4's final loss. The x -axis is training compute normalized so that GPT-4 is 1 .</p>

<p>Figure 2. Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models. The metric is mean log pass rate on a subset of the HumanEval dataset. A power law fit to the smaller models (excluding GPT-4) is shown as the dotted line; this fit accurately predicts GPT-4's performance. The x -axis is training compute normalized so that GPT-4 is 1 .</p>
<p>where $k$ and $\alpha$ are positive constants, and $P$ is a subset of problems in the dataset. We hypothesize that this relationship holds for all problems in this dataset. In practice, very low pass rates are difficult or impossible to estimate, so we restrict to problems $P$ and models $M$ such that given some large sample budget, every problem is solved at least once by every model.
We registered predictions for GPT-4's performance on HumanEval before training completed, using only information available prior to training. All but the 15 hardest HumanEval problems were split into 6 difficulty buckets based on the performance of smaller models. The results on the $3^{\text {rd }}$ easiest bucket are shown in Figure 2, showing that the resulting predictions were very accurate for this subset of HumanEval problems where we can accurately estimate $\log ($ pass_rate $)$ for several smaller models. Predictions on the other five buckets performed almost as well, the main exception being GPT-4 underperforming our predictions on the easiest bucket.
Certain capabilities remain hard to predict. For example, the Inverse Scaling Prize [44] proposed several tasks for which model performance decreases as a function of scale. Similarly to a recent result by Wei et al. [45], we find that GPT-4 reverses this trend, as shown on one of the tasks called Hindsight Neglect [46] in Figure 3.</p>

<p>Figure 3. Performance of GPT-4 and smaller models on the Hindsight Neglect task. Accuracy is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. ada, babbage, and curie refer to models available via the OpenAI API [47].</p>
<p>We believe that accurately predicting future capabilities is important for safety. Going forward we plan to refine these methods and register performance predictions across various capabilities before large model training begins, and we hope this becomes a common goal in the field.</p>
<h1>4 Capabilities</h1>
<p>We tested GPT-4 on a diverse set of benchmarks, including simulating exams that were originally designed for humans. ${ }^{4}$ We did no specific training for these exams. A minority of the problems in the exams were seen by the model during training; for each exam we run a variant with these questions removed and report the lower score of the two. We believe the results to be representative. For further details on contamination (methodology and per-exam statistics), see Appendix C.
Exams were sourced from publicly-available materials. Exam questions included both multiplechoice and free-response questions; we designed separate prompts for each format, and images were included in the input for questions which required it. The evaluation setup was designed based on performance on a validation set of exams, and we report final results on held-out test exams. Overall scores were determined by combining multiple-choice and free-response question scores using publicly available methodologies for each exam. We estimate and report the percentile each overall score corresponds to. See Appendix A for further details on the exam evaluation methodology.</p>

<p>Figure 4. GPT performance on academic and professional exams. In each case, we simulate the conditions and scoring of the real exam. Exams are ordered from low to high based on GPT-3.5 performance. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 on most exams tested. To be conservative we report the lower end of the range of percentiles, but this creates some artifacts on the AP exams which have very wide scoring bins. For example although GPT-4 attains the highest possible score on AP Biology (5/5), this is only shown in the plot as 85th percentile because 15 percent of test-takers achieve that score.</p>
<p>GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on the majority of these professional and academic exams. Notably, it passes a simulated version of the Uniform Bar Examination with a score in the top 10\% of test takers (Table 1, Figure 4).</p>
<p>The model's capabilities on exams appear to stem primarily from the pre-training process and are not significantly affected by RLHF. On multiple choice questions, both the base GPT-4 model and the RLHF model perform equally well on average across the exams we tested (see Appendix B).</p>
<p>We also evaluated the pre-trained base GPT-4 model on traditional benchmarks designed for evaluating language models. For each benchmark we report, we ran contamination checks for test data appearing in the training set (see Appendix D for full details on per-benchmark contamination). ${ }^{5}$ We used few-shot prompting [1] for all benchmarks when evaluating GPT-4. ${ }^{6}$</p>
<p>GPT-4 considerably outperforms existing language models, as well as previously state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems which often have benchmark-specific crafting or additional training protocols (Table 2).</p>

<p>Table 2. Performance of GPT-4 on academic benchmarks. We compare GPT-4 alongside the best SOTA (with benchmark-specific training) and the best SOTA for an LM evaluated few-shot. GPT-4 outperforms existing LMs on all benchmarks, and beats SOTA with benchmark-specific training on all datasets except DROP. For each task we report GPT-4's performance along with the few-shot method used to evaluate. For GSM-8K, we included part of the training set in the GPT-4 pre-training mix (see Appendix E), and we use chain-of-thought prompting [11] when evaluating. For multiple-choice questions, we present all answers (ABCD) to the model and ask it to choose the letter of the answer, similarly to how a human would solve such a problem.</p>
<p>Many existing ML benchmarks are written in English. To gain an initial understanding of GPT-4's capabilities in other languages, we translated the MMLU benchmark [35, 36] - a suite of multiplechoice problems spanning 57 subjects - into a variety of languages using Azure Translate (see Appendix F for example translations and prompts). We find that GPT-4 outperforms the Englishlanguage performance of GPT 3.5 and existing language models (Chinchilla [2] and PaLM [3]) for the majority of languages we tested, including low-resource languages such as Latvian, Welsh, and Swahili (Figure 5).</p>
<p>GPT-4 substantially improves over previous models in the ability to follow user intent [63]. On a dataset of 5,214 prompts submitted to ChatGPT [64] and the OpenAI API [47], the responses generated by GPT-4 were preferred over the responses generated by GPT-3.5 on $70.2 \%$ of prompts. ${ }^{7}$

<h1>4.1 Visual Inputs</h1>
<p>GPT-4 accepts prompts consisting of both images and text, which - parallel to the text-only setting - lets the user specify any vision or language task. Specifically, the model generates text outputs given inputs consisting of arbitrarily interlaced text and images. Over a range of domains - including documents with text and photographs, diagrams, or screenshots - GPT-4 exhibits similar capabilities as it does on text-only inputs. An example of GPT-4's visual input can be found in Table 3. The standard test-time techniques developed for language models (e.g. few-shot prompting, chain-ofthought, etc) are similarly effective when using both images and text - see Appendix G for examples.
Preliminary results on a narrow set of academic vision benchmarks can be found in the GPT-4 blog post [65]. We plan to release more information about GPT-4's visual capabilities in follow-up work.</p>

<h1>5 Limitations</h1>
<p>Despite its capabilities, GPT-4 has similar limitations as earlier GPT models. Most importantly, it still is not fully reliable (it "hallucinates" facts and makes reasoning errors). Great care should be taken when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts, with the exact protocol (such as human review, grounding with additional context, or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether) matching the needs of specific applications. See our System Card for details.
GPT-4 significantly reduces hallucinations relative to previous GPT-3.5 models (which have themselves been improving with continued iteration). GPT-4 scores 19 percentage points higher than our latest GPT-3.5 on our internal, adversarially-designed factuality evaluations (Figure 6).</p>
<h2>Internal factual eval by category</h2>
<p>Accuracy
<img alt="img-6.jpeg" src="img-6.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6. Performance of GPT-4 on nine internal adversarially-designed factuality evaluations. Accuracy is shown on the y-axis, higher is better. An accuracy of 1.0 means the model's answers are judged to be in agreement with human ideal responses for all questions in the eval. We compare GPT-4 to three earlier versions of ChatGPT [64] based on GPT-3.5; GPT-4 improves on the latest GPT-3.5 model by 19 percentage points, with significant gains across all topics.</p>
<p>GPT-4 makes progress on public benchmarks like TruthfulQA [66], which tests the model's ability to separate fact from an adversarially-selected set of incorrect statements (Figure 7). These questions are paired with factually incorrect answers that are statistically appealing. The GPT-4 base model is only slightly better at this task than GPT-3.5; however, after RLHF post-training we observe large improvements over GPT-3.5. ${ }^{9}$ Table 4 shows both a correct and an incorrect answer. GPT-4 resists selecting common sayings (you can't teach an old dog new tricks), however it still can miss subtle details (Elvis Presley was not the son of an actor, so Perkins is the correct answer).
GPT-4 generally lacks knowledge of events that have occurred after the vast majority of its pre-training data cuts off in September $2021^{10}$, and does not learn from its experience. It can sometimes make simple reasoning errors which do not seem to comport with competence across so many domains, or be overly gullible in accepting obviously false statements from a user. It can fail at hard problems the same way humans do, such as introducing security vulnerabilities into code it produces.
GPT-4 can also be confidently wrong in its predictions, not taking care to double-check work when it's likely to make a mistake. Interestingly, the pre-trained model is highly calibrated (its predicted</p>

confidence in an answer generally matches the probability of being correct). However, after the post-training process, the calibration is reduced (Figure 8).
GPT-4 has various biases in its outputs that we have taken efforts to correct but which will take some time to fully characterize and manage. We aim to make GPT-4 and other systems we build have reasonable default behaviors that reflect a wide swath of users' values, allow those systems to be customized within some broad bounds, and get public input on what those bounds should be. See OpenAI [68] for more details.</p>
<h2>6 Risks \&amp; mitigations</h2>
<p>We invested significant effort towards improving the safety and alignment of GPT-4. Here we highlight our use of domain experts for adversarial testing and red-teaming, and our model-assisted safety pipeline [69] and the improvement in safety metrics over prior models.
Adversarial Testing via Domain Experts: GPT-4 poses similar risks as smaller language models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT-4 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged</p>

over 50 experts from domains such as long-term AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, and international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test model behavior in high-risk areas which require niche expertise to evaluate, as well as assess risks that will become relevant for very advanced Als such as power seeking [70]. Recommendations and training data gathered from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model; for example, we've collected additional data to improve GPT-4's ability to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals (Table 5).
Model-Assisted Safety Pipeline: As with prior GPT models, we fine-tune the model's behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) [40, 63] to produce responses better aligned with the user's intent. However, after RLHF, our models can still be brittle on unsafe inputs as well as sometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. These undesired behaviors can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified during reward model data collection portion of the RLHF pipeline. When given unsafe inputs, the model may generate undesirable content, such as giving advice on committing crimes. Furthermore, the model may also become overly cautious on safe inputs, refusing innocuous requests or excessively hedging. To steer our models towards appropriate behaviour at a more fine-grained level, we rely heavily on our models themselves as tools. Our approach to safety consists of two main components, an additional set of safety-relevant RLHF training prompts, and rule-based reward models (RBRMs).
Our rule-based reward models (RBRMs) are a set of zero-shot GPT-4 classifiers. These classifiers provide an additional reward signal to the GPT-4 policy model during RLHF fine-tuning that targets</p>

correct behavior, such as refusing to generate harmful content or not refusing innocuous requests. The RBRM takes three inputs: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy model, and a human-written rubric (e.g., a set of rules in multiple-choice style) for how this output should be evaluated. Then, the RBRM classifies the output based on the rubric. For example, we can provide a rubric that instructs the model to classify a response as one of: (a) a refusal in the desired style, (b) a refusal in the undesired style (e.g., evasive or rambling), (c) containing disallowed content, or (d) a safe non-refusal response. Then on the set of safety-relevant training prompts, which request harmful content such as illicit advice, we can reward GPT-4 for refusing these requests. Conversely, we can reward GPT-4 for not refusing requests on a subset of prompts guaranteed to be safe and answerable. This technique is related to work by Glaese et al. [71] and Perez et al. [72]. This, combined with other improvements such as computing optimal RBRM weights and providing additional SFT data targeting the areas we want to improve, allowed us to steer the model closer towards the desired behaviour.</p>
<p>Improvements on Safety Metrics: Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT-4's safety properties. We've decreased the model's tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content (Table 6) by $82 \%$ compared to GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 responds to sensitive requests (e.g., medical advice and self-harm, Table 7) in accordance with our policies 29\% more often (Figure 9). On the RealToxicityPrompts dataset [73], GPT-4 produces toxic generations only $0.73 \%$ of the time, while GPT-3.5 generates toxic content $6.48 \%$ of time.</p>
<p><img alt="img-9.jpeg" src="img-9.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9. Rate of incorrect behavior on sensitive and disallowed prompts. Lower values are better. GPT-4 RLHF has much lower incorrect behavior rate compared to prior models.</p>
<p>Overall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. For example, there still exist "jailbreaks" (e.g., adversarial system messages, see Figure 10 in the System Card for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines. So long as these limitations exist, it's important to complement them with deployment-time safety techniques like monitoring for abuse as well as a pipeline for fast iterative model improvement.</p>
<p>GPT-4 and successor models have the potential to significantly influence society in both beneficial and harmful ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in future systems. We will soon publish recommendations on steps society can take to prepare for AI's effects and initial ideas for projecting AI's possible economic impacts.</p>
<h1>7 Conclusion</h1>
<p>We characterize GPT-4, a large multimodal model with human-level performance on certain difficult professional and academic benchmarks. GPT-4 outperforms existing large language models on a collection of NLP tasks, and exceeds the vast majority of reported state-of-the-art systems (which often include task-specific fine-tuning). We find that improved capabilities, whilst usually measured in English, can be demonstrated in many different languages. We highlight how predictable scaling allowed us to make accurate predictions on the loss and capabilities of GPT-4.
GPT-4 presents new risks due to increased capability, and we discuss some of the methods and results taken to understand and improve its safety and alignment. Though there remains much work to be done, GPT-4 represents a significant step towards broadly useful and safely deployed AI systems.</p>
