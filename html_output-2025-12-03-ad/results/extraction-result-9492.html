<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We present a new framework integrating the AI model GPT-4 into the iterative process of reticular chemistry experimentation, leveraging a cooperative workflow of interaction between AI and a human researcher. This GPT-4 Reticular Chemist is an integrated system composed of three phases. Each of these utilizes GPT-4 in various capacities, wherein GPT-4 provides detailed instructions for chemical experimentation and the human provides feedback on the experimental outcomes, including both success and failures, for the in-context learning of AI in the next iteration. This iterative human-AI interaction enabled GPT-4 to learn from the outcomes, much like an experienced chemist, by a prompt-learning strategy. Importantly, the system is based on natural language for both development and operation, eliminating the need for coding skills, and thus, make it accessible to all chemists. Our collaboration with GPT-4 Reticular Chemist guided the discovery of an isoreticular series of MOFs, with each synthesis fine-tuned through iterative feedback and expert suggestions. This workflow presents a potential for broader applications in scientific research by harnessing the capability of large language models like GPT-4 to enhance the feasibility and efficiency of research activities.</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The advancement of reticular chemistry relies on our ability to expand the repertoire of materials and devise innovative strategies to exploit their properties. ${ }^{[1]}$ The mastery of this chemistry requires working knowledge in various disciplines of chemistry (organic, inorganic, physical, analytical, and computational), physics, biology, as well as material science and engineering. ${ }^{[1 c, 2]}$ However, training a reticular chemist to such a degree of proficiency is time-intensive, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of project design and workflow, as well as expertise beyond the traditional confines of chemistry. Indeed, the development of this depth and breadth of knowledge is typically acquired over years of education and training. We believe that the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI) and more specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 are poised to help bridge the knowledge gap between these disciplines and do so with efficiency and speed. ${ }^{[3]}$
Implementation of this vision requires the seamless integration of Al models into the day-to-day activities and workflow of a reticular chemist. ${ }^{[4]}$ In the present report, we use GPT-4 as a demonstration of how this could be done. GPT-4, being proficient in language comprehension, ${ }^{[3 \mathrm{c}, 5]}$ can facilitate experiment design, ${ }^{[6]}$ review and summarize research articles, ${ }^{[7]}$ provide educational introductions to various concepts and techniques, ${ }^{[8]}$ and assist in data interpretation ${ }^{[9]}$ when guided by carefully

<p>Figure 1. Schematic representation of the GPT-4 based framework functioning as an advanced reticular chemist through strategic prompt engineering and incontext learning informed by human feedback. This GPT-4 Reticular Chemist workflow encapsulates three states: the "Reticular ChemScope", responsible for devising the foundational research project blueprint by dividing it into major domains of activity; the "Reticular ChemNavigator", which assesses the latest activities and presents three potential task options for the human researcher; and the "Reticular ChemExecutor" that furnishes comprehensive procedural guidelines for the selected task, facilitating step-by-step human engagement. All three states are powered by GPT-4 but are given three different types of prompts. The GPT-4's incontext learning capacity is nurtured through a combination of a pre-engineered prompt system and continual human feedback, linked to each task performed. The development and execution of this workflow only require natural language, with no coding involved.</p>
<p>designed prompts with explicit instructions. ${ }^{[3f, 5 c, 10]}$ Yet, as it stands, GPT-4 alone lacks the capability to perform a core component of chemistry - experimentation, which is essentially a series of iterative trial-and-error cycles driven by observations and hypotheses. Here, we show initial steps for integrating GPT-4 into the iterative process of chemical experimentation and propose a novel framework wherein GPT-4 works in tandem with a human researcher at any expertise level. Our strategy features having GPT-4 provide detailed step-by-step instructions for experiments, and the human researcher carries out these procedures and provides detailed feedback on the observations and results. This iterative in-context learning process allows the GPT-4 Reticular Chemist to have access to the experimental outcomes, thereby enabling it to learn from both successes and failures, just like an experienced chemist. This humanAI interaction loop continues until the project goal is achieved, with GPT-4 dynamically adjusting its strategy based on the outcomes of previous iterations. This innovative approach reaps mutual benefits - GPT-4 Reticular Chemist gains real-world experimental validation of its plans and learns from the outcomes, and the human benefits from accelerated research progress under the professional guidance of GPT-4, akin to having a personalized mentor.</p>
<h1>Results and Discussion</h1>
<p>We designed a novel prompt learning strategy framework that integrates GPT-4 into reticular chemistry, utilizing human feedback to expedite the discovery of new MOFs. Impressively, this symbiotic human-AI collaboration based on two-way learning process led to the sequential discovery of four isoreticular MOFs bearing the same generic chemical formula of $\left[\mathrm{Al}<em 3="3">{3}(\mu-\mathrm{OH})</em>)\right]$ and further defined and elaborated below. Notably, the synthesis of these MOFs and their linkers and the subsequent optimization and characterization were all designed by GPT-4 and executed by the human researcher.
Our developed framework allows the fast adaptation of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 to the realm of reticular chemistry via prompt engineering and in-context learning, driven by human feedback. The process comprises three interlinked phases, each employing GPT-4 as a reticular chemist with varying degrees of interaction with human counterparts through tailored prompts, we termed Reticular ChemScope, Reticular ChemNavigator, and Reticular ChemExecutor, which are illustrated in Figure 1.
The first phase Reticular ChemScope had GPT-4 create a project blueprint based on given inputs, followed by the second phase Reticular ChemNavigator where the GPT-4 suggested tasks and guided progress based on human feedback. Lastly, in the third phase Reticular ChemExecutor, GPT-4 provided detailed task steps and a feedback template, enabling effective task execution and improvement. The detailed design and description of each phase can be found in the Materials and Methods Section (Supporting Information, Section S1). In addition, an interactive prompt refinement strategy was used to enable GPT-4 to self-compose prompts by providing role descriptions and duties, which were then refined through an iterative process of suggesting, testing, and improvement. The final versions of the prompts for all three phases are depicted in Figures S36-S41.
It should be emphasized that the ChemNavigator serves as the heart of the three-phase framework. It is where most of the proposed experiment - human wet lab experiments - feedback loop takes place and serves as the cornerstone of our human-AI interaction research design. Inspired by previous studies on prompt engineering of GPT models, ${ }^{[11]}$ our prompt was designed to include specific elements such as role definition, goal instructions, memory of previous trials, evaluation process, and structured output as three task choices. These elements were included based on our reasoning to ensure that the input information is provided in an explicit way, to store a summarized memory of the previous information, and to make GPT-4's logic in suggesting tasks more interpretable. Together, they contribute to GPT-4's reticular chemist behavior, manageability of development process, accumulation of past learning, interpretability and transparency in GPT-4's decision-making process, and variety of task choices based on available resources or schedules, respectively. Following the proposed task by ChemNavigator, the ChemExecutor then makes a detailed experimental plan for the human.
In particular, each iteration involves a single instance of human-AI conversation. It begins with the human sharing a summary of prior experiments, successes, and failures, which GPT-4 processes as "memory". GPT-4 also considers the most recent task it had recommended in the previous iteration, along with the human's feedback on the outcomes. The central question posed to GPT-4 is how to advance, given the current status of the project, to achieve the goal of discovering and studying a new MOF. Hence, even if every time a new dialogue session is initiated, GPT-4 capitalizes on in-context learning from prior interactions, allowing it to pick up from the latest point of progress. Using this information, GPT-4 evaluates the current state of the project, updates its memory to include a description of the last trial and errors, and suggests three potential actions. These actions are all aimed at progressing towards the completion of the current stage. Since the GPT-4 was asked to come up with reasoning behind its suggestions, the human researcher can critically evaluate them. This evaluation aids in selecting a course of action, based not only on its merit but also on the availability of resources, laboratory instruments, and the expertise level of the human researcher. Subsequent to the task's execution, as guided by GPT-4's instructions, the human documents the observations and summarizes the outcomes. This summary, presented to GPT-4 in textual format, reinforces its in-context learning, assisting it in making more informed decisions in subsequent steps. This iterative process continues until GPT-4 identifies progress indicators that align with the objectives indicated in the current stage's description and provides an explanation (Supporting Information, Section S8). Guided by GPT-4's suggestions, the human researcher then decides whether to proceed to the next stage or continue refining the current one.}(\mathrm{HCOO})_{3}(\mathrm{BTB}-\mathrm{X</p>
<p>The complete journey of MOF discovery involved the use of GPT-4 Reticular Chemist workflow outlined in Figure 1 and encompasses the creation of four new MOFs (Figure 2a: MOF-521-H, -oF, -mF, - $\mathrm{CH}<em 3="3">{3}$ ) as detailed in Figures S47-S165, where the input into and the output from GPT-4 are shown. Notably, one of these compounds, MOF-521-H, was previously discovered accidentally as a byproduct during the synthesis of MOF-520, ${ }^{[12]}$ another BTB-based aluminum MOF, and remained unpublished. GPT-4 Reticular Chemist, however, unaware of and thus unbiased by the synthesis details from this previous study, independently designed a strategy for these four new MOFs, including MOF-521-H. Interestingly, the optimized synthesis condition established by GPT-4 was subtly different from what humans had previously discovered alone (Supporting Information, Section S2 and Section S9).
Succinctly, upon initiation, the first stage saw Reticular ChemNavigator guiding the human researcher to seek synthesis routes to obtain the linkers, primarily through a thorough literature review (Figures S1-S6). Following a preliminary plan for synthesis, the dialogue directed the human to conduct the organic synthesis reaction, overcome the challenges, and finally confirm the linker by proton NMR (Figures S7-S10). With the linkers in hand, and guiding the human in summarizing the literature search, ${ }^{[13]}$ the second research phase phase focused on identifying the best conditions for MOFs formation, encompassing modifications to metal-linker ratio, temperature, reaction time, modulator(s), and their proportion (Table 1 and Supporting Information, Section S9). Alongside powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), microscopic observations were used to report the progress. After several rounds of optimization guided by the suggestions of Reticular ChemNavigator, single crystals of all compounds were obtained. Except for MOF-521- $\mathrm{CH}</em>$
}$, whose rod-shaped single crystals were too small for single crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD), the remaining three compounds were sufficiently large to have their structures characterized by SXRD. ${ }^{[14]<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2. (a) Synthesis and structures of MOF-521. (b) Topological analysis of MOF-521. Color code: Al, blue; O, red; F, green; C, yellow. Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.</p>
<p>Throughout single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, it was discovered that the MOF-521 compounds crystallize in the P-62c (No. 190) space group with almost the same unit cell parameters ( $a=b=21.9 \AA, c=6.6 \AA$ ). All MOF-521 compounds are built from rod secondary building units (SBUs): two of the six corners of each $\mathrm{AlO}<em 2="2">{6}$ octahedron are shared with another two octahedra via $\mu</em>}-\mathrm{OH}$ respectively, two corners are bridged by carboxylate from the BTB linker, and the last two corners are capped by formates, thus forming a 1dimensional straight rod (Figure 2a). There is one $\mu_{2}-\mathrm{OH}$, one carboxylate from the BTB linker and one formate between the two adjacent $\mathrm{AlO<em 2="2">{6}$ octahedra. The rods are parallelly connected to each other via BTB linkers, while the $\mu</em>$ ). Adding functionalities onto the phenyl rings would introduce steric hindrance and therefore larger dihedral angles are favored. In addition, the carboxylate of the BTB is almost coplanar with the peripheral phenyl ring to which it connected so that the large dihedral angle determines the plane of the carboxylate to be perpendicular to the plane of the central phenyl ring and also the formation of rod SBUs.}-\mathrm{OH}$ groups point into the large pores and form hydrogen bonding with DMF or water. Positional disorder is found at the peripheral phenyl rings of BTB and can be refined to two symmetric positions. The dihedral angle between the peripheral phenyl ring and the central phenyl ring in MOF-521 (MOF-521-H: $62.9(4)^{\circ}$, MOF-521-oF: $51.9(4)^{\circ}$, and MOF-521-mF: $68.0(5)^{\circ}$ ) is larger than the one in MOF-520 ${ }^{[15]}(36.4(7)^{\circ}, 36.7(8)^{\circ}$ and $40.8(7)^{\circ</p>

<p>[a] Experiment ID corresponds to each human-conducted experiment following the guidelines provided by the Reticular ChemNavigator, powered by GPT-4. Initial conditions were derived from a comprehensive literature review. For each iteration, GPT-4 suggests a modification of one parameter (e.g., linker to metal ratio, modulator, temperature, or time). For the sake of conciseness, representative conditions were documented in this table. Please refer to Supporting Information, Table S1 and Section S9, for comprehensive details. It is important to note that GPT-4 does not provide explicit predictions, but instead guides human to analyze PXRD patterns, considers previous success and failures reported by human, infers potential avenues for subsequent steps in MOF screening, and provides suggestions to human. [b] Modulator abbreviations: FA = formic acid; TFA = trifluoroacetic acid; AA = acetic acid. [c] This denotes the molar ratio of linker to metal ions.</p>
<p>Given the unique rod packing presented in four MOF-521 compounds, we sought to further examine its topology ${ }^{[16]}$ to determine whether they were unprecedented MOFs. However, the inherently mathematical and analytical nature of this process surpassed GPT-4's capabilities, ${ }^{[36,39]}$ so this analysis was handled by the human side. Several topological analyses were applied to the MOF-521 structure, aiming to better describe its underlying topology, which include standard method, point-of-extension (PE), point-of-extension \&amp; metal (PE\&amp;M) and straight rod representation (STR). ${ }^{[17]}$ Among them, we believe PE and STR best extract the topological features as they both simplify the rod shape just based on its connection direction to the BTB linkers, which is a conventional analysis for MOFs with</p>
<p>rod SBUs (Figure 2b). Both methods result in a (3-c)3(3-c) 2-nodal net, which is also termed as etc according to the Reticular Chemistry Structure Resource (RCSR). ${ }^{[18]}$ We found that this (3-c)3(3-c) 2-nodal net only has 3 entries recorded in the TOPOS database (GEKCAD: $\mathrm{In}<em 34="34">{12} \mathrm{~S}</em>} \mathrm{Sn<em 66="66">{4} ;$ OMABEL: $\mathrm{C}</em>} \mathrm{H<em 3="3">{78} \mathrm{~B}</em>} \mathrm{Cu<em 27="27">{6} \mathrm{~N}</em>} \mathrm{~S<em 3="3">{5} \mathrm{~W}</em>} ;$ XEKJUT: $\mathrm{C<em 15="15">{24} \mathrm{H}</em>} \mathrm{Cu<em 12="12">{3} \mathrm{~N}</em>$ ), which included one inorganic compound and two coordination polymers, suggesting MOF-521 is the first MOF to have this topology.} \mathrm{O}_{3</p>
<p>In addition, we note that even though the underlying topology is the same, the MOF-521 structure still differs strongly from the three entries in TOPOS database in that the 3 rod SBUs in MOF-521 are packed so closely to each other as evidenced by the small distance between the central axis of the rods $(6.54 \AA$ ). The three rod SBUs are not covalently linked because the formates block the coordination sites of the aluminum metal center. This close parallel packing of rod SBUs has not been observed in other MOFs with rod SBUs. Furthermore, given the uniqueness of its SBU, another way to describe the MOF-521 structure is to view the three closely packed rod SBUs as one pseudo rod SBU since the internal space could not be accessed by any guest molecules, and then the structure has a gra topology (Figure 2b).

<p>As we moved forward, GPT-4 and the human found a good agreement between the simulated and experimental PXRD patterns, indicating that all four MOF-521 compounds were constructed under the same topology (Figure 3a). A crucial stage was reached in stage 3 when Reticular ChemNavigator initiated investigations into the permanent porosity of the obtained MOF-521 compounds. It gave useful suggestions on setting up the measurement and interpreting the analysis results. The permanent porosity of the MOF-521 family was confirmed by nitrogen sorption measurements, and the experimentally measured surface area of the four MOFs was consistent with the predictions made by Material Studio (Table 2). All the compounds show the Type I isotherms with no significant accompanied hysteresis, and there is a rough trend based on the relationship between the porosity and the size of the functional groups in the framework for both calculated and experimental data. The least substituted MOF-521-H demonstrates the highest BET surface area of $1696 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~g}^{-1}$, and MOF-521-oF and MOF-521-mF shows a comparable BET surface area of $1535 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~g}^{-1}$ and $1562 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~g}^{-1}$, respectively (Figures S21-S32). On the other hand, the surface area of MOF-521- $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ is $1311 \mathrm{~m}^{2} \mathrm{~g}^{-1}$ and turns to be much lower than other ones, suggesting that the substitution of center benzene has a greater influence on the pore environment and can be potentially used to tune the porosity.</p>

<p>In stage 4, to verify their compositions and chemical formulae, all four MOF-521 compounds underwent proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and elemental analysis as suggested by the Reticular ChemNavigator. The proton signals from four linkers were assigned based on their chemical shifts and splitting patterns (Figures S11-S14). The DMF solvent peak cannot be identified in the digestion NMR, suggesting that the compounds were fully activated. The appearance of the formate peaks at 8.5 ppm and the linker peak between 6.2 ppm and 7.8 ppm shows good agreement with the chemical formulae of MOF-521 compounds determined by SXRD and elemental analysis. In addition, it further confirms that, instead of moving freely in the pore of the MOF, formates exist as a building ligand on the framework and were not subjected to removal during the activation under vacuum. It's noteworthy that the data analysis was primarily conducted by human intervention, guided by recommendations from GPT-4. The findings were subsequently reported to GPT-4 for further analysis and interpretation, a strategic approach designed to reduce potential hallucination effects from large language model. We note that an experienced chemist may be able to do this without consultation, but the GPT-4 was able to offer three different directions by evaluating the circumstances and help human researcher, especially those who are not so familiar with some of the standard characterization techniques in reticular chemistry, to move on. Next, the thermogravimetric experiment was performed under nitrogen with a heating rate of $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$. The activated sample demonstrated a two-step weight loss and indicated that almost no solvent or water molecules were present in the pore (Figures S15-S18). We notice that the observed first weight loss between $250-350^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ matches with the weight of the formate ligand (calc. $19.2 \%$; obs. $20.1 \%$ ), and the second step $\left(600-700^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ can be attributed to the decomposition of the framework.

<p>Figure 4. Number of prompting iteration took to complete each stage for the MOF-521 compounds based on BTB-H, BTB-oF, BTB-mF and BTB- $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ linkers. The number of iterations is a function of (i) the human input provided to Al , and (ii) the task picked by the human at each iteration of the approach.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 4, the total numbers of prompt iterations are similar across the four MOF-521 compounds. The number of prompt iterations serves as a valuable measure of the efficiency and complexity of the synthesis, characterization and analysis of each compound. This observation is noteworthy as it underscores the reproducibility and robustness of GPT-4's effectiveness in acting as a reticular chemist to uncover new MOFs. The similarity in iterations across compounds is particularly noteworthy considering that each compound's discovery route differs in aspects such as organic linker preparation, synthesis condition optimization, and property characterization. In this light, the four linkers can be conceptualized as distinct discovery narratives, with each narrative standing as a</p>
<p>testament to GPT-4's reproducible efficacy in acting as a reticular chemist for MOF exploration. Moreover, even within identical stages, GPT-4 encountered varied routes. For instance, in the synthesis condition screening phase, one route might prioritize temperature while another emphasizes the metal-to-linker ratio. This flexible approach by GPT-4, adapting and providing tailored suggestions to divergent scenarios, showcases its adeptness at addressing distinct challenges. The consistent number of iterations for each compound suggests that, irrespective of the distinct routes and decisions made, the steps and workload to achieve optimal stage goals remain similar. This consistency underscores GPT-4's ability to avoid situations where it becomes entangled in indecision or ineffective pathways.
Such observations validate not only the method's robustness but also its broader potential applicability for LLM-assisted scientific research. The iterative consistency further ratifies our division into five stages, emphasizing both its logical nature and efficiency. This segmentation, by breaking down the broader MOF discovery into digestible milestones, mirrors a typical human approach to complex tasks. Such structuring ensures evenly distributed efforts across stages, preventing any one stage from being disproportionately challenging or simple. In the meantime, it is essential to acknowledge that the role of GPT-4 in this research was not simply about discovering the most efficient path, but rather acting as a discerning consultant, providing expert suggestions tailored to researchers at various levels of expertise. As an illustrative point, when juxtaposed against human expert perspectives, over $80 \%$ of GPT-4's task recommendations were congruent with the immediate challenges faced by researchers and had evidently been taken account into prior project trajectory to ensure the task suggestions are helpful and practical (Table S5). This approach emphasizes a nuanced human-AI collaboration where the AI model serves as a valuable tool to guide and support rather than replace human judgment, reflecting the essence of a symbiotic relationship.
The in-context learning by GPT-4 Reticular Chemist within the system is further evidenced by the observation that the total iteration count for the latter three compounds was less than that for MOF-521-H. This is attributable to the fact that MOF-521-H, being the initial compound, lacked a precedent for guidance. However, once MOF-521-H successfully navigated through all stages, its compiled summary functioned as a directive for subsequent compounds, thereby expediting their processes. In essence, generating a summary based on past successes and failures is analogous to creating a repository of useful tools and guidance that can self-instruct other instances of GPT-4 Reticular Chemist to propose more efficient tasks for the discovery and development of similar MOFs. This reflects the system's inherent capability for progressive learning, emphasizing not only the feasibility and efficiency of this approach but also the potential for extending such methods to newcomers and cross-disciplinary researchers.</p>

<p>Large Language Model. The Large Language Model (LLM) involved in this study is GPT-4, which was developed and is maintained by OpenAI. GPT-4 is an autoregressive language model that employs the transformer architecture. ${ }^{[1]}$ It is crucial to point out that there are two primary modes for interfacing with GPT-4: firstly, via the web-based interaction of ChatGPT, operating on the GPT-4 model and accessible directly from the OpenAI website; secondly, through the application programming interface (API) of the GPT-4 model. While both are suitable for supporting our architecture, for the objectives outlined in this study, a more widely accessible variant of the GPT-4-based chatbot, denoted as ChatGPT or GPT-4, was utilized via the OpenAI official web portal at chat.openai.com. We chose the web-based chatbot interface also because it is easier to use and does not require any coding experience from scientists. All tasks involved in this study could be executed under the Default mode using GPT-4 as backbone model. Specifically, the chat model on which this study is based was the ChatGPT March 14, 2023 version ${ }^{[2]}$, which is supported by gpt-4-0314 model. Additionally, the choice of GPT-4 as the base model over GPT-3.5 was made considering GPT-4's larger model size and better inferencing capabilities, ${ }^{[2-3]}$ along with its broader domain knowledge, making it more suitable for the diverse and detailed tasks required in this research. Subsequently, we present three distinct phases where the GPT-4 model was instructed by prompt. These phases are named "Reticular ChemScope," "Reticular ChemNavigator," and "Reticular ChemExecutor." Each phase has unique roles as determined by its respective prompt. It's crucial to highlight that all three phases are supported by GPT-4, with the different names signifying the various aims induced by their predefined prompts with designated roles.</p>
<p>Reticular ChemScope. In the first phase, GPT-4 was tasked with reading and understanding the standard practices of reticular chemistry, the project's goals and objectives, and current instruments. It then needed to apply this knowledge to develop a broader vision for the project. The term 'Scope' here refers to GPT4's ability to 'zoom out' and perceive the big picture of the project, breaking it down into a series of stages and major goals. In particular, the GPT-4 model was instructed to behave like a professional reticular chemist and was tasked with comprehending and processing the standard practices of reticular chemistry, the objectives, and goals of the project, as well as the current instruments available and some other necessary information available. Using this information, GPT-4 constructed an overarching scheme or blueprint of the project, segmented into distinct stages with their corresponding goals. The human was then able to chat with GPT-4 to refine the blueprint of the project and provide more expectations if necessary. All the interaction was made using natural language and no code is needed. The given text from a peerreviewed and well-cited reticular chemistry standard practice paper will allow for minimizing the hallucinations from GPT-4 model, leading to an effective means to visualize the big picture and enabling a systematic workflow for the project (Figure S37).</p>
<p>Reticular ChemNavigator. GPT-4 was mainly responsible for suggesting tasks and experiments, evaluating progress, and guiding the human counterpart through the stages of the project. The name of this phase emphasizes the element of navigation in the iterative process, as the GPT-4 navigates through trial-and-error summaries, human feedback, and current situations, all in pursuit of reaching each stage's completion. Therefore, the second phase involved an interactive dialogue between the human researcher with GPT-4. Here, based on the big picture designed in the previous phase, GPT-4 provided three task suggestions for the human participants to undertake, all aimed at achieving the objectives of the current project stage. Feedback from human participants, as well as previous trial-and-error summaries, were incorporated in this phase. These components were utilized by GPT-4 to evaluate the current situation and devise subsequent tasks, guiding the project toward the successful completion of each stage. In each iteration GPT-4 acting as Reticular ChemNavigator is reinitiated for every new prompt with the context on research summary, previous task suggested and the human feedback (Figure S39).</p>
<p>Reticular ChemExecutor. GPT-4 functioned in giving detailed steps for tasks and providing a feedback template. 'Executor' indicates GPT-4's role in enabling the execution of specific tasks, detailing the steps, and facilitating a structured feedback mechanism. Consequently, the final phase had GPT-4 detailed steps for a task chosen by the human participants from the three suggestions given in the previous phase. GPT4 also provided a template for structured feedback, which allowed for effective communication and improvements in the implementation of tasks. In each iteration GPT-4 acting as Reticular ChemExecutor is</p>
<p>reinitiated for every new prompt with the context on the task suggestion given by Reticular ChemNavigator as well the summary of previous activities (Figure S41).</p>
<p>Prompt Components. The prompt components to prompt GPT-4 can be classified into the following five categories: role definition and goal, memory, evaluation, and structured output. Our goal for the incorporation of these elements into the prompt was to enable GPT-4's functionalities to align with the requirements of human-GPT-4 interaction in the complex reticular chemistry research process. The design incorporated various elements, each playing a critical role, and the reasons for the choice of these components are described as follows. First, in the role definition, the inclusion of specific role descriptions within the prompt establishes a clear context for GPT-4's suggestions, allowing GPT-4 to assume a role akin to a collaborative partner in the research process, working in the field of reticular chemistry. This ensures that the recommendations provided are in accordance with the overall objectives and constraints of the project. In the meantime, regarding goal instructions, by embedding the main goals and specific targets within the prompt, GPT-4 can align its suggestions with the overarching aims of the research. This alignment is crucial for meaningful human-GPT-4 collaboration, directing the focus of GPT-4's outputs toward the successful completion of the project. Also, this will ensure that the suggestions made by GPT-4 do not go beyond the scope of the activities within reticular chemistry. Next, concerning the memory of previous trials, a summary of prior experiments, successes, and failures allows GPT-4 to process and recall important historical information. This aspect aids in the accumulation of past learning and facilitates intelligent suggestions that build upon previous experiences. It promotes a more nuanced, adaptive approach that can reflect on past actions to guide future decisions. Due to token limitations of the model, it is impossible to include all human-GPT-4 interaction history throughout the research process. As more and more information is added, GPT-4 can lose track of previous history, thus a short memory serves as a good tool for it to know the previous history. Following this, the evaluation process is critical as an embedded evaluation process enables GPT-4 to make assessments on the current state of the project, including successes or failures in previous trials. This not only adds depth to GPT-4's understanding but also enhances the transparency of its decision-making process, enabling humans to follow and critically evaluate the logic behind its recommendations. Finally, with structured output as three task choices, providing structured output in the form of three task choices adds flexibility and adaptability to GPT-4's responses. It takes into consideration practical constraints such as the availability of resources and time schedules, offering a variety of options that can suit different scenarios.</p>
<p>Interactive Prompt Refinement. The main aim was to utilize GPT-4's capability to self-instruct prompts based on the provided role descriptions and duties, and then refine these prompts through an iterative process of suggesting, testing, and improvement. Initially, raw prompts were composed by human users, which contained role descriptions, duties, and necessary supplementary information tailored to each phase. For instance, in the ChemScope phase, texts from reticular chemistry literature were used, outlining the standard process of reticular chemistry research. The ChemNavigator phase included a predefined project with a certain number of stages and their corresponding outcome goals, along with definitions of summaries. In the ChemExecutor phase, detailed descriptions of tasks chosen by human participants were included to guide the execution process. Next, GPT-4 was prompted with these raw inputs and the objectives of the prompts, encouraging the GPT-4 to ask questions for clarification and further refining the prompt. This active dialogue allowed the prompts to be revised and improved according to the Al's queries and the human users' feedback. After this initial loop, the first drafts of the prompts generated by GPT-4 were tested on a separate instance of GPT-4, devoid of any prior conversational context. The effectiveness of the prompts was assessed based on the generated outputs. Based on the test results, feedback was relayed back to the original GPT-4 instance (the prompt writer), highlighting the areas that needed addressing or improvement. The prompts were then updated, and the cycle of testing and refinement continued until the performance of the prompts met the satisfaction of the human users. The full prompt of Reticular ChemScope, Reticular ChemNavigator, and Reticular ChemExecutor obtained from this refinement strategy and demonstration on this process can be found in Section S8.</p>

<p>Synthesis of Mixed MOF-520 and MOF-521-H. We observed in our prior studies that manual synthesis of MOFs, per established literature procedures ${ }^{[11]}$, resulted in a simultaneous production of MOF-521-H alongside MOF-520.

These two solutions were combined, to which an additional 13 mL of anhydrous DMF was added. This was succeeded by the addition of 1 mL of formic acid and 0.3 mL of deionized water. The resultant solution was sealed in a 20 mL scintillation vial and subsequently subjected to heating at $140^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for a duration of 3 to 5 days. The process culminated in the formation of a mixture of colorless block and needle crystals. The synthesized crystals were then washed with DMF $(9 \times 20 \mathrm{~mL})$ over the span of 3 days and immersed in $\mathrm{CH}</em>$ prior to activation.} \mathrm{Cl}_{2</p>
