                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> With the rising human-like precision of Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous tasks, their utilization in a variety of real-world applications is becoming more prevalent. Several studies have shown that LLMs excel on many standard NLP benchmarks. However, it is challenging to evaluate LLMs due to test dataset contamination and the limitations of traditional metrics. Since human evaluations are difficult to collect, there is a growing interest in the community to use LLMs themselves as reference-free evaluators for subjective metrics. However, past work has shown that LLM-based evaluators can exhibit bias and have poor alignment with human judgments. In this study, we propose a framework for an end-to-end assessment of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios. We create a carefully curated dataset, covering 10 languages containing native speaker judgments for the task of summarization. This dataset is created specifically to evaluate LLM-based evaluators, which we refer to as meta-evaluation (METAL). We compare the performance of LLM-based evaluators created using GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, and PaLM2. Our results indicate that LLM-based evaluators based on GPT-4 perform the best across languages, while GPT-3.5-Turbo performs poorly. Additionally, we perform an analysis of the reasoning provided by LLM-based evaluators and find that it often does not match the reasoning provided by human judges.</p>

            "metrics_compared": "Weighted F1 (pairwise agreement) between LLM predictions and human aggregate per language & metric; class-distribution comparisons (cases: all annotators agree / two agree / none agree); qualitative alignment of justifications/reasoning.",
            "reported_differences": "GPT-4 with detailed instructions achieved the best agreement with human aggregate scores among the evaluated models and came closest to human pairwise F1 in many languages and metrics, especially for LA and TQ when humans disagreed. However, humans still have the highest agreement overall. GPT-4 sometimes overpredicts the highest class (class 2) and underpredicts middle class when only two annotators agree; GPT-4's scores are frequently close to human labels but its textual justifications often do not match the reasoning implied by its scores.",
            "llm_specific_limitations": "Instruction sensitivity (performance improves modestly with detailed instructions), scale-region / calibration issues (tendency to prefer extreme or specific regions of the scale in some settings), reasoning-score misalignment (justification text often inconsistent with assigned score), potential preference toward model-generated artifacts (not fully explored here), multilingual variability (performance varies by language and metric), and inability to explain some divergences in human-like terms.",
            "notable_failure_cases": "Qualitative examples where GPT-4 assigned high TQ despite human annotators citing omissions and poor discourse; cases where GPT-4 marked a summary as hallucinated and gave low score while humans gave high score; GPT-4 sometimes ignored explicit human-flagged problems (e.g., omission of important information) and claimed the summary 'captures main points'. In class-disagreement cases GPT-4 sometimes outputs the middle class but also overpredicts class 2 in two-agree cases.",
            "mitigation_strategies": "Carefully curate meta-evaluation datasets per language (METAL); use detailed, rubric-style prompts (GPT-4 detailed prompts performed best when annotators disagreed); measure and report weighted-F1 and class-distribution diagnostics rather than only correlation; manually inspect LLM justifications and perform qualitative analyses; retain human reference judgments (use LLMs as complementary, not replacement); future calibration for scale-region bias and explicit calibration procedures recommended.",

            "reported_differences": "GPT-3.5-Turbo showed the worst agreement with humans across most languages and metrics. It often preferred the middle rating (scale-region bias), and detailed instructions sometimes degraded performance relative to simple instructions (except in English where prompting sensitivity was lower). There are a few language-specific exceptions (e.g., some Bengali metrics where GPT-3.5 outperformed GPT-4/PaLM2).",
            "llm_specific_limitations": "Pronounced scale-region bias (tendency to pick the middle class); high sensitivity to prompt wording (performance sometimes increases with simpler instructions); poor multilingual robustness across many non-English languages; lower F1 versus human aggregate on LA/OCQ/TQ for most languages.",
            "notable_failure_cases": "GPT-3.5-Turbo often assigned the middle class across cases where humans either agreed on extremes or had two-vs-one splits, producing low discriminative power; inconsistent gains from detailed prompts (detailed instructions sometimes worsened scores). In class-disagreement scenarios it sometimes produced near-uniform class frequencies (i.e., unreliable signal).",
            "mitigation_strategies": "Prefer simpler prompt templates for GPT-3.5-Turbo in some settings (empirical choice per language); do not rely solely on GPT-3.5-Turbo for multilingual meta-evaluation; use model calibration and scale adjustment techniques; include human-in-the-loop verification and maintain human gold labels for auditing; consider upgrading to more capable models (GPT-4/PaLM2) for higher-stakes evaluation.",

<p>METAL: Towards Multilingual Meta-Evaluation
2 Apr 20247F27539302C623ABE63E5A1E26484260arXiv:2404.01667v1[cs.CL]
With the rising human-like precision of Large Language Models (LLMs) in numerous tasks, their utilization in a variety of real-world applications is becoming more prevalent.Several studies have shown that LLMs excel on many standard NLP benchmarks.However, it is challenging to evaluate LLMs due to test dataset contamination and the limitations of traditional metrics.Since human evaluations are difficult to collect, there is a growing interest in the community to use LLMs themselves as reference-free evaluators for subjective metrics.However, past work has shown that LLMbased evaluators can exhibit bias and have poor alignment with human judgments.In this study, we propose a framework for an end-to-end assessment of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios.We create a carefully curated dataset, covering 10 languages containing native speaker judgments for the task of summarization.This dataset is created specifically to evaluate LLM-based evaluators, which we refer to as meta-evaluation (METAL).We compare the performance of LLM-based evaluators created using GPT-3.5-Turbo,GPT-4, and PaLM2.Our results indicate that LLM-based evaluators based on GPT-4 perform the best across languages, while GPT-3.5-Turboperforms poorly.Additionally, we perform an analysis of the reasoning provided by LLM-based evaluators and find that it often does not match the reasoning provided by human judges.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5-Turbo (Ouyang et al., 2022), PaLM2 (Anil et al., 2023), Gemini-1.5 (Reid et al., 2024), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023(Jiang et al., , 2024) ) etc. have shown impressive performance on a variety of standard NLP tasks across languages (Ahuja et al., 2023a,b;Arora et al., 2023;Laskar et al., 2023; Further, evaluating the text generation capabilities of these models is even more challenging (Chiang and Lee, 2023;Zhou et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023a).Natural Language Generation (NLG) capabilities are traditionally evaluated using automated metrics such as ROUGE (Lin, 2004) or BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) scores.These metrics have several known drawbacks, such as reliance on exact matches and over-emphasis on length.Secondly, these metrics do not account for subjective evaluations such as quality, coverage, and coherence (Schluter, 2017;Grusky, 2023;Reiter, 2018).Thirdly, these metrics are reference-based i.e. they need a comparison baseline, which can be expensive to collect and can sometimes have a low correlation with human judgments.This has led to work on reference-free and subjective evaluation (Chen et al., 2023;Stammbach et al., 2023;Xu et al., 2023;Hasan et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Using LLMs as evaluators presents several challenges.Recent works (Clark et al., 2021;Wang et al., 2023b;Chiang and Lee, 2023) have shown that while LLMs can produce evaluations with human-like accuracy, these evaluations are often inconsistent and can easily be influenced.LLMs also show position bias or scale region bias and are unable to distinguish between candidates that are close to each other (Golchin and Surdeanu, 2023).LLMs are sensitive to instructions and their capabilities vary for different metrics (Skopek et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023b;Shen et al., 2023).Another significant challenge when using LLMs as evaluators is a limited assessment of their abilities in multilingual settings.Studies have shown that LLMs have inferior performance even on some high-resource languages and cannot be assessed extensively on low-resource languages due to a lack of benchmarks (Ahuja et al., 2023a).Therefore, it is still unclear if LLMs can replace human evaluations in multilingual settings.</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce the METAL framework for a robust assessment of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios.Figure 1 shows an outline of our framework.The METAL framework is an end-to-end pipeline, that starts with first creating a rich meta-evaluation dataset that contains a variety of samples across the metrics of interest.We do this by systematically prompting GPT-4 to generate a wide range of sample data points, that are then evaluated by native speakers.In the next step, we compare LLM judgments with human judgments.For this, we draw on our previous work (Hada et al., 2024) to prompt LLMs for evaluations and subsequently compare the scores with human judgments.In particular, for the task of summarization we create a dataset of 1000 summaries covering 10 languages, with human ratings across 5 metrics. 1 Next, we obtain LLM evaluations from GPT-3.5-Turbo,GPT-4, and PaLM2 across these 1000 summaries and 5 metrics.</p>
<p>Our findings show that the GPT-3.5-Turbo-basedevaluator does not perform well across languages and metrics, while evaluators based on GPT-4 and PaLM2 perform better.We find that the evaluation ability of LLMs significantly across languages, motivating the creation of a meticulously crafted metaevaluation dataset covering all target languages before using LLM-based evaluators.Lastly, our qualitative analysis shows that while GPT-4 and PaLM2 can achieve accuracy close to humans, the reasoning behind their evaluations is often flawed.While we study the applicability of the METAL framework for the task of summarization, it is extensible to other tasks as well, by creating meta-evaluation datasets for the other tasks.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Studies by Kryściński et al. (2018); Huang et al. (2020); Shen et al. (2022b) implemented the Likert scale for assessing various dimensions of generated summaries.Fan et al. (2018); Fabbri et al. (2019); Shen et al. (2022a) perform side-by-side comparisons of summaries produced by different models, using systems such as Elo for ranking the models based on performance.</p>
<p>Evaluation Datasets Human-verified goldstandard datasets are crucial for being able to evaluate LLMs.Skopek et al. (2023) release riSum, an English-centric dataset of documentinstruction-output triplets, with the LLMs generating instructions and outputs, and a human evaluation is adopted to score the triplets, with a focus on "instruction-following".In our work, we manually curate the instructions and create a dataset covering 10 languages.SEAHORSE (Clark et al., 2023) is a multilingual and multifaceted data for summarization with 96K summaries, and metrics related to grammar and output quality.They fine-tune T5 (Raffel et al., 2023;Xue et al., 2021) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) models on the train split of the dataset for generating a spectrum of outputs, whereas we work with black-box models and tune our prompts to generate "good" and "bad" summaries.</p>
<p>LLM Evaluation</p>
<p>Several previous studies have analyzed and evaluated LLMs on new tasks and standard benchmarks (Ahuja et al., 2023a,b).Wang et al. (2023a) prompt ChatGPT for summarization and other higher-level tasks, across various metrics and find a high correlation with human scores, with the caveat that it may be influenced by the way the meta-evaluation datasets are created.We extend this idea in the METAL dataset.Other studies (Naismith et al., 2023;Fu et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2023b) have also put forth GPT scoring frameworks and prompt-based evaluators, however, they are mostly confined to English or Latin script languages.Wu and Aji (2023) employ a Multi-Elo Rating System and advice for a similar multi-dimensional assessment of LLM-generated summaries.Previous studies (Li et al., 2023;Zheng et al., 2023;Hada et al., 2024) have solely relied on GPT-4 as an LLM judge/evaluator.Kim et al. (2023) propose a fine-tuned LLM, comparable to GPT-4 for input-evaluation rubric-output triplets, however, it is only fine-tuned for English.Previously, we performed a multilingual study of LLM meta-evaluation using an internal dataset of human judgments Hada et al. (2024).The dataset used in this work was not curated for the specific purpose of LLM-evaluator calibration and hence suffers from weaknesses such as dataset skew, and we focus this work on building a better dataset for meta-evaluation.We use the prompting strategies from our prior work (Hada et al., 2024) to evaluate our new curated dataset.To the best of our knowledge, no other study has proposed an end-to-end pipeline from generating a rich evaluation set to assessing the performance of LLM as evaluators in the multilingual scenario.</p>
<p>The METAL Dataset</p>
<p>The METAL dataset contains a total of 1000 summaries across 10 languages.The dataset is specially curated to investigate the capabilities of LLMs as evaluators in different languages along 5 dimensions.In this section, we describe how the dataset was created and annotated.</p>
<p>Dataset Creation</p>
<p>The dataset consists of 100 summaries each, for 10 languages: English (En), French (Fr), Chinese Simplified (Zh), Hindi (Hi), Arabic (Ar), Bengali (Bn), Russian (Ru), Turkish (Tr), Japanese (Ja), and Swahili (Sw).We selected the languages to cover a diverse range of scripts and regions.The main text for each summary in our dataset was chosen from XL-Sum (Hasan et al., 2021), and the corresponding summary was generated by prompting GPT-4.A brief overview of our methodology is shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Main Text Selection</p>
<p>For each of the 10 languages we create a histogram of 20 bins of the number of tokens in the main text for all the datapoints in the test set of the XL-Sum dataset (Hasan et al., 2021).We chose 100 random samples from the bin with the highest frequency.</p>
<p>Summary Generation To investigate the capabilities of LLMs as evaluators, our objective was to create an evaluation set of summaries with varying quality.To this end, for each of the chosen 1000 samples from the above step, we generate two summaries by prompting GPT-4 as follows.</p>
<p>To generate good-quality summaries we provide the main text to GPT-4 and prompt it to return a summary of the main text such that it captures the essence of the main passage.We specifically ask for a summary that is highly rated on the 5 metrics of interest, described in the next section.We keep the temperature at 0 for the generation of goodquality summaries.</p>
<p>To generate bad-quality summaries we provide the main text to GPT-4 and prompt it to act as an adversarial NLP assistant, and badly summarize the main passage.We specifically ask for a summary that is rated low on the 5 metrics of interest.To generate bad quality summaries we keep the temperature as 1.In our initial experiments with lower temperatures, we observed that GPT-4 does not produce bad summaries even when specifically prompted to do so.</p>
<p>To further ensure the quality of summaries, in both styles of prompting we ask GPT-4 to also justify why the generated summary is good or bad.Once we have 2 summaries per data point, we choose a good-quality summary or a bad-quality summary at random.The verbatim of our prompts are provided in §A.1</p>
<p>Dataset Annotation</p>
<p>For the 1000 summaries selected from the above process, we have each sample annotated by 3 annotators for 5 different metrics.We use the metrics described by Hada et al. (2024) in their work: Linguistic Acceptability (LA) This metric assesses whether the summary is acceptable to a native speaker.Specifically, the annotators are asked to determine whether the text exhibits signs of being translated, misuses words, or includes expressions that are not idiomatic in their language.</p>
<p>Output Content Quality (OCQ) This metric assesses whether the general quality of the output text is good.The annotators are asked to consider flaws such as significant repetition, non-native language elements, or indications that the text has been webscraped.</p>
<p>Task Quality (TQ) This metric assesses the effectiveness of the summarization.It focuses on assessing the degree to which the summary aligns with key information in the main passage.</p>
<p>Problematic Content (PC) This metric assesses the summary for the presence of any content that may be deemed offensive, inappropriate, or harmful.It serves as a filter against outputs that might perpetuate harmful stereotypes or misinformation.</p>
<p>Hallucinations (H) This metric assesses whether the summary remains anchored to, and consistent with, the main passage.It serves as a check against unwarranted deviations from the ground truth provided in the input.</p>
<p>For LA, OCQ, and TQ, annotators were asked to assign one of the three possible classes: Bad (0), Medium (1), Good (2).For PC and H, annotators were asked to assign one of the two possible classes: Present (1) and Absent (0).2 Annotation Task and Quality Each datapoint was annotated by three annotators for the five metrics.Annotators were native speakers of the respective language and trained professionals contracted through an external annotator services company.The pay was adjusted based on the annotator's region and experience.Since we wanted to ensure we had a strong evaluation set to study the capabilities of LLMs as evaluators, special attention was given to the quality of annotations.The annotators were specifically trained to perform annotations for this task and a sample of annotations was reviewed for all annotators.Annotations were reviewed for accuracy and guideline consistency.Based on the review, feedback was provided to the annotators, and ambiguous cases were re-annotated.Table 6 in Appendix §A.3 shows the Fleiss' Kappa (κ) and pairwise agreement (computed as F1) values among the annotators for the various languages and metrics.All our κ values are &gt; 0.6 (except for H in En, κ = 0.54), and all F1 values are &gt; 0.75, indicating substantial agreement.Some κ values are 0 due to class skew, but high F1 in these cases indicates high reliability.For our experiments, we take the majority vote from the three human annotations per sample as the aggregate class for that sample.In the case of 3 distinct annotations, we take the average value.Figure 2 shows the distribution of the aggregate annotations over various languages and metrics.</p>
<p>Dataset Statistics</p>
<p>As discussed in §3.1, we sample the datapoints from XL-Sum based on the number of tokens of the passage.Specifically, the tiktoken 3 was utilized for the tokenization process, and the length (token) distribution of the passages and summaries are presented in Table 1 along with the number of good and bad instances per language.Table 2 presents the frequency/distribution of the classes (0, 1, and 2) in the good and bad summaries.Notably, the first row of the table depicts higher counts of low scores (class 0) for the bad summaries, relative to the good ones.Further, the medium scores (class 1) also contain a higher frequency in the bad summaries, however, the difference between the frequencies is lower than that of class 0. Sur-</p>
<p>Prompts</p>
<p>The models were prompted using the LangChain5 framework and a structured JSON output format was maintained to parse the generations efficiently.</p>
<p>The prompts for evaluation follow the same verbatim as Hada et al. (2024).</p>
<p>Prompting Strategies</p>
<p>Based on our previous work (Hada et al., 2024), we use the simple and detailed prompting strategies for all models, and all the metrics are evaluated independently in a single call to the API.All prompts were provided in English, as Ahuja et al. (2023a) have shown that multilingual instructions lead to worse performance.Further, the temperature is set to 0 for reproducibility.</p>
<p>Simple Instruction A rudimentary description of the metric and scoring schema is provided, as shown in Figure 7 in appendix §A.4.</p>
<p>Detailed Instruction An informative and thorough description of the metric and a case-by-case breakdown of the scoring schema is provided, as shown in Figure 8in the appendix §A.4.</p>
<p>Meta Evaluation</p>
<p>As described in §3.2 we use the aggregate of the three annotations for our experiments.</p>
<p>Pairwise Agreement (F1) We measure the pairwise agreement between the LLM evaluators and human aggregate scores per language and metric.</p>
<p>To account for any class imbalance, we report the weighted F1 score instead of accuracy.</p>
<p>Class Distribution</p>
<p>We analyze the class distribution of the human aggregate scores and the various model predictions for three possible classes: When all three annotators agree, when two of three annotators agree, and when no annotators agree.We do this analysis only for metrics with 3 possible classes: LA, OCQ, and TQ.</p>
<p>Comparison between SEAHORSE and METAL</p>
<p>SEAHORSE (Clark et al., 2023) is a dataset akin to METAL, as described in §2.It contains summaries generated using several models for passages from popular summarization datasets such as XL-Sum (Hasan et al., 2021), XSum (Narayan et al., 2018), MLSum (Scialom et al., 2020) and WikiLingua (Ladhak et al., 2020).We use the XL-Sum subset of Seahorse and find out common datapoints between SEAHORSE and METAL.There are a total of 27 overlapping data points: 1 in English, 10 in Russian, and 16 in Turkish.present the distribution of F1 scores of various models with the two prompting strategies on the 10 languages.For "human scores", we average the pairwise F1 scores of all the annotators, i.e., A1-A2, A2-A3, and A3-A1.For the "model scores" in the plot, the F1 score between the annotator aggregate and model evaluation is computed.For all the metrics, humans have the best agreement.In the case of LA, for most of the languages, GPT-4 with detailed instructions performs the closest to humans, followed by GPT-4 with simple instructions.GPT-3.5-Turboperforms the worst with detailed instructions and a significant difference is observed by making the instructions simple, however, no difference is found for English.For most of the languages, especially Zh, Hi, Ru, and Ar, GPT-4 and PaLM2 perform similarly.</p>
<p>For OCQ, GPT-3.5-Turboperforms the worst, and detailed instruction improves the performance marginally over simple instructions.GPT-4 and PaLM2 perform very closely to humans for Russian, however, there is a gap between the human and LLM scores on the rest of the languages.For TQ, both prompting strategies for GPT-4 and PaLM2 do equally well on most languages except Ar, Hi, Zh, and En.In these cases, GPT-4 with detailed instructions does the best.</p>
<p>For PC and H, all models show very similar scores as compared to humans, except GPT-3.5-Turbo.Simple instructions for GPT-3.5-Turboimprove performance for both metrics with a higher gain on H. Interestingly, for Bn and metrics LA and OCQ, both prompting strategies for GPT-3.5-Turbodo better than GPT-4 and PaLM2.For Sw and metrics LA, OCQ, and TQ, the agreement between humans and GPT-4 or PaLM2 is as good as the agreement between humans.GPT-3.5-Turbo with detailed instructions does worse than GPT-3.5-Turbofor all metrics except OCQ.</p>
<p>Overall, we find that the performance of GPT-4 and especially PaLM2 are largely independent of simple or detailed instructions, in all languages. 6We do not consider the 1 overlapping datapoint in English for our experiment.The same holds for GPT-3.5-Turboonly on English, suggesting that it is less sensitive to prompting in English.GPT-4 with detailed instructions comes closest to human evaluation, with marginal improvements over simple instructions, in most cases.GPT-4 and PaLM2 are very effective in identifying hallucinations and problematic content for all languages.</p>
<p>Class Distribution</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the distribution of human aggregate score and various models for the three cases.In the case where all annotators agree, as shown in Figure 3a we can see that the class distribution for GPT-4 and PaLM2 with both prompting variations is very close to the class distribution of human aggregate scores.This indicates that when humans have full agreement (perhaps due to easier samples), LLMbased evaluators also perform well.</p>
<p>In the case where two of three annotators agree, we can see in Figure 3b that for both prompting variations GPT-4 and PaLM2 often over-predict class 2, under-predict class 1 and are similar to humans for class 0. Overall, detailed-GPT-4 comes closest to the distribution of human aggregate scores.For both cases, GPT-3.5-Turbooften prefers the middle class, which can be indicative of scale region bias.</p>
<p>In our third case, owing to our high quality of annotations, we have only 13 out of 3000 samples where no annotators agree.Figure 3c shows the class distribution for this case.We can observe that GPT-3.5-Turbo with simple instructions assigns different classes with almost equal frequency.GPT-4 with detailed instructions often outputs the middle class, which is the annotator aggregate as well.PaLM2 with detailed instructions outputs the highest or the lowest score, and interestingly very few times opts for the middle class.</p>
<p>From this analysis, we conclude that while simple or detailed instructions for both GPT-4 and PaLM2 perform equally well when all human annotators agree, detailed instructions for GPT-4 do best when there is disagreement amongst annotators.</p>
<p>Comparison of evaluation between SEAHORSE and METAL</p>
<p>Table 4 shows the values for evaluation of overlapping datapoints between SEAHORSE and METAL for RU and TR.The values are averaged over all datapoints.For Russian, we can observe that palm_1shot does the best as it is rated highly across all metrics by both the models.Interestingly, palm_1shot is rated better than palm_finetuned.</p>
<p>GPT-4 good summaries received very bad evaluations across all metrics by both models.On further investigation, we found that GPT-4 good category had only 2 datapoints out of the overlapping 10 datapoints, and co-incidentally these 2 generated summaries were of bad quality and have been rated poorly by human annotators as well.This indicates that GPT-4 might not always be biased towards its own generations as compared to generations from other models.We can also observe that in almost all cases GPT-4 provides a higher rating as compared to PaLM2.For Turkish, we can observe that GPT-4 good receives the highest ratings by both models.Similar to Russian, palm_1shot receives better ratings than palm_finetuned.As expected, mt5_small_250 receives the lowest ratings since it is an under-trained model.We can also notice a clear difference in ratings for GPT-4 good vs GPT-4 bad generations.Overall, from this experiment we can conclude that using our metrics and prompting methods we can compare generations from different models.</p>
<p>Qualitative Analysis</p>
<p>While results in section §5 show that detailed instructions to GPT-4 and PaLM2 give evaluations very close to humans, it is unclear how humans and LLMs reason about their scores.We qualitatively analyse the comments from the annotators for their ratings and justifications produced by the LLMs at the time of scoring the summaries.An analysis of some interesting examples is discussed in this section.As discussed in section §4.4, the annotations from humans can be divided into three categories: when all annotators agree, when two annotators agree, and when no annotators agree.Table 5 shows examples from each of these categories for different languages and metrics.We specifically analyze cases where LLMs' scores differ from the annotator aggregate score.</p>
<p>The first example is where no annotators agree on TQ for an English sample.Both GPT-4 and PaLM2 assign a 2 in this case.While all three annotators point out a few problems with the summary, both GPT-4 and PaLM2 ignore some key elements for TQ such as "omission of important information", and "poor discourse" and say that the summary "captures main points of the passage".</p>
<p>The next two cases in the table are when two annotators agree.In the second case, two annotators give the sample a score of 1 for LA, however, no annotators point towards any grammatical issues with the summary.Their comments are more relevant for TQ and OCQ.This indicates that for humans their judgment of one metric might affect their judgment of other metrics.Both LLMs give a high score of 2 to the sample, even though the reason from PaLM2 says "lacks natural rhythm and intonation".This shows that LLMs' reasons might not always be aligned with their scores, in line with findings from Hada et al. (2023).In the third case, the annotator aggregate for OCQ is 2, however, both LLMs assign a score of 0. Annotators mention problems such as "hallucinations" in their comments, while GPT-4 says the summary is an inaccurate representation of the main text, and PaLM2 complains of incoherence.</p>
<p>The last two examples in the table are where all three annotators agree but the LLM scores are different.In the fourth case, all annotators assign a score of 2 for TQ, however, both LLMs assign a score of 0.Even though A2 complains about the quality of the summary, they assign a score of 2, indicating some error in judgment.Both LLMs assign a score of 0 and reason that that the summary consists of hallucinations.It is interesting that humans still assign the summary a score of 2 indicating that there can be subtle differences in how humans interpret these metrics.</p>
<p>In the last case, all annotators assign the sample a score of 2 for OCQ and do not mention any issues with content quality in their comments.Interestingly, PaLM2 assigns a score of 1 and the justification states "it does not provide any new information or insights beyond what is already in the passage".Since this was a summarization task no new information is expected in the summary.This again indicates that the judgment and justification might not always be aligned.Table 7 in Appendix §A.6 shows some samples of cases where either of the LLM scores agree with human aggregate scores, but there are some discrepancies in their justification.</p>

<p>Table 5: Samples from METALdataset with human and LLM (detailed variation) scores and comments.Note: We only include snippets from the full comment.</p>
<p>Overall, our analysis indicates that there are several challenges in the alignment of human evaluations with LLM evaluations.While the scoring by LLMs on several metrics and languages might come close to humans, it is difficult to understand how they come up with these scores, necessitating further research.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We presented the first framework for end-to-end evaluation of LLMs as evaluators in multilingual scenarios.We created a dataset of 1000 summaries across 10 languages rated by native speakers on 5 different metrics.Our dataset covers a range of summaries in terms of linguistic acceptability, output quality, task quality, and others.We do this by systematically prompting GPT-4 to generate summaries of varying quality.The human ratings obtained for these summaries are of high quality with κ &gt; 0.6 and F 1 &gt; 0.75.We plan to make the METALdataset available to the research community.Using our dataset, we investigate the capabilities of three LLMs as evaluators: GPT-3.5-Turbo,GPT-4, and PaLM2 using two prompting strategies and compare their evaluation with the METALhuman evaluations.Our results show that GPT-4 with detailed instructions performs closest to humans, while GPT-3.5-Turbo is not a suitable multilingual evaluator but surprisingly does better than GPT-4 and PaLM2 in some metrics for Bengali.We also show that GPT-4 with detailed instructions does best when there is disagreement amongst human annotators.We compare the overlapping summaries between SEAHORSE and METAL and show how our metrics and prompting methods can be used to compare generations from different models.Finally, we analyze human and LLM reasoning and observe that LLMs often provide incorrect justifications for their scores, thus showing that more research is needed to be able to use LLM-based evaluators with confidence in the multilingual setting.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>We prompt GPT-4 to generate good and bad-quality summaries.As noted in §3.1, for lower tempera-ture values we observed that GPT-4 did not generate bad summaries.We use a temperature of 1 and observe some variation of quality across all our metrics except problematic content.This could be due to the content filter applied to these models.Therefore, it is difficult to study the capability of such models on this metric.We evaluate the generations from GPT-4 using GPT-3.5-Turbo,GPT-4, and PaLM2.Recent work has shown that LLMs prefer their own outputs.Although this might have affected our evaluations, exploring this is beyond the scope of our work.In our work, we mainly focused on investigating how well LLM ratings align with human ratings across various metrics and languages.All summaries generated and evaluated in our study are by the same model, we do not compare them against human-written summaries or summaries generated by other models.Lastly, LLMs are also shown to have scale region bias and we do not calibrate for this in our study, expecting it to be standardized across all their ratings.In the future, it would interesting to explore their impact on our evaluation.</p>
<p>Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>We use the framework by Bender and Friedman (2018) to discuss the ethical considerations for our work.</p>
<p>Institutional Review Our dataset was annotated by an external company that has long-standing contracts with the organization and is employed by the organization regularly to do this work.Therefore, the annotation company only accepts work that is covered under the purview of their contract.</p>
<p>Data To generate the summaries in our dataset we use the main text from the publicly available test set of XL-Sum (Hasan et al., 2021).Our summaries are generated in 10 languages: En, Fr, Hi, Zh, Ar, Bn, Tr, Ja, Ru, and Sw.We do this by prompting GPT-4.We release the dataset publicly for future research.Our dataset was created such that it covers a range of quality for summaries.Therefore, some summaries in our dataset are deliberately incoherent.Our ratings on problematic content show that &lt; 5% of our data had problematic text in them.</p>
<p>Annotator Demographics Annotators were recruited through an external annotator services company.All annotators were native speakers of the language of the data points they annotated.The pay was adjusted after discussion with the company, based on the annotator's region and experience.No demographic information is available about the annotators.The annotators are governed by their company's and our organization's privacy policy.</p>
<p>Annotation Guidelines We draw inspiration from the community standards set for similar tasks.These guidelines were created following best practices after careful research.Annotators were asked to rate the summaries across 5 metrics.A detailed explanation was given for each of the metrics.For 3 metrics annotators had to choose from 3 classes, and for 2 metrics they had to choose from 2 classes.Annotators were allowed to give feedback for any data point via an optional comments text box.Annotators received training for this task.Annotator identity was hidden from the task reviewers to limit any bias.</p>
<p>Methods In this study, we explore methods to generate summaries by prompting GPT-4.We deliberately prompt GPT-4 to generate some bad summaries.All summaries generated were evaluated by 3 LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo,GPT-4, and PaLM2.We explore several ways to calibrate LLM judgment with human judgments for various metrics and languages.While these methods can be easily misused, our intent with this study is to highlight the gap between the two and urge the community to proceed with caution.</p>

IntroductionIn this task, you will assess summaries of a passage using five metrics.Your assessment will be used to investigate the performance of automated models.Task steps1. Read the main passage: Begin by thoroughly reading the main passage.Understand the key points, main ideas, and any critical details in the text.2. Read the corresponding summary: After reading the main passage, carefully examine the summary.Pay attention to how well it represents the essential information in the main passage.3. Rate the summary: Assign a rating on all the metrics defined above.Score all the metrics that apply (i.e., consider each metric independently)4. Comment (optional): You may provide a brief comment explaining why you assigned a certain score.When leaving a comment, mention specific strengths or weaknesses you observed in the summary.Additional notes• Strive for consistency in your ratings throughout the task.Use the same criteria and judgment for similar summaries.• If you encounter any summaries that are offensive, irrelevant, or clearly off topic, please flag them for review by leaving a comment specifying the problem.• Take your time and evaluate each summary carefully.Your thoughtful assessments are invaluable for our study.• Try not to overthink the answer: Let your instinct guide you.Figure6: Detailed task instructions provided to the annotators.Hada et al. (2024).A.5 Radar Plots of F1-scoresFigures 9 and 10 are a pictorial representation of Table3.A.6 Qualitative AnalysisTable7shows some samples of cases where either of the LLM scores agree with human aggregate scores, but there are some discrepancies in their justification."name": "linguistic_acceptability", "description": "Linguistic acceptability pertains to the degree to which a given language structure (e.g., phrase, sentence, discourse) aligns with the implicit norms and rules of a native speaker's linguistic intuition.In the study of language, it's distinct from 'grammaticality', which is a stricter and narrower concept based on the prescriptive rules of a language.Linguistic acceptability, on the other hand, captures broader native-speaker intuitions and encompasses factors like fluency, idiomacy, and appropriateness in context.In the context of language models, evaluating linguistic acceptability involves assessing the output of the model not just for its adherence to grammar rules, but for its overall fit within the natural, expected, and intuitive contours of fluent human language.The scoring rubric is described below, with a few possible reasons (which might not be exhaustive) for a given score.","scoring": { "0": { "(a)": "Sentences that lack clear syntactic structure.","(b)": "Usage of non-existent or incorrect words.","(c)": "Grossly inappropriate word choices for a given context."}, "1": { "(a)": "Overly verbose or stilted phrasing.","(b)": "Minor grammatical errors that do not impede understanding.","(c)": "Use of a word that's technically correct but not the most appropriate for context."}, "2": { "(a)": "Seamless integration of contextually relevant vocabulary", "(b)": "Effective use of idiomatic expressions without sounding forced.","(c)": "Sentences that reflect natural rhythm, emphasis, and intonation of spoken language."} }   No.Lang.Metric Human Scores and Comments GPT-4 Scores and Justification PaLM2 Scores and Justification 1 Bengali TQ 'A1': 0, 'The summary part is very short.','A2': 1, 'This summary section was not completed.Language construction was good and some flaws but otherwise okay and summary section more improvement was needed.','A3': 2, 'This content has good co-relation between different thoughts and ideas.The summary of the content is not complete.'1, However, it misses out on finer details and nuances such as the reason behind the boycott, the reactions of different countries, and the political implications of the boycott.Therefore, the summary partially aligns with the passage.. 1, The summary is a good summary of the passage.It captures the main points of the passage and provides a brief overview of the topic.However, the summary does not go into as much detail as the passage and does not provide as much information about the topic.2 Bengali OCQ 'A1': 0, 'Difficult to understand from beginning to end.', 'A2': 1, ' summary section can be more improvement is needed.','A3': 1, "In summary part as well, the sentences are irrelevant with other sentences of the paragraph."1, the summary is somewhat accurate in terms of content relevance but lacks clarity and cohere 1, The summary is not in the same language as the passage 3 Swahili LA 'A1': 1, 'The summary is inaccurate and incomplete and thus not a true reflection of the original passage.Some crucial information is missing while other information is not accurate.', 'A2': 0, NA, 'A3': 0, NA 1, The summary uses correct grammar and sentence structure, and there are no non-existent or incorrect words.However, the summary is overly verbose and uses stilted phrasing.1, The summary is not linguistically acceptable.It contains several grammatical errors, such as the use of the word 'gok tasl' (meteorite) to refer to a handbag, and the use of the word 'muze' (museum) to refer to a planet Table7: Samples from METAL dataset with human and LLM (detailed variation) scores and comments.Note: We only include snippets from the full comment.
