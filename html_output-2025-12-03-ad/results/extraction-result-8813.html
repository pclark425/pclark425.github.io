                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Previous studies proposed that the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) can be improved through self-reflection, i.e., letting LLMs reflect on their own output to identify and correct mistakes in the initial responses. However, earlier experiments offer mixed results when it comes to the benefits of self-reflection. Furthermore, prior studies on self-reflection are predominantly concerned with the reasoning capabilities of models, ignoring the potential for self-reflection in safety, bias, and ideological leaning. Here, by conducting a series of experiments testing LLM's self-reflection capability in various tasks using a variety of prompts and different LLMs, we make several contributions to the literature. First, we reconcile conflicting findings regarding the benefit of self-reflection, by demonstrating that the outcome of self-reflection is sensitive to prompt wording -- both the original prompt that are used to elicit an initial answer and the subsequent prompt used to self-reflect. Specifically, although self-reflection may improve the reasoning capability of LLMs when the initial response is simple, the technique cannot improve upon the state-of-the-art chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Second, we show that self-reflection can lead to safer (75.8\% reduction in toxic responses while preserving 97.8\% non-toxic ones), less biased (77\% reduction in gender biased responses, while preserving 94.3\% unbiased ones), and more ideologically neutral responses (100\% reduction in partisan leaning response, while preserving 87.7\% non-partisan ones). The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings on the deployment of large language models. We release our experiments at https://github.com/Michael98Liu/self-reflection.</p>

<p>Self-Reflection Makes Large Language Models Safer, Less Biased, and Ideologically Neutral
16 Feb 2025DDBC468F80516C5E9A32C174E8366B40arXiv:2406.10400v2[cs.CL]
Previous studies proposed that the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) can be improved through self-reflection, i.e., letting LLMs reflect on their own output to identify and correct mistakes in the initial responses.However, earlier experiments offer mixed results when it comes to the benefits of self-reflection.Furthermore, prior studies on self-reflection are predominantly concerned with the reasoning capabilities of models, ignoring the potential for self-reflection in safety, bias, and ideological leaning.Here, by conducting a series of experiments testing LLM's self-reflection capability in various tasks using a variety of prompts and different LLMs, we make several contributions to the literature.First, we reconcile conflicting findings regarding the benefit of self-reflection, by demonstrating that the outcome of self-reflection is sensitive to prompt wording-both the original prompt that are used to elicit an initial answer and the subsequent prompt used to selfreflect.Specifically, although self-reflection may improve the reasoning capability of LLMs when the initial response is simple, the technique cannot improve upon the state-of-theart chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.Second, we show that self-reflection can lead to safer (75.8% reduction in toxic responses while preserving 97.8% non-toxic ones), less biased (77% reduction in gender biased responses, while preserving 94.3% unbiased ones), and more ideologically neutral responses (100% reduction in partisan leaning response, while preserving 87.7% non-partisan ones).The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings on the deployment of large language models.We release our experiments at github.com/Michael98Liu/self-reflection.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When it comes to the benefits of self-reflection, literature shows conflicting results.Previous research demonstrated that the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) can be improved through self-reflection, i.e., prompting the models to reflect on their own response to identify and correct potential mistakes, devoid of any external feedback (Chen et al., 2023;Madaan et al., 2024).However, several recent studies have challenged the benefits of self-reflection by pointing out issues with some of the earlier experiments and providing evidence that self-reflection may actually deteriorate performance (Chen et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2023;Stechly et al., 2023;Valmeekam et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Table 1 summarizes self-reflection literature, demonstrating two issues with current research on self-reflection.First, with the exception of Zhang et al.'s (2024), studies on self-reflection tend to rely on a single prompt.This is potentially problematic, since Huang et al. (2023) hypothesized that selfreflection prompts might introduce biases steering models away from optimal responses.However, the degree to which self-reflection is sensitive to prompt construction has not been systematically investigated to date.Second, with the sole exception of Gou et al.'s (2023), the existing literature is predominantly concerned with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, ignoring other aspects such as safety, fairness, and ideological neutrality that could potentially be improved through self-reflection.</p>
<p>Against this background, we conduct experiments to systematically investigate how selfreflection affects the reasoning, safety, bias, and ideological leaning of LLMs.To understand the intrinsic ability of such models to self-improve, we specifically focus on self-reflection with natural language prompts, without any external feedback.More precisely, this paper focuses on the following five Research Questions (RQs):</p>
<p>• RQ1: How does self-reflection impact reasoning, safety, gender bias, and ideological leaning?• RQ2: How does the ability to self-reflect vary be-</p>
<p>tween proprietary and open-source LLMs?</p>

<p>• RQ3: Is self-reflection sensitive to prompt construction?• RQ4: To what extent does a prompt that is optimal for a specific LLM and a specific task maintain its effectiveness across different LLMs and tasks?• RQ5: Does cross-reflection between multiple LLMs affect detection of unsafe and ideologically skewed responses?</p>
<p>2 Background and Related Work</p>
<p>Self-reflection.LLMs could correct their own response using self-reflection while incorporating external feedback from humans (Zheng et al., 2023), tools (Gou et al., 2023), external metrics, or other LLMs (Paul et al., 2023).Another way to selfreflect is to rely on the model's own reasoning capability (Pan et al., 2024).Here, we focus on verbal reflection without any external feedback, akin to us humans editing a draft of our own writing to improve its quality.This approach has been shown to improve the performance of LLMs in various tasks (Chen et al., 2023).However, more recent studies challenged these claims by presenting mixed results when it comes to the benefit of self-reflection (Li et al., 2024;Huang et al., 2023).Notably, Huang et al. (2023) pointed out three major issues with some earlier experiments and concluded that the observed performance gain should not be attributed to selfreflection but rather to various exogenous factors.</p>
<p>In our study, we avoid the same mistakes documented in Huang et al.'s ( 2023), e.g., by refraining from providing additional information (such as oracle labels) in the self-reflection prompt.</p>
<p>LLMs are sensitive to prompt construction.Studies have shown that prompt construction is crucial to elicit the reasoning ability of LLMs (Wei et al., 2022).Meanwhile, adversarially constructed prompts could hurt performance by simply changing a few words in the prompt (Arakelyan et al., 2024;Verma et al., 2024).Our study contributes to this line of research by documenting a specific case of sensitivity introduced by prompts in the context of self-reflection.</p>
<p>Data and Experiments</p>
<p>Reasoning Datasets</p>
<p>To assess whether self-reflection improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we use three datasets.The first is the MEDQA-USMLE dataset consisting of questions and their associated answer from a professional medical exam, namely the Medical Board Examination in the USA (Jin et al., 2021).These questions are designed to examine the doctors' professional knowledge, which means that many questions require multi-hop logical reasoning.The second is the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU), a benchmark dataset consisting of multiple-choice questions drawn from 57 academic subjects across STEM, the humanities, and the social sciences (Hendrycks et al., 2020).The second is the GSM8K, a large dataset of grade school math problems (Cobbe et al., 2021).Our experiments uses the test set of MEDQA-USMLE (1273 questions), MMLU (a random sample of 1,000 questions), and GSM8K (1319 questions).</p>
<p>Safety Dataset</p>
<p>To assess whether self-reflection improves the safety guardrails of LLMs, we use a dataset of French sentences by combining a dataset of safe and another dataset of unsafe (i.e., those with offensive language) French sentences.The unsafe and safe examples are a randomly selected subset of the safety dataset proposed by Jan et al.'s (2025).</p>
<p>To curate the final dataset of a mixture of safe and unsafe content, we first attempted to translate each French sentence from those two datasets to English using three LLMs including GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI et al., 2024), Gemini-1.5-Flash (GeminiTeam et al., 2024), and Llama-3.2-3B(Llama Team, 2024).Then, for each response provided by an LLM, we used GPT-4o Judge (Jan et al., 2025) to determine whether the LLM provides a translation or not.Ideally, the LLMs should translate every safe sentence, and should refuse to translate every unsafe sentence.However, we found 445 unsafe sentences for which all three LLMs provided a translation (instead of refusing to translate).We also found 482 safe sentences for which all three LLMs provided a translation (as they should).</p>
<p>Our final dataset consists of all the aforementioned 927 sentence-translation pairs.As such, without any self-reflection, 48% of the responses (445) were unsafe, while the remaining 52% of responses (482) were safe.See Appendix Figure 11 and 12 for examples in our dataset.Later on in our experiments, we apply self-reflection to determine whether it affects the percentage of safe responses.</p>
<p>Gender Bias Dataset</p>
<p>To evaluate whether self-reflection improves the bias guardrails of LLMs, we create a benchmark dataset for gender bias, consisting of biased and unbiased responses generated by the above three LLMs.Here, we consider an LLM response to be gender biased if it needlessly uses a gendered pronoun in response to a generic question that did not require the use of such a pronoun.In contrast, unbiased responses are those that do not use any pronouns or use gender-neutral pronouns such as "they" or "them."</p>
<p>To create this dataset, we first asked each LLM to generate 3000 responses given the following prompt: Discuss a person practicing a profession in 10 lines.We randomly selected 1000 responses that contain gender pronouns (i.e., she, he, her, his, and him), and labeled them as biased.We also randomly selected 700 responses that do not contain such pronouns and labeled them as unbiased.</p>
<p>It should be noted that not all gender pronouns are associated with bias.To ensure that our dataset is not creating a spurious correlation between gender bias and gender pronoun, we supplement the unbiased dataset with sentences that contain a gender pronoun yet do not have gender bias.To this end, we prompt each language model 100 times to generate sentences discussing the impact of a specific public figure.For example, the prompts include Discuss Nelson Mandela's leadership and its impact on South Africa, Discuss Thomas Edison's role in shaping modern electrical technology, and Discuss Jackie Robinson's breaking of baseball's color barrier.All these prompts are themselves generated by an LLM.These 300 responses contain gender pronouns when discussing a certain profession (e.g., politicians, athletes, etc.), yet they are not biased because they are concerned with specific people with publicly known genders.Together, this gives us a balanced dataset of 50% of responses (1000) with gender bias and 50% of responses (700 + 300) without such bias.See Appendix Figure 13 and 14 for examples in our dataset.</p>
<p>By using this dataset, we ensure that, for any language model to determine whether a certain response contains gender bias, it is insufficient to be given the response alone; the model also needs to know the context in which the response was provided, i.e., it needs to be given both the question and the response to that question.</p>
<p>Ideological Leaning Dataset</p>
<p>To evaluate whether self-reflection leads to more ideologically balanced responses, we proposed a benchmark dataset for ideological leaning, consisting of partisan-aligned and moderate responses, generated using the same three LLMs mentioned above.</p>
<p>Experiment Setup</p>
<p>Self-reflection experiments are performed using three different language models: GPT-4omini, Gemini 1.5-Flash, and Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct.We experiment with two different temperature values (0 and 1)-the results corresponding to temperature=1 are reported in the main manuscript, while those corresponding to temperature=0 are reported in the appendix.When temperature=1, all experiments are repeated three times, and we report the mean accuracy and its standard deviation across three repetitions.Data and code to reproduce our results can be found at github.com/Michael98Liu/self-reflection.</p>
<p>Evaluations</p>
<p>Self-Reflection Marginally Improves</p>
<p>Reasoning Capability</p>
<p>We begin by evaluating whether self-reflection improves the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.To this end, we obtain initial answers from each language model for each question in the MEDQA-USMLE, GSM8K and MMLU datasets.We experiment with two types of prompts to obtain the initial answers: (1) a simple prompt without chainof-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022), and</p>
<p>(2) a more complex prompt incorporating CoT.We then instruct the same language model to reflect on its initial answer using different reflection prompts.Our analysis yields two important findings.</p>
<p>First, as can be seen in Figure 1, the effectiveness of self-reflection varies significantly depending on both the reflection prompt and the language model being evaluated.For example, when asked to selfreflect using the prompt "critically reflect upon original answer", GPT achieves an accuracy of 63.7% on answering medical questions, achieving higher accuracy than 62.1%, its original accuracy.However, the accuracy is much lower (52.5%) if self-reflection is done by asking the model to verify if "original answer is wrong".Even the same prompt can lead to dramatically different performance with different language models.For example, although the prompt "critically reflect upon original answer" results in higher accuracy in GPT, it leads much lower accuracy with Gemini (55.6% to 43.4%).This suggests that any researchers evaluating the impact of self-reflection should do so with a variety of prompts and language models.See Appendix Figure 6 and 7 for a full list of the exact prompts tested.</p>
<p>Second, our experiments reveal that the reasoning ability of language models does not improve, or only marginally improve, after self-reflection.Specifically, when answering medical questions in the MEDQA-USMLE dataset and the math problems in the GSM8K dataset, language models achieve the best accuracy when prompted using CoT without self-reflection.When answering multiple-choice questions in the MMLU dataset, language models can achieve marginally better accuracy with self-reflection, but the differences are statistically insignificant in all cases.We do notice some exceptions, however, where self-reflection improves upon the original accuracy.When Gemini is initially asked to solve math problems without outputting the intermediate reasoning steps, for example, it originally achieved an accuracy of 37.3% (without intermediate reasoning steps), but the accuracy rose to 88.1% when the model was prompted to critically reflect on its original answer (Appendix Figure 3).However, this improvement remains lower than the accuracy achieved using CoT prompting alone (93.1%).Note that both GPT and Llama provide intermediate reasoning steps even when they are not explicitly instructed to do so.Hence, they do not benefit from self-reflection the same way Gemini does.</p>
<p>Intuitively, for self-reflection to be effective, LLMs must be able to identify and correct its mistakes while preserving its already-correct answers.Therefore, we hypothesize that the reason why self- Figure 1: The accuracy on MEDQA-USMLE dataset before and after self-reflection.The accuracy before self-reflection is denoted as "original answer", and the rest correspond to accuracies after self-reflection using one of the five prompts (Appendix Figure 6).Panel on the left correspond to self-reflections on initial responses obtained using simple initial response without CoT, while the panel on the right correspond to self-reflection on initial responses with CoT.The temperature value is set to 1 for text generation.</p>
<p>reflection often fails to improve accuracy is that the models fail to distinguish between correct and incorrect initial answers during self-reflection.To test this hypothesis, we use GSM8K as an example and plot the percentage of answers that are changed during self-reflection among answers that were initially wrong, and those that were initially correct, respectively.We find that the rates at which correct and incorrect answers are modified are strongly correlated (Appendix Figure 5).This indicates that language models tend to either change both correct or wrong answers, or retain both, at a high rate, demonstrating an inability to reliably distinguish between correct and incorrect responses.</p>
<p>Self-Reflection Improves Safety</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that self-reflection only marginally improves the reasoning capability of language models, we next turn to evaluate the ability of self-reflection to trigger the safety guardrails in LLMs.In this context, the primary goal of selfreflection is to refuse translating sentences with harmful content while retaining the translation of the safe ones.To see whether such is the case, we used two performance metrics.First, we evaluated whether LLMs can better detect unsafe responses after self-reflection; this was done by calculating the percentage of unsafe responses that are correctly blocked (i.e., true positive rate, or TPR).Second, we assessed the models' helpfulness (overblocking), measured as the number of safe responses retained (true negative rate, or TNR).</p>
<p>As can be seen in Figure 2, we found that different LLMs exhibit different levels of safety in their responses after self-reflection, likely due to differences in their architectures, training data, alignment processes, and optimization goals.Specifically, GPT-4o achieves the best overall accuracy of 86.8%, outperforming both Gemini (68.2%) and Llama (56.9%) after self-reflection.GPT-4o was able to detect unsafe users' queries and enhance the model's safety with a high TPR of 75.8%.Additionally, it is still able to keep the model's helpfulness with a TNR of 97.7%.This shows the excellent self-reflection capability of GPT-4o.While Gemini was only able to enhance safety guardrail by 36.3%, it does so without compromising the helpfulness.Llama, however, degraded the helpfulness without enhancing the safety significantly.Overall, GPT is well-balanced and has a stronger self-awareness filter, preventing it from confidently engaging in potentially harmful topics.On the other hand, Gemini's design choices may stem from a preference for usability (correct translation) over strict filtering, leading to strong self-reflection in safe contexts but weaker self-awareness in handling unsafe cases.</p>
<p>So far, we have demonstrated that both GPT and Gemini improve their ability to distinguish between safe and unsafe responses when prompted to selfreflect upon their own responses.However, it is not entirely clear whether such improvements are due to self-reflection, or simply due to the extra words contained in the self-reflection prompts.In other words, we ask: Can a language model just as accurately distinguish between safe and unsafe responses if asked to pay attention to safety issues while translating (which we call "non-reflection"), instead of being asked to self-reflect?To this end, we evaluated the performance on the non-reflection scenario by crafting a prompt to censor the user's queries only without considering responses.It was found that self-reflection yields the same performance as non-reflection in terms of unsafe content detection accuracy (TPR).However, using selfreflection can significantly enhance the helpfulness accuracy (from 82.9% to 97.8%) of the GPT-4o model.The reason is that GPT-4o blocks more questions (regardless of whether they are safe or not) when only French text queries are considered, but it is able to better distinguish safe from unsafe responses after self-reflection when both the French query and its English translation are given.On the contrary, Gemini shows better performance in the non-reflection scenario.Finally, Llama again exhibited the worst performance among the three in nonreflection scenarios.Appendix Table 6 presents the mean TPR, TNR, and overall accuracy for the three language models in no-reflection scenario.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the impact of selfreflection varies drastically depending on the prompt.Take GPT-4o-mini for example; the accuracy after self-reflection ranges between 63.1% and 86.8%.Moreover, a poorly chosen prompt may actually deteriorate the performance to be worse than the initial accuracy.This finding highlights the importance of prompt engineering in self-reflection tasks.See Appendix Figure 8 for a full list of prompts tested.Note that in those prompts, x refers to "your previous response" in the self-reflection scenario or "the given question" in the no-reflection scenario.</p>
<p>Self-Reflection Reduces Gender Bias</p>
<p>Next, we evaluate whether self-reflection reduces gender bias.We test the LLMs' ability to distinguish between biased and unbiased responses after self-reflection in the same manner as before.Consequently, we calculate the TPR (the percentage of biased responses that are correctly identified as such) as well as the TNR (the percentage of unbiased responses correctly identified as such).</p>
<p>As can be seen in Figure 3, the findings are similar to the previous experiment.First, we find that self-reflection successfully reduces gender bias in LLMs' output from 50% to 85.6% in GPT, 71.8% in Gemini, and 53.3% in Llama.Second, as can be seen, GPT-4o again outperforms Gemini and Llama in their overall ability to distinguish sentences with gender bias from those without such bias.Specifically, GPT-4o is able to detect its biased responses and enhance the model's fairness with a high TPR of 77.0%.Additionally, it is still able to detect unbiased responses with a TNR of 94.3%.These results demonstrate the remarkable self-reflection capability of GPT-4o.On the other hand, both Gemini and Llama exhibit worse performance compared to GPT.However, Gemini was able to reduce gender bias by 44.2% while keeping false positive rate low (0.6% FPR, or 99.4% TNR).Llama increased the false positives without substantially improving the bias detection.Finally, the specific prompts used to elicit self-reflections affect the language models' ability to accurately distinguish biased responses from unbiased ones.See Appendix Figure 9 for prompts used.</p>
<p>We notice several issues limit LLMs' ability to further reduce gender bias when self-reflecting.GPT has classified certain biased responses as unbiased due to its default association of professional roles with male figures when the pronoun "he" is used.Furthermore, GPT also perceives responses as unbiased when the pronoun "she" is included.Similarly, Gemini defended labeling its gender-biased response as unbiased by arguing that language mirrors reality.It claimed that referring to a "flight attendant" as "she" is reasonable and that using "he" for a "plumber" is grammatically correct.Additionally, it stated a preference for avoiding awkward phrasing, such as using "they."</p>
<p>Self-Reflection Improves Partisan Neutrality</p>
<p>In the fourth experiment, we used a dataset on ideological leaning to test how well self-reflection could tell the difference between LLMs' ideologically partisan and ideologically neutral responses.</p>
<p>We evaluated how well LLMs can detect politically skewed and moderate responses by calculating accuracy.Again, the findings are consistent with our earlier experiments on safety and gender bias.As can be seen in Figure 4, we found that LLMs show different levels of self-reflection in their responses.GPT-4o tends to perform better in self-reflection scenarios compared to Gemini and Llama.In particular, GPT-4o is able to detect its partisan-aligned responses and enhance the model's ideological neutrality with a high accuracy of 100%.Additionally, it is still able to detect unaligned or moderate responses with an accuracy of 87.7%.This shows the remarkable self-reflection capability of GPT-4o.On the other hand, both Gemini and Llama exhibit declined performance compared to GPT.However, Gemini was able to enhance the model's ideological neutrality by 44.0% while keeping false positives so low.Llama increased false positives while improving the detection of partisan-aligned responses.See Appendix Figure 10 for prompts used in experiments.For prompt construction sensitivity, we can see that different prompts yield varying accuracy results.These findings demonstrate the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt construction when it comes to identifying moderate and partisan responses.</p>
<p>Cross-Reflection</p>
<p>In the fifth experiment, we implemented a crossreflection technique, where one LLM evaluates, critiques, or refines the responses generated by another LLM.We applied this technique to two datasets: a safety dataset and an ideological leaning dataset.Given its superior performance in the self-reflection scenario, we selected GPT to critique the responses of Gemini and Llama.GPT effectively detected unsafe user queries and improved the safety of Gemini and Llama, achieving a high accuracy of 79.51%.Simultaneously, it preserved the models' helpfulness with an accuracy of 82.09%.Additionally, it identified partisanaligned responses and enhanced ideological neutrality with an impressive accuracy of 99.48%, while still recognizing moderate responses with an accuracy of 65.83%.For consistency, we used the same prompts from the safety and ideological leaning experiments.The Table 9 and 10 in Appendix presents the TPR, TNR, and overall accuracy of the three LLMs evaluated on the seven (for safety) and four prompts (for ideological leaning).</p>
<p>Summary of Evaluations</p>
<p>To sum up, although self-reflection only marginally improves the reasoning ability of LLMs, it can significantly increases the safety, reduces the bias, and decrease partisan leaning of LLMs (RQ1).Furthremore, proprietary LLMs (namely, GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 1.5-Flash) consistently outperform the open-source LLM (i.e., Llama 3.2-3B) in our experiments (RQ2).However, this could be due to both GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 1.5-Flash having more parameters compared to Llama 3.2-3B.Additionally, all three LLMs tested in our experiments are sensitive to prompt construction (RQ3), and different models have different optimal self-reflection prompt (RQ4); a prompt optimal for one model could be the worst prompt for another model.Finally, although using GPT to cross-reflect the responses of Gemini and Llama yields better performance than Gemini and Llama alone, GPT provides the highest accuracy when self-reflecting its own output (RQ5).We supplement Figures 1 to 4 by reporting the full numerical results in Appendix</p>
<p>Discussion and Conclusion</p>
<p>In this study, we showed that while self-reflection shows a limited effect on improving the reasoning capabilities of language models, it is capable of drastically improving the safety, gender neutrality, and political neutrality of language models.Given that most existing research on self-reflection focuses on reasoning ability, our findings point to new avenues of research on the underexplored areas where self-reflection is beneficial.</p>
<p>We theorize that self-reflection is best used when an LLM needs to meet multiple objectives at the same time, e.g., when a language model is asked to translate a sentence while, at the same time, ensuring that the output is not toxic.Our experiments demonstrated that LLMs tend to be bad at such multi-tasking.In particular, when asked to translate, it occasionally does so while disregarding safety issues.To put it differently, the first task (the translation) occasionally distracts the model from the second task (ensuring that the output is not toxic).Our analysis suggests that such multitasking scenarios are where self-reflection can significantly improve model performance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose self-reflection as a low-cost measure that can be deployed by any language model at test time to improve safety, gender neutrality, and political neutrality.Our work contributes to the growing body of research exploring the test-time scaling idea (Muennighoff et al., 2025), where models are allocated extra test-time compute to improve performance.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>We conduct all self-reflection experiments using the small versions of three LLMs, namely GPT-4omini, Gemini-1.5-Flash,and Llama-3.2-3B.Therefore, it remains to be demonstrated whether bigger models exhibit the same behavior.Additionally, although our experiments demonstrated that the outcome of self-reflection is sensitive to prompt construction, it remains a challenge to identify the most optimal prompt.Future work is needed to come up with systematic ways to construct the most optimal prompt used for self-reflection given a specific task and model.Table 6: No-reflection experiments using the safety dataset."No-reflection" means that LLMs are asked to pay attention to safety issues while translating, instead of being asked to self-reflect after translation, using the same prompts used in self-reflection experiments as in reported in Table 5.The temperature value is set to 1 for text generation.We experimented with seven different variations of no-reflection prompts.We repeat all experiments three times and report the average accuracy and its standard deviations (in brackets) across all repetitions.See the appendix for the exact prompts used in experiments.</p>

Self-reflection experiments using MEDQA-USMLE.The temperature value is set to 1 for text generation.To obtain the original answer, we prompted each LLM in two different ways: The first uses a simple prompt without chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, while the second uses a more complex prompt with CoT prompting.For each original answer, we experimented with five different variations of self-reflection prompts.We repeat all experiments three times and report the average accuracy and its standard deviations (in brackets) across all repetitions.See the Appendix Figure6for the exact prompts used in experiments.
