                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The transferability of the approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Chemically accurate and comprehensive studies of the virtual space of all possible molecules are severely limited by the computational cost of quantum chemistry. We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree-Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.</p>

            "efficiency_gain": "Qualitative efficiency gain: large reduction in the number of costly high-level calculations needed — only 1–10% of the dataset must be computed at high-level to obtain DFT-level predictions across the remainder. The paper demonstrates that electron-correlation energies of post-Hartree–Fock methods can be predicted at the computational cost of Hartree–Fock after training, implying orders-of-magnitude computational savings for large-scale screening (specific speedup factors or percent reductions are not given in the provided text).",
            "tradeoff_analysis": "The paper empirically demonstrates a cost–accuracy tradeoff by comparing models trained on different fractions (1% vs 10%) of a large dataset and showing transferability: smaller training fractions greatly reduce expensive computation but still allow ML-corrected predictions to reach chemical accuracy over large sets. However, the paper does not present an explicit formal analysis using information-theoretic metrics or an active-learning curve in the provided content.",
            "optimal_allocation_findings": "Recommended practical principle: allocate expensive high-accuracy quantum-chemical computations to a relatively small, representative training subset (demonstrated at 1% and 10% of ~134k molecules) and use machine learning to generalize corrections to the remainder; this yields high-level accuracy (chemical accuracy) with drastically reduced total computational cost. The paper does not appear to give a prescriptive selection algorithm (e.g., optimal subset selection by information gain) in the provided text, but validates that small fractions suffice empirically for large chemical spaces.",

  <meta name="description" content="Chemically accurate and comprehensive studies of the virtual space of all possible molecules are severely limited by the computational cost of quantum chemistry. We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree-Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.">

Meets Quantum Chemistry Approximations: The Δ-Machine Learning Approach","dateCreated":"2015-01-01","author":["Ramakrishnan, Raghunathan","Dral, Pavlo O.","Rupp, Matthias","von Lilienfeld, O. Anatole"],"abstract":"Chemically accurate and comprehensive studies of the virtual space of all possible molecules are severely limited by the computational cost of quantum chemistry. We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree-Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy."}</script></head>

We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree-Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.</div></div><button _ngcontent-sc71="" dsdragclick="" class="btn btn-link p-0 expandButton"><i _ngcontent-sc71="" class="fas

We introduce a composite strategy that adds machine learning corrections to computationally inexpensive approximate legacy quantum methods. After training, highly accurate predictions of enthalpies, free energies, entropies, and electron correlation energies are possible, for significantly larger molecular sets than used for training. For thermochemical properties of up to 16k isomers of C7H10O2 we present numerical evidence that chemical accuracy can be reached. We also predict electron correlation energy in post Hartree-Fock methods, at the computational cost of Hartree-Fock, and we establish a qualitative relationship between molecular entropy and electron correlation. The transferability of our approach is demonstrated, using semiempirical quantum chemistry and machine learning models trained on 1 and 10% of 134k organic molecules, to reproduce enthalpies of all remaining molecules at density functional theory level of accuracy.&q;,&q;place&q;:0,&q;authority&q;:null,&q;confidence&q;:-1}],&q;dc.description.rangeOfPages&q;:[{&q;uuid&q;:&q;7db68d2b-2179-4525-893d-2ba375c6ab43&q;,&q;language&q;:null,&q;value&q;:&q;2087-96&q;,&q;place&q;:0,&q;authority&q;:null,&q;confidence&q;:-1}],&q;dc.identifier.doi&q;:[{&q;uuid&q;:&q;6dc5df8a-f6bc-449f-a9ba-1202fd5be294&q;,&q;language&q;:null,&q;value&q;:&q;10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00099&q;,&q;place&q;:0,&q;authority&q;:null,&q;confidence&q;:-1}],&q;dc.identifier.pmid&q;:[{&q;uuid&q;:&q;f7d03e61-cd70-40b3-ae5a-fa4155b5911b&q;,&q;language&q;:null,&q;value&q;:&q;26574412&q;,&q;place&q;:0,&q;authority&q;:null,&q;confidence&q;:-1}],&q;dc.identifier.uri&q;:[{&q;uuid&q;:&q;73b85094-5441-44c0-9d05-062c6da1efe2&q;,&q;language&q;:null,&q;value&q;:&q;https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.14716/97620&q;,&q;place&q;:0,&q;authority&q;:null,&q;confidence&q;:-1}],&q;dc.publisher&q;:[{&q;uuid&q;:&q;29ac0c40-0bfc-4e40-bd67-10109adeee36&q;,&q;language&q;:null,&q;value&q;:&q;American
