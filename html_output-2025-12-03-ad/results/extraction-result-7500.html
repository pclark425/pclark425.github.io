                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We present a wormhole solution in four dimensions. It is a solution of an Einstein Maxwell theory plus charged massless fermions. The fermions give rise to a negative Casimir-like energy, which makes the wormhole possible. It is a long wormhole that does not lead to causality violations in the ambient space. It can be viewed as a pair of entangled near extremal black holes with an interaction term generated by the exchange of fermion fields. The solution can be embedded in the Standard Model by making its overall size small compared to the electroweak scale.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>We present a wormhole solution in four dimensions. It is a solution of an Einstein Maxwell theory plus charged massless fermions. The fermions give rise to a negative Casimir-like energy, which makes the wormhole possible. It is a long wormhole that does not lead to causality violations in the ambient space. It can be viewed as a pair of entangled near extremal black holes with an interaction term generated by the exchange of fermion fields. The solution can be embedded in the Standard Model by making its overall size small compared to the electroweak scale.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Schematic form of the solution we discuss here. It is a traversable wormhole threaded by magnetic fields. This drawing was made by John Wheeler in 1966.</p>
<p>It has been a long-standing speculation that wormhole configurations might exist, see figure 1, for example. Traversable short wormholes that join very distant points in space,</p>
<p>and would lead to causality violation, are not allowed by the Einstein equations combined with the achronal average null energy condition $[1,2,3,4]^{1}$. However, long traversable wormholes are in principle allowed. By "long" we mean that it takes longer to go through the wormhole than through the ambient space. Such solutions should crucially use quantum effects because they are not allowed in classical physics, which obeys the average null energy condition ${ }^{2}$. However, it has been difficult to find a controllable example. Here we provide an example by considering a solution that is close to a pair of extremal magnetically charged black holes. A single extremal charged black hole develops an infinitely long throat with the geometry of $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$. We consider a configuration where two such throats are joined to each other by a spacetime that again looks like $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$, but in global coordinates. The combined configuration has a time translation symmetry that corresponds to the global time translation of $A d S_{2}$ in the throat region. It has no horizon. In the presence of the magnetic field, a massless charged fermion gives rise to a series of Landau levels. The lowest Landau level has zero energy in the sphere directions and gives rise to massless fields in the radial and time directions. This Landau level has degeneracy $q$, where $q$ is an integer specifying the quantized magnetic flux through the sphere. A crucial idea in this paper is that, for large $q, q \gg 1$, a single four dimensional fermion field gives rise to $q$ two dimensional fields. This large number of fields enables parametric control of the solution. Each of the states within the lowest Landau level can be viewed as localized along a magnetic field lines. The corresponding two dimensional field moves on the spatial circle described by this magnetic field line. A two dimensional fermion on a circle gives rise to a negative Casimir-like vacuum energy. The vacuum stress tensor develops a negative null-null component leading to a violation of the average null energy condition along the null lines wrapping around the cylinder. Of course, these null lines are not achronal, see figure 2. This negative energy makes it possible to find a solution with a geometry close to global $A d S_{2}$ in the throat region. The Einstein equations in the throat region determine the length of the throat. In the ambient space, the two mouths of the throat look like a pair of extremal black holes with opposite charges. We can create a long lived solution if we imagine that they are rotating around each other. By adjusting the distance between them, we can make sure that they rotate slowly enough so that the throat is not de-stabilized. Rotation implies that the configuration emits gravitational and "electromagnetic" radiation which will cause the two mouths of the wormhole to eventually merge. This is a slow process and the wormhole can exist for a relatively long time. The</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>configuration is rather fragile. If enough energy is sent through the wormhole mouth, a pair of horizons will develop. However, the wormhole can be safely explored by sending low energy waves, whose propagation will display the characteristic features of the wormhole configuration.</p>
<p>The wormhole solution can be viewed as a pair of entangled black holes [8, 9, 10]. Similar solutions were found in [11] (following [12, 13]) by postulating an interaction between the fields on the two asymptotic regions of $A d S_{2}$. In this four dimensional configuration this interaction is generated automatically by the exchange of massless fields in the bulk.</p>
<p>The elements we used are rather general and solutions of this type are expected in any theory that contains these elements. In particular, the Standard Model of particle physics contains these elements. The $U(1)$ gauge field can be considered to be the weak hypercharge gauge field. And the overall size of the configuration, namely the distance between the two wormhole mouths, can be taken to be smaller than the electroweak scale to ensure that the fermions can be approximated as massless.</p>
<p>There are many possible variations of the basic construction, such as putting it in $A d S_{4}$, etc, which we will not explore in detail here.</p>
<p>Another very interesting question which we will not address is whether the wormhole can be reached starting from two separate near extremal black holes.</p>
<p>Interesting examples of traversable wormholes supported by Casimir energy were also recently discussed in [14].</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows. In section two we review the geometry of extremal and near extremal charged black holes. We also consider a charged fermion propagating on this background. In section three we consider a pair of pointlike magnetic charges and we study the geometry of the field lines. In section four we discuss the general strategy for finding the solution by splitting it into three different regions. In section five we discuss the wormhole region, the Casimir energy, and we show that enforcing Einstein's equations fixes the length of the wormhole. In section six we discuss the rotating configuration of the two mouths. In section 8 we discuss some aspects of this type of solutions in the Standard Model. In section 9 we present some conclusions.</p>
<h1>2 Single Magnetically charged black hole</h1>
<h3>2.1 The theory</h3>
<p>In this paper we will consider a theory described by Einstein gravity plus a $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to a set of massless Weyl fermions. In order to have no anomalies we need that the sum of the cube of the charges and well as the sum of the charges is zero. As a simple example, we can consider a single charged Dirac fermion with charge one. We will discuss this case for most of the paper. The action is</p>
<p>$$
I=\int d^{4} x \sqrt{g}\left[\frac{R}{16 \pi G_{N}}-\frac{1}{4 g^{2}} F^{2}+i \bar{\chi}(\nabla \nabla-i A) \chi\right]
$$</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: In (a) we see a particular field line highlighted in green. There is a corresponding lowest Landau level state localized around this field line. It describes a massless two dimensional field moving along the field line, which has the topology of a circle. In (b) we see a cylindrical spacetime. The null line that wraps around the circle is not achronal, since we can see that there are points that are timelike separated along this null line. The average null energy along this line is negative.</p>
<p>We assume that $g$ is small so that loop corrections are suitably suppressed.</p>
<h1>2.2 Single charged black holes</h1>
<p>We start by recalling the form of the magnetically charged black hole solution, with metric and gauge field given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
d s^{2} &amp; =-\left(1-\frac{2 M G_{N}}{r}+\frac{r_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}\right) d t^{2}+\left(1-\frac{2 M G_{N}}{r}+\frac{r_{e}^{2}}{r^{2}}\right)^{-1} d r^{2}+r^{2}\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right) \
A &amp; =\frac{q}{2} \cos \theta d \phi, \quad r_{e}^{2} \equiv \frac{\pi q^{2} l_{p}^{2}}{g^{2}}, \quad l_{p} \equiv \sqrt{G_{N}}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where $M$ is the mass and $q$ is an integer, giving us the charge of the black hole. Here $g$ is the coupling constant of the $U(1)$ gauge field. In the quantum theory, $g$ is the running coupling evaluated at distance scale $r_{e} / \sqrt{q}$, which is the scale set by the magnetic field. The horizon is located at $r=r_{+}$, where $r_{ \pm}$are given by:</p>
<p>$$
r_{ \pm}=M G_{N} \pm \sqrt{M^{2} G_{N}^{2}-r_{e}^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>The temperature and entropy are given by</p>
<p>$$
T=\frac{r_{+}-r_{-}}{4 \pi r_{+}^{2}}, \quad S=\frac{\pi r_{+}^{2}}{G_{N}}
$$</p>
<p>At extremality, $T \rightarrow 0$ and $r_{+}=r_{-}=r_{e}$. Near extremality, for small temperatures, we can expand</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
M &amp; =\frac{r_{e}}{G_{N}}+\frac{2 \pi^{2} r_{e}^{3} T^{2}}{G_{N}}+\cdots \
S &amp; =\frac{\pi r_{e}^{2}}{G_{N}}+\frac{4 \pi^{2} r_{e}^{3} T}{G_{N}}+\cdots
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The near horizon geometry of these black holes is approximately given by an $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$ geometry</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
d s^{2}=r_{e}^{2}\left[-d \tau_{r}^{2}\left(\rho_{r}^{2}-1\right)+\frac{d \rho_{r}^{2}}{\rho_{r}^{2}-1}+\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)\right] \
\tau_{r}=2 \pi T t, \quad \rho_{r}=\frac{\left(r-r_{e}\right)}{2 \pi T r_{e}^{2}}, \quad \text { for } \quad r-r_{e} \ll r_{e}
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>where we have also given the relation between the near horizon coordinates and the ones in (2.2). We see that this geometry is a good description when $r-r_{e} \ll r_{e}$ and also when $T r_{e} \ll 1$. This geometry connects with the flat space region via a transition region which is located where $r \sim r_{e}$. See figure 3 .
<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Schematic form of a near extremal black hole geometry. As we approach extremality, a long "throat" with an $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$ geometry develops.</p>
<h1>2.3 Charged fermions moving in a magnetic black hole</h1>
<p>We now consider a massless charged fermion moving in the magnetically charged black hole background (2.2). The basic physics is the following. We have a magnetic field on the sphere. This leads to a series of Landau levels. The energy of the Landau levels has an orbital contribution and a magnetic dipole contribution. For fermions, these two precisely cancel for the lowest Landau level. So we get states with zero energy on the sphere. In fact, this lowest level has degeneracy $q$, which is also related to the angular momentum, $j$, by $2 j+1=q$. Here we assumed that the fermion has charge one. Each of these states gives rise to a massless two dimensional field in the radial and time directions. In conclusion, a four dimensional chiral fermion gives rise to $q$ massless two dimensional chiral fermions, whose two dimensional chirality depends both on the four dimensional chirality and the sign of the charge ${ }^{3}$.</p>
<p>The fact that we get zero energy states on the sphere can be understood in terms of anomalies [21]. Viewing the $U(1)$ gauge field as a fixed background field, the massless four dimensional fermion has a $U(1)<em A="A">{V} \times U(1)</em>$ imply that we should have two dimensional anomalies. So we should have two dimensional massless chiral fermions after reducing on the sphere. This can be seen by dimensionally reducing the anomaly polynomial of the four dimensional theory to the two dimensional one, which acquires an overall factor of $q$. This is consistent with a four dimensional Dirac fermion giving rise to $q$ two dimensional Dirac fermions.}$ symmetry. The four dimensional anomalies involving $U(1)_{A</p>
<p>So far we have ignored the dynamics of the gauge field. It turns out that the dynamics of the gauge field gives a small mass to some of the two dimensional the fermions. We will ignore this effect here because it is subleading for large $q$. Further discussion can be found in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Since this discussion can sound a bit abstract, it is also useful to explicitly solve the Dirac equation. Since the massless Dirac equation (and the Maxwell field) are Weyl invariant we can scale out the metric of the two sphere as an overall factor, so that the size of the sphere is constant. This amounts to dividing the metric (2.2) by $r^{2}$. We can then factorize the four dimensional spinor as</p>
<p>$$
\chi=\psi \otimes \eta
$$</p>
<p>where $\eta$ is a spinor on the $S^{2}$ and $\psi$ a spinor in the other two directions. The lowest Landau level corresponds to a negative chirality spinor $\eta_{-}$that obeys the two dimensional massless Dirac equation on the two sphere with a magnetic field, $\gamma^{\alpha}\left(\nabla_{\alpha}-i A_{\alpha}\right) \eta=0$. These solutions have the form</p>
<p>$$
\eta_{-} \propto e^{i m \phi}\left(\sin \frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{j-m}\left(\cos \frac{\theta}{2}\right)^{j+m}, \quad j=\frac{q-1}{2}, \quad-j \leq m \leq j
$$</p>
<p>where $m$ is the $J^{3}$ quantum number. See appendix C for more details.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Note that for large $q$ these wavefunctions are well localized near $\theta_{m}$ given by</p>
<p>$$
\cos \theta_{m}=\frac{m}{j}, \quad(\Delta \theta)^{2} \sim \frac{1}{q}, \quad q \gg 1
$$</p>
<p>where we also indicated the rough size of the wavefunction around the central value. These wavefunctions are extended along the $\phi$ direction of the sphere.</p>
<p>As we said before, each of these modes on the sphere gives rise to a two dimensional massless mode $\psi_{m}$ on the $r$ and $t$ directions. Again, this two dimensional system is conformal invariant, so we can ignore the overall factor in the two dimensional metric. In other words, these fermions propagate on a space with the metric</p>
<p>$$
d s_{2}^{2}=\left|g_{t t}\right|\left[-d t^{2}+d x^{2}\right], \quad \text { where } \quad d x=\sqrt{\frac{g_{r r}}{-g_{t t}}} d r
$$</p>
<p>As a final comment let us note that if we consider a scalar field instead of a fermion field, then the Landau levels all have positive energy, with the lowest one having an energy of order $E \sim \sqrt{B}$. This is also the order of magnitude of the energy for all the other non-zero energies in the case of the fermion field. In the throat region, this leads to modes which have masses in $A d S$ units of the form $m^{2} R_{A d S_{2}}^{2} \propto q$. These relatively large masses lead to fields that decay quickly in the $A d S_{2}$ region and do not give rise to significant Casimir energy. If we had a charged spin one field, then we would have an instability. This arises when the magnetic field is part of a non-abelian gauge group and it represents the fact that the magnetic field can be screened. This is why we insisted that the gauge field is $U(1)$.</p>
<h1>3 Two oppositely charged black holes</h1>
<p>We now consider two oppositely charged magnetic black holes. Let us imagine that the two black holes are at some relative distance $d$ that is large compared to their size, $d \gg r_{e}$. First we will ignore the motion of the black holes, which will be relatively slow, and focus on the massless fermions, which can move at the speed of light. At distances large compared to $r_{e}$, we can approximate the black holes as two magnetic monopoles in flat space. These produce a magnetic field simply given by the vector potential (see figure 4)</p>
<p>$$
A=\frac{q}{2}\left(\cos \theta_{1}-\cos \theta_{2}\right) d \phi
$$</p>
<p>where $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$ are the angles relative to the $\hat{z}$ axis, which is the axis joining the two black holes and $\phi$ is a azimuthal angle. The configuration is rotational invariant around this axis. In order to find the form of the magnetic field lines it is convenient to write the spatial metric in polar coordinates, $d s^{2}=d \rho^{2}+d z^{2}+\rho^{2} d \phi^{2}$. The magnetic field can then be written as</p>
<p>$$
B_{\rho}=\frac{\partial_{z} A_{\phi}}{\rho}, \quad B_{z}=-\frac{\partial_{\rho} A_{\phi}}{\rho}, \quad B_{\phi}=0
$$</p>
<p>The equations for the field lines should be such that the tangent vector is along $\vec{B}$. We see that if we consider the solutions of the equation $A_{\phi}=$ constant, then its gradient is normal to $\vec{B}$ due to (3.14) and therefore the tangent vectors to the curve are along $\vec{B}$. Then the equations for the field lines are at $\phi=$ constant and</p>
<p>$$
\cos \theta_{1}-\cos \theta_{2}=\nu, \quad 0 \leq \nu \leq 2, \quad \nu=\frac{j+m}{j}
$$</p>
<p>where we also indicted the relation between $\nu$ and the value of the angular momentum of a fermion at that angular position near each of the black holes, as computed via (2.11).
<img alt="img-3.jpeg" src="img-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Magnetic field lines for two sources at distance $d$. We have plotted the magnetic field lines for a few values of $\nu$ in equation (3.15). We have also defined the angles $\theta_{1}, \theta_{2}$.</p>
<h1>3.1 Fermions outside the black holes</h1>
<p>We now consider the massless fermions moving in the magnetic field described in the previous section. We are now interested in the solutions at distances comparable to the distance, $d$, between the two sources. We want to focus on solutions with low energies, low compared to $\sqrt{q} / d$. For this reason we are interested in the lowest Landau levels. Near each of the sources the solutions are approximately the ones described above, with the fermion wavefunctions localized on the field lines. In fact, we can make the approximation that the fermions continue to be localized along the field lines throughout the whole intermediate region. This amounts to solving the Dirac equation in a WKB-type approximation. Quantitatively, the condition that massless fermions follow the magnetic lines can</p>
<p>be stated as follows. First of all, for massless fermions the wave function will be localized over distances $\sim 1 / \sqrt{B}$. We demand that the magnetic field changes adiabatically over this distance:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{B}} \frac{1}{B} \frac{\partial B}{\partial r} \ll 1
$$</p>
<p>Since the magnetic field goes as the dipole field, namely, as $\sim q d / r^{3}$, this implies that the fermions will follow the lines up until distance $r \sim q d$. Using the result of Appendix D we see that this distance corresponds to $\nu$ near $0: \nu \sim 1 / q$. We conclude that only a small fraction of fermions will not follow the magnetic lines and fly away to infinity. See appendix E for further discussion.</p>
<p>The fermion with angular momentum $J_{z}=m$ follows a magnetic field line obeying (3.15). The length of this magnetic field line is is proportional to $d$ times a function of $\nu$</p>
<p>$$
L_{\text {flat }}=d f(\nu)
$$</p>
<p>where precise form of $f(\nu)$ is given in appendix D, eqn. (D.21). This is also the length in the $x$ coordinate defined in (2.12) because $g_{t t}=1$ in this flat space region we are considering.</p>
<h1>4 General strategy</h1>
<p>Our strategy for finding and describing the solution is the following. We cut the solution in three pieces: 1) the wormhole, 2) the mouth, and 3) the flat space region, see figure 5. We approximate the solution in different ways in each region. These approximations have overlapping regions of validity so that we can patch the solutions. In the wormhole region we approximate the solution as $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$ plus a small deformation. In region 2) we approximate it as the mouth of the single black hole solution (2.2). It turns out to be a black hole with a mass slightly below extremality. In 3), the flat space region, we approximate the two mouths as two point-like masses and charges, incorporating their almost Newtonian dynamics, emission of radiation, etc.</p>
<h2>5 The wormhole region</h2>
<p>In this section we find the solution in the wormhole region, see figure (5). We do this in a few steps. First we write down the geometry of the wormhole as $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$, which is a solution of the leading order Einstein equations with gravity and the magnetic field. It is not quite a solution of those equations once we deform it so that each of the two boundaries turns into mouths connecting the throat into flat space. After this deformation we have one free parameter, called $\ell$, which parametrizes the length of the wormhole. We then consider a massless fermion in this geometry and argue that it generates negative energy. This negative energy then produces a solution with the length $\ell$ fixed to a special value.</p>
<p><img alt="img-4.jpeg" src="img-4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5: We separate the solution into three overlapping regions: 1) the wormhole, 2) the mouth and 3) the nearly flat space region. Within each region we describe the solution using a different metric which coincide with that of the next region in the overlapping regions of validity.</p>
<p>First we show this from a quick energy minimization argument. Then we analyze in detail Einstein's equations in the wormhole region.</p>
<h1>5.1 The geometry</h1>
<p>We will now make a precise ansatz for the wormhole geometry that joins the two throat regions. As a first approximation, the geometry is that of $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=r_{e}^{2}\left[-(\rho^{2}+1) d \tau^{2}+\frac{d \rho^{2}}{\left(\rho^{2}+1\right)}+\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)\right]
$$</p>
<p>This is a solution of Einstein's equations with a magnetic field on $S^{2}$. We know this since it is a limit of the original charged black hole solution (2.7). (5.18) is a different coordinate system for $A d S_{2}$ compared to (2.7). (5.18) is the so called "global" coordinate system which covers the whole Penrose diagram of $A d S_{2}$, see figure 6 . We want to match each of the two asymptotic regions to each of the two black holes, see figure (6b). So for large $\rho$ we match the geometry (5.18) to the small $r$ region of the extremal black hole geometry, $(2.2)$, via</p>
<p>$$
\tau=\frac{t}{\ell}, \quad \rho=\frac{\ell\left(r-r_{e}\right)}{r_{e}^{2}}, \quad \text { for } 1 \ll \rho, \quad \frac{r-r_{e}}{r_{e}} \ll 1, \quad 1 \ll \frac{\ell}{r_{e}}
$$</p>
<p>where $\ell$ is a free parameter that we will soon fix. Since the throat opens up at $r-r_{e} \sim r_{e}$ we see that we can trust the $A d S_{2}$ geometry until $\rho_{\text {cutoff }} \propto \frac{\ell}{r_{e}}$. We assume that $\ell / r_{e} \gg 1$ and we will check it later. Here $\ell$ is a length like quantity that plays a role similar to the</p>
<p>inverse temperature $\beta=1 / T$ in (2.8), in the sense that it provides a rescaling between the $A d S_{2}$ time and the asymptotic time. Notice that the time direction never shrinks in (5.18), so that this configuration is not a black hole, since it does not have a horizon. And this spacetime is at zero temperature (for now).
<img alt="img-5.jpeg" src="img-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6: In (a) we display in red the region corresponding to the near horizon region of a near extremal black hole. The two triangles correspond to the two exteriors of the maximally extended black hole. The regions shaded in grey should be cut out, and instead replaced by a geometry that connects to flat space. These red regions correspond to a Rindler-like portion of global $A d S_{2}$ space. In (b) we consider the full $A d S_{2}$ space in global coordinates. We cut out the shaded regions near the boundaries. We will then patch that geometry to flat space. We have also highlighted a $\tau=0$ slice which is very similar for the geometries in (a) and (b).</p>
<p>It is interesting to calculate the rescaled length of the wormhole in the $x$ coordinates introduced in (2.12). We find</p>
<p>$$
L_{\text {throat }}=\Delta x \sim \int_{-\rho_{\text {cutoff }}}^{\rho_{\text {cutoff }}} d \rho \frac{\ell}{\left(1+\rho^{2}\right)} \sim \pi \ell
$$</p>
<p>Therefore we can interpret $\ell$ as setting the "length" of the wormhole. Notice that this is not the proper length. It is the effective length that a two dimensional massless field will effectively see, after we normalize the time coordinate as in the asymptotically flat region. Note that (5.20) is also the time that it takes to go through the wormhole, as measured in terms of the asymptotically flat spacetime coordinate $t$. In other words, if an outside observer sends a signal into one side at $t=0$, he or she will see it emerge from the other side at time $t=\pi \ell . \ell$ also sets the energy gap for excitations deep inside the wormhole. For example, we can consider a massless four dimensional field, which we expand in Kaluza Klein modes on the $S^{2}$. Then, these excitations have energies of order one measured in</p>
<p>terms of the time $\tau$. However, they have energies of order $1 / \ell$ measured in terms of the outside time $t$. So we can say that the energy gap for the wormhole geometry is</p>
<p>$$
E_{\text {gap }} \propto \frac{1}{\ell}
$$</p>
<h1>5.2 Negative energy</h1>
<p>Solutions with the shape that we have discussed so far cannot exist without negative energy. However, we have set up the whole configuration so that we have a sizable source of negative energy. This comes from the effectively massless two dimensional fermions. These are modes that move along the magnetic field lines. They come out of one the throats, moving along the field lines in the flat space region, they go into the other throat and then through the wormhole in (5.18) they emerge again in the original throat. Therefore each massless mode lives on a circle, parametrized by coordinates $t$ and $x$, (2.12), of total length</p>
<p>$$
L \equiv \oint d x \sim L_{\text {throat }}+L_{\text {flat }}(\nu), \quad L_{\text {throat }}=\pi \ell, \quad L_{\text {flat }}=d f(\nu)
$$</p>
<p>where $\pi \ell$ is the contribution in the connecting wormhole region and $L_{\text {flat }}(\nu)$ is the distance (3.17). First we will assume that</p>
<p>$$
\ell \gg d
$$</p>
<p>This implies that for most of the field lines we have that $\ell \gg L_{\text {flat }}(\nu)$ and $L=\pi \ell$. After we find the value of $\ell$, we will check this assumption, (5.23).</p>
<p>If we had $q$ complex fermions with both left and right moving components moving on a circle of length $L$ we would have a ground state energy</p>
<p>$$
E_{\text {flat cylinder }}=-\frac{q}{12} \frac{2 \pi}{L}=-\frac{1}{6} \frac{q}{\ell}
$$</p>
<p>It is tempting to say that this is also the energy in our case. However, in the wormhole region, the spacetime where these fermions live is not flat, it is only conformally flat. So we need to take into account the two dimensional conformal anomaly. One quick way to derive the effect of the anomaly is to note that for the case of $A d S_{2}$ with reflecting boundary conditions at both boundaries we do not expect to see negative energy. In this case the field configuration and the boundary conditions are $S L(2)$ invariant so we cannot have a null-null component in the stress tensor. On the other hand, on a flat strip of length $L$ we have a negative energy of the form</p>
<p>$$
E_{\text {flat strip }}=-\frac{q}{24} \frac{\pi}{L}
$$</p>
<p>This means that the conformal anomaly contribution must be such that it cancels this precisely, see appendix F. Therefore, in our case, we have a total negative energy of the form</p>
<p>$$
E_{\text {wormhole }}=+\frac{q}{24} \frac{\pi}{L}-\frac{q}{12} \frac{2 \pi}{L}=-\frac{q}{8 \ell}

$$}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\alpha \beta} T_{\alpha}^{\alpha</p>
<p>where we have extracted the two dimensional trace contribution, which also is related to the conformal anomaly. This trace part can also have contributions from the other four dimensional modes.</p>
<p>When we wrote (5.24) we had implicitly assumed that the fermions have anti-periodic boundary conditions around the cylinder. In fact, this corresponds to a choice of spin structure. It is part of the specification of the geometry in a theory with fermions. We chose the fermions to be antiperiodic. In this particular case of a single charged fermion, the two choices are continuously connected by another continuous variable which the Wilson line of the gauge field around the circle. Since the Casimir energy depends on this Wilson line, the Wilson line is fixed to the value that minimizes it, which is again the antiperiodic boundary condition. This is related to the fact that the two dimensional gauge field becomes massive in the throat, see appendix (A).</p>
<p>One might question whether it is reasonable to ignore all the other quantum effects due to all the other modes of the fermion field, as well as the other modes of the gauge field and gravity. The logic for ignoring them is the following. All other modes of the fields are massive in the throat region, with a mass at least of order one in units of the radius of the sphere or $A d S$. In the case that we have exactly $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$, all these other modes give a stress tensor which respects the $S L(2) \times S U(2)$ symmetries and is proportional to the metrics of $A d S_{2}$ and/or $S^{2}$. Such contributions to the quantum stress tensor slightly change the radius of the $S^{2}$ or $A d S_{2}$. This is not a qualitative change. Therefore we will ignore components of the stress tensor that are proportional to the $A d S_{2}$ and/or $S^{2}$ metrics. When we consider the wormhole geometry, we get nontrivial boundary conditions that relate the fields at the two opposite ends of $A d S_{2}$. This arises because the two mouths of the wormhole are close in the ambient space. However, for massive fields, the effect of this change of boundary conditions dies relatively quickly as we go deeper into the throat. This means that we do not get a significant contribution to the qualitatively important components of the stress tensor from these modes.</p>
<h1>5.3 Stabilizing the wormhole</h1>
<p>In this subsection we will determine the length $\ell$ of the wormhole. We will first present a quick argument and then present a longer, conceptually clearer, argument, by solving explicitly Einstein's equations with the quantum stress tensor source.</p>
<h3>5.3.1 Quick variational ansatz argument</h3>
<p>Notice that the full extended Penrose diagram of a near extremal black hole also contains a wormhole. As opposed to the one we are considering here, this is not a traversable</p>
<p>wormhole. However, if we focus purely on the $t=0$ slice of the geometry we find a configuration similar to the $t=0$ slice of the above wormhole if we connect the temperature to $\ell$ with the equation</p>
<p>$$
T=\frac{1}{2 \pi \ell}
$$</p>
<p>obtained by comparing the rescaling of both time directions. In order to make the connection between the two geometries it is useful to note the explicit change of coordinates between $\tau_{r}, \rho_{r}$ in (2.7) and (5.18). This is most simply obtained by expressing the embedding coordinates $X^{M}, X^{2}=-1$, in both sets of coordinates. In particular, this implies that</p>
<p>$$
X^{1}=\rho=\sqrt{\rho_{r}^{2}-1} \cosh \tau_{r}
$$</p>
<p>As $\rho$ goes from being positive to negative we move through the Rindler horizon, $\left(\tau_{r} \rightarrow\right.$ $\tau_{r}+i \pi)$.</p>
<p>We can now set up a variational ansatz for the geometry as follows. First we ignore the quantum corrections and compute the classical energy by focusing on the $\tau=0$ slice and equating the geometry to that of the $\tau_{r}=0$ of the standard near extremal wormhole. This last energy is simply the energy of two near extremal black holes (2.6) at the temperature (5.28). Quantum effects then add the Casimir energy (5.26) so that we get a total energy (relative to that of two extremal black holes)</p>
<p>$$
E=\frac{r_{e}^{3}}{G_{N} \ell^{2}}-\frac{q}{8 \ell}
$$</p>
<p>We now set the value of $\ell$ by minimizing this, and we get</p>
<p>$$
\ell=16 \frac{r_{e}^{3}}{G_{N} q}=\frac{16 \pi^{3 / 2} q^{2} l_{p}}{g^{3}}, \quad E_{\min }=-\frac{G_{N} q^{2}}{256 r_{e}^{3}}=-\frac{g^{3}}{256 \pi^{3 / 2} q l_{p}}
$$</p>
<p>where we have also written the net result for the binding energy coming from the throat, relative the the energy of two disconnected extremal black holes. Since this is the minimum energy configuration, we then expect it to lead to a time independent solution, which is the wormhole we are after.</p>
<p>Though this procedure seems to be intuitively reasonable, we have not derived it directly from Einstein's equations. Therefore in the next section we rederive this result by directly solving Einstein's equations.</p>
<h1>5.3.2 Directly solving the Einstein equations with quantum matter</h1>
<p>Here we directly solve the semiclassical Einstein equations. We will divide the problem into two regions. First we consider the classical solution in a region that goes from flat space until deep in the throat. There we will mostly ignore the quantum effects. We make a spherically symmetric ansatz for the geometry</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-A(r) d t^{2}+B(r) d r^{2}+r^{2} d \Omega^{2}, \quad F=d A=-\frac{q}{2} \sin \theta d \theta d \phi
$$</p>
<p>The most general solution that is asymptotically flat has only one integration constant which is the mass parameter in (2.2). This integration constant will be set after we solve the equations in the wormhole region.</p>
<p>$$
A=\frac{1}{B}=\left(1-\frac{r_{e}}{r}\right)^{2}-\frac{2 \varepsilon}{r}, \quad \varepsilon \equiv G_{N} M-r_{e}
$$</p>
<p>where $\varepsilon$ is proportional to the difference between the mass and the extremal mass.
In the wormhole region, we could dimensionally reduce the equations to two dimensions, where we recover the Jackiw-Teitelboim theory [22, 23, 24, 25]. Then the solution of the equations can be obtained from appendix C of [11]. For the benefit of the readers who are not familiar with all that, we will solve them directly here.</p>
<p>In the wormhole region we can expand the metric as a perturbation away from $A d S_{2} \times S^{2}$</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=r_{e}^{2}\left[-\left(1+\rho^{2}+\gamma\right) d \tau^{2}+\frac{d \rho^{2}}{1+\rho^{2}+\gamma}+(1+\phi)\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)\right]
$$</p>
<p>where $\phi$ and $\gamma$ are small quantities, so that we expand the denominator to first order in $\gamma$. The four dimensional stress tensor contains a classical piece from the magnetic field. The quantum part of the stress tensor was computed in (5.27).</p>
<p>We can now write the $\rho \rho$ component of Einstein's equation to obtain</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; R_{\rho \rho}-\frac{1}{2} g_{\rho \rho} R-\left(8 \pi G_{N}\right)\left[T_{\rho \rho}^{\mathrm{mag}}+\hat{T}<em N="N">{\rho \rho}\right]=0 \rightarrow \

\end{aligned}
$$}\right)}{4 \pi r_{e}^{2}</p>
<p>where we used that the quantum contribution to the stress tensor is</p>
<p>$$

The parts of the stress tensor that are proportional to the $A d S</em>$ and are not interesting for our purposes.}$ metric or the $S^{2}$ metric simply rescale the overall sizes of the $S^{2}$ or $A d S_{2</p>
<p>The most general solution of (5.36) contains also a term linear in $\rho$ which we have set to zero by demanding a $Z_{2}$ symmetry around $\rho=0$ to obtain (5.37). The $\tau \tau$ component of Einstein's equations is then automatically obeyed. In addition, we can look at the sphere components of Einstein's equations. These determine the form of $\gamma$. Fortunately we will not need $\gamma$.</p>
<p>We now should match the throat solution to the asymptotic solution. We perform this matching at large $\rho$ where</p>
<p>$$
r^{2} \sim r_{e}^{2}(1+\phi) \quad \longrightarrow \quad 2 \frac{r-r_{e}}{r_{e}}=\phi \sim \frac{\pi \alpha}{2} \rho
$$</p>
<p>where the first equality is obtained by comparing the sphere part of the metric between (5.32) and (5.34). The second equality comes from expanding (5.37) at large $\rho$. We can now compare the leading order time component of the metrics to determine $\ell$</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\left(r-r_{e}\right)}{r_{e}^{2}} d t=\rho d \tau \longrightarrow \ell=\frac{d t}{d \tau}=\frac{r_{e}^{2} \rho}{\left(r-r_{e}\right)}=\frac{4 r_{e}}{\pi \alpha}=16 \frac{r_{e}^{3}}{q G_{N}}
$$</p>
<p>which agrees with (5.31). We can also compare the leading expansion of the metric (5.32) (5.33) with (5.34) (with $\gamma=0$ ) to obtain</p>
<p>$$
r_{e}^{2}\left(1+\rho^{2}\right) d \tau^{2}=\left[\frac{\left(r-r_{e}\right)^{2}}{r_{e}^{2}}-2 \frac{\epsilon}{r_{e}}\right] d t^{2}
$$</p>
<p>Using (5.40) and (5.39) we see that the $\rho^{2}$ term is identical to the $\left(r-r_{e}\right)^{2}$ in the right hand side. Equating the constant terms on both sides we get</p>
<p>$$
E_{\min }=\frac{2 \epsilon}{G_{N}}=-\frac{1}{256} \frac{q^{2} G_{N}}{r_{e}^{3}}
$$</p>
<p>which is the wormhole energy reproducing what we found in (5.31). The factor of two comes from the mass correction to each of the two black holes. We have also checked that the radial components of the metrics match. We see that we only needed to use the leading form of the time component of the metric, so that we justify neglecting $\gamma$ in (5.34). If you are curious, you can find the form of $\gamma$ in appendix B.</p>
<p>Note that $\epsilon$ in (5.42) is smaller than zero, which is less than the extremality bound. For a single black hole this would lead to a naked singularity. However, in our case, with the additional Casimir energy contribution, we find that the geometry of the throat is completely smooth.</p>
<h1>5.4 Stability of the throat under small perturbations</h1>
<p>It is important to check that the throat is not so long that quantum gravity fluctuations become large. For a near extremal black hole this happens when the temperature is so low that the near extremal entropy is of order one, $r_{e}^{3} T / G_{N} \sim 1$. Since $1 / T$ is setting the length of the throat, and is analogous to $\ell$, we expect that quantum fluctuations will become important when $r_{e}^{3} /\left(G_{N} \ell\right) \sim 1^{4}$. So the solution presented here is valid only when</p>
<p>$$
\ell \ll q^{3} l_{p}
$$</p>
<p>In (5.31) we got $\ell \propto q^{2} l_{p}$, which obeys this bound ${ }^{5}$.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref3:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the throat energy gap is $(5.21), E_{g a p} \sim 1 /\left(q^{2} l_{p}\right)$. However, if we send too much energy into the throat we run the risk of making a near extremal black hole. This happens when we send an energy that is larger than the binding energy of the throat (5.31) which is of order $1 /\left(q l_{p}\right)$. While this is larger than the gap by a factor of $q$, it is still a relatively small energy. In fact, an object that has a Compton wavelength of order $r_{e}$ outside the throat will already have this energy!. This means that these wormholes are not safe for human travelers, who will need $r_{e}$ much larger than their Compton wavelength!. On the other hand, the presence of the wormholes can be detected by sending very low energy waves. These could be the charged fermion fields themselves, for example. They can still make into the throat region and can come back out the other black hole after a time of order $\ell$, revealing the presence of an energy gap. We can say that the wormhole is traversable for waves, but not for very small and energetic objects. It is a fragile and delicate wormhole.</p>
<h1>5.5 Wormholes at larger distances, $d&gt;q^{2} l_{p}$</h1>
<p>Since we found that $\ell \sim q^{2} l_{p}$ and we had assumed that $d \ll \ell(5.23)$, we conclude that the discussion in the preceding sections holds only in the case $d \ll q^{2} l_{p}$. We can wonder what happens when $d$ is larger than this value. To analyze this we need to take into account the length of the field lines outside the wormhole (5.20). So the total length is $L=\pi \ell+d f(\nu)$, which depends on the particular angular momentum of the charged fermion wavefunction. The Casimir energy will then have a contribution involving $1 / L$ which needs to be integrated over $\nu$. This approximation breaks down for some of the fermion wavefunctions that can escape to infinity, but these give a subleading contribution anyway, so we ignore this issue. Notice that when we talk about "length" we are referring to length in the coordinate $x$ defined in (2.12). We should also take into account the effects of the conformal anomaly inside the throat. This is a positive energy contribution that only depends on the geometry of the throat (and $\ell$ ), but is independent of the total length of the magnetic field lines. Putting these two contributions together, and adding the classical energy we get</p>
<p>$$
E=\frac{r_{e}^{3}}{\ell^{2} G_{N}}+\frac{q}{24 \ell}-\frac{q \pi}{6} \int_{0}^{2} \frac{d \nu}{2} \frac{1}{(\ell \pi+d f(\nu))}
$$</p>
<p>The first term is the classical energy, the second term arises from the conformal anomaly in the throat region, and the final contribution is the integral over all the field lines of the Casimir energy.</p>
<p>We can get the value of $\ell$ by minimizing (5.44). Here it will also give the same answer as directly solving Einstein's equations, because the stress tensor is proportional to the $\ell$ derivative of the last two terms in (5.44), and, in equation (5.36), all that appears is the total integral of the stress tensor over the throat region, which ends up equated to the same $\ell$ derivative of the first term of (5.44) as it happened in (5.40) in section (5.3.2).</p>
<p>As a toy model, just to get oriented, it is convenient to replace the integral in (5.44) by $1 /(\pi \ell+d)$ which amounts to approximating the integrand as a constant given by its</p>
<p>largest term. Namely it amounts to saying that all fermions go from one mouth to the other by the shortest path, instead of following the field lines. In this case we can minimize the energy by imposing</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial \ell}=0, \quad \longrightarrow \quad 2 \frac{r_{e}^{3}}{G_{N} \ell^{3}}=\frac{q}{6}\left[-\frac{1}{4 \ell^{2}}+\frac{1}{(\ell+d / \pi)^{2}}\right]
$$</p>
<p>In the approximation that we neglect the left hand side we find that</p>
<p>$$
\pi \ell=d
$$</p>
<p>which is saying that the length through the wormhole is equal to the length through the ambient space. Notice that this result depends crucially on the relative coefficient of the flat space Casimir energy contribution (the last term in (5.45)) and the conformal anomaly contribution (first term on the right in (5.45)). For $d \gg q^{2} l_{p}$ we can safely neglect the left hand side relative to the right hand side of (5.45). If we included the left hand side of (5.45), we would get a bigger distance through the wormhole. We see that including the correct Casmir energy, as in (5.44), we are having distances along the field lines are all greater or equal to $d$, so that the value of $\ell$ that minimizes (5.44) will be such that the distance through the wormhole is larger than $d$. To study (5.44) it is convenient to rewrite it as</p>
<p>$$
E=\frac{\pi q}{6 d}\left[\frac{3}{8} \frac{d_{0}}{d y^{2}}+\frac{1}{4 y}-\int_{0}^{2} \frac{d \nu}{2} \frac{1}{(y+f(\nu))}\right], \quad y \equiv \frac{\pi \ell}{d}, \quad d_{0} \equiv \frac{16 \pi r_{e}^{3}}{q G_{N}} \propto q^{2} l_{p}
$$</p>
<p>where we defined $d_{0}$ to be the distance through the wormhole when $d \ll q^{2} l_{p}$, see (5.20),(5.31). We can now find the solution by minimizing over $y$, for a fixed value of $d$. This determines $\pi \ell$ for each $d$. We finally obtain the plot in figure (7). For $d / d_{0} \ll 1$ we have that $y$ is very large and we recover the approximation used in (5.31) where $\ell \gg d$ and $\pi \ell=d_{0}$. In the other extreme, for $d / d_{0} \gg 1$, we find that $\pi \ell$ grows linearly with $d$, with a coefficient which is greater than one, and numerically of order 2.35 . This ensures that in all cases $\pi \ell&gt;d$, which is saying that it takes longer to go through the wormhole than through the ambient space. In this regime the energy gap is of order $E_{g a p} \sim 1 / d$, which also the energy of a massless particle whose wavelength is the separation between the two black holes. In the large distance regime the energy at the minimum depends on $d$ as</p>
<p>$$
E_{\min } \propto-\frac{q}{d}, \quad \text { for } \quad q^{2} l_{p} \ll d
$$</p>
<p>This is larger than the gap by a factor of order $q$.
Since the Landau levels are localized on the sphere, and the various levels have different lengths, we have a Casimir energy that depends on the angle on the sphere. So we get a stress tensor which depends on the sphere coordinates. This will excite the Kaluza Klein modes, which were found in [29] ${ }^{6}$. Since Kaluza Klein modes are massive, this non-uniform</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>energy distribution is not expected to be a problem, we will simply slightly excite some of these Kaluza Klein modes. But we expect that the basic shape of the wormhole is still the same. The extra energy due to this excitation of the KK modes is of higher order in the $1 / q$ expansion compared to (5.44).
<img alt="img-6.jpeg" src="img-6.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7: (a) Linear plot of the relation between $\pi \ell$ and the distance $d$. For distances $d \ll d_{0}$ we see that $\pi \ell / d_{0}$ goes to one. In orange we see the line $\pi \ell=d$, which is the causality bound, anything above this line is consistent with causality. (b) The same plot in log-log form. For large $d$ we approach a linear relation $\pi \ell \propto d$, with a proportionality constant bigger than one. The orange curve is again the causality bound.</p>
<p>It is interesting to ask whether there is an upper limit on $d$ for the validity of the solution. We already mentioned that we expected that when $\ell \sim q^{3}$ quantum corrections would be important (5.43). That estimate was based on an analogy with the thermal case. Here we note the following, the circle on which the fermions live has a portion inside the wormhole throat and a portion outside, both proportional to $d$, up to a numerical factor. Though the total energy on the circle is fixed to be the Casimir energy, the energy within each portion could have quantum fluctuations. We can worry that the total energy inside the throat might have fluctuations that are larger than the left hand side in (5.45), which would invalidate our classical derivation in (5.36) (5.40). Estimating these fluctuations, after averaging them over a time also of order $d$, we find that they become larger than the left hand side of (5.45) unless</p>
<p>$$
d \ll q^{5 / 2}
$$</p>
<p>which is smaller than our previous estimate $q^{3}$ in (5.43). The solution might exist beyond $d&gt;q^{5 / 2}$, but it would require a more quantum mechanical treatment that we will not attempt in this paper. The energy gap for throat excitations continues to be given by (5.21). This is also true for energy of fluctuations of the $\ell$ mode around the minimum ${ }^{7}$.</p>
