                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the"System 1"way of quick reactions to the"System 2"style of reflection-and-correction problem solving. However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined. This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for fine-grained evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness. Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking, and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing performance on general mathematical tasks. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in math reasoning by up to 5.1% on GSM8K.</p>

<p>FINEREASON: Evaluating and Improving LLMs' Deliberate Reasoning through Reflective Puzzle Solving
1 Jun 2025F78F07DCA515E4815147E3EB43749714arXiv:2502.20238v2[cs.CL]
Many challenging reasoning tasks require not just rapid, intuitive responses, but a more deliberate, multi-step approach.Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) highlights an important shift from the "System 1" way of quick reactions to the "System 2" style of reflection-and-correction problem solving.However, current benchmarks heavily rely on the final-answer accuracy, leaving much of a model's intermediate reasoning steps unexamined.This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process.To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities.Each puzzle can be decomposed into atomic steps, making it ideal for rigorous validation of intermediate correctness.Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move.To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing general reasoning.We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in mathematical reasoning by up to 5.1%. 1 * Guizhen and Chaoqun are under the Joint PhD Program between Alibaba and NTU.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In cognitive science, human reasoning is typically characterized by two distinct systems: (i) System 1, which is fast, automatic, and effortless, and (ii) System 2, which is slow, analytical, and effortful (Kahneman, 2011).System 2 reasoning enables humans to proactively anticipate future outcomes, reassess intermediate states, and iteratively refine solutions (Yao et al., 2023), thereby allowing them to tackle more complex reasoning tasks.Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) can  Is this state solvable?</p>
<p>State Transition</p>
<p>Remove 1 at (3,4)  What's the next move?attain advantages akin to those of System 2 reasoning (OpenAI, 2024;Snell et al., 2025;DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025;Team, 2025).Instead of generating answers directly, these models can iteratively reflect and correct their reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023), achieving strong performance on reasoningintensive tasks like mathematics and coding (Qin et al., 2024;Li et al., 2024a;Muennighoff et al., 2025).Despite these improvements, the underlying mechanisms remain underexplored.Existing reasoning benchmarks primarily focus on the finalanswer accuracy (Hendrycks et al., 2021a;Cobbe et al., 2021;Chen et al., 2021;Hendrycks et al., 2021b), which offers limited insight into LLMs' internal reasoning processes, such as reflection and correction.For instance, models might reach a correct conclusion through flawed reasoning (Zelikman et al., 2022;Creswell et al., 2023;Lightman et al., 2024;Chia et al., 2024a).This diminishes the trustworthiness of model outputs, posing potential risks in practical usage.Moreover, models might achieve high accuracy by exploiting superficial patterns in the training data (Roelofs et al., 2019;Xu et al., 2023;Enström et al., 2024), making it difficult to ascertain whether the observed performance gain truly stems from deliberate reasoning.Therefore, there is a pressing need for more comprehensive reasoning benchmarks that assess the integrity of intermediate processes.</p>
<p>In this work, we present FINEREASON, a logicpuzzle benchmark for evaluating LLMs' deliberate reasoning capabilities, such as reflection, backtracking, and exploring alternative solutions.FINEREASON includes four types of puzzles: Sudoku, Graph Coloring, Game of 24, and Grid Puzzles, as shown in Figure 2. Solving a logic puzzle involves a series of discrete steps, and the explicit rules make it straightforward to validate the intermediate states.To structure our evaluation, we propose two key actions in each atomic step, state checking and state transition, as illustrated in Figure 1.State checking predicts whether the current state can lead to a solvable solution (Agarwal et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2024).It captures both retrospective evaluation of prior steps (Lightman et al., 2024) and prospective analysis of future steps.Meanwhile, state transition focuses on determining the next valid step, either moving forward or backtracking to the previous state.Together, these two tasks cover the entire puzzle-solving process, revealing the internal reasoning processes of reflection, correction, and exploration of alternative paths in LLMs.</p>
<p>Our evaluation reveals a significant 19.7% per-formance gap between OpenAI-o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking(Google, 2024), a difference not captured by other maths and coding benchmarks where high scores saturate.Generalpurpose models like GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024) struggle with deliberate reasoning in FINEREA-SON, making near-random guesses in state checking and poor performance in state transition.</p>
<p>To enhance reasoning, we develop a specialized training set on puzzle state checking and transition.Integrating our dataset with common reasoning data consistently improves performance on complex reasoning tasks.For example, when applied to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, our puzzle data boosts the accuracy from 82.3% to 87.4% on GSM8K, compared to models trained exclusively on math data.Our results suggest that skills such as backtracking and constraint validation generalize from puzzles to general reasoning, similar to how structured practice (e.g., chess) enhances human strategic thinking and problem solving.</p>
<p>Our main contributions are three-fold: 1) We introduce FINEREASON, a puzzle-based benchmark accompanied by systematic evaluations on state checking and transition, to provide a more precise evaluation of models' reasoning abilities, particularly in reflection and correction.2) Experimental results reveal substantial limitations in deliberate reasoning among general-purpose models, and even in the leading reasoning models.3) We show that training on structured puzzles transfers deliberate reasoning skills to general problem-solving.</p>
<p>FINEREASON</p>
<p>We present FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark that comprehensively assesses LLMs' reason-  ing through stepwise evaluation of state checking and transition.Inspired by the adage "think twice before acting," these actions capture how models assess the current situation (i.e., state checking) and plan the next move (i.e., state transition), skills crucial for deliberate reasoning.Formally, the reasoning process of a logic puzzle can be represented as p = {p 1 , p 2 , ..., p n }, where n denotes the number of atomic steps.Each step p i consists of a puzzle state s i and two actions: state checking a c i and state transition a t i , i.e., p i = (s i , a c i , a t i ).Applying these actions to s i produces the next state s i+1 .The puzzle-solving process begins at an initial state s 1 and proceeds through a sequence of atomic steps until reaching the solution state s n that satisfies all constraints.</p>
<p>In the following section, we first introduce a tree-based approach for step decomposition in our puzzles ( §2.1).Next, we describe the two key actions -state checking and state transition -that facilitate reasoning evaluation of models ( §2.2).</p>
<p>Tree-based Puzzle Decomposition</p>
<p>Puzzle solving can be represented as a tree, where nodes are intermediate states, and edges represent the execution of state checking and state transition, as illustrated in Figure 1.Edges are bidirectional, enabling both the exploration of child states and backtracking to the parent when encountering dead ends.This process begins at the root node s 1 and terminates at a solution leaf s n , potentially requiring multiple backtracks to explore different paths.</p>
<p>To capture all possible states, we perform a depth-first search (DFS) from the initial puzzle state s 1 until no further valid states remain for exploration.Each DFS step involves a minimal move to ensure that no valid state is overlooked.For example, in Sudoku, we add or remove only a single digit at each step.Table 1 summarizes the definition of a minimal move for each puzzle category.Additionally, we translate puzzle rules into executable code to automatically validate each state.</p>
<p>Sudoku.In Sudoku, the aim is to fill the empty cells such that each row, each column, and each of the 3 × 3 subgrids contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.A Sudoku state can be either a partially or fully filled 9 × 9 grid.The minimal move is defined as either adding a number for exploration or removing a number for backtracking.We use Sudoku questions from Kaggle2 to create the Sudoku trees.</p>
<p>Graph Coloring.The aim of graph coloring is to assign colors to each vertex in a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.Each puzzle specifies a maximum number of colors allowed in a graph.A graph coloring state is either a partially colored graph or a completely colored graph.A minimal move involves either assigning a color to a vertex or removing a color from a vertex.To create the questions, we generate random graphs and find their respective chromatic numbers using the backtracking algorithm (van Beek, 2006).</p>
<p>Game of 24.</p>
<p>In Game of 24, given four numbers, the task is to apply basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to reach exactly the value of 24.Each number must be used exactly once.Each state is a partial or complete arithmetic expression.The minimal move is to apply or unapply an operation to two of the remaining numbers.We use the problem set from Yao et al. (2023) to generate the trees.</p>
<p>Logic Grid Puzzles.Logic grid puzzles involve filling a grid with attributes from multiple categories (e.g., color, time) based on a set of textual clues.Each attribute must appear exactly once per category and satisfy all given clues.Each state is a partially or fully filled grid, with minimal moves being adding or removing attribute combinations specified in a clue.Our grid puzzle trees are constructed from Tyagi et al. (2024).Unlike other puzzles, translating textual clues into verification code is challenging, especially when it involves attribute comparisons.To address this, we define three functions: r(v) and c(v) to retrieve the row and column numbers of an attribute v, and T (i, j) to identify the attribute at row i and column j.These functions encode attributes to a structured axis space.Thus, the textual clues can be parsed into conditions involving r(v), c(v), and T (i, j) for constraint checks.For example, Clue 1 in Figure 2 can be parsed to T (r("Guy"), c("Time")) − T (r("back pain"), c("Time")) == 1.We use oneshot prompting with GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024) for clue translation, followed by manual verification.We ensure all solutions pass the coded clues.</p>
<p>Evaluation Tasks</p>
<p>We define two key actions, state checking and state transition, which enable movements between states.</p>
<p>State Checking.</p>
<p>State checking requires the model to assess if a given state s i can lead to a solvable solution s n .Based on our constructed puzzle trees, we label a state as solvable if at least one valid solution exists in the subtree of s i .To ensure a diverse difficulty range, we uniformly sample both solvable and unsolvable states across different tree depths.For each sampled state, we prompt models to evaluate its solvability with puzzle rules, prior visited states, and the current state (see Appendix A.2).In general, state checking evaluates two key aspects: 1) It tests if models can reflect on prior steps to avoid rule violations (e.g., preventing duplicate "1"s in a Sudoku row).2) It requires models to anticipate potential dead ends by looking ahead.The second aspect, however, requires a higher level of reasoning to proactively detect unsolvable states.</p>
<p>State Transition.State transition involves making the minimal move defined in §2.1, which requires models to determine the next valid state.Based on the state-checking results, models should proceed if the state is solvable and backtrack otherwise.Specifically, at a solvable state, a correct transition would be an unvisited child of the given state.At an unsolvable state, the correct move is to backtrack to its parent state.To isolate the impact of state transition from incorrect state checking, our evaluation provides ground-truth state-checking labels.We sample states from the puzzle tree and construct prompts with puzzle rules, prior visited states, the current state, and some unsolvable child states (see Appendix A.2).The inclusion of unsolvable child states is to assess whether models can effectively bypass these bad states.Models.We select the best-performing open and closed-source models, including 1) reasoningoriented models: o1 (OpenAI, 2024), Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking(Gemini-FT, Google (2024)), and 2) general-purpose models that perform straightforward execution: GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024), GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022), Gemini-2.0-Flash(Gemini-F, Google (2024)), and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct(Qwen2.5-Inst, Qwen et al. (2025)).</p>
<p>Evaluation Results</p>
<p>In this section, we first present a preliminary evaluation of LLMs on end-to-end puzzle solving ( §4.1), which reveals inconsistencies in model performance.To gain deeper insights beyond their end-to-end performance, we present our main results focusing on state checking and transition tasks ( §4.2), followed by analyses on models' behaviors, error patterns, and performance across different difficulty levels ( §4.3 to §4.6).</p>
<p>Preliminary: End-to-End Puzzle Solving</p>
<p>Table 2 presents an initial evaluation of LLMs on end-to-end puzzle-solving tasks.Despite their strong performance on coding and math tasks (Qwen et al., 2025), these models are notably weak in end-to-end puzzle solving.Additionally, there are some counter-intuitive observations: Gemini-F outperforms Gemini-FT on Sudoku and Game of 24, yet struggles on the other two puzzles.These inconsistencies suggest that end-to-end puzzle solving alone may not be a reliable metric for assessing LLMs' reasoning, emphasizing the need for more granular evaluation methods.</p>
<p>Main results</p>
<p>To understand models' reasoning capabilities in greater depth, we evaluate on state checking and transition.Results in Table 3 reveal noticeable performance gaps between reasoning-oriented and general-purpose models.On the state-checking task, reasoning-oriented models (o1 and Gemini-FT) consistently lead the performance in every puzzle category.In contrast, general-purpose models barely match the random baseline in puzzles like Sudoku and Grid Puzzles.A similar trend is observed on the state-transition task.These findings further support the view that inference-time scaling can substantially boost reasoning capabilities (Snell et al., 2025;Muennighoff et al., 2025).</p>
<p>Between the reasoning models, Gemini-FT generally performs on par with o1 in state checking but consistently lags behind in state transition.This reveals weaknesses in Gemini-FT's reasoning process, particularly in error revision.These findings align well with our practical experience using these models, which provides empirical evidence that FINEREASON offers a more accurate reflection of LLMs' reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Model Behaviors in State Checking</p>
<p>State checking requires looking ahead to identify unsolvable states.To analyze models' behaviors, we report the state-checking precision, recall, and F1 scores in Table 4, designating unsolvable states as positive cases.Recall measures the model's ability to detect dead ends, while precision indicates the reliability of its unsolvable state predictions.</p>
<p>We find that reasoning models generally detect unsolvable states well, as indicated by the high F1 scores.As for general models (GPT-4o, Gemini-F, Qwen2.5-Inst), the recall is generally low in Sudoku but not in Game of 24, possibly due to Sudoku's deeper puzzle tree making unsolvable state detection harder.A similar trend is also observed in other puzzles that have deeper solutions, including graph coloring and grid puzzles (see Appendix A.3).These observations reveal that general LLMs tend to make overly optimistic decisions (i.e., assuming a solvable state) when faced with tasks that exceed their actual capabilities.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Instshow high precision, which suggests that these models are conservative and might not attempt to classify states as unsolvable unless they are very confident.</p>
<p>Quality Analysis of State Checking</p>
<p>To examine the errors made in state checking, we conduct a human analysis of the mistakes from the best-performing model, o1, in Figure 3.The most common error is the Misinterpretation of Premises, where o1 incorrectly uses available information to reach a faulty conclusion.For instance, in a grid puzzle, given the clue "The chocolate piece, Joey's cake, and the $125 cake are three different cakes," the model still mistakenly assigned Joey's cake to the $125 cake.Additionally, the model might fail to explore alternative paths, leading to an incorrect assessment of current states.Other mistakes include drawing a wrong conclusion despite correct deductions (Inconsistent Reasoning), failure to recognize conflicting information (Conflicts Resolving Failure), nonexistent constraints (False Premise), and a few instruction-following errors.Examples of the errors are shown in Appendix A.4.</p>
<p>Model Behaviors in State Transition</p>
<p>To understand models' behaviors during state transition, we break down the performance by class and count the common mistakes made by models.The left chart of Figure 4 shows the Sudoku state-transition performance breakdown for each class (solvable vs. unsolvable).We observe that most models transit much better on solvable states than on unsolvable ones.The large gap indicates that models are better at proceeding forward from a valid state than backtracking.This might be attributed to a forward-generation reasoning style of LLMs.This trend, however, does not apply to GPT-3.5, which shows significantly weak performance and tends to rely primarily on random guessing.</p>
<p>The right chart of Figure 4 shows the errors typically made by models during state transition.At solvable states, common errors include making multiple moves (Multiple Moves), violating Sudoku rules (Invalid Move), and transitioning to an unsolvable child state (Unsolvable Child).At unsolvable states, two primary errors are: failing to return to the parent state (Backtracking Failure) and making an additional move to a sibling state after backtracking (Sibling).Examples of the errors are shown in Appendix A.5.Among these errors, Backtracking Failure is the most frequent across all models.Models sometimes jump back more than one level (e.g., to a grandparent state) or to a wrong state, indicating that LLMs struggle with step-bystep backtracking.For reasoning models (o1 and Gemini-FT), transitioning to siblings is the second most frequent error.This error is due to violating the minimal move principle (Table 1), highlighting weaknesses in their instruction-following capability.For general models, they frequently commit an invalid move.This shows that general models often fail to adequately check Sudoku rules.</p>
<p>Performance by Difficulty Level</p>
<p>To understand the state-checking performance across difficulty levels, we plot the density diagrams of correct vs. incorrect predictions by the number of unfilled cells in Sudoku states (Figure 5).We find that Sudoku states with fewer empty cells are more likely to be predicted correctly.As the number of unfilled cells increases, the problem becomes more complex and requires more exploration, and the proportion of incorrect predictions increases.This likely reflects the increased computational complexity of looking ahead and determining solvability when many possibilities exist.</p>
<p>Training on puzzle data</p>
<p>As highlighted in §4, most models struggle with identifying dead ends and backtracking.These observations reveal critical bottlenecks in models' reflection and correction abilities, which are essen-  tial for reasoning.We hypothesize that training on state-checking and state-transition tasks can provide synthetic reflection, allow models to practice error correction, and ultimately transfer these reasoning skills to mathematical problem solving.</p>
<p>To validate our hypothesis, we construct a training set consisting of state-checking and statetransition data from Sudoku, Graph Coloring, and Game of 24.We train models on a mixture of puzzle data and math data to test whether reasoning skills transfer beyond puzzles themselves, ultimately improving performance on math tasks.</p>
<p>Experimental setup</p>
<p>We prepare 10, 000 puzzle samples and another 15, 000 samples from MetaMathQA (Yu et al., 2024), a popular training set for mathematical reasoning.The puzzle states are easily verified, making it suitable for Reinforcement Learning.Specifically, we train GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).Table 5: Training with our puzzle data improves math reasoning on GSM8K and MATH.</p>
<p>Other training details are reported in Appendix A.6.Due to limited computing resources, we restrict the maximum completion length to 1024 in both training and evaluation.</p>
<p>Improvements on mathematical reasoning</p>
<p>We start with 2, 000 training samples, with a 1 : 1 distribution between puzzle and math data.We compare with two baselines: the first is the base model, and the second is training with entirely math samples.The results in Table 5 show that combining puzzle data with math data yields the highest accuracy on both GSM8K and MATH for both models, outperforming training on math data alone.This consistent performance improvement suggests that the state-checking and state-transition logic of puzzle solving generalizes to mathematical problems, aligning well with our initial hypothesis.</p>
<p>To further assess the impact of the mixed training, we analyze the number of correctly solved samples at each difficulty level in the MATH dataset, where a higher level means higher difficulty.Results in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Effect of the puzzle ratio</p>
<p>To study the optimal ratio between puzzle-based and math-based data, we vary the proportion of math samples, r m , from 0.4 to 1.0 in a combined training set of 10k samples.In Figure 6, the performance on GSM8K steadily improves as the math ratio increases, peaking at a ratio of 0.8.Beyond this point, increasing the math ratio further results in lower accuracy.This suggests that neither pure math training nor pure puzzle training is optimal.Instead, a balanced combination of puzzle-based and math data provides the best performance.This indicates that our puzzle-based data, though simple, can complement the reasoning in standard math problems.</p>
<p>In addition, our previous analysis shows that models struggle significantly more with unsolvable states than solvable states in both state checking ( §4.3) and state transition ( §4.5).Our error analysis also shows that "backtracking failure" is a major error ( §4.4), even for top reasoning mod- els like o1.This means we could prioritize the learning for backtracking from these unsolvable cases to maximize learning benefits.To validate this, we examine the effect of varying the ratio of unsolvable data, r u , in mixed training.In Table 6, it is evident that increasing the proportion of unsolvable data boosts the performance on GSM8K, suggesting that focusing on these unsolvable cases enhances the model's ability to detect dead ends and revise strategies-skills transferable to math problem-solving.</p>
<p>Analysis on the scaling effect</p>
<p>We examine the scaling effect of using math-only and mixed data for training.We use the optimal math ratio (r m = 0.8) in the mixed data.The results in Figure 7 show that, as we increase the number of training samples, both approaches benefit from scaling up.Noticeably, the mixed approach consistently outperforms math-only training starting from 5k samples.While math-only training shows diminishing returns or even a slight decline beyond 7.5k samples, the mixed approach continues to improve, reaching an accuracy peak of 81.3% with around 12.5k samples.This scaling effect suggests the great potential of our simple puzzle data for enhancing the overall reasoning capability of LLMs.</p>
<p>Improvements on general reasoning</p>
<p>To investigate if our puzzle data benefits general reasoning tasks beyond math, we conduct additional experiments on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), a dataset covering 57 tasks including STEM, humanities, social sciences, and others.Using the same optimal ratio (r m = 0.8) as in math training, we observe consistent performance improvements over MMLU-only training (Table 7).</p>
<p>Next, we analyze the performance improvement across different subsets in MMLU.Results in Ap-</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs.Advancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models is a critical goal in natural language processing (Wos et al., 1992;Yang et al., 2018).In recent years, LLMs, combined with prompting techniques such as Chain of Thought (Wei et al., 2022), Tree of Thought (Yao et al., 2023), and Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023), have shown remarkable performance in various reasoning tasks (Cobbe et al., 2021;Srivastava et al., 2023).Current evaluation methods focus mainly on the final accuracy in reasoning-intensive domains, including mathematics (Cobbe et al., 2021;Hendrycks et al., 2021b;Chen et al., 2023;Rein et al., 2024;Ma et al., 2024), science (Mihaylov et al., 2018;Xu et al., 2021a,b;Huang et al., 2025Huang et al., , 2024)), coding (Chen et al., 2021;Austin et al., 2021), commonsense (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), and logical reasoning (Yao et al., 2023;Long, 2023).However, as inference-time scaling gains importance (Snell et al., 2025;DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) and models become more capable of reasoning, it is crucial to assess how effectively models perform reflection and correction during reasoning.While Tyagi et al. ( 2024) manually analyzes the reasoning chains in logic puzzles, their approach lacks scalability.Some studies (Singh et al., 2024;Zeng et al., 2024;Xu et al., 2024) evaluate how models handle reasoning mistakes, but these investigations often rely on rule-based mistakes that may be easily resolved by current LLMs.Moreover, these studies only assess reflection on past steps in a static manner.In our work, we address these limitations by introducing two novel tasks designed to more accurately reflect models' capabilities in dynamic reasoning and error correction.</p>
<p>Puzzle Solving Tasks.Logic puzzles, which require deducing solutions from a set of rules (Giadikiaroglou et al., 2024), are ideal for evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs, as they rely minimally on prior knowledge (Li et al., 2024b).Recent studies have explored LLMs on various puzzles with different emphases (Mittal et al., 2024), such as Sudoku (Ishay et al., 2023;Long, 2023) for strategic thinking, Game of 24 (Ding et al., 2024;Yao et al., 2023) for arithmetic calculations.Some investigate grid puzzles (Dziri et al., 2023;Tyagi et al., 2024), crosswords (Yao et al., 2023), chess puzzles (Feng et al., 2023), mazes (Noever and Burdick, 2021), Minesweeper (Li et al., 2024b), and abstract pattern recognition (Chia et al., 2024b).However, the evaluation remains mainly focused on the final accuracy.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this work, we introduce FINEREASON, a novel logic-puzzle benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.Unlike existing benchmarks that focus mainly on final-answer accuracy, FINEREASON delves into intermediate reasoning steps, specifically emphasizing state checking and transition actions.This fine-grained evaluation captures the model's ability to reflect, look ahead, and backtrack, which are vital aspects of human-like System 2 reasoning.Our experiments reveal significant gaps between reasoning-oriented and general-purpose LLMs, emphasizing the need to consider reflection and correction for robust reasoning evaluation.Furthermore, using puzzle-based data for training can enhance performance in general reasoning tasks, highlighting the scalability of this approach and its potential to transfer reasoning skills beyond puzzles to broader reasoning.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations.First, we represent puzzle states using textual tables.Our evaluation shows that models can reasonably understand this table format.However, there is potential to explore alternative representation formats, such as coordinates or images.The image format could be particularly valuable for facilitating the evaluation of multi-modal reasoning, offering a promising direction for future extensions of our work.Second, we employ zero-shot CoT prompting (Kojima et al., 2022) to focus on evaluating the inherent reasoning capabilities of LLMs, foregoing more advanced prompting techniques that could potentially improve performance but might obscure the models' true reasoning abilities.Finally, our current evaluation prioritizes reasoning correctness over efficiency, treating all solvable states equally regardless of the steps required to reach the solution.Future research could incorporate metrics like "steps to solution" to assess efficiency.</p>
<p>A.2 Prompt Templates</p>
<p>In Table 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, we show the state checking and state transition prompts for each puzzle.</p>
<p>A.3 Additional results on state checking precision, recall and F1 scores</p>
<p>Table 9 reports the state-checking precision, recall, and F1 scores of models across four tasks.It is observed that o1 consistently outperforms all other models in detecting unsolvable states, as evidenced by the high recall and precision acorss tasks.Models like GPT-4o, Qwen2.5-Inst and Gemini-F are generally more precise when they predict unsolvability, but are limited by low recall in tasks like Sudoku and Grid Puzzles.GPT-3.5 generally struggles with both recall and precision, especially in more complex tasks like Sudoku.</p>
<p>A.4 Error types in state checking</p>
<p>Through human analysis, we categorise five common types of errors o1 made in state checking.We show one example for each type of error: Misinterpretation of Premises (Table 18), Exploration and Backtracking Issues (Table 19), Inconsistent Reasoning (Table 20), Conflicts Resolving Failure (Table 21), and False Premise (Table 22).</p>
<p>A.5 Error types in state transition</p>
<p>We automatically classify the state transition mistakes based on the next move.We show one example for each type of error models made in the  state transition: Multiple Moves (Table 23), Invalid Move (Table 24), Unsolvable Child (Table 25), Backtracking Failure (Table 26), Sibling (Table 27).</p>
<p>A.6 Training Details</p>
<p>We train our models using GRPO based on OpenR13 .We use one GPU to run vLLM for faster generation and the remaining GPUs for training.</p>
<p>The hyperparameters and training details are reported in Table 10.In the first example, model 1 applied the formula directly without cross-checking its consistency with the given example of the third row.After training, model 2 verified the calculation against the provided example before reaching the answer.</p>
<p>In the second example, model 2 initially included an incorrect letter "C" but it caught this mistake and removed "C" before proceeding.However, model 1 skipped this step.</p>
<p>These examples suggest that puzzle training helps reinforce skills like constraint validation and error correction, which generalize to math reasoning.</p>
<p>A.9 Benefits of mixed-training across different reasoning tasks</p>
<p>In Table 12, we analyze the performance improvement across different subsets in MMLU.We organize the tasks into four categories following Hendrycks et al. (2021a).The most significant improvement is in STEM tasks, where accuracy increases by 10%.The STEM subset consists of multi-step reasoning problems that require reflection and correction in the reasoning process.We also observe some benefits (+3.8%) to the social sciences subset, as some subjects (eg, Econometrics) require multi-step reasoning.The humanities subset and other tasks, which are typically straightforward questions requiring fewer reasoning steps, show smaller improvements.</p>
<p>Sudoku State Checking</p>
<p>You are given a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku grid represented as a list of lists, where empty cells are represented as 0.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine if this current state can lead to a solvable solution.Specifically, use lookahead techniques to determine if it's possible to fill the remaining cells according to standard Sudoku rules, ensuring that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains unique numbers from 1 to 9.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are provided with a previously explored next state that has been proven to be unsolvable.Use this information to avoid revisiting this failed path and leverage it to make a more informed decision about the current state.</p>
<p>Current state:</p>
<p>[ [4,1,6,9,7,2,8,3,5], [7,2,3,1,8,5,6,9,4], [5,9,8,3,4,6,2,1,7], [6,3,5,4,1,9,7,2,8], [1,8,9,2,6,7,4,5,3], [2,4,7,5,3,8,1,6,9], [8,7,2,6,9,3,5,4,1], [3,6,0,0,5,0,0,7,2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0]] Explored next state that leads to an unsolvable path:</p>
<p>[ [4,1,6,9,7,2,8,3,5], [7,2,3,1,8,5,6,9,4], [5,9,8,3,4,6,2,1,7], [6,3,5,4,1,9,7,2,8], [1,8,9,2,6,7,4,5,3], [2,4,7,5,3,8,1,6,9], [8,7,2,6,9,3,5,4,1], [3,6,1,0,5,0,0,7,2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 8, 0]] Let's think step by step, considering the failed state to avoid unnecessary exploration.Do not solve using programming.</p>
<p>Choose from (A) Solvable (B) Unsolvable.End your answer with "Answer: (A)" or "Answer: (B)".</p>
<p>Sudoku State Transition</p>
<p>You are given an initial Sudoku puzzle S(0), followed by a sequence of progressive states leading to the current state S(i).Alongside each state, its solvability status L(*) is given.Your task is to determine the next state by making exactly one move, ensuring progress toward a valid solution.A valid Sudoku solution requires that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition.Additionally, you are provided with a previously explored next state that has been proven to be unsolvable.Use this information to avoid revisiting this failed path.</p>
<p>A move is defined as either:</p>
<ol>

<p>Graph Coloring State Checking</p>
<p>You are given a graph represented as an adjacency list, where each index corresponds to a vertex, and the list at that index represents its adjacent vertices.You are also given the current coloring state of the graph in a list, where each index represents the corresponding vertex, and the number at that index represents its color (0 indicates an uncolored vertex).</p>
<p>Your task is to determine if this current state can lead to a valid coloring.Specifically, use lookahead techniques to determine if it's possible to color the remaining vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using no more than 8 colors in total.</p>
<p>Additionally, you are provided with a previously explored next state that has been proven to be uncolorable.Use this information to avoid revisiting this failed path and leverage it to make a more informed decision about the current state.</p>

<p>To determine the sum of the elements in the tenth row of Pascal's Triangle, we use the property that the sum of the elements in the nth row is 2 n .Since the top row is counted as the 0th row, the tenth row corresponds to the 9th row.Calculating 2 9 , we get 512.</p>
<p>To determine the sum of the elements in the tenth row of Pascal's Triangle, we use the property that the sum of the elements in the nth row is 2 n .Given that the third row has a sum of 8, we can verify this by calculating 2 3 = 8, which matches the given information.Therefore, the sum of the elements in the tenth row is 2 10 = 1024.</p>
<p>Determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word TEPEE.</p>
<p>Step 1: Identify the letters and their frequencies.</p>
<p>The word TEPEE consists of the following letters:</p>
<p>-T: 1 occurrence -E: 2 occurrences -P: 2 occurrences.</p>
<p>Step 2: Apply the formula for permutations of a multiset.The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is: Number of permutations = n! n1!×n2!×•••×n k !where: n is the total number of letters, n1, n2, . . ., nk are the frequencies of the repeated letters.Step 3: Plug in the values.For the word TEPEE: n = 5 (since there are 5 letters).n1 = 1 (for T). n2 = 2 (for E). n3 = 2 (for P).Number of permutations = Table 28: Two examples of how the 1.5B model shows more evidence of verification and self-correction in its thought process after mixed training.Red denotes where the error starts to occur.Green denotes signs of verification or self-correction.</p>

2: A preliminary study on end-to-end puzzle-solving performance of LLMs.3 Experimental SetupDatasets. We sample 500 intermediate states perpuzzle category, resulting in 2000 test instancesfor each task: state checking and state transition.Dataset statistics are included in Appendix A.1.Implementation. We use zero-shot chain ofthought prompting (Kojima et al., 2022) for evalua-tion. To ensure a genuine evaluation of LLM's in-herent reasoning capabilities, we explicitly include"Do not solve using programming" in the in-struction, restricting models from relying on mem-orized code snippets from their training data. In ouractual attempts, without explicitly stating this con-straint, models tend to generate Sudoku solvers orgraph-coloring algorithms instead of demonstratingdeliberate reasoning. Prompt templates are shownin Appendix A.2.</p>

Training with our puzzle data improves general reasoning tasks on MMLU.pendixA.9 show that mixed training significantly improves performance on complex, multi-step reasoning tasks that might require more reflection (STEM +10%, Social Sciences +3.8%), but shows less benefit for simpler, more direct question types.Overall, our puzzle data bridges the gap of the lack of annotated intermediate training data for general reasoning tasks by providing synthetic, structured scenarios for learning reasoning skills.While real-world reasoning is less deterministic, our results indicate that mastering deterministic steps in puzzle solving builds foundational skills like reflection and correction, which demonstrably transfer to general reasoning tasks.
