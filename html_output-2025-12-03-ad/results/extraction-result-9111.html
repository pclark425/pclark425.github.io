                <p><strong>Paper Venue:</strong> International Journal of Innovative Science and Research Technology</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical model for a warp bubble that enables faster-than-light travel using positive energy densities, an advancement over traditional models that rely on exotic negative energies. Building on the framework proposed by Eric Lentz, we introduce a non-uniform energy distribution model to enhance control and efficiency in warp field generation. The research validates the stability and feasibility of a warp bubble sustained by positive energy through detailed numerical simulations and analysis. Key findings include the discovery of anisotropic behavior in the warp bubble's structure, which allows for directional tuning of the warp field, thereby optimizing space- time manipulation and reducing energy demands. These results represent a significant step forward in the theoretical foundations of warp drive technology and its potential practical applications.</p>

                                      <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Abstract : </strong>
                                                This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical
model for a warp bubble that enables faster-than-light
travel using positive energy densities, an advancement
over traditional models that rely on exotic negative
energies. Building on the framework proposed by Eric
Lentz, we introduce a non-uniform energy distribution
model to enhance control and efficiency in warp field
generation. The research validates the stability and
feasibility of a warp bubble sustained by positive energy
through detailed numerical simulations and analysis. Key
findings include the discovery of anisotropic behavior in
the warp bubble's structure, which allows for directional
tuning of the warp field, thereby optimizing space- time
manipulation and reducing energy demands. These results
represent a significant step forward in the theoretical
foundations of warp drive technology and its potential
practical applications.                                            </p>
