                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Generative language models are increasingly being subjected to psychometric questionnaires intended for human testing, in efforts to establish their traits, as benchmarks for alignment, or to simulate participants in social science experiments. While this growing body of work sheds light on the likeness of model responses to those of humans, concerns are warranted regarding the rigour and reproducibility with which these experiments may be conducted. Instabilities in model outputs, sensitivity to prompt design, parameter settings, and a large number of available model versions increase documentation requirements. Consequently, generalization of findings is often complex and reproducibility is far from guaranteed. In this paper, we present R.U.Psycho, a framework for designing and running robust and reproducible psychometric experiments on generative language models that requires limited coding expertise. We demonstrate the capability of our framework on a variety of psychometric questionnaires, which lend support to prior findings in the literature. R.U.Psycho is available as a Python package at https://github.com/julianschelb/rupsycho.</p>

<p>R.U.Psycho? Robust Unified Psychometric Testing of Language Models
13 Mar 2025DFEC848F091AF171EEFFD2FE3AAA2168arXiv:2503.10229v1[cs.CL]
Generative language models are increasingly being subjected to psychometric questionnaires intended for human testing, in efforts to establish their traits, as benchmarks for alignment, or to simulate participants in social science experiments.While this growing body of work sheds light on the likeness of model responses to those of humans, concerns are warranted regarding the rigour and reproducibility with which these experiments may be conducted.Instabilities in model outputs, sensitivity to prompt design, parameter settings, and a large number of available model versions increase documentation requirements.Consequently, generalization of findings is often complex and reproducibility is far from guaranteed.In this paper, we present R.U.Psycho, a framework for designing and running robust and reproducible psychometric experiments on generative language models that requires limited coding expertise.We demonstrate the capability of our framework on a variety of psychometric questionnaires, which lend support to prior findings in the literature.R.U.Psycho is available as a Python package at https://github.com/julianschelb/rupsycho.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The proliferation of generative large language models (LLMs) and their ease of use has recently created an interest in their experimental application in domains that are traditionally focused on human experimentation, including sociology (Ziems et al., 2024) and psychology (Pellert et al., 2024).</p>
<p>On the one hand, this interest stems from the desire to measure the performance and behavior of language models from a psychological perspective to assess the traits of LLMs as one would for a human, a direction that has been termed machine psychology (Hagendorff et al., 2024).Examples of such research are varied and range from vignettebased tasks (Binz and Schulz, 2023), over game-theoretic testing of LLMs (Duan et al., 2024), to analyses of their decision-making (Horton, 2023).</p>
<p>On the other hand, some researchers in computational social science view LLMs as potential proxies for human (sub)populations in social science research and human experimentation (Aher et al., 2023;Argyle et al., 2023;Dillion et al., 2023), often referred to as persona simulation.The arguments for such applications range from the reduction in cost that usage of a language model may offer, to an increase in experimental scale.</p>
<p>Finally, given the increasing ubiquity of LLMs that is beginning to contaminate the research artifacts created by crowdworker-participants with LLM-generated content (Veselovsky et al., 2023) and the difficulty one faces in detecting such contamination (Sadasivan et al., 2023;Jakesch et al., 2023), one might argue that establishing a baseline of LLM traits is simply a necessity for conducting online research in the age of generative models.</p>
<p>However, while it has its proponents, psychometric testing of LLMs is also the subject of intense criticism, as LLMs are prone to failing theory of mind tasks under even minor prompt variations (Ullman, 2023) and are subject to inherent (intersectional) biases that are poorly understood and difficult to quantify (Husse and Spitz, 2022), yet have been shown to directly affect reasoning tasks during persona simulation (Gupta et al., 2024).In addition to model-related challenges, experimental issues are abound, ranging from prompt (ordering) sensitivity (White et al., 2023;Lu et al., 2022), over non-trivial processing steps required for interpreting and mapping model responses (Wang et al., 2024), to performance variations between model families and model sizes (Ziems et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, while highlighting an important research direction, much of the early work into machine psychology has been haphazard and is fundamentally not robust or reproducible outside the exact (and often ill-documented) modeling choices and parameter settings of a given study.For a detailed overview and breakdown, we direct the reader to Löhn et al. (2024).Consequently, psychometric testing of LLMs is running the risk of mirroring the reproducibility crisis in psychology.</p>
<p>In this paper, we therefore take a step back from individual psychometric tests and a step towards addressing these concerns by introducing R.U.Psycho, a framework for prompt-based psychometric experimentation on generative LLMs.Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present a framework for robust and configurable psychometric testing of any open-or closed-weight LLM using any questionnaire.(ii) We focus on the reproducibility of experiments through versatile, well-documented experiment configuration files.(iii) We include support for customizable prompt templates, which we illustrate at the example of simulating personas.(iv) We present results for 4 psychometric test and one thought experiment to demonstrate the framework's usability and to expand the experimental data in the literature.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Related work can be divided into four areas, for which we provide an overview of contributions.Persona-simulation for social science encompasses investigations whether LLMs can be used as replacement for human participants, typically through the simulation of personas.Dillion et al. (2023) argue for and identify potentially beneficial applications of such an approach.Aher et al. (2023) test GPT models for generating human-like samples.In a similar approach, Argyle et al. (2023) use GPT-3 to assess political beliefs and voting behavior through persona simulation.Psychometric testing of LLMs typically encompasses tasks that can be viewed as logic-or reasoning-based probing (Manigrasso et al., 2024).Studies in this direction include tasks from cognitive psychology applied to GPT-3 as a prototypical LLM (Binz and Schulz, 2023), the personality assessment of GPT-3 (Miotto et al., 2022), and an assessment of encoder-based models for psychological traits (Pellert et al., 2024).More broadly, (Huang et al., 2024) investigate the general reliability of psychometric scales intended for use on humans on LLMs, which they find generally suitable for the large models used in their experiments.Criticism and calls for caution.A growing body of work raises concerns regarding the indiscrim-inate application of psychometric tests on LLMs and cautions with regard to their reliability (Shu et al., 2024), inconsistency and deviations from human behavior (Dorner et al., 2023), poor temporal stability in the responses (Bodroža et al., 2024), and the observation that LLMs tend to simulate latent traits of personas that are not readily apparent (Petrov et al., 2024).Overall, these works raise the question when generative AI can or should reasonably be used in the social sciences (Bail, 2024).Towards rigorous benchmarking.Finally, two recent additions are worth highlighting.Löhn et al. (2024) provide a well-researched criticism of the lack of standardization and methodological variances in approaches to recent machine psychology research, based on a literature review.Ren et al. (2024), with a similar but orthogonal approach to the one we take here, provide a benchmark for the evaluation of values in generative LLMs that is comprised of a multitude of psychometric tests.</p>
<p>In contrast to most of the above works, we do not investigate specific LLMs or specific questionnaires and do not establish guidelines for such experimentation, but provide a framework within which such experiments can be conducted.</p>
<p>Pipeline Overview</p>
<p>With the focus on robustness, flexibility, usability, and reproducibility, we center our design around a configuration file defining an experiment.This ensures reproducibility and documentation of experimental settings, including prompt design, model selection, model hyperparameters, and questionnaire configurations.The framework operates as a pipeline with four stages: (1) experiment definition, (2) LLM response generation, (3) post-processing, and (4) export of results (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>For ease of use, maintenance, and extensibility, R.U.Psycho is based on the LangChain framework and designed for compatibility with its ecosystem, ensuring the integration of future releases of openweight models and closed-source APIs .</p>
<p>Experiment Definition</p>
<p>The core interaction with our framework is the definition of an experiment configuration file, coded in JSON, which ensures a low bar for interaction with R.U.Psycho and maintains reproducibility.Importing a configuration file creates an experiment object that serves as the main interface for programmatic modification and running of experiments.The four configuration parameters are: Models.Specifies a list of generative (chat) models used to generate responses by simulating human subjects who answer the questionnaire.We support multiple ways to integrate models, including OpenAI-compatible APIs, local Huggingface models, and the Huggingface Inference API.Prompt Template.Used to instruct the model to respond to questions by selecting from the answer options defined in the questionnaire.It combines questionnaire-specific instructions with LLM optimized instructions together with the persona (see Section 4.2).Since psychometric questionnaires typically provide participants with predefined answer options, we adapt insights on multiple-choice answering tasks from the literature to our prompts (Röttger et al., 2024;Miotto et al., 2022).Personas.Describes the characteristics of the simulated human subjects on whose behalf the model responds.These are filled into predefined placeholders in the prompt template.Questionnaire.Structured representation of a psychometric survey, defining questionnaire-specific instructions (e.g., explanations of technical terms), a series of questions, and their corresponding answer options (e.g., as defined by a labeled Likert scale).Possible answer options can be specified per question or globally for the entire questionnaire.</p>
<p>Response Generation</p>
<p>Models</p>
<p>Furthermore, minor reproducibility parameters can be defined in the configuration file as well.</p>
<p>Response Generation</p>
<p>Once an experiment is defined, the responses are generated by iterating over the questions.All specified models are prompted with multiple choice questions and are instructed to select from the predefined set of answer options.The framework generates multiple responses per question for each model, random seed, and persona as defined in the experiment configuration file.Given the issues that have been identified in measurements based on token-probabilites (Wang et al., 2024), we use free generation of text.Responses can be stored in memory as a Pandas DataFrame or saved line-byline via callbacks in CSV or JSONL files.</p>
<p>Postprocessing</p>
<p>Postprocessing prepares the LLM responses for analysis by cleaning, validating, and mapping them to answer options.The pipeline combines cleaners, validators, and judges to interpret responses and to filter invalid or inconclusive responses.Cleaners.Cleaners are used to remove noise from the text, such as line breaks, non-ASCII characters, and other irrelevant information.Cleaners also parse JSON outputs if required.Validators.After cleaning, the responses are validated for relevance to the original prompts.Validators identify responses with specific undesired artifacts, such as apologies, refusals, or concerns raised by the LLM.Building on existing research, we implement two validators: a rule-based validator using templates from Röttger et al. (2024), and an LLM-based validator that is a fine-tuned Distil-RoBERTa model (ProtectAI.com, 2024).Judges.Finally, judges map the models' noisy responses to the most likely intended answer option from the questionnaire.Since generated responses often do not exactly match the label of the intended answer option or include additional details, judges normalize the outputs for further analysis.Ambiguous or non-relevant responses are marked as inconclusive and can be filtered out.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>In the final stage, the processed data can be exported as DataFrame, JSONL file, or CSV files, ready to integrate with any desirable data analysis or visualization tool to investigate the responses.</p>
<p>Experimental Component Design</p>
<p>To finalize the design of our framework, we conduct a series of small-scale comparative experiments to identify optimal pipeline components.</p>
<p>Judges: Rule-based vs. Model-based</p>
<p>Since chat-tuned LLMs are designed to mimic human conversation, they tend to incorporate unnecessary explanations, disclaimers, or emphatic expressions in verbose responses (e.g., "Sure, let me do this...").Our framework therefore requires a reliable method to map potentially noisy LLM response to the discrete answer options of the questionnaires.We explore two methods for interpreting the responses generated by the models: a rulebased method and a model-based method.Rule-based judge.We employ a strategy based on token-overlap to identify the answer option with the greatest lexical similarity to the model-generated response.First, each answer option is tokenized into two components: a numerical component and a label component (e.g., "5." and "always").We then count the occurrences of each component in the response.The answer option with the highest total overlap score is designated as the optimal choice.In the case of a tie, the result is marked as inconclusive, while responses with no detected overlap are labeled as not present.Model-based judge.To better handle complex responses with negations or synonyms (e.g., "My answer is neither Option 1 nor 4. My answer is Item 5."), we fine-tune an encoder-transformer model to predict a probability distribution over the possible answer choices from which we select the most likely response.Specifically, we model the task as a binary 1-vs-all classification for a single encodertransformer model, which has to decide whether the response (input 1) matches an answer option that is given as context (input 2).This allows the model to cope with varying numbers of answer options per question as well as diverse answer options per questionnaire, so that we can run an entire questionnaire using a single judge.As output, we select the answer option with the maximum probability.Furthermore, this setup allows us to reject uncertain predictions that do not match any answer option by applying a threshold to the entropy values and assigning a value of not present if none of the answer options exceed the threshold.To create ground truth data, we use a selection of five LLMs (Qwen 2.5 7B and 72B, Llama 3.1 8B and 70B, and Zephyr 7B) to generate responses to the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire for each of three prompt variants (see Figure 4).We randomly sample 484 responses and manually annotate them.For details on the ground truth data creation and annotation, see Appendix D.2. Results We first select the optimal threshold for rejecting responses as not present.As shown in Figure 2, we can use the entropy values of the classifier output to determine a suitable separation between model outputs matching an answer option and noise on the ground truth data.Optimal separation is achieved for and entropy threshold of 0.359, which we use in the following.</p>
<p>In Figure 3, we show a comparison of the perfor-mance of the rule-based and model-based judges.Interestingly, we find that despite our optimizations, the rule-based judge performs substantially better than the model-based judge.In the our experiments in Section 5, we therefore use the rule-based judge, but include both judges in the framework.</p>
<p>Prompt Template Design</p>
<p>Given the sensitivity of LLMs to prompt variations, we also experiment with suitable designs for prompt templates to optimize the relevance of LLM responses when answering questionnaires originally designed for human participants.Candidate templates.We evaluate three prompt variants with progressively detailed instructions (see Figure 4): (1) a natural prompt mimicking instructions given to a human respondent;</p>
<p>(2) a variant with added LLM-specific instructions tailored to the common multiple-choice structure of many questionnaires; and (3) a variant specifying JSON as the output format.The user prompt remains identical across variants, containing the questions and answer options defined in the questionnaire.Dataset.For evaluation, we again use the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ).All prompts include a persona to be simulated, based on a title and a surname chosen from one of five ethnic groups (see Section 5).We generate 500 responses for the entire survey for each model, using Llama 8B and 70B, Qwen 32B and 72B, and Zephyr 7B.Experimental setup.We consider a response to be relevant if it meets two criteria: (1) it is valid, meaning that it does not contain refusals or apologies from the model, as determined by a validator, and (2) it is not rejected, meaning it includes content related to at least one of the predefined answer options, as determined by a judge.Answer option formatting.We also experiment with presenting the answer options as an itemized list using line breaks versus a single-line, commaseparated list.The latter performed better and is used in our experiments.</p>
<p>Psychometric Experiments</p>
<p>To demonstrate the capability of our framework and expand the available data on LLM traits, we designed five experiments based on psychometric questionnaires and problems from the literature.Models.We select models of various sizes and families to demonstrating that our design is effective for open-weight models as well as closed-source APIs.Specifically, we use the Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1, and SmolLM families of instruction-tuned models, Aya-23 35B, and Zephyr 7B.We also include ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4o-mini as commercial models in some of the experiments.For model details, see Appendix A.1.Settings and hyperparameters.In all experiments, we limit the generation to a maximum of 64 tokens since the models are answering multiplechoice questionnaires.We use sampling-based generation with temperature = 1.0, top_k = 50 and top_p = 0.95.Due to GPU memory constraints, we use 4-bit quantized versions of all models.Prompt template.Following our findings in Section 4.2, we use the full JSON-based template (variant 3) for all experiments (see Figure 4).Personas.To simulate personas, we use names from the list provided by Aher et al. ( 2023), from which we select Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Black, and White names (for details, see Appendix C).Gender is simulated by adding Ms. or Mr. as a prefix to the names.</p>
<p>Exp1: Gain vs. Loss Orientation</p>
<p>As our first experiment, we show the scores that we obtained for the models used in the experimental component design in Section 4. Experimental setup.The Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (RFQ) (Higgins et al., 2001) aims to assess participants' tendencies for focusing on lossavoidance (prevention), and focusing on attainment and gain (promotion).For details on the prompts, see Appendix B.1.We collect 2,750 questionnaire responses per model, which are equally split into female/male personas and across ethnicities.</p>
<p>Results.As we see in the results in Figure 5, there are no significant differences in scores based on the used personas.However, we find strong differences between the models, with the larger models having generally lower prevention and higher promotion scores.No other trends are observable.</p>
<p>Exp2: Impact of Model Size</p>
<p>The number of parameters of a model tend to correlate with the model's overall performance on many NLP tasks.While comprehension of the task by the model is an important factor, for psychometric tests it is not readily apparent whether model size should correlate with observed scores.Experimental setup.To demonstrate how our framework can provide such a general assessment of LLM traits by size, we use the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI) (John et al., 1991).For details on the prompts, see Appendix B.2.As models, we use the full line of Qwen 2.5 models and collect 11,000 questionnaire responses for each, split uniformly into personas by gender and ethnicity.</p>
<p>Results.Based on the results (see Figure 6), we find clear evidence of personality traits that increase with model size in agreeableness and conscientiousness.This highlights that the prior finding by Bodroža et al. (2024) regarding pro-social characteristics may have to be viewed as a function of model size.For the other three traits, trends are less obvious, although neuroticism seems to generally decrease, while extraversion and openness are more or less constant if the smaller models are considered potentially unstable outliers.</p>
<p>Exp3: Persona-induced Bias</p>
<p>The use of personas has been proposed as an option for simulating human participants in (computational) social experiments (Aher et al., 2023;Argyle et al., 2023).However, social biases in such a setting are a serious concern (Hu et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Experimental setup.To employ our framework to investigate persona-induced biases, we choose a highly sensitive topic and use the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs questionnaire (Schudson and van Anders, 2022), which breaks down participants attitudes towards gender/sex minorities into the factors upbringing, uniformity, affirmation, gender normativity, and attitude towards surgery.For details on the prompts, see Appendix B.3.As models, we utilize the most capable ones, namely GPT-4o mini, Llama 3.1 70B and Qwen 2.5 72B.For each model, we collect 5,750 questionnaire responses, which are equally split into female/male personas and across the five ethnicities.Results.The results are shown in Figure 7. Interestingly, we find very little evidence for personainduced bias: with the exception of slightly increased uniformity scores for white and male personas in the GPT-4o mini and Llama model, there are no significant differences in the scores by persona.This finding is largely consistent with prior observations in the literature that personas induce relatively little variability (Hu and Collier, 2024).However, we find strong differences based on the model, with Qwen producing significantly more conservative scores on upbringing, uniformity and affirmation than the other two models.</p>
<p>Exp4: Contamination and Consistency</p>
<p>Data contamination (Magar and Schwartz, 2022) is a serious concern when testing the capabilities of LLMs, in particular for closed-source models Table 2: Performance of LLMs on variations of the trolley task, including the morality decision (classic), the decision to divert the trolley (action), and a semantically equivalent rephrasing of the problem (sky).Values denote the percentage of responses in which the model takes action or views action as morally permissible.%na denotes the percentage of unusable responses.(Balloccu et al., 2024).In the case of psychometric testing, contamination may be further exacerbated by closed-source models being explicitly trained for desired performance on select questionnaires.Experimental Setup.To obtain an impression of contamination and reasoning consistency, we consider three variations of the trolley problem (Thomson, 1984), namely (1) the classic morality dilemma in which the participant is asked to assess the morality of making a decision, (2) the decision version in which the participant must choose whether to divert the trolley, and (3) an equivalent "trolley in the skies" decision version in which we present the problem as an airplane crash scenario.</p>
<p>For details on the prompts, see Appendix B.4.We use all LLMs for this experiment, plus GPT-4o.</p>
<p>For each model, we collect 750 questionnaire responses, equally split into female/male personas and across the five ethnicities.</p>
<p>Results.In Table 2, we show the results of the trolley experiments.Apart from the SmolLM and Zephyr models, the successful response rate of models is very high.However, we find the behavior of models to be largely inconsistent, with models either rating action as morally permissible (classic) but then not following through on diverting the trolley (action) or rating it as not permissible yet still acting on it.The "trolley in the skies" highlights inconsistencies in the responses of most models in comparison to the classic wording.Only Llama 3.1 70B and Qwen 2.5 32B are consistent in their responses through all three versions.</p>
<p>Exp5: Prompt Order Sensitivity</p>
<p>It is well documented that the performance of generative LLMs can depend on the order in which information in the prompt is provided (Lu et al., 2022).For designing psychometric tests, this is particularly relevant with regard to the order of items in multiple-choice questionnaires, where several LLMs have been found to suffer from output instability (Pezeshkpour and Hruschka, 2024;Zheng et al., 2024).Experimental setup.To investigate the effect that the order of the presented answer options, we use the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961), which consists of 21 questions that each have 4 answer options labeled 0-3, with higher numbers indicating higher risk of depression.For our two experimental setups, we present the answer options to the LLMs (1) in the regular order, and (2) in inverted order with re-labeled options, such that higher numbers indicate a lower risk of depression.For scoring, the inversion is then reversed to map both outputs to the same scale.For details on the prompts, see Appendix B.5.For each model, we collect 5,250 questionnaire responses, equally split into female and male personas.Results.Considering results in Figure 8, we find strongly differing depression scores between models in the default setup, with Qwen scoring a normal state, GPT-4o mini falling into the range of a mild mood disturbance, and Llama indicating a mod-erately depressed behavior.The scores between male and female personas differ significantly only for GPT.When using the inverted questionnaire, the scores of GPT-4o mini and Llama decrease significantly (and across depression severity levels), while the scores of Qwen increase slightly.</p>
<p>Conclusion and Outlook</p>
<p>In summary, our experimental results confirm and expand on some prior findings in machine psychology, including the pro-social characteristics of LLMs and the limited impact of persona variations on model responses at large.However, they also highlight the strong variability in results that can be obtained and the sensitivity of experimental outputs to expriment conditions, including prompt wording and ordering, patterns induced during of model pretraining and potential contamination, as well as social biases as a result of using personas.Not least, our results show that experiments in machine psychology have so far only scratched the very surface of the breadth of experimental results that are obtainable and consequently paint a very sparse picture of LLM characteristics.Thus, our findings highlight the need for a principled, rigorous approach to the psychometric testing of language models that has previously been called for (Löhn et al., 2024).With R.U.Psycho, we provide a framework that not just enables easy variation of experimental design, questionnaires, prompts, models, and settings, but also ensures reproducibility of the findings by means of welldefined experiment design files.With this contribution, we aim to help resolve inconsistencies in the literature on machine psychology and lower the bar for conducting such experiments to more readily include domain experts with less coding expertise.R.U.Psycho is available as a Python package at https://github.com/julianschelb/rupsycho.</p>
<p>Ongoing work.In our ongoing work, we are integrating chat capability into the framework to support more human-like settings for filling in a questionnaire with full recall of previous answers.We are also working on an LLM-powered UI experiment configurator that can directly import questionnaires from PDFs with a human in the loop.Finally, we are developing improved and generalizable versions of the encoder-based judges to further optimize answer extraction effectiveness.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>Despite the focus on comprehensiveness and generalizability, we see a number of limitations in our work presented here.</p>
<p>Persona details.In our experiments, our approach to simulting personas is rather straightforward and kept simple to allow for a wide range of experiments.However, more detailed instructions for persona generation that includes further background and demographic information are established in the literature (e.g., see (Giorgi et al., 2024)).Our findings should be viewed in the light of this limitation (i.e., the lack of effects that we find based on persona ethnicity may not generalize) and such extended approaches should be investigated in more detail using our framework.</p>
<p>Usage of chat history.Following what has been investigated in the literature, we simulate questionnaire taking by LLMs as a series of disconnected individual prompts, one per question.With the continual increase in models' input context sizes and the availability of models tuned for chat compatibility, it is also possible to simulate a more human-like questionnaire setup in which previous questions remain in the context of the model as it fills in the questionnaire.While our framework is easily extensible to this functionality and will support it in the release version, the experimental design for ensuring a fair comparison is non-trivial and requires further research.</p>
<p>Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>We see no ethical concerns in our own work -we use openly available models and questionnaires from the literature and do not include any human experiments.The computational effort for our experiments was kept to the necessary minimum.However, in using our framework, all caveats of subjecting language models to human-centric psychometric questionnaires and attributing human characteristics and traits to LLMs do apply.We refer the interested reader to the calls for caution that we reference in our Related Work section.</p>
<p>AI Statement</p>
<p>Language model-based AI tools (ChatGPT) were used as coding assistants in the implementation and as writing assistants in drafting parts of the manuscript.The final version of the manuscript was written without AI input.As open-weight models, we use the Qwen 2.5 (Yang et al., 2024), Llama 3.1 (Dubey et al., 2024), and SmolLM (Allal et al., 2024) model families.The Qwen 2.5 models, ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters, are valuable for analyzing impact of model size.Llama 3.1's 8B and 72B sizes offer a good comparison to Qwen 2.5's 7B and 72B variants.Both model families pre-trained on multilingual datasets of trillions of tokens are considered multi-purpose chat models that can handle complex instructions and output structured formats (e.g., JSON).The SmolLM family allows us to expariment with the smallest available model sizes.As further architecture variations, we include the Aya-23 35B (Aryabumi et al., 2024) and Zephyr 7B (Tunstall et al., 2023) models.Finally, we use ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4o-mini as representatives of closed-source commercial API as a point of comparison (OpenAI, 2023).We list all models used in our experiments, in Table 3.</p>

<p>B Full Experiment Prompts</p>
<p>We employ an identical prompt template for all five experiments, using placeholders that are populated according to the questionnaire and the used personas.</p>
<p>System prompt:</p>

</ol>
<p>B.2 Experiment 2: BFI</p>
<p>For a general assessment of LLM "personality" across model sizes, we use the standard 44-item Big Five Inventory (John et al., 1991).All questions are scored on an identical 5-point Likert scale indicating the participant's level of agreement with statements about themselves.</p>
<p>Questionnaire instruction:</p>

Disagree strongly, 2. Disagree a little, 3. Neither agree nor disagree, 4. Agree a little, 5. Agree strongly</p>
<p>B.3 Experiment 3: GSDB</p>
<p>We use the Gender/Sex Diversity Beliefs questionnaire (Schudson and van Anders, 2022) consisting of 23 questions, which are all scored on an identical 7-point Likert scale indicating the participant's level of agreement.</p>
<p>Questionnaire instruction: Indicate your level of agreement with the following statements about gender and sex.Also, please note these definitions for terms some people might be unfamiliar with: Transgender -a person whose gender identity is different from the gender they were assigned at birth.Example: "Michael is a transgender man.He was labeled a girl at birth and currently identifies as a man."Cisgender -a person whose gender identity is the same as the gender they were assigned at birth.Example: "Alyssa is a cisgender woman.She was labeled a girl at birth and currently identifies as a woman."Non-binary -a person whose gender identity exists beyond woman or man or involves both.Non-binary identities include genderqueer, agender, etc. Example: "Taylor is non-binary.Taylor was labeled a boy at birth but is now agender, and does not identify with man or woman, or any gender."</p>

<p>B.4 Experiment 4: Trolley Problem</p>
<p>We consider three variations of the trolley problem (Thomson, 1984), namely (1) the classic morality dilemma in which the participant is asked to assess the morality of making a decision, (2) the decision version in which the participant must choose whether to divert the trolley, and (3) an equivalent decision version in which we present the problem as an airplane crash scenario.We use the same general model instruction for all three cases.</p>
<p>Questionnaire instruction: Consider the following scenario and answer the question at the end.</p>
<p>B.4.1 Classic Trolley Morality Dilemma</p>
<p>Question: Suppose you are the driver of a trolley.The trolley rounds a bend, and there come into view ahead five track workmen, who have been repairing the track.The track goes through a bit of a valley at that point, and the sides are steep, so you must stop the trolley if you are to avoid running the five men down.You step on the brakes, but alas they don't work.Now you suddenly see a spur of the track leading off to the right.You can turn the trolley onto it, and thus save the five men on the straight track ahead.Unfortunately, Mrs. Foot has arranged that there is one track workman on that spur of the track.He can no more get off the track in time than the five can, so you will kill him if you turn the trolley onto him.Is it morally permissible for you to turn the trolley?Answer Options: 1. Yes, 2. No</p>
<p>B.4.2 Trolley Decision Dilemma</p>
<p>Question: Suppose you are the driver of a trolley.The trolley rounds a bend, and there come into view ahead five track workmen, who have been repairing the track.The track goes through a bit of a valley at that point, and the sides are steep, so you must stop the trolley if you are to avoid running the five men down.You step on the brakes, but alas they don't work.Now you suddenly see a spur of the track leading off to the right.You can turn the trolley onto it, and thus save the five men on the straight track ahead.Unfortunately, there is one track workman on that spur of the track.He can no more get off the track in time than the five can, so you will kill him if you turn the trolley onto him.You have two options.Answer Options: 1. Do nothing., 2. Turn the trolly and hit the single worker.</p>
<p>B.4.3 Trolley in the Skies Dilemma</p>
<p>Question: Suppose you are working as an air traffic controller in a flight control tower and your task is to give clearance for takeoff and landings.Your airport has just one single runway, meaning that only one plane can land at any given time.At the start of your shift, the sole pilot of a light aircraft requests emergency landing permission, which you grant to prevent it from crashing.Moments later, a passenger plane carrying five people also requests emergency landing permission to avoid a crash.Since it is impossible for both planes to land at the same time, one of them will crash, inevitably killing everyone on board.In order to grant landing permission to the passenger plane, you would have to let the light aircraft crash.You have two options.Answer Options: 1. Do nothing., 2. Revoke the landing permission of the light aircraft and let the passenger plane land.</p>
<p>B.5 Experiment 5: BDI</p>
<p>To experiment with prompt-order sensitivity, we use the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck et al., 1961(Beck et al., , 1988)), which consists of 21 questions that each have 4 answer options labeled 0-3, with higher numbers indicating higher risk of depression.For our two experimental setups, we present the answer options to the LLMs (1) in the regular order, or (2) in inverted order.We use the same questionnaire instruction in both cases.</p>
<p>Questionnaire instruction: This depression inventory can be self-scored.The scoring scale is at the end of the questionnaire.Choose the answer option that describes your current state.</p>
<p>B.5.1 Standard BDI Questionnaire</p>
<p>Question: Question 1. Answer Options: 0. I do not feel sad., 1.I feel sad., 2. I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it., 3.

I do not feel like a failure., 1.I feel I have failed more than the average person., 2. As I look back on my life, all I can see is a lot of failures., 3. I feel I am a complete failure as a person.Question: Question 4. Answer Options: 0. I get as much satisfaction out of things as I used to., 1.I don't enjoy things the way I used to., 2. I don't get real satisfaction out of anything anymore., 3. I am dissatisfied or bored with everything.Question: Question 5. Answer Options: 0. I don't feel particularly guilty., 1.I feel guilty a good part of the time., 2. I feel quite guilty most of the time., 3. I feel guilty all of the time.Question: Question 6. Answer Options: 0.

<p>B.5.2 Reverse-option BDI Questionnaire</p>
<p>For the reversed option setup, we inverted the order of the four answer options and relabeled them accordingly such that the first option (formerly item 3) would be labeled 0, i.e., in this version, the highest value corresponds to the least risk of depression.For evaluating this version of BDI, the scores are inverted after collecting the answers as score := 3 − reverse score.</p>
<p>We only show the first question an an example:</p>
<p>Question: Question 1. Answer Options: 0. I am so sad and unhappy that I can't stand it., 1.I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it., 2. I feel sad., 3. I do not feel sad.</p>
<p>C Full Persona Details</p>
<p>To generate descriptions for the personas in our experiments, we use a combination of the title Ms. or Ms. in combination with a surname that we take from the lists of names published by Aher et al. (2023) for this purpose.From each of the five original lists of names, we sample 25 names at random without replacement and use each of them once as a male and once as a female name, for a total of 250 persona variations.</p>

<p>D Experimental Component Design D.1 Model-based Judge Implementation</p>
<p>The model-based judge evaluates responses by comparing them against all possible answer options using a fine-tuned classifier.Figure 9 illustrates this inference process, while Figure 10 shows the entropy-based rejection criteria used to filter inconclusive responses for each individual answer option in the RFQ questionnaire.</p>
<p>D.1.1 Supervised Answer Classification</p>
<p>We model the task of mapping the LLM-generated responses to one of the multiple choice options as a binary classification problem: for each (answer option, generated response) pair, the classifier outputs a probability that the pair corresponds (Yes) or does  Each response is paired with all n possible answer options and evaluated by a fine-tuned binary classifier.If the entropy exceeds 0.359, the response is rejected as inconclusive; otherwise, the highest-probability answer is selected.not correspond (No).This setup offers flexibility by allowing the classifier to evaluate each possible answer option independently, making it adaptable to varying numbers of options.This is particularly useful for Likert-scale responses, where answer labels vary slightly to fit specific questions (e.g., "5.very often true" vs. "5.many times").</p>
<p>D.1.2 Training Procedure</p>
<p>We fine-tune an encoder-based model on the resulting labeled dataset, optimizing for binary classification accuracy.Each training example indicates whether a given response matches a particular answer option.The model then outputs a probability for the Yes or No labels.</p>
<p>To reject uncertain predictions, we apply an entropy threshold.Specifically, we compute the entropy of the predicted probability distribution over the answer options, where high entropy indicates uncertainty due to multiple options having similar likelihoods.We determine the optimal rejection threshold by averaging the lowest and highest entropy values that yield the highest accuracy.For validation, we apply bootstrap sampling with this threshold to generate the accuracy distribution over 1,000 iterations.options defined in the RFQ questionnaire.This dataset is used to train the binary answer option classifier used by the model-based judge to select the most likely option for a given response.To benchmark the judge, we manually annotate a sample of responses.</p>
<p>D.2 Model-based Judge Data</p>
<p>Training data generation.We employ a twostage process to construct a synthetic data set consisting of (answer option, paraphrased answer option) pairs.First, we define a set of handcrafted templates that capture various ways to phrase responses in a Likert-scale format.We generate a seed dataset by combining each template with every possible answer option (see Appendix D.2.1 for a full template list).</p>
<p>Next, we increase the diversity of the dataset by prompting Llama 3.1 70B to generate paraphrases of the filled-in templates (for more details see Appendix D.2.2).Paraphrases with cosine similarity below the 25th percentile, computed using Sentence-BERT embeddings, are discarded.Template-based and paraphrased versions are merged into a combined dataset.We model the negative class by randomly pairing a paraphrased answer option with an incorrect answer option.We include three negative samples for each positive pair and label them as non-corresponding.</p>
<p>Benchmark dataset.To compare the performance of both judges, we generate 2,750 responses to the Regulatory Focus Questionnaire (Higgins et al., 2001) for each of three prompt variants (see Figure 4) and five models (see Exp. 1 in Appendix A), resulting in a total of 41,250 responses.We manually annotated a random sample of 484 responses.Two annotators (one with a psychology / data science background and one with a computer science background) independently labeled each response with the most likely answer option.Five responses with disagreeing annotations were excluded.</p>
<p>D.2.1 Seed Dataset Generation</p>
<p>The seed dataset is generated by populating predefined templates with all possible answer options, creating an initial set of positive (answer option, template + answer option) pairs.Each template is completed with every answer option in three distinct formats: (1) numeric-only, (2) text-only, and (3) a combined format (e.g., "1.", "never or seldom", and "1.never or seldom").</p>
<p>Templates.The following list presents the complete set of 67 handcrafted templates we used to generate the seed dataset.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>D.2.2 Dataset Augmentation</p>
<p>To increase the diversity of the seed dataset, we generate additional examples by instructing LLaMA 3.1 70B (Dubey et al., 2024) to paraphrase the filled-in templates from the original seed dataset.</p>
<p>Prompt template.We use the following prompt template to instruct the model to generate multiple distinct paraphrases of a given statement from the seed dataset.To further enhance the diversity of the paraphrases, we randomly sample five paraphrasing strategies from a list of handcrafted instructions for inclusion in the prompt.The generated sentences are separated by newlines to obtain multiple paraphrased versions of the original statement.</p>
