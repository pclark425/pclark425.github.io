                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non–negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like ”dark fluid” and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analogue gravity setups.</p>

Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe.We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non-negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally).We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC.We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analogue gravity setups.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The concept of warp drives was first introduced by Miguel Alcubierre in his seminal 1994 paper [1], and elaborated upon by José Natario in [2].A warp drive is a solution of General Relativity that has the appearance of a "bubble" propagating on some (flat or non-flat) spacetime background.The observers inside the bubble are in an inertial reference frame, which means warp drives do not require external energy sources to accelerate, and they may move at any speed (in principle including superluminal).This makes them a viable candidate for interstellar travel, but they have one significant downside: in order to sustain a bubble, one requires exotic matter with negative energy density [2]- [21].</p>
<p>As pointed out by Homer Ellis in [22], the Schwarzschild metric, which describes a black hole, can be mapped to a warp drive-type metric with the use of a coordinate system known as Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates, which makes it possible to embed a warp drive in a black hole background.In [23], we studied the implications of this result, and in [24], we generalized it to wormholes.In this paper, we generalize this result to the case of a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe and demonstrate that it's possible for it to have a non-negative energy density, meaning that it may be physically interpreted not as an object made of some exotic matter, but rather as a vacuum energy inhomogeneity.This kind of object satisfies the averaged null and weak energy conditions, though it does violate them locally.We show that this is a consequence of a more generic theorem stating that perturbations of vacuum energy that produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames inevitably result in local violations of WEC and NEC.</p>
<p>First, we briefly outline the warp drive physics in general and Ellis' formalism in section 2.Then, in section 3, we apply this formalism to the de Sitter metric to construct a warp bubble with non-negative Eulerian energy density, and prove the theorem on vacuum energy underdensities.We conclude in section 4 with an overview of these results and their possible implications for cosmology and lab setups.</p>
<p>An Overview of Warp Drives</p>
<p>A warp drive metric, as defined by Alcubierre in [1], is a metric of the form
−dt 2 + (dx − f vdt) 2 + dy 2 + dz 2 ,(1)
where f (r s ) is a function that is equal to 1 for r s smaller than some scale R W , and quickly decreases to zero for r s &gt; R W .Here
r s = (x − x 0 (t)) 2 + y 2 + z 2 ,(2)
and
v = dx 0 dt .(3)
Physically, this metric describes a localized "bubble" with a radius R W , whose center is located at (x 0 (t), 0, 0), and within which the observer is in a reference frame moving at velocity v (which is inertial if v = const).The Alcubierre metric belongs to a more generic class of metrics of the form
−dt 2 + 3 i=1 dx i + N i dt 2 ,(4)
known as the Natario class [2].In ADM terms, this is a type of metric that has the lapse N = 1 and flat intrinsic metric (h i j = δ i j ).For every spacetime belonging to this class, it is possible to embed a warp bubble into it by changing the shift vector in the following way [22]:
N i → (1 − f )N i − f v i .(5)
As shown in [25], for a Natario-type metric, the Eulerian energy density is given by
ρ = 1 16πG ∂ i (N i ∂ j N j − N j ∂ j N i ) − 1 4 (∂ i N j − ∂ j N i ) 2 , (6)
where the first term is a total divergence that averages to zero for asymptotically flat spacetimes with N i 's falling off quicker than r −1/2 (and, hence, has to be negative somewhere), and the second term is negative-definite.This means that asymptotically flat Natario spacetimes always have regions of negative energy density; in particular, for the Alcubierre metric (1), the energy density is manifestly negative:
ρ = − f ′2 v 2 32πG y 2 + z 2 r 2 s .(7)
However, every theorem is only as strong as its assumptions: namely, if one takes a shift vector that is both irrotational (i.e. it can be written as a gradient of some function ϕ, as was done in [26,27]) and asymptotically non-vanishing (or falling off slower than r −1/2 ), it's possible to produce ρ that is nonnegative everywhere.By combining this result with the Ellis' procedure of "embedding", we demonstrate the possibility of non-negative energy density for a warp bubble embedded in a de Sitter universe.</p>
<p>De Sitter Spacetime</p>
<p>Beginning with the standard FRW form of the de Sitter metric:
−dt 2 + e 2Ht dρ 2 + ρ 2 dΩ 2 ,(8)
we make the replacement
r = e Ht ρ(9)
to yield
−dt 2 + dr − r L dt 2 + r 2 dΩ 2 ,(10)
where
L = H −1 .(11)
This is a warp-type metric with
N i = − r L x i r . (12)
After embedding it becomes
N i = −(1 − f ) x i L − f v i . (13)
The energy density is given by
ρ = (1− f ) 2 3 8πGL 2 + f ′ (1 − f ) 4πGL ⃗ v − ⃗ r L ⃗ r s r s − f ′2 32πG ⃗ v − ⃗ r L ⊗ ⃗ r s r s 2 . (14) Now, if we write ⃗ r = ⃗ r 0 + ⃗ r s ,(15)
where ⃗ r 0 is the position of the center of the bubble relatively to the center of the black hole, and then set
⃗ v = ⃗ r 0 L ,(16)
the last negative definite term will be identically set to zero, and the energy density would be given by
ρ = (1 − f ) 2 3 8πGL 2 − r s f ′ (1 − f ) 4πGL 2 ,(17)
which is positive definite.Alternatively, this expression may be written in the form:
ρ = 3 8πGL 2 + 1 8πGL 2 r 2 s r 3 s f ( f − 2) ′ ,(18)
where the first term is the background vacuum energy density, and the second is a total divergence that averages to zero upon integration over d 3 r.This means that the total amount of energy in the universe does not change, and the bubble is effectively just a rearrangement of vacuum energy.In this context, vacuum energy may be modeled as a fluid whose total mass is conserved, so all we do is rearrange it: we create an underdensity region with ρ = 0, surrounded by a shell with excess ρ.</p>
<p>The mathematical reason for this is that under the condition ( 16), ⃗ N would be a gradient:
N i = ∂ i ϕ(19)
of the function
ϕ(r) = − r 2 2L + 1 L |⃗ r−⃗ r 0 | 0 dr ′ r ′ f (r ′ ) .(20)
Therefore for a highly specific type of warp drive that moves along the "river flow", it is possible to get rid of negative energy.Rather than being "made" of negative energy, this kind of warp bubble may be physically interpreted as a kind of underdensity in vacuum energy, an underdensity that is in some way similar to the ones that exist between the Casimir plates where the energy is only "relatively negative".However, if we want the condition ( 16) to be valid always, we would need the bubble to accelerate.Namely, by integrating ( 16) from some initial point r i , we obtain
r(t) = r i e Ht , v(t) = r i L e Ht . (21)
By inverting the first relation, we find
t = t H ln r r i .(22)
Now, let us consider the other components of the SET:
T ni = 1 16πG ∂ i (∂ j N j ) − ∂ 2 N i = 0 ,(23)T i j = ρδ i j + 1 16πG ∂ i N k ∂ j N k − ∂ k N i ∂ k N j +(24)+ 1 8πG ∂ k N k K i j − Kδ i j + 1 8πG ∂ t δ i j K − K i j .(25)
The averaged spatial stresses are given by
T i j = − 3 8πGL 2 δ i j = − ⟨ρ⟩ δ i j ,(26)
as can be seen from the fact that the second term vanishes identically due to N i being a gradient, and the third term is just a total divergence that averages to − 3 4πGL 2 δ i j (27) upon surface integration at a large enough r s where f ≈ 0. The fourth time-derivative term is also a total divergence:
δ i j 8πG ∂ t K = δ i j 8πG ∂ k ∂ t N k ,(28)
and the fifth term becomes a total divergence upon multiplying it by n i n j :
− 1 8πG n i n j ∂ t K i j = − 1 8πG ∂ i n i n j ∂ t N j .(29)
Both of them vanish at a boundary far away from the bubble where N i 's are time-independent, and therefore the averaged null energy condition is saturated:
T µν n µ n ν = ⟨ρ⟩ + T i j n i n j = 0 ,(30)
exactly as the ordinary NEC for unperturbed de Sitter (here n i is an arbitrary unit vector).As the terms that average to zero have to be negative somewhere, this means that NEC is violated locally.Likewise, one can see that the weak energy condition, given by ρ + β 2 T i j n i n j ≥ 0 ,</p>
<p>where β is the modulus of the spatial part of a timelike vector (and, hence, β 2 &lt; 1), is satisfied on average and violated locally because NEC is a limiting case of WEC, and β 2 can be made arbitrarily close to 1 (corresponding to an observer moving at a speed that may be arbitrarily close to the speed of light).This is a specific case of a more generic theorem: For perturbations of de Sitter vacuum energy that produce underdensities (i.e. there do exist regions where the energy density ρ &lt; ρ, where ρ is the background energy density) in every reference frame, NEC and WEC are always locally violated (namely, there are timelike observers that observe negative energy density in some regions).</p>
<p>Equivalently, this may be formulated as: A perturbed de Sitter metric that satisfies NEC and WEC may be obtained from a de Sitter metric with strictly positive perturbations (i.e. where ρ ≥ ρ everywhere) by a coordinate transformation.</p>
<p>Proof: One can split the SET into background and perturbation:
T µν = Tµν + δT µν . (32)
For the de Sitter metric, we have
Ti j = − ρδ i j , T0i = 0 ,(33)
and hence the energy density, as measured by an arbitrary timelike observer, is given by
(1 − β 2 ) ρ + δρ + 2βn i δT 0i + β 2 n i n j δT i j .(34)
Now, we can write
β = 1 − ϵ ,(35)
so for very small values of ϵ (34) yields 2ϵ ρ − n i δT 0i − n i n j δT i j + δρ + 2n i δT 0i + n i n j δT i j .</p>
<p>As ϵ can be aribtrarily small, for some value of it we will have
2ϵ ρ − n i δT 0i − n i n j δT i j &lt; inf δρ + 2n i δT 0i + n i n j δT i j ,(37)
leading to negative energy density.The only way to avoid this is to set δρ
+ 2n i δT 0i + n i n j δT i j = 0 ,(38)
but as the direction of n i is arbitrary, this would require
δT 0i = 0 , δT i j = −δρg i j .(39)
However, the zero-divergence condition
∇ µ T µν = 0(40)
means that δρ = const, yielding just ordinary unperturbed de Sitter solution.This concludes the proof of the theorem.In our specific case, we have
δN i = ∂ i Φ , δN 2 = δh i j = 0 ,(41)
so the perturbation is mass-conserving (i.e. it conserves the integral of ρ over d 3 r) in every reference frame.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>In this paper, we studied the model of warp drive embedding into a de Sitter background, and found that it's possible to construct a warp bubble for which:</p>
<p>• The Eulerian energy density is strictly non-negative;</p>
<p>• The volume-averaged weak and null energy conditions are satisfied (though NEC and WEC are violated locally).</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, one needs the bubble to move in the radial direction at a velocity exactly equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe.This means that this type of warp drive is not a very practical option for space travel because if you want to choose your direction, you have to start at the center of the universe (otherwise you can only move in one particular direction; see fig. 1).Besides, one can only realistically traverse distances that are much smaller than the bubble's initial distance from the center of the universe (r − r i ≪ r i ); otherwise, according to (22), the time of travel will be of the order of the Hubble time (which, for our Universe, is about 14.4 billion years).Nonetheless, this solution is useful as a "proof of concept" because it demonstrates the principal possibility of creating a warp bubble with non-negative Eulerian energy density through a loophole in the no-go theorem outlined in [25], namely by considering a spacetime whose shift vector is both irrotational (gradient) and asymptotically non-vanishing.Besides, it illustrates the idea of creating a warp drive through a manipulation of dark energy.</p>
<p>It also serves as a mathematical model of vacuum energy underdensities that may be of use because what one has been able to produce in Casimir cavity experiments so far is precisely that, not actual negative energy but underdensities in the background (positive) vacuum energy.In principle, it's possible to consider more generic models of these underdensities, such as stationary bubbles, non-spherical bubbles, bubbles in which the energy density is not exactly zero ( f &lt; 1) in the inner region, etc.</p>
<p>We have also proven that if perturbations in de Sitter space produce at least some underdense regions in every reference frame, they inevitably result in local violations of WEC and NEC.This result may have implications for theories like quintessence [28,29,30], "dark fluid" [31,32], and superfluid vacuum [33,34,35,36,37] that model dark energy as a kind of fluid.It can also lead to a new physical interpretation of the exotic "negative energy" as just dark energy underdensities observed in a different reference frame (this is especially relevant for the superfluid vacuum theory that postulates the violation of Lorentz symmetry and the existence of a preferred reference frame).</p>
<p>Analogue gravity setups mimicking a de Sitter universe are also known to exist, so it may be possible to create this kind of bubbles and study their effects within these analogue systems [38,39,40,41,42,43,44].</p>
