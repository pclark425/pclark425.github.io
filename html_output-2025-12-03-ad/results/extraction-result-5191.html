                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The diversity of contexts in which large language models (LLMs) are deployed requires the ability to modify or customize default model behaviors to incorporate nuanced requirements and preferences. A convenient interface to specify such model adjustments is high-level verbal feedback, such as"Don't use emojis when drafting emails to my boss."However, while writing high-level feedback is far simpler than collecting annotations for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we find that simply prompting a model with such feedback leads to overgeneralization of the feedback to contexts where it is not relevant. We study the problem of incorporating verbal feedback without such overgeneralization, inspiring a new method Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO). C3PO uses a piece of high-level feedback to generate a small synthetic preference dataset specifying how the feedback should (and should not) be applied. It then fine-tunes the model in accordance with the synthetic preference data while minimizing the divergence from the original model for prompts where the feedback does not apply. Our experimental results indicate that our approach effectively applies verbal feedback to relevant scenarios while preserving existing behaviors for other contexts. For both human- and GPT-4-generated high-level feedback, C3PO effectively adheres to the given feedback comparably to in-context baselines while reducing overgeneralization by 30%.</p>

<p>RLVF: Learning from Verbal Feedback without Overgeneralization
16 Feb 20248A5ED6436D4C8C02AFD4F1194B0228EDarXiv:2402.10893v1[cs.LG]
The diversity of contexts in which large language models (LLMs) are deployed requires the ability to modify or customize default model behaviors to incorporate nuanced requirements and preferences.A convenient interface to specify such model adjustments is high-level verbal feedback, such as "Don't use emojis when drafting emails to my boss."However, while writing high-level feedback is far simpler than collecting annotations for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), we find that simply prompting a model with such feedback leads to overgeneralization of the feedback to contexts where it is not relevant.We study the problem of incorporating verbal feedback without such overgeneralization, inspiring a new method Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO).C3PO uses a piece of high-level feedback to generate a small synthetic preference dataset specifying how the feedback should (and should not) be applied.It then fine-tunes the model in accordance with the synthetic preference data while minimizing the divergence from the original model for prompts where the feedback does not apply.Our experimental results indicate that our approach effectively applies verbal feedback to relevant scenarios while preserving existing behaviors for other contexts.For both humanand GPT-4-generated high-level feedback, C3PO effectively adheres to the given feedback comparably to in-context baselines while reducing overgeneralization by 30%.</p>

<p>With the increasingly widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across diverse industries and individuals, the ability to align them with high-level human feedback for a specific user or use-case becomes increasingly important.While LLM users often want the model to adhere to broad principles at all times, such as producing fluent text, individual users and use-cases have more nuanced preferences.For example, a user may request the LLM to write more concise work emails but more detailed personal emails, making feedback context dependent.Tailoring models to accommodate such preferences is challenging: it requires extensive resources to gather preferences in all different contexts and fine-tuning the model in one context can unpredictably impact model behavior in other contexts.We study the problem of adapting models using verbal feedback that is fast and easy for people to provide (see Fig. 1).</p>
<p>Common approaches to incorporating feedback, such as supervised context distillation (SCD) or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), use example-level supervision via either supervised completions or preference labels.Such methods require a corpus of user-provided (preference-)data, which can be costly and cumbersome to obtain.Additionally, they do not constrain model behavior outside the context that the feedback may apply, so the LLM might adapt its behavior in unintended ways, e.g.output a more verbose work email when the preference only applies to personal emails.Verbal feedback is far easier and faster for humans to provide.To this end, another common approach is to incorporate such verbal feedback into the prompt, potentially through an iterative process to continually add additional points of feedback.However, this approach requires re-using the prompt in all future queries.As more pieces of feedback accumulate, long prompts containing many context-dependent feedbacks can make inference expensive; further, identifying which pieces of feedback should apply in a given context can become difficult.</p>
<p>We aim to adapt LLMs such that, when provided with a single sentence that specifies feedback, the model can discern which situations the feedback applies to and appropriately incorporate the feedback in future outputs.We propose Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO), where we first synthetically generate hypothetical prompts in-scope and out-of-scope for the feedback.We then sample original completions to these prompts, without the feedback applied, as well as revised completions in line with the feedback.Importantly, we utilize the strong priors of existing instruction-tuned LLMs in this process and therefore do not require any additional human supervision.We then introduce a new objective to fine-tune the LLM's response behavior.One naive approach might use original and revised completions for prompts to maximize the implicit reward of a preference model (e.g. using direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023)).However, this objective does not capture the need to leave model behavior unchanged for non-relevant prompts.Instead, C3PO jointly maximizes the implicit reward for inscope prompts and minimizes standard cross-entropy loss between the logits of the base and fine-tuned model for outof-scope prompts.Including the latter loss in the objective adjusts the LLM's responses to prompts where the feedback is relevant, while preserving its behavior in contexts where the feedback should not be applied.</p>
<p>Our main contribution is C3PO, a new method for learning from verbal feedback that selectively adapts the LLM's behavior based on the context of the feedback.This novel synthetic data generation scheme and fine-tuning objective enables an LLM to extrapolate single-sentence feedback to new situations.Across numerous examples of feedback generated by humans and GPT-4, we find that C3PO accurately applies the feedback to relevant prompts and importantly, substantially reduces unintended behavior changes in scenarios where the feedback is not applicable, outperforming prior methods by over 10% when both criteria are considered.By providing adaptability to verbal feedback while reducing overgeneralization of such feedback, our work may help enhance the utility of LLMs in diverse use-cases.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Improving language or dialogue systems from feedback has been studied in the context of various types of feedback, including learned or (Walker, 2000;Böhm et al., 2019) or heuristic (Li et al., 2016) rewards on individual model out-puts, preferences or rankings over pairs or sets of model samples (Ziegler et al., 2020;Ouyang et al., 2022;Rafailov et al., 2023), and natural language feedback on model outputs or behaviors (Li et al., 2017).Natural language feedback or corrections on individual model outputs have been used to improve performance in code generation (Austin et al., 2021;Chen et al., 2023), dialogue (Li et al., 2017;Hancock et al., 2019;Shi et al., 2022), and summarization (Scheurer et al., 2023).Feedback or critiques are typically used to refine model outputs during generation, iterating on or refining the model's initial response before outputting a final answer.Recent work has emphasized self-refinement, where an LLM generates its own feedback (Madaan et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2023;Pan et al., 2023).Some studies have shown that the final outputs from such (self-)refinement methods can be distilled back into the model, improving its base performance without requiring iterative refinement during sampling at test time (Sun et al., 2023;Lu et al., 2023;Yu et al., 2023;Yuan et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Most relevant to the present work are studies leveraging natural language feedback to refine general model behaviors, rather than iteratively improving a single model output.Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022) uses an LLM to generate synthetic training data that encourages an LLM to follow high-level rules written by a human; Glaese et al. (2022) uses a similar approach to instill various rules into a pre-trained LLM.Context distillation (Askell et al., 2021;Snell et al., 2022) is another approach to controllability that distills the behavior of the LLM when conditioned on a piece of feedback back into the LLM without the feedback present, essentially 'baking in' the feedback.However, these approaches to controllability have mostly been used to instill universal behavioral changes (i.e., rules that should always be adhered to).Relatively fewer works have studied conditional or context-dependent rule following (though Clark et al. (2021) study adherence to synthetic rules for logical reasoning and commonsense).In concurrent work, Castricato et al. (2024) also utilize model completions and revisions to generate synthetic preference pairs; they use this technique to train a language model to better follow instructions that specifically request avoiding a given topic.</p>
<p>A related problem is model editing (Sinitsin et al., 2020;Cao et al., 2021;Mitchell et al., 2021;Meng et al., 2022), which studies interventions to pre-trained models that should only apply in a relatively small neighborhood around the 'model edit' (desired intervention).Most work in model editing studies corrections to factual or reasoning errors.However, Mitchell et al. (2022) study edits that adjust the sentiment of a dialogue model for a single topic, and Murty et al. (2022) show edits (or 'patches') to sentiment classification or relation extraction models.Mao et al. (2023) extend this work by editing model behavior for a single topic according to three categories of personality traits.Akyürek et al. (2023) and Hewitt et al. (2024) study model edits aimed at debiasing LLMs; Hewitt et al. (2024) also study factual edits and corrections to syntactic errors.In contrast, our work performs general behavioral edits to pre-trained LLMs, rather than edits of a specific type or for a specific context.</p>
<p>Preliminaries</p>
<p>We first outline two approaches for updating LLMs with high-level verbal feedback: supervised context distillation and preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL).</p>
<p>Supervised context distillation.</p>
<p>A simple but effective method to updating language models from feedback is supervised context distillation (SCD; Askell et al. (2021)), which incorporates a textual context z containing a general principle (e.g., "Always be nice!") or information (e.g., "Assume the US president is Joe Biden.")into a model's behavior.SCD 'distills' the behavior that a human or an LLM π 0 would produce when conditioned on both a user query x and the context z into the LLM without the context present.That is, from a dataset of unlabeled user queries or prompts D u = {x i }, a distillation target y i is either written by a human or generated by the LLM π 0 for each x i as y i ∼ π 0 (• | x, z).The language model π θ is produced from supervised fine-tuning with the negative log likelihood loss, using the synthetic supervision targets:
L SFT (D) = −E x,y∼D log π θ (y | x),(1)
where π θ is typically initialized as π 0 .</p>
<p>Preference-based reinforcement learning.Preferencebased reinforcement learning (PbRL; (Busa-Fekete et al., 2014;Saha et al., 2023)) is the most widely-used approach to updating language models from feedback by leveraging preferences over pairs 1 of LLM-generated responses y, y ′ to an input x.The responses y, y ′ are typically sampled 1 Rankings over larger sets of responses can also be used, but we use pairs for simplicity.For existing approaches for incorporating high-level feedback, high feedback adherence on inscope prompts (x axis) strongly predicts a large change in behavior for out-of-scope prompts (y axis), which is undesirable.In contrast, our approach C3PO decreases the rate at which out-of-scope behavior is affected as in-scope feedback adherence improves.Lines of best fit are computed with linear orthogonal regression.</p>
<p>from a language model π 0 fine-tuned with SCD or a similar objective (Ziegler et al., 2020;Bai et al., 2022;Ouyang et al., 2022).The input x may be an instruction, document to summarize, or dialogue history, for example.Given an input x, responses y, y ′ , an annotator (either a human or an LLM) labels which response is better, ultimately producing a dataset D pref = {x i , y + i , y − i }, where y + i is preferred to y − i for query x i , as judged by the annotator.</p>
<p>The dataset D pref is used to learn a parameterized reward model r ϕ : X × Y → R that assigns scalar goodness scores to individual input-response pairs.The most common objective for training a reward model is maximum likelihood in the Bradley-Terry choice model (Bradley &amp; Terry, 1952):
L BT (ϕ) = −E x,y + ,y − log p r ϕ (y + ≻ y − | x, y + , y − ) (2) = −E x,y + ,y − log σ r ϕ (x, y + ) − r ϕ (x, y − ) (3)
Early methods for fine-tuning LLMs from human preferences followed the reward modeling stage with a policy optimization stage aimed at finding a language model policy π θ that produces high-reward responses without deviating excessively from the LLM that generated the responses in D pref (Schulman et al., 2017;Ziegler et al., 2020).More recently, direct preference optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. (2023)) shows that the optimal policy can be extracted from the learned reward in closed form, avoiding the need for iterative policy search.Due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, we use the DPO algorithm for learning from preference data in this work.DPO directly optimizes the language model policy from preferences using the loss:
L DPO (D) = −E x,y + ,y − ∼D log σ log πθ(y + |x) π0(y + |x) − log πθ(y − |x) π0(y − |x) .

<p>Feedback</p>
<p>For specific Python coding questions, respond with only a code snippet and no explanations before or after the snippet.Our approach leverages PbRL to update a language model from high-level verbal feedback and does not assume that a preference dataset is directly available at the outset., respectively.We also prompt the current model to revise y − i to incorporate the feedback, giving a revised response y + i .This data generation scheme is the first stage of C3PO-autonomously generating fine-tuning datasets Din-scope, Dnear-scope and Dout-of-scope, the latter two of which are used to prevent overgeneralization on irrelevant tasks.</p>
<p>Categories</p>
<p>the distribution of model inputs where the model's behavior should change.Given a piece of feedback z, C3PO uses GPT-4 to first generate a set of K categories of prompts where the feedback could apply.GPT-4 then generates M prompts x in-scope i ( M K for each category) where the feedback applies.However, beyond accommodating feedback for inscope prompts, we must also avoid overgeneralization of the feedback to prompts where it does not apply.We therefore generate a set of M prompts x near-scope i in each category that are superficially related to the feedback in some way (lexically, semantically), but are not actually inputs where the model's behavior should change.Finally, we use a fixed set of M feedback-independent prompts x out-of-scope i to avoid degradation of completely unrelated model behaviors. 2See Table 1 for an example feedback, categories, and prompts and Figure 3 for a summary on the data generation scheme.</p>
<p>To capture the desired delta in behavior denoted by the feedback, we generate the dataset of preference pairs using the in-scope prompts D in-scope = {x in-scope i , y + i , y − i }. y − i is generated by the language model that originally received the feedback, i.e., we have y
− i ∼ π 0 (• | x in-scope i ).
To generate y + i , the language model is then prompted to revise y − i to incorporate the feedback, i.e., we have
y + i ∼ π 0 (• | x in-scope i , y − i , z).
See Appendix D for the complete prompt format.Thus to the extent that the model π 0 can correctly interpret the given feedback, the generated preference data represents the desired 'delta' in behavior described by the feed- } with the respective prompts and corresponding completions sampled from the initial language model π 0 .These datasets encode the behaviors that we want to preserve after incorporating z.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning using the synthetic data.</p>
<p>Using our synthetically-generated datasets, we now fine-tune the model π 0 using a combined loss, as shown in Figure 4, that both incorporates feedback on relevant prompts and discourages model degradation on feedback-irrelevant prompts:
L C3PO = Apply feedback L DPO (D in-scope ) + λ 1 L SFT (D out-of-scope ) + λ 2 L SFT (D near-scope ) Control model degradation . (5)
Interpreting the C3PO loss.While the L SFT losses simply regularize the updated model π θ toward the original model π 0 for prompts not relevant to the feedback, the result of learning from the C3PO synthetic preference dataset for in-scope inputs is less obvious.C3PO generates what we refer to as synthetic two-policy preference data (x, y + , y − ), where y + is always preferred to y − .These preference tuples are constructed by simply sampling y − from a policy π − (the baseline model π 0 ) and y + from a different policy π + (the baseline model π 0 prompted to revise a baseline model response using the feedback). 3Unlike preference datasets scored by a black-box human or AI annotator, we can express the optimal policy learned from such preference data in terms of the data-generating policies.</p>
<p>We show in Appendix C that such synthetic two-policy preference data satisfies the Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model (Bradley &amp; Terry, 1952), which assumes that preference data (x, y, y ′ ) are constructed according to some unknown scoring function r * as p(y ≻ y ′ |x) = σ (r * (x, y) − r * (x, y ′ )).We show that two-policy preference data adheres to the BT model with
r * 2p (x, y) = log π + (y|x) π − (y|x) .(6)
Further, we show that when using π − as the reference model for PbRL, the optimal policy corresponds to
π * 2p (y|x) ∝ π + (y|x) π − (y|x) 1−β 1 β .(7)
Notable special cases of π * 2p are the geometric mean of π + and π − for β = 2 and simply π + for β = 1.For β &lt; 1, we interpret π * 2p as returning a temperature-sharpened version of π + , but with a penalty on responses assigned high probability under π − (i.e., responses that respond to the user but fail to adhere to the feedback).See Appendix C for visualization of π * 2p with various β in a synthetic setting.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Our experiments are intended to answer several research questions about learning from verbal feedback.We first investigate the question: to what extent does the overgeneralization problem occur for existing methods for learning from verbal feedback, and does C3PO mitigate this effect?Next, we study whether simple modifications to standard approaches to incorporating feedback with prompting or supervised context distillation effectively mitigate overgeneralization.Further, we study whether or not C3PO can learn multiple pieces of feedback as well as the impact of the specific choice of the form of the constraint loss used in C3PO.Before discussing the results of these experiments, we elaborate the datasets, evaluation metrics, and baseline methods used in our experiments.</p>
<p>Datasets.Our feedback dataset is composed of 100 pieces of feedback, where half are written by the authors 4 and half are generated by GPT-4 using the prompt provided in Appendix D. All pieces of feedback are designed to apply only in some contexts; see Table 1 for  Evaluation metrics.Our evaluations are constructed to compare the feedback adherence of the baseline model with the model after learning from the feedback; we evaluate this change in behavior for both in-scope and out-of-scope prompts.For in-scope prompts, our goal is to increase feedback adherence, while for out-of-scope prompts, our goal is to preserve the rate of feedback adherence of the original model (that is, leave the baseline model unchanged).We measure feedback adherence in two ways, heuristically and with GPT-4.For 14 of the human-generated pieces of feedback such as modifying response length or the inclusion of certain words, manually crafted heuristic rules are sufficient 4 One piece of feedback was inspired by a suggestion from social media.to reliably measure which of two responses better adheres to a given piece of feedback.For a prompt x, a model output y, and a baseline response ȳ from the baseline model, the heuristic scoring function produces a feedback score h(x, y, ȳ).This scoring function intuitively scores whether the feedback adherence of the adapted model response is better than, equal to, or worse than the baseline model response.h(x, y, ȳ) takes a value of 1 if y incorporates the feedback and ȳ does not, a value of 0 if both responses adhere to the feedback or neither response adheres to the feedback, and a value of -1 if the baseline response ȳ adheres to the feedback and the adapted model response y does not.In contrast, most pieces of feedback, such as requesting the usage of more metaphors or less aggressive speech, require qualitative evaluation.In these cases, we measure relative feedback adherence using GPT-4.For a prompt x, a model output y, and a baseline response ȳ from the baseline model, we prompt GPT-4 to output a preference score when comparing two responses using the prompt in Appendix D, producing a feedback score g(x, y, ȳ) scaled to be in the range
[−1, 1].
This score measures the extent to which a given response adheres to the feedback better than the baseline response; a score of 1 denotes that the trained model response adheres to the feedback much better than the baseline model and −1 denotes the reverse.We use these metrics (heuristic scoring or GPT-4 scoring) to measure the feedback adherence of the trained model responses compared to the response of the base model for in-scope prompts.The in-scope adherence score for an algorithm on a given piece of feedback is the average of the per-prompt feedback scores (h(x, y, ȳ) if the prompt x is heuristically checkable, g(x, y, ȳ) otherwise) across all in-scope test prompts for that feedback.The overall in-scope adherence score S in is the average of these per-feedback adherence scores over all feedbacks evaluated.2 as a combined metric with equal weighting of the in-scope feedback adherence score S in and one minus the out-of-scope behavior change score S out .A S overall near one indicates that an algorithm effectively adheres to the given feedback better than the baseline model for in-scope prompts while preserving the level of feedback adherence in the baseline model on out-of-scope prompts.</p>
<p>Methods.We compare C3PO against both in-contextlearning-based and fine-tuning methods.For In-Context learning, we provide the baseline model with the user query as well as the feedback and a prompt instructing the model to selectively apply the feedback whenever it is applicable to the given user query.We explore an enhancement of this naive prompting approach, In-Context + CoT using chain-of-thought prompting; this approach is the same as In-Context, except we prompt the model to first reason stepby-step about the applicability of the provided feedback to the given prompt before answering.See Appendix D for the full prompts.Next, we compare against performing supervised context distillation SCD on in-scope prompts, using the revised responses y + generated by C3PO as the  (left).This result suggests that learning separate LoRA parameters for each feedback as it is received and simply adding them together to acquire the model adapted to all feedbacks may be viable.supervision targets.In addition, in order to better control overgeneralization, we evaluate SCD + Negatives, which adds a weighted constraint to the SCD loss over out-ofscope prompts, using the baseline model responses on these prompts as the supervision target.Finally, we evaluate DPO on the preference dataset D in-scope without additional regularization, essentially an ablation of C3PO's regularization losses.For all experiments, we use Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Jiang et al., 2023) and train with Low-Rank Adaptation (Hu et al., 2021) with a rank of 64 and alpha of 128.We use a learning rate of 5e-5 with a cosine decay schedule and a warmup ratio of 0.05 and train for 1 epoch.</p>
<p>Quantifying and mitigating overgeneralization</p>
<p>Our initial results in Figure 2 show that for existing approaches to learning from verbal feedback, successfully incorporating the feedback (large x-axis value) leads to application of that feedback for prompts where the feedback does not apply (large y-axis value).That is, successful adherence to feedback for in-scope prompts comes at a high cost in terms of incorrect adherence to that feedback for out-of-scope prompts, shown by the large slope of the best fit lines.This result also shows that C3PO trades off inscope adherence and out-of-scope behavior preservation much more efficiently, shown by the much smaller slope of the best-fit line.In this section, we study the impact of incorporating verbal feedback in terms of the evaluation metrics S in and S out , measuring out-of-scope behavior change for both generic out-of-scope prompts and more difficult nearscope prompts.The results are shown in Figure 6.C3PO dramatically reduces the behavior change for both general out-of-scope prompts and near-scope prompts, while only slightly reducing feedback adherence for in-scope prompts.</p>
<p>It is natural to wonder whether we can improve the performance of the baseline methods using a similar goal of constraining the behavior change for out-of-scope prompts.We therefore evaluate the modifications of the In-Context and SCD methods, In-Context + CoT and SCD + Negatives, intended to reduce behavior change.The In-Context + CoT method first performs chain-of-thought reasoning to decide whether the feedback is applicable to the given input before responding; the SCD + Negatives baseline mixes in the regularization loss on the D near-scope and D out-of-scope datasets.We report the in-scope feedback adherence and out-of-scope behavior change (averaged over the general out-of-scope and near-scope prompts) in Table 2.While both improvements do substantially reduce the amount of overgeneralization compared to the original version of each method, they come at a substantial cost to in-scope feedback adherence.Therefore, the overall score S overall does not substantially improve for either of these approaches; however, C3PO offers a more efficient tradeoff between in-scope feedback adherence and out-of-scope behavior change, shown by the significantly higher S overall .We therefore conclude that C3PO is an effective way to reduce overgeneralization while generally maintaining in-scope feedback adherence.This claim is supported by the results in Figure 5.</p>
<p>Adhering to multiple feedbacks</p>
<p>So far, our experiments have evaluated the average result of applying a single piece of feedback to a pre-trained model.While a comprehensive evaluation of continual learning of many feedbacks is out of the scope of this work, we perform an initial investigation in this direction to assess the effectiveness of mixing the LoRA parameters learned from separate feedbacks.That is, we perform C3PO separately on two different feedbacks z 1 and z 2 , producing LoRA parameters ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 .Ideally, to produce a model that adheres to both z 1 and z 2 , rather than re-training, we could simply use the mixture of residual parameters ϕ ′ = ϕ 1 +ϕ 2 .In this section, we compare the performance of this approach to combining feedback-adapted models.Figure 7 compares the average feedback adherence and behavior change when applying and evaluating only a single piece of feedback at a time (left) with the average feedback adherence and behavior change on two feedbacks after applying the merged LoRA parameters ϕ ′ (right), averaged across 20 feedbacks (10 pairs).We observe virtually no degradation in in-scope feedback adherence and no change in out-of-scope behavior change.This result is promising for the possibility of enabling rapid, mix-and-match personalization and customization of large language models without re-training.</p>
<p>Choice of C3PO constraint formulation</p>
<p>C3PO constrains the feedback-adapted model by maximizing the likelihood of the baseline model's responses on Figure 8: Replacing C3PO's maximum likelihood constraint on out-of-scope prompts with full knowledge distillation leads to substantially impaired performance on in-scope prompts, suggesting that allowing some subtle changes to the model's conditional distribution for out-of-scope prompts may be beneficial.</p>
<p>out-of-scope prompts during fine-tuning.We hypothesize that performing full knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) for the conditional distributions of the adapted model and baseline model at each time step.That is, performing knowledge distillation on only out-of-scope prompts, where the baseline model is the teacher and the adapted model is the student.Rather than simply maximizing the likelihood of baseline model samples from each out-of-scope prompt, this constraint minimizes the KL-divergence between the baseline model's conditional distribution and the adapted model's conditional distribution, averaged over all timesteps in the baseline model's completion.While this form of constraint has successfully leveraged the 'dark knowledge' represented by the lower-probability logits in the model's output to constrain neural networks in the context of continual learning (Buzzega et al., 2020), we find that this stronger constraint substantially impairs in-scope feedback adherence compared to the maximum likelihood constraint.Alternative approaches to constraining out-of-scope model behavior is an important topic for future work.</p>
<p>Discussion &amp; Future Work</p>
<p>As large language models become more ubiquitous and widely-adopted, the ability to easily customize and personalize their behaviors is increasingly valuable.We therefore have studied the problem of learning from high-level verbal feedback, where a user provides a short piece of written feedback describing a desired change to a language model's behaviors, and an algorithm must update the model to adhere to this feedback when it is appropriate, but preserve the model's behaviors elsewhere.We showed that applying existing methods for fine-tuning language models from feedback demonstrate severe overgeneralization: after incorporating the feedback, they also change model behavior for inputs that are not relevant to the provided feedback.To mitigate this problem, we introduced Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization (C3PO), an algorithm that performs reinforcement learning from verbal feedback (RLVF).C3PO leverages existing language models to generate a set of small fine-tuning datasets that encode both the desired change in behavior described by the feedback and the set of behaviors that should be preserved for inputs unrelated to the feedback.We found that C3PO substantially reduces overgeneralization while still adhering to feedback for relevant inputs.Our experiments raise several important questions for future work.Can we perform continual learning from feedback by simply continually aggregating and mixing adapted model weights?In addition, our ablations of the C3PO constraint loss function suggest that the proper level of 'strictness' when constraining the model update is a non-trivial problem, and better-performing alternatives may exist.Finally, future work may investigate the relationship between the complexity of the feedback and the capabilities of the base model being adapted.</p>
<p>A Sampling Details</p>
<p>We sample from GPT-4 using a temperature of 0.7 and a topp value of 0.7.When sampling from Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, use a temperature of 0.7, a top-p value of 0.7, and top-k value of 50 and a repetition penalty of 1.</p>
<p>B Training Details</p>
<p>To conduct our hyperparameter search, we select 10 arbitrary pieces of feedback from the human-generated feedback dataset.For all methods, we train using LoRA and choose a rank of 64, alpha of 128, and a LoRA dropout of 0.05.We observe that a smaller rank results in decreases inscope feedback adherence while increasing the rank above 64 results in degradation of model completions across all methods.</p>
<p>We train for 1 epoch with a learning rate of 5e−5 using a cosine learning rate schedule and a 0.05 warmup ratio.We ablate learning rates from 1e−7 to 1e−4 and found that below 1e−5, in-scope feedback adherence never increases sufficiently, even when training for multiple epochs.We, thus, picked our learning rate to be larger than this threshold but still small enough avoid a plateauing loss.In addition, we experimented with training for multiple epochs but found that this does not significantly alter the results and sometimes even increases feedback adherence for out-of-scope and near-scope prompts.</p>
<p>To choose λ 1 and λ 2 of the L C3P O objective, we conducted a grid search over the two hyperparameters.We found that it is crucial to set both λ 1 &gt; 0 and λ 2 &gt; 0 and that increasing λ 2 , which is the weight for the SFT loss over the near-scope samples, beyond 0.1 decreases in-scope feedback adherence drastically while only marginally mitigating overgeneralization.Additionally, we found that C3PO is not as sensitive over the choice of λ 1 as long as it is non-zero and chose 0.2 due to the best in-scope to out-of-scope performance trade-off on our evaluation set.</p>
<p>For both C3PO and DPO, we select a β parameter of 0.1.We ablate with values of 0.05, 0.15, and 0.25 and find that a setting of 0.05 results in less in-scope feedback adherence and more overgeneralization while β &gt; 0.1 only reduces in-scope feedback adherence.</p>
<p>C Derivation of Optimal Policy for PbRL on Two-Policy Preference Pairs</p>
<p>In this section, we derive several properties of the PbRL learning procedure used by C3PO.First, we demonstrate that the synthetic preference data generated by C3PO adheres to the commonly-used Bradley-Terry model (Bradley &amp; Terry, 1952) of discrete choice and compute the true reward function implied by the preference data.Using this reward function, we then show that the optimal policy learned by C3PO for in-scope prompts takes the form in Equation ( 7).Finally, we perform a simple empirical validation of this theoretical result in a synthetic bandit problem.</p>
<p>C.1 Deriving the underlying Bradley-Terry scoring function for synthetic two-policy preference data</p>
<p>The Bradley-Terry model of discrete choices states that for a preference over two responses y, y ′ , we have
p(y ≻ y ′ |x, y, y ′ ) = σ (r * (x, y) − r * (x, y ′ ))(8)
for some true scoring function r * .In the case of two-policy preference data, we assume that the preferred response is generated from a policy π + and the dispreferred response is generated by a policy π − .The probability of observing the response pair y, y
′ is p(y, y ′ |x, A) = π + (y|x)π − (y ′ |x) and p(y, y ′ |x, ¬A) = π + (y ′ |x)π − (y|x)
, where A is the event that y was generated by π + and y ′ from π − (and therefore y ≻ y ′ by the definition of our data-generating process).By Bayes' Rule, the probability of A (that y was generated by π + and y ′ by π − ) is
p(A|x, y, y ′ ) = p(y ≻ y ′ |x, y, y ′ ) = π + (y|x)π − (y ′ |x) π + (y|x)π − (y ′ |x) + π + (y ′ |x)π − (y|x) .(9)
We now set the RHS of Equation ( 8) equal to the RHS of Equation ( 9) and show that a Bradley-Terry scoring function exists.We have:
σ (r * (x, y) − r * (x, y ′ )) = π + (y|x)π − (y ′ |x) π + (y|x)π − (y ′ |x) + π + (y ′ |x)π − (y|x) .(10)
Applying the transformation log z 1−z to both sides, we have
r * (x, y) − r * (x, y ′ ) = log π + (y|x) π − (y|x) − log π + (y ′ |x) π − (y ′ |x) ,(11)
implying the Bradley-Terry scoring function
r * (x, ȳ) = log π + (ȳ|x) π − (ȳ|x) + C(x)(12)
for some value C(x) that is constant with respect to y.Therefore, synthetic two-policy preference data is Bradley-Terry, with the above scoring function.</p>
<p>C.2 Deriving the optimal policy for C3PO for in-scope prompts</p>
<p>The optimal policy for the KL-regularized reinforcement learning objective optimized by DPO is shown in prior work Figure 9: Empirical demonstration of the result of C3PO's optimal policy on in-scope prompts.For β = 1, the optimal policy recovers π + ; for smaller beta, the optimal policy amplifies the delta between π + and π − .Note that the reward learned with the Bradley-Terry loss perfectly recovers the theoretically optimal reward in Equation ( 12).(Peters &amp; Schaal, 2007;Peng et al., 2019;Rafailov et al., 2023) to be
π * (y|x) = 1 Z(x) π ref (y|x) exp 1 β r(x, y) .(13)
Substituting the optimal reward function in Equation ( 12), assuming C(x) = 0 as this constant term does not affect the optimal policy, we have
π * (y|x) = 1 Z(x) π ref (y|x) exp 1 β log π + (y|x) π − (y|x) (14) = 1 Z(x) π ref (y|x) π + (y|x) π − (y|x) 1 β . (15)
Assuming that
π ref = π − gives π * (y|x) = 1 Z(x) π − (y|x) π + (y|x) 1 β π − (y|x) 1 β (16) = 1 Z(x) 1 π − (y|x) − β β π + (y|x) 1 β π − (y|x) 1 β (17) ∝ π + (y|x) π − (y|x) 1−β 1 β ,(18)
which is the optimal policy expression given in Equation (7).</p>
<p>C.3 Empirically validating the in-scope C3PO policy in a synthetic setting</p>
<p>We validate the theoretical results in the previous subsections in a simple bandit setting with 100 possible actions.We define the preferred policy π + as π + (i) ∝ exp (i−70) 2 1000 and similarly define π − as the shifted policy π − (i) ∝ exp (i−40) 2 1000</p>
<p>. We generate 1e8 preference pairs (y + , y − ), where y + ∼ π + (•) and similarly for y − .We fit a reward function to this preference data using the Bradley-Terry loss, using 400 steps of gradient descent with the Adam optimizer (Kingma &amp; Ba, 2015) with learning rate 1.0, initializing the reward function to the zero vector.</p>
<p>The results are shown in Appendix C.3.We find that the recovered reward function is exactly the Bradley-Terry scoring function predicted by Equation ( 12), and that the special cases predicted by Equation ( 7) hold (e.g., with β = 1, we have simply π * = π + ).With β &lt; 1, we have the intuitive behavior of amplifying the delta between π + and π − .</p>

<p>D.8 Feedback Generation Prompt -Style</p>
<p>You are a helpful assistant that always closely follows instructions.Your overall task is to generate feedback which a user gives to a LLM to improve its responses.The user is asking the LLM for responses and has found something they would like the LLM to improve upon.This means the feedback should be something a LLM would not already follow well.For example, feedback to "write work emails more politely" is NOT GOOD because LLMs already generate very polite work emails.The feedback should target something the LLM can improve on.Assume this LLM only takes text as input and outputs only text.</p>
<p>Your task is to generate 100 sets of effects, domain, and feedbacks based on the following instructions: 1. Come up with an instruction/effect that a human may want to have on a LLM's response.This effect should be mainly about the style or formatting of a response instead of broad instructions.The effect should not focus on content or tone.2. Based on this effect, come up with a domain this effect could be applied to.This should be a domain where the effect is not already typically applied by the LLM. 3. Combine the effect and domain to create a piece of feedback.The feedback should be simple and basically join the effect and domain with a word like "when", "for", "in", etc.</p>
<p>Below are a few examples: Example 1: { "effect"="use London gangster vernacular", "domain": "sending texts to my friend Peter", "feedback": "Use London gangster vernacular when texting my friend Peter" } Example 2: { "effect"="be more detailed", "domain": "writing an email to my PI Anna", " feedback": "Be more detailed in your emails to my PI Anna" } Example 3: { "effect"="be more concise", "domain": "writing an email to my boss Jared", " feedback": "Be more concise when emailing my boss Jared" } Example 4: { "effect"="end emails with "Best,\nMoritz"", "domain": "writing work emails", "feedback": "End work emails with "Best,\nMoritz"" } Example 5: { "effect"="use German", "domain": "writing emails to my colleague Max", " feedback": "Use German when emailing my colleague Max" } Be creative and think out of the box.Do not repeat feedback, effects, or domains.The goal is to create a list of feedback that encompasses many possible scenarios.Output ONLY the feedback, effect, and domain in structured json format.</p>

Figure 1: We consider the problem of leveraging high-level, verbal feedback (left) to refine model behaviors (center).Prior approaches often struggle to appropriately update the model, leading to either failure to adhere to the feedback or overgeneralization (right).</p>
<p>Figure 2 :

Figure2: C3PO mitigates the overgeneralization problem when learning from high-level feedback.For existing approaches for incorporating high-level feedback, high feedback adherence on inscope prompts (x axis) strongly predicts a large change in behavior for out-of-scope prompts (y axis), which is undesirable.In contrast, our approach C3PO decreases the rate at which out-of-scope behavior is affected as in-scope feedback adherence improves.Lines of best fit are computed with linear orthogonal regression.</p>
<p>Data structures in various languages; Statistical computing in different environments In-scope prompts Write a basic Queue class in Python.How can I implement backprop in Python?Out-of-scope prompts When did the Haitian revolution begin?Can you explain relativity in a paragraph?Near-scope prompts What good C++ libraries are there for trees?Is Python or Julia more popular for NLP?</p>

Figure 3: C3PO Data Generation Scheme.Given human feedback, C3PO begins by generating a set of categories of prompts where the feedback may be relevant using GPT-4.GPT-4 then generates in-scope prompts x in-scope i</p>
<p>Figure 4 :

Figure 4: C3PO Fine-Tuning Objective.C3PO facilitates feedback adherence for relevant prompts by fine-tuning with DPO on the generated in-scope data while minimizing overgeneralization through SFT losses on the generated out-of-scope and near-scope data, which regularizes model behavior towards the original model for feedback-irrelevant prompts.</p>

Figure 5: Sample responses from C3PO and each baseline for an in-scope and out-of-scope prompt.Only C3PO correctly adheres to the feedback for the in-scope input and ignores the feedback for the out-of-scope input.</p>
<p>examples.For C3PO and the SCD + Negatives baseline, the datasets D near-scope and D out-of-scope , each containing out-ofscope prompts and corresponding baseline model completions used for regularization, are sampled according to the C3PO procedure in Section 4. For each piece of feedback, |D near-scope | = |D out-of-scope | = 960.We sample the prompts for D out-of-scope from the Open Instruction Generalist (OIG) Dataset (LAION, 2023) which contains a mix of diverse prompts ranging from math to QA and chat.Within each of the 32 categories of prompts, we randomly select 80% to be used for training and validation and the remainder are used for testing.</p>

Figure 6: Contextualized Critiques with Constrained Preference Optimization substantially reduces overgeneralization (applying the given feedback to prompts where it is not actually relevant) with only minor reduction in adherence to feedback for prompts where the feedback is relevant.</p>
<p>For out-of-scope prompts, our goal is to measure changes in the model's behavior as a result of incorporating the feedback.Because the model's behavior is most likely to change along the dimension of the feedback, we measure model behavior change on out-of-scope as the average change in the rate we instead measure the absolute change in feedback adherence since over this domain, our objective is to leave the model behavior unchanged.To compute the out-of-scope behavior change score for an algorithm on a given piece of feedback, we average the absolute value of the feedback scores (again, h(x, y, ȳ) if x is a heuristically checkable prompt, g(x, y, ȳ) otherwise).That is, the average change in feedback adherence over the set of out-ofscope test prompts.The overall behavior change score S out is the average of these per-feedback behavior change scores over all feedbacks evaluated.Apart from these individual metrics, we define S overall =Sin+(1−Sout)</p>
<p>Figure 7 :

Figure7: Mixing the LoRA weights that C3PO learns for two different pieces of feedback (right) provides virtually the same level of in-scope feedback adherence and out-of-scope behavior change as applying and evaluating each feedback independently (left).This result suggests that learning separate LoRA parameters for each feedback as it is received and simply adding them together to acquire the model adapted to all feedbacks may be viable.</p>

Develop the chatbot: Once the data has been collected, the AI technology chosen, and the conversation flow designed, the chatbot can be developed.This involves writing the code, integrating the AI algorithms, and building the user interface.6. Test and refine the chatbot: After the chatbot has been developed, it's essential to test it thoroughly and refine it based on user feedback.This involves identifying and addressing any bugs or issues, improving the conversation flow, and enhancing the user experience.7. Deploy and monitor the chatbot: Once the chatbot has been tested and refined, it can be deployed on various platforms, such as websites, mobile apps, or messaging platforms.It' s essential to monitor the chatbot's performance regularly and make any necessary updates or improvements based on user feedback and data analysis.In conclusion, developing an AI chatbot to help patients navigate their health insurance options involves defining the scope and objectives, collecting and analyzing data, choosing the right AI technology, designing the conversation flow, developing the chatbot, testing and refining it, and deploying and monitoring it.This solution can significantly improve the patient experience by making it easier for them to understand their health insurance coverage and manage their medical expenses.• For specific Python coding questions (about syntax, popular library use etc.), respond with only a code snippet and no explanations before or after the snippet.G Full List of
