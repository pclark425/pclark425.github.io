                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Pathology of subcortical visual centres in relation to cortical degeneration in Alzheimer's disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Subcortical visual centres such as the lateral geniculate nucleus, the lateral inferior pulvinar and the superior colliculus, together with the primary visual cortex and its adjacent white matter, were studied in 12 Alzheimer brains and five age‐matched controls. The periodic acid methenamine technique was used for the demonstration of senile plaques and the Gallyas technique for neuro‐fibrillary tangles and neuritic threads in the neuropil. In the lateral geniculate nucleus and inferior pulvinar, the presence of periodic acid methenamine‐positive senile plaques was observed in variable numbers in all Alzheimer cases. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, senile plaques were encountered more often in parvocellular than in magnocellular layers, in the interlaminar zones, in the optic radiation and in the adjacent pre‐geniculate nucleus. Gallyas staining did not reveal any neuro‐fibrillary tangles. neuritic threads or neuritic plaques, meaning that in this thalamic region there are mainly amyloid deposits without neuritic degeneration. In the superior colliculus both amyloid and neuritic plaques, as well as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads were encountered in the superficial and deep layers. In the primary visual cortex, all types of senile plaques were observed as well as a rather high number of neurofibrillary lesions in pyramidal neurons, mainly in layers 5 and 6, but also in several types of non‐pyramidal neurons. In the underlying white matter there was a morphologically heterogeneous population of neurofibrillary tangle‐bearing neurons and a considerable number of threads representing degenerating axons, suggesting that degeneration could follow cortico‐subcortical connections. These data demonstrate that lesions in the primary visual structures and pathways are more prevalent than previously observed and could partly explain the visual disturbances in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Subcortical visual centres such as the lateral geniculate nucleus, the lateral inferior pulvinar and the superior colliculus, together with the primary visual cortex and its adjacent white matter, were studied in 1 2 Alzheimer brains and five age-matched controls. The periodic acid methenamine technique was used for the demonstration of senile plaques and the Gallyas technique for neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads in the neuropil. In the lateral geniculate nucleus and inferior pulvinar. the presence of periodic acid methenamine-positive senile plaques was observed in variable numbers in all Alzheimer cases. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, senile plaques were encountered more often in parvocellular than in magnocellular layers, in the interlaminar zones, in the optic radiation and in the adjacent pre-geniculate nucleus. Gallyas staining did not reveal any neurofibrillary tangles. neuritic threads or neuritic plaques, meaning that in this thalamic region there are mainly amyloid deposits without neuritic degeneration. In the superior colliculus both amyloid and neuritic plaques, as well as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads were encountered in the superficial and deep layers. In the primary visual cortex, all types of senile plaques were observed as well as a rather high number of neurofibrillary lesions in pyramidal neurons, mainly in layers 5 and 6, but also in several types of non-pyramidal neurons. In the underlying white matter there was a morphologically heterogeneous population of neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons and a considerable number of threads representing degenerating axons. suggesting that degeneration could follow corticosubcortical connections. These data demonstrate that lesions in the primary visual structures and pathways are more prevalent than previously observed and could partly explain the visual disturbances in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>Keywords: Alzheimer's disease, lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar, superior colliculus. visual cortex, white matter, neurofibrillary degeneration. senile plaques introduction There is a growing body of evidence that Alzheimer's disease does not spare the visual cortex [ 2 4 . 11, 33, 421, affecting even more severely a subset of cases with particular visual deficits [30-32. 411. Cortical degeneration in Alzheimer's disease was thought to begin'in the entorhinal and/or subicular regions and proceed in a feedback direction along the cortico-cortical connections Correspondence: Dr G. Leuba 33, 541. It would reach the primary after the association visual cortex, only in the last stages of the disease [8]. Senile plaques could thus be in the termination zones of the axons of the large pyramidal neurons involved in neurofibrillary degeneration [49, 541. In the primary area 17, we have found neurofibrillary tangles in layers 5 and 6 neurons projecting to subcortical visual centres, but also scattered in its underlying white matter. Together with the presence of senile plaques in the lateral geniculate nucleus, this suggested that degeneration could spread even further, descending retrogradely along the cortico-geniculate axons [40]. On Cortical degeneration could then proceed anterogradely from the primary towards the association visual areas [ 2 2 ] . Finally, cases presenting with major visual impairment have shown a high degree of occipital atrophy and large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the visual areas [5,31,411, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease could damage preferentially the visual system in a subgroup of patients. We have demonstrated that the amount of neuronal loss was much higher than the degree of neurofibrillary tangle formation in both primary and association visual areas, suggesting that two mechanisms of degeneration could coexist in the visual system, one being related to neurofibrillary tangles and the other unrelated to neurofibrillary tangles [39]. To further investigate the relationships between cortical and subcortical degeneration, and thus the possible patterns of functional degeneration, we compare Alzheimer-type changes in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex with those in the lateral inferior pulvinar, visual association thalamic nucleus, and in the visuo-motor superior colliculus.</p>
<p>Materials and methods</p>
<p>The brains of 12 autopsied Alzheimer's disease patients (Table l), and five controls were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (post-mortem delay 6-24 h). All patients had been hospitalized in the University Psychogeriatrics Hospital and the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (based on DSM III-R criteria) was confirmed by neuropathological examination. One to 1.5 cm thick blocks of the primary visual area 17 were dissected out from the middle of the calcarine sulcus. from the thalamic region containing the lateral geniculate nucleus and the lateral inferior pulvinar, and from the mesencephalon containing the superior colliculus. Frozen 50-60 pm sections were cut in a frontal plane. Periodic acid methenamine [34] and Campbell-Switzer [lS] staining was used for the demonstration of senile plaques, and Gallyas silver iodide [25] and modi6ed Palmgren [47] for the demonstration of neurofibrillary tangles, dystrophic neurites in senile plaques and threads. As periodic acid methenamine and Gallyas techniques gave the best results, they were used for the semi-quantitative study. In most sections, structures were clearly identifiable, but cresyl violet staining was used on alternate sections for confirmation. Quantitative estimation of pathological hal1.marks was performed in the lateral geniculate nucleus, lateral inferior pulvinar and superior colliculus by characterizing the number of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles with graded numbers between 0 and 3 (see legend of Table 1). Statistical analysis of correlation was performed by computing and testing for significance Pearson coefficients for senile plaques between the different structures (see Table 2 ) . including numbers already obtained in the primary visual cortex using the same histological methods [39].</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Distribution of pathological hallmarks in subcortical visual centres</p>
<p>The lnterd geru'culute riucleus is a conical laminated structure situated in the posterior part of the thalamus and receiving the vast majority of retinal afferents. It is subdividedfrom ventral hilum to dorsal capsuleinto magnocellular (layers 1-2) and parvocellular (layers [3][4][5][6] regions, layers 1. 4. 6 receiving a contralateral input and layers 2 , 3 . 5 an ipsilateral input. In periodic acid methenamine stained sections of Alzheimer brains, we observed an irregular distribution of senile plaques in both magno and parvocellular regions (Figure l a x ) . within the laminar and interlaminar zones (Figure 1b.d).</p>
<p>Senile plaques in the laminae are often encountered at the laminar border, closer to the adjacent interlaminar zones and also at the outer border of lamina 6. in close apposition to the geniculate capsule, as well as scattered in the optic radiation at the level of the geniculate capsule itself (Figure lc,e). In the most ventral lamina S and in the adjacent white matter of the hilurn. senile plaques occur only rarely. In addition, we observed senile plaques in the pre-geniculate nucleus, in close vicinity to the lateral geniculate nucleus capsule (Figure 1e.f).</p>
<p>Semi-quantitative analysis indicates that the number of senile plaques varies from one case to another (Table 1) but in all cases the deposition of senile plaques is higher in the parvocellular than in the magnocellular regions. The Campbell technique also reveals the presence of senile plaques while Gallyas technique shows negative results. Palmgren and Gallyas staining in both lateral geniculate nucleus and pre-geniculate nucleus do not reveal any neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons.</p>
<p>The pulvinar represents a thalamic association nucleus, situated dorsal to the lateral geniculate nucleus. It is subdivided into different parts and we concentrated on the lateral inferior pulvinar. which is more specifically visually related. In all the Alzheimer cases, we observed the presence of periodic acid methenamine-positive senile plaques, distributed irregularly across the nucleus as well as in the adjacent fibre tract, the pulvinar capsule ( Figure  2a,b). In Figure 2a. the medial geniculate nucleus also exhibits periodic acid methenamine-positive plaques. In the lateral inferior pulvinar, the semi-quantitative analysis indicates large variations between cases. but generally we observed a similar or even a larger number of senile plaques in the lateral inferior pulvinar than in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the same case ( Table 1). The  Gallyas technique did not reveal any neuritic plaques or neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons in this structure.</p>
<p>In both the lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral inferior pulvinar, the senile plaques revealed by the periodic acid methenamine technique often present without a clear border or are better defined with a dark central core. A few plaques contain a dark periodic acid methenamine-positive neuron (Inset of Figure 2b. upper) or an accumulation of dark and small round glial nuclei (Inset of Figure 2b. lower).</p>
<p>The superior colliculus is a laminated structure subdivided into stratum griseum superficiale. medium and profimdum, situated in the upper dorsal part of the tectum. It receives visual, auditory and somatosensory stimuli and is involved in visuo-motor functions. Senile plaques revealed by the periodic acid methenamine technique are distributed irregularly from superficial to deep layers, without any preferential location (Figure  3a,b). Different types of plaque mlth or without a dark central core are also present. I n contrast to the thalamic structures, the superior colIicuIus exhibits both neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as revealed by the Gallyas technique (Figure 3c to g). Degenerating neurons bearing neurofibrillary tangles are pyramidal-like in shape, with a long apical dendrite directed towards the tectal surface (Figure 3c,d) or towards the deep layers (Figure 3e). Others are multipolar and bipolar without any preferential orientation (Figure 3g). Numerous neuropil threads are present around neuritic plaques ( Figure 30. In a few cases. we even observed periodic acid methenamine positive senile plaques surrounded by neuritic threads and neurofibrillary tangle-bearing neurons resembling those revealed by the Gallyas technique. The semi-quantitative analysis demonstrates again large variations from one case to another ( Table 1). We did not find any significant correlation between the numbers of senile plaques in the lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and superior colliculus ( Table 2).</p>
<p>Area 17 and underlying white matter</p>
<p>Primary area 17 shows in most cases large numbers of periodic acid methenamine-positive senile plaques distributed irregularly across the grey matter (Figure 4a). at the limit of layer 6 with the underlying white matter (Figure 4c) as well as deep in the white matter ( Figure  4e). In the white matter. senile plaques are present as periodic acid methenamine-positive deposits, without a sharp border but filled with glial nuclei. In our series of Alzheimer cases, we counted the number of senile plaques per unit of volume [39]. There were large variations between cases, but we now show that there is no significant statistical correlation between the number of plaques in the visual cortex and that in subcortical visual structures ( Table 2 ) . In some cases, the Gallyas technique revealed numerous neurofibrillary tangles and threads, localized throughout the cortical plate but mostly in layers 5-6 ( Figure 4b,d). In the white matter, many Gallyas positive axons were seen following an oblique course just beneath layer 6 (Figure 4f) and running parallel to the main axonal stream more deeply in the white matter. The most frequent cells undergoing neurofibrillary degeneration are pyramidal neurons of layers 2-6. These include small, medium and large pyramidal cells whose apical dendrites run towards the pial surface, as well as less common inverted pyramidal cells in layers 3 and 6 with apical dendrites directed towards the deeper layers or the underlying white matter. Bipolar neurons showing neurofibrillary degeneration are scattered in layers 2-6, with cell bodies elongated in the direction of their emerging stem dendrites perpendicular to the pial surface, or sometimes orientated parallel to t h e pial surface, confined to the base of layers 3C and 6. Multipolar neurons with round or polygonal shaped cell bodies. from which three to five stem dendrites emanate in various directions, are found in all layers except layer 1 (inset of Figure 4d). Several interstitial neurons, widely scattered within the underlying white matter. varying greatly in their size, form and orientation, also exhibit neurofibrillary degeneration. Most of them are bipolar, with two stem dendrites emanating. from the opposite poles and orientated parallel to the white matter axons (inset of Figure 40.</p>
<p>Small multipolar cells constitute the second most frequently degenerating cell type in the white matter, with three or more stem dendrites running parallel, perpendicular or oblique to the white matter axons.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Pathological hallmarks in subcortical visual structures Our study revealed the presence of senile plaques in several subcortical nuclei belonging to the visual system in Alzheimer's disease patients without evident visual deficits, but with a substantial number of senile plaques in the primary visual area 1 7 [39]. None of the controls had senile plaques in the subcortical visual centres although they had some in area 1 7 [39]. In the thalamic region, both in the lateral geniculate nucleus, pregeniculate nucleus (available in some cases) and lateral inferior pulvinar. the plaques were demonstrated with periodic acid methenamine [34] and Campbell [15] techniques but not with Gallyas [25] or modified Palmgren [47]. Moreover, Gallyas did not reveal any neurofibrillary tangles or threads. On the contrary, the superior colliculus contained senile plaques revealed both by periodic acid methenamine and Gallyas as well as Gallyas positive neurofibrillary tangles and threads. The number of senile plaques has been shown to differ according to fixation and staining procedures [ 2 3 . 27, 651. It is now generally accepted that there are four categories of plaques: diffuse, containing amorphous non-neuritic amyloid material, primitive containing amyloid fibrils and aggregation of neuritic fibres without a (0 1995 Blackwell Science Ltd. Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiologg. 21. [410][411][412][413][414][415][416][417][418][419][420][421][422] core. classical with neuritic fibres and a compact arnyloid core and finally compact cored deposits [27]. The periodic acid methenamine technique demonstrates as many senile plaques as the p immunostaining, revealing mainly the p amyloid component of the difiuse, primitive and classical plaques [ 2 3 , 34, 53, 661. The Gallyas method is as sensitive as anti-tau antibodies for the recognition of neurofibrillary lesions such as the neuritic component of primitive and classical plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and threads [ 3 5 . 531. In our cases, the lateral geniculate nucleus, pre-geniculate nucleus and lateral inferior pulvinar contain mainly amyloid deposits without associated neuritic degeneration, while the superior colliculus contains both amyloid and neuritic changes.</p>
<p>The relationship between amyloid and neuritic changes in Alzheimer's disease is still a matter of discussion. A proportion of purely amyloid or Wuse plaques probably never transforms into primitive or classical plaques [12]. This could depend on the vulnerability of different brain regions to amyloid deposits, inducing or not neuritic degeneration [14]. In the cerebellum only pre-amyloid deposits have been shown [lo. 431. without any damage to the Purkinje cell dendrites [43]. However, in the thalamic region diffuse pre-amyloid deposits, primitive and classical plaques without neuritic degeneration, as well as neurofibrillary changes have been described in several nuclei [9,44]. In the lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral inferior pulvinar of our cases, diffuse deposits are observed, as well as primitive or classical plaques, but without neuritic degeneration. This means that the transformation from diffuse to classical senile plaques may not necessarily be associated with the presence of neuritic changes in the visual thalamus, for both relay (lateral geniculate nucleus) and association (lateral inferior pulvinar) parts. Interestingly, there are some plaques with a clear neuron in the centre, or with an accumulation of dark methenamine-positive glial nuclei, indicating that it could be the 6rst 'nest' of the plaque. On the other hand, the presence of neuritic plaques and threads, as well as that of neurofibrillary tangles has been reported in the pulvinar of Alzheimer patients [ 3 81. In the superior colliculus. there are both amyloid and neuritic plaques, together with the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and threads and this situation is very similar, although quantitatively less important, to the one in the visual cortex. Similar changes have been described both in the inferior and superior colliculus [ 13, 591. Relay and association thalamic nuclei, sending mainly ascending and local projections, are thus susceptible to different kinds of amyloid deposits. They seem to be less vulnerable to neurofibrillary and neuritic degeneration than structures sending long descending projections to the brain stem and spinal cord. Specifically, these are pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex, projecting to other cortical areas or towards subcortical structures which are involved in neurofibrillary degeneration [33,421 and senile plaques with a neuritic component certainly include broken pieces of these neurons. In the superior colliculus. neurons involved in neurofibrillary degeneration are also of the pyramidal-like and multipolar types of projection neurons. This particular vulnerability of pyramidal-like neurons to neurofibrillary degeneration does not exclude that other types of neurons, such as ascending relay or interneurons, could degenerate without neurofibrillary tangles. The presence of dark neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus and lateral inferior pulvinar plaques, as well as the observation of a probable cellular breakdown material in the vicinity of the plaque favours this hypothesis. Recent in vitro data indicate that neurons could also die by an apoptotic mechanism in Alzheimer's disease [l8]. On the other hand, the variability in neurofibrillary degeneration may just reflect a different neuropathological staging of Alzheimer-related changes [8]. In this case, a relay nucleus like the lateral geniculate nucleus would be in a later phase of degeneration than the superior colliculus and of course than the visual cortex. However, there is no significant correlation between the numbers </p>
<p>Anatomical visual connections in AD</p>
<p>Some authors have suggested that cortical degeneration could proceed along the feedback connections from the association areas towards the primary areas [22,33,541 and that senile plaques would form in the termination zone of degenerating axons from neurofibrillary tanglebearing pyramidal neurons [49, 541. We suggest that degeneration may even spread further along the corticosubcortical connections towards the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus. There are no neurofibrillary tangles in the retina [6. 291, which provides its major input to the lateral geniculate nucleus and a small input to the pre-geniculate nucleus. The other major input to the lateral geniculate nucleus originates in layer 6 pyramidal cells of the primary visual area 17, which are severely damaged by neurofibrillary degeneration, less in the visual association cortex and colliculus whose projections back to the lateral geniculate nucleus are less numerous in primates [16,28,481. Cortico-geniculate axons are distributed to all parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus, with some emphasis on interlaminar zones, while extrastriate and collicular inputs seem to concentrate in the interlaminar zones [16, 281. Similarly, the distribution of senile plaques involves all laminar and interlaminar parts of the lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as the geniculate capsule and pre-geniculate nucleus. The back projection from the cortex to the superior colliculus originates in layer 5 pyramidal neurons of area 17, which are also most severely damaged by neurofibrillary degeneration, reaching the superficial visual layers involved in senile plaque formation. Degeneration could thus follow the cortico-geniculate and cortico-tectal connections. The presence of scattered senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and threads in the white matter underlying area 1 7 favours this hypothesis. taking into account the fact that the axonal population is probably involved in the neurofibrillary degenerative process [SO,601. The presence of scattered neurofibrillary tangles in pyramidal-like projection neurons of the superior colliculus could in turn produce senile plaques in their projection territories, including the lateral geniculate nucleus, pulvinar and even the oculo-motor nuclei of the brain stem where we observed scattered senile plaques in two of the available cases.</p>
<p>In area 17, we observed neurofibrillary tangles not only in the pyramidal neurons from layers 3, 5 and 6 but also in smaller neurons from all layers, mostly bipolar and sometimes multipolar, being probably interneurons or even recipient neurons of the thalamo-cortical projections in layer 4. Neurofibrillary tangles have been described in 4% of the parvalbumin-immunoreactive interneurons in the cerebral cortex [36], but de, oeneration of their extensive connections within area 1 7 itself could explain the rather random distribution of plaques in this area. The latter is more difficult to understand if plaques only occur at the termination of degenerating feedback connections from area 18 to 17, mostly situated in superficial layers. On the other hand, the discrep ancy between the number of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal death in the primary visual cortex [39] suggests that another mechanism of neuronal de, aeneration may occur. Close association between PIA4 protein [52] or P/A4 precursor [67] and neuronal cell bodies or dendrites has been observed, suggesting that neuronal membrane degeneration could be the source of P/A4 in Alzheimer's disease. Since neuronaI degeneration without neurofibrillary tangles in the retina [6] or optic nerve degeneration [29. 561 has been observed in Alzheimer patients, a partial deafferentation from the periphery cannot be ruled out at present. However, loss of retinal ganglion cells in Alzheimer's disease has not been conk e d [21]. Cortical deafferentation could also start in the lateral geniculate nucleus itself. Our preliminary data indicate a decrease of parvalbumin-positive axonal and dendritic terminals in layer four of area 17, together with a lack of parvalbumin-positive fibres both in the capsule of the lateral geniculate nucleus and in the white matter underlying area 17, suggesting that some thalamo-cortical connections could be damaged in Alzheimer's disease [38].</p>
<p>Correlations with visual deficits in AD patients</p>
<p>Recent studies indicate several types of visual deficits in Alzheimer's disease patients, including deficits in contrast sensitivity and stereoacuity, impairments in colour and form recognition [ i , 19, 30, [7. 19, 45, 551, but the alternative hypothesis of deafferentation of the primary visual cortex was proposed as well 137, 56. 61, 641. Our data, both in the primary visual. cortex and in the visual thalamus and colliculus, suggest that damage to these structures clearly participates in the visual deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Lesions in the visual layers of the superior colliculus. for instance. could well contribute to the deficits in eye movements [24. 51. 57. 681. However, the great variability between cases is in favour of the existence of subgroups of patients with a specific visual symptomatology. whose anatomical correlates should be studied in greater detail.</p>
