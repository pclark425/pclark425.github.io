                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Associations between vascular function and tau PET are associated with global cognition and amyloid</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Tau pathology and vascular dysfunction are important contributors to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), but vascular-tau associations and their effects on cognition are poorly understood. We investigated these associations in male and female humans by conducting voxelwise comparisons between cerebral blood flow (CBF) and tau positron emission tomography (PET) images in independent discovery (cognitively normal (CN): 19; mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-risk: 43; MCI: 6) and replication (CN: 73; MCI:45; AD: 20) cohorts. In a subgroup, we assessed relationships between tau and soluble platelet-derived growth factor beta (sPDGFRβ), a CSF marker of pericyte injury. We tested whether CBF/sPDGFRβ-tau relationships differed based on Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) global cognition performance, or based on amyloid burden. Mediation analyses assessed relationships between CBF/sPDGFRβ, tau, and cognition.Negative CBF-tau correlations were observed predominantly in temporal-parietal regions. In the replication cohort, early negative CBF-tau correlations increased in spatial extent and in strength of correlation with increased disease severity. Stronger CBF- and sPDGFRβ-tau correlations were observed in participants with greater amyloid burden and lower MoCA scores. Importantly, when stratifying by amyloid status, stronger CBF-tau relationships in individuals with lower MoCA scores were driven by amyloid-positive participants. Tau PET was a significant mediator CBF/sPDGFRβ-MoCA relationships in numerous regions.Our results demonstrate vascular-tau associations across the AD spectrum and suggest that early vascular-tau associations are exacerbated in the presence of amyloid, consistent with a two-hit model of AD on cognition. Combination treatments targeting vascular health, as well as amyloid-β and tau levels, may preserve cognitive function more effectively than single-target therapies.SIGNIFICANCEEmerging evidence demonstrates a role for vascular dysfunction as a significant contributor to Alzheimer's pathophysiology. However, associations between vascular dysfunction and tau pathology, and their effects on cognition remain poorly understood. Multimodal neuroimaging data from two independent cohorts were analyzed to provide novel in vivo evidence of associations between cerebral blood flow (CBF), an MRI measure of vascular health, and tau pathology using PET. CBF-tau associations were related to cognition and driven in part by amyloid burden. Soluble platelet-derived growth factor beta (sPDGFRβ), an independent CSF vascular biomarker, confirmed vascular-tau associations in a subgroup analysis. These results suggest that combination treatments targeting vascular health, amyloid-β, and tau levels, may more effectively preserve cognitive function than single-target therapies.</p>

<p>to abnormal angiogenesis (Bennett et al., 2018). Even less is known about the association 140 between tau and vascular health in humans. One recent study indicated that heightened vascular 141 risk factors may influence subsequent elevations in tau (Rabin et al., 2019), but no studies to date 142 have directly investigated the regional association between tau levels and cerebral blood flow or 143 CSF biomarkers of vascular dysfunction in vivo. In order to elucidate interactions between vascular dysfunction and pathological tau 163 accumulation, we conducted a human study comparing two independent markers of vascular 164 health and tau levels in males and females using a discovery and replication design to ensure that 165 the study findings were replicable and robust. 166</p>
<p>All data in the discovery cohort (n=68) were collected at the University of Southern 167</p>
<p>California, which included pooled data from two ongoing research initiatives. Each participant 168 received PET scans with [ 18 F] flortaucipir (FTP) to measure tau and Neuraceq (florbetaben F 18 169 injection (FBB)) to measure amyloid-, and a 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling 170 (pCASL) MRI scan to measure CBF. All scans were conducted on the same PET and MRI 171 scanners, respectively. A subset of the USC discovery cohort underwent lumbar punctures to 172 measure CSF sPGFR (n=19). sPGFR , a molecule released from damaged pericytes that was 173 recently shown to predict early cognitive decline, even before traditional AD markers (Nation et 174 al., 2019). 175</p>
<p>Replication data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 176 (ADNI) phase 3. The replication dataset consisted of ADNI participant demographics, MRI and 177 PET imaging, and cognitive data (n=138). Imaging data were selected to match the discovery 178 cohort data as closely as possible with regard to the FTP PET tracer and ASL MRI sequences. 179</p>
<p>Only ADNI participants with both a 3D pCASL and an FTP PET scan collected within a 12 180 month window (mean 43.5±53 days apart) were included in the replication cohort. All ADNI 181 participants were also required to have a PET scan with either FBB (n=60) or [ 18  All data processing was performed using an automated in-house processing pipeline as 268 detailed below. image. For ADNI data, CBF quantification was performed with the static perfusion-weighted and 282 M0 images available through ADNI, using the same formula as above. For each participant, the 283 M0 image was coregistered to the T1w image, moved into template space, and smoothed with a 284 5mm Gaussian kernel. To obtain a global gray matter CBF measure, T1w images were 285 segmented with SPM12 to produce probabilistic tissue maps. The gray matter probabilistic map 286 was thresholded at 60% to reduce partial volume effects (PVE) and resampled to the resolution 287 of the CBF image, and average gray matter CBF was extracted in native CBF space. Discovery 288 CBF data were corrected for PVE assuming 2.5 times greater perfusion in gray matter compared 289 to white matter (Johnson et al., 2005). To control for intersubject variability in CBF related to 290 potential confounding factors (e.g. caffeine intake, anxiety, movement), parametric CBF images consisted of frontal, parietal, lateral temporal, and cingulate cortices (Landau and Jagust, 2015). 312 A modified Level 3 calibration was used to convert cortical FBB and FBP uptake to centiloids 313 (CL) using the formulas given by ADNI (see below). An amyloid CL value of 19 was used as the 314 cut-off for amyloid positivity, as the rate of change in amyloid PET has been shown to reliably 315 increase at this level (Jack et al., 2017). 316 317</p>
<p>Amyloid PET centiloid calibration (level 3):</p>
<p>We performed a modified level 3 CL 318 calibration to verify agreement between a previously validated CL processing method (ADNI, 319 which uses SPM8 for pre-processing of the data) and our processing pipeline (which uses 320</p>
<p>Advanced Normalization Tools [ANTs]). 321</p>
<p>FBP PET and structural MR images for 76 participants, and FBB PET and MR images 322 for 49 participants were downloaded from ADNI's Image Database Archive (IDA). We also 323 downloaded the final SUVR data processed through the ADNI pipeline, which is also available 324 on the IDA. We created cortical SUVR values using the same reference and cortical regions 325 described by ADNI (Landau and Jagust, 2015) our non-standard pre-processing pipeline using 326 steps described in the "Data processing" section of the manuscript. We subsequently compared 327 our FBB and FBP cortical SUVR values to those obtained from the ADNI processing, using a 328 linear model as suggested in Klunk et al. (2015). We showed that our pipeline did not introduce 329 errors into the data, and the comparisons between SUVR values derived from our pipeline and 330 those derived from the ADNI pipeline are shown were assessed with Quade tests (correcting for diagnosis) for continuous variables, and with chi-346 squared tests for categorical variables. 347</p>
<p>In the discovery analysis, we performed voxelwise partial correlations between 348 normalized CBF images and FTP SUVR images using the Biological Parametric Mapping 349 toolbox (Yang et al., 2011). Analyses were spatially restricted with a gray matter mask, obtained 350 by segmentation of the MR template. For the discovery cohort, correlations between CBF and 351 FTP PET were compared with or without incorporating PVE correction. Because the results were 352 largely overlapping, all subsequent analyses were conducted with non-PVE-corrected data. For 353 the replication analyses, a binarized mask of significant clusters from the discovery analysis was 354 used to restrict the search volume of the voxelwise replication analysis. Discovery and 355 replication analyses were corrected for age, sex, amyloid burden, and diagnosis. 356</p>
<p>In order to probe CBF-tau associations that extended outside of the search volume 357 restricted by the binarized mask used in the replication analyses, we conducted secondary 358 analyses in the ADNI cohorts using a gray matter mask. Secondary analyses were conducted 359 across all participants within a cohort, as well as stratified by diagnosis to determine whether 360 certain patterns of CBF-tau associations were more specific to a given diagnostic group. Because 361</p>
<p>of the relatively small sample size of AD patients, AD and MCI groups were combined. All 362 analyses were corrected for age, sex, and amyloid burden, and diagnosis if the analysis contained 363 more than one diagnostic group. A voxelwise threshold of p&lt;0.001 and an FDR-corrected 364 cluster-level threshold of p&lt;0.05 was used to determine significance for all voxelwise analyses. 365</p>
<p>Average FTP SUVR and CBF were extracted from significant clusters in all voxelwise 366 partial correlations for further analysis. In order to reduce the number of ROIs for multiple 367 comparisons, bilateral clusters and clusters within the same anatomic region (e.g. left and right 368 inferior parietal lobe [IPL]) were combined into one ROI. To correct for potential confounding 369 effects of atrophy, average gray matter volume was extracted from each ROI by moving the ROI 370 from template space into subject space and multiplying with the gray matter probability from 371</p>
<p>SPM segmentation. 372</p>
<p>For all voxelwise analyses, we conducted follow-up tests to determine if the slope of 373 CBF-tau associations differed as a function of cognitive performance. To this end, we conducted 374 univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses with MoCA and regional CBF as independent 375 variables, with a MoCA<em>CBF interaction term. Regional FTP SUVR identified from the 376 discovery/replication or secondary gray matter masked analyses was the dependent variable, 377 which were run in parallel models. Age, sex, education, diagnosis, amyloid burden, and gray 378 matter volume were included as covariates. GLM analyses were also used to investigate the 379 effect of amyloid burden on CBF-tau associations. Amyloid CL and regional CBF were entered 380 as independent variables, with an amyloid</em>CBF interaction term. Regional FTP SUVR identified 381 from the discovery/replication or secondary gray matter masked analyses was entered as the 382 dependent variable. Age, sex, diagnosis, amyloid burden, and gray matter volume were included 383 as covariates. In the subgroup of USC participants with CSF sPDGFR data, we used ROIs from 384 the discovery analysis to extract FTP SUVR to conduct sPDGFR -tau partial correlations and 385 analogous GLM analyses to those above. The GLMs included FTP SUVR as the dependent 386 variable, CSF sPDGFR as the independent variable, as well as MoCA<em>sPDGFR and amyloid-387 </em>sPDGFR interaction effects in parallel models. Significance for interaction effects in all 388</p>
<p>analyses was set at p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected. 389</p>
<p>To further examine the effects of amyloid, MoCA<em>CBF interactions were assessed 390 independently in amyloid+ and amyloid-groups. Stratified analyses for amyloid positivity were 391 not conducted for MoCA</em>sPDGFR interactions due to the limited number of participants with 392 sPDGFR data. 393</p>
<p>To better understand the order of events between vascular markers (CBF/sPDGFR ), tau, 394 and cognition, we conducted causal mediation analyses. We analyzed two hypothesized 395 pathological models leading to impaired cognition: 1) CBF/sPDGFR -&gt; tau PET -&gt; MoCA (tau 396 mediates vascular dysfunction), and 2) Tau PET -&gt; CBF/sPDGFR -&gt; MoCA (vascular 397 dysfunction mediates tau). Mediation models were compared using the entire group sample, as 398 well as between amyloid+ and amyloid-groups. Age, sex, diagnosis, amyloid burden, gray 399 matter volume, and education were included as covariates. Significance for mediation effects in 400 all analyses was set at p&lt;0.05, FDR-corrected. Tests assessing differences between and within-401 groups and the GLM analyses following voxelwise comparison were conducted with SPSS. 402</p>
<p>Causal mediation analyses were performed using the "mediate" function of the "mediation" The data that support the findings of this study will be made available upon request to the 415 corresponding author in accordance with the existing data sharing agreement with the National 416    To investigate the order of events related to tau accumulation and vascular dysfunction 527 on cognition, we conducted parallel causal mediation models following two potential pathways 528 leading to impaired cognition. Tau was identified as a significant mediator in the pathway from 529 CBF/sPDGFR to MoCA performance for a majority of the ROIs examined, with significant 530 mediating effects present in all subgroups except for the ADNI CN group ( Figure 6A, Figure 6-531 1). CBF/sPDGFR was a significant mediator between tau SUVR and MoCA only for the mPFC 532 in the ADNI AD-MCI group (Figure 6-2). When assessing the mediating effects of tau on the 533 CBF to MoCA pathway separately in amyloid+ and amyloid-groups, we discovered significant 534 effects only for amyloid+ group, in almost of all the same regions showing significance in the 535 analysis combining all participants ( Figure 6B, Figure 6-3), showing the effects were largely 536 driven by the amyloid+ participants. 537 538 CBF is associated with amyloid-

<p>540</p>
<p>In confirmatory analyses of previous studies, we observed significant negative 541 correlations between FBB SUVR and CBF in several cortical regions (Figure 7). Similar to 542 associations between CBF and tau, we observed several negative correlations in lateral temporal 543 and frontal areas in both USC and ADNI groups, although the spatial extent of associations was 544 largely reduced. In general, associations were stronger and more widespread in less impaired 545 groups ( Figure 7A,D) compared to more impaired groups ( Figure 7C). In the ADNI cohort, a few 546 significant positive CBF-FBB associations were observed in PCC, OFC, and fusiform gyrus that 547 were likely driven by the AD-MCI subgroup (data not shown). In the current study, we showed that: i) two markers of vascular health (MRI CBF and 552 CSF sPDGFR ) were significantly associated with tau PET levels, and that this effect was 553 present in two independent cohorts; ii) linear CBF/sPDGFR -tau PET relationships had steeper 554 slopes as a function of poorer cognition and higher amyloid burden in independent analyses; iii) 555</p>
<p>MoCA-CBF/sPDGFR interactions on tau PET appeared to be driven by amyloid positivity; iv) 556 causal mediation analyses suggested that vascular dysfunction may relate to cognitive 557 dysfunction through a tau-mediated pathway, particularly in the presence of amyloid positivity; 558</p>
<p>and v) CBF-tau associations are stronger than and spatially distinct from CBF-amyloid 559 associations. Taken together, these results show important associations between three key 560 pathological factors in AD: tau, amyloid-, and vascular dysfunction. 561</p>
<p>A major finding of the current study is that several cortical regions showed negative 562 CBF-tau PET associations (Figures 1,2), which were largely localized to temporal-parietal and 563 frontal areas. Although there are no published studies reporting correlations between elevated tau 564 PET signal and decreased ASL-derived CBF to our knowledge, support for these associations 565 2018). CBF is strongly linked to vascular health, but as mentioned above it is also coupled with 592 other physiological processes such as metabolism and synaptic function, therefore it is difficult 593 to determine which process is most associated with elevated tau. However, a strength of the 594 study is that we also showed significant relationships between lateral temporal tau levels and an 595 additional vascular marker, CSF sPDGFR . PDGFR in the adult brain is expressed 596 predominantly in pericytes, cells that are integral to BBB maintenance and regulation of CBF 597 increases in the presence of amyloid, but CBF and sPDGFR also undergo dynamic changes. It 607 is possible that amyloid<em>CBF interactions are driven by the presence of high tau levels 608 predominantly in individuals with high amyloid. Because few participants exhibited high tau but 609 low amyloid levels, consistent with primary age-related tauopathy, the restricted dynamic tau 610 range in these individuals may make it more difficult to accurately estimate the slope. However, 611 not every region that displayed a significant voxelwise CBF/sPDGFR -tau correlation also 612 showed a significant amyloid</em>CBF/sPDGFR interaction, suggesting that some regional 613 CBF/sPDGFR -tau relationships arise prior to substantial amyloid accumulation. This is in line 614 with post-mortem evidence of early arterial tau deposition in the absence of amyloid- (Merlini 615 et al., 2016). Though some initial CBF/sPDGFR -tau associations appeared in advance and 616</p>
<p>independently of amyloid-positivity, the presence of significant amyloid in the system greatly 617 strengthened the relationship. Because amyloid-itself is known to have vasoactive properties, 618 and in many cases leads to vascular deposits in dementia patients (Govindpani et al., 2019), it is 619 possible that amyloid interacts with the vascular system in tau-independent and tau-dependent 620 pathways. A tau-independent pathway is supported by recent evidence that amyloid deposits act 621 directly on pericytes to reduce CBF through pericyte-mediated capillary constriction (Nortley et  PET as has been done previously, the current study investigated CBF and tau together and asked 634 whether the slope of observed CBF-tau relationships differed according to cognitive function. 635</p>
<p>Our observations indicated that, in participants demonstrating relatively lower global cognition, 636 the negative CBF-tau association was stronger than in participants with higher cognitive 637 performance, suggesting the link between CBF and tau levels is clinically meaningful. The current study has several limitations. Due to difficulties associated with a multisite 650 study, study sites utilized different MRI sequences and MRI/PET scanners, which is likely 651 responsible for some of the differences between cohorts, such as global gray matter CBF. 652</p>
<p>However, identifying a relatively large sample of participants with 3D pCASL sequences and the 653 same PET tracers is a strength of this multi-modal imaging study with a CSF sub-component, 654 and the fact that many of the discovery findings were replicable is evidence of the robustness of 655 the findings. Another limitation is that only data uncorrected for PVE were included in the main 656 results. We chose to proceed with non-PVE corrected data, because associations between PVE-657 corrected CBF and FTP data in the discovery cohort were not different from those using non-658 PVE-corrected data, indicating that these associations were likely PVE-independent. The 659</p>
<p>inclusion of gray matter volume as a covariate in the ROI analyses also limits the impact of 660 atrophy-induced PVE. An additional limitation is that CSF levels of sPDGFR were quantified 661</p>
<p>with Western blot analysis, which can result in less accurate quantification compared to 662 techniques like Meso Scale Discovery (MSD). However, we have previously shown strong 663 positive associations between CSF sPDGFR levels quantified by MSD and Western blot 664 (Sweeney et al., 2020), indicating that our Western blot analysis provides accurate quantification. 665</p>
<p>In conclusion, results from the current study provide the first evidence of associations 666 between elevated tau PET signal and vascular dysfunction, reflected by decreased CBF and 667 increased CSF sPDGFR , two independent measures of impaired vascular health. Furthermore, 668 CBF/sPDGFR -tau relationships were steeper in amyloid-positive individuals and also in 669 individuals with poorer cognitive performance, that were largely dependent upon amyloid status. 670</p>
<p>Taken together, combination treatments targeting vascular health, as well as amyloid-and tau 671 levels, may be more effective in preserving cognitive function than single-target therapies.   </p>
<p>Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with several biological 121 hallmarks, including amyloid-plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles. Vascular 122 dysfunction has gained traction as another important contributor to AD etiology (Rabin et al., 123 2018; Bos et al., 2019; Govindpani et al., 2019; Sweeney et al., 2019b). One measure of vascular 124 health is cerebral blood flow (CBF), which decreases consistently throughout progression of AD, 125 and can be measured non-invasively with MRI (Binnewijzend et al., 2016; Benedictus et al., 126 2017; Sweeney et al., 2018). Conversely, amyloid-and tau levels, measured in vivo by positron 127 emission tomography (PET), increase throughout the course of AD, typically with earlier 128 detection of increased amyloid-deposition followed by elevated levels of tau. Despite 129 seemingly anticorrelated trajectories of CBF and amyloid-and tau PET measures, associations 130 between these variables, and their effects on clinical outcome, are not well understood. 131 A large body of work describes relationships between CBF and amyloid-, including 132 recent neuroimaging investigations in humans suggesting that decreased CBF is generally 133 paralleled by increased amyloid-deposition (Mattsson et al., 2014; McDade et al., 2014; Yan et 134 al., 2018), as well as preclinical studies that indicate bidirectional interactions between amyloid-135 and vascular dysfunction (for a review, see Govindpani et al., 2019). However, studies focused 136 on associations between tau and the vascular system are less common. Some recent preclinical 137 research suggests that the tau protein also accumulates in cerebral vasculature in AD patients and 138 animal AD models (Castillo-Carranza et al., 2017) and that tau overexpression in animals leads 139</p>
<p>144 Despite the wealth of knowledge documenting the involvement of amyloid-in AD, the 145 causative role for amyloid-is still open for debate. Other pathologies, such as tau, are 146 consistently shown to be more strongly associated with AD-related outcomes, like 147 neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, compared to amyloid-(Hedden et al., 2013; 148 Ossenkoppele et al., 2019). Therefore, the main focus of the present study was understanding the 149 interactions between tau and vascular function on cognition, and also the influence of amyloid 150 burden on these associations. In a subgroup analysis, the relationship between tau uptake and 151 CSF soluble platelet-derived growth factor beta (sPDGFR ), a molecule released from injured 152 pericytes, which are integral to vascular function (Montagne et al., 2015; Nation et al., 2019; 153Montagne et al., 2020), was evaluated. We hypothesized that vascular dysfunction (decreased 154 MRI CBF and increased CSF sPDGFR ) would be associated with increased tau PET signal, 155 which would predict global cognition, and that these associations would be stronger in 156 individuals with significant amyloid accumulation.</p>

270MRI. Separate T1-weighted (T1w) MR templates were created for each cohort from 271 T1w scans using the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) package template building tool 272 (Avants et al., 2010; Avants et al., 2011). Each participants' T1w image was processed with 273 FreeSurfer v6.0.0 (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) to generate subject-specific regions of 274 interest (ROIs). 275 276 3D pCASL. For USC data, motion correction was performed separately for label and 277 control images by rigid body registration of individual frames to the first respective image. 278 Perfusion-weighted images were obtained by simple subtraction of label-control pairs, followed 279 by principal component analysis-based denoising. CBF time series images were computed based 280 on the kinetic model recommended by Alsop et al., (2015), and averaged to create a mean CBF 281</p>
<p>291 were normalized by dividing each CBF voxel by the average global gray matter CBF (Aslan and 292 Lu, 2010; Lacalle-Aurioles et al., 2013).293PET. Dynamic FTP, FBB, and FBP images were motion corrected by aligning each 295 frame to an average image. Motion-corrected PET frames were then averaged, coregistered to 296 the T1w image, moved into template space, and smoothed with an 8mm Gaussian kernel. For 297 FTP data, inferior cerebellar gray matter was used as a reference region(Baker et al., 2017).298 Cerebellar segmentation was performed with SUIT 299 (http://www.diedrichsenlab.org/imaging/suit.htm), and dorsal regions were removed from the 300 cerebellar ROI. For FBB and FBP data, whole cerebellum was used as a reference region. 301 Bilateral cerebellar gray and white matter labels from FreeSurfer were combined and eroded by 1 302 voxel to reduce PVE, then moved into PET space. Average PET signal was extracted from 303 reference ROIs in native PET space. Parametric FTP SUVR images were created by dividing 304 PET signal in each voxel by the average signal in the respective reference regions. FTP PET data 305 from the discovery cohort were corrected for PVE with the region-based voxelwise technique, 306 based on the geometric transfer matrix method (Rousset et al., 1998) incorporated in FreeSurfer 307 v.6.0.0 (Greve et al., 2016). To characterize general levels of PET binding, composite ROIs were 308 created. For FTP, two composite ROIs were created to reproduce Braak I-II and Braak III-IV 309 areas consistent with neuropathological observations. Regions were created according to 310 FreeSurfer labels as defined in Baker et al., (2017). For FBB and FBP, the composite ROI 311</p>

11These equations for each tracer 331 were then used to convert our SUVR values to ADNI-equivalent standard SUVR values, which 332 were then converted to CL values using the equations determined for ADNI data (Kolibash et al., 333 2018): FBB SUVR to CL -CL FBB = 159.08 x SUVR FBB -151.65; FBP SUVR to CL -CL FBP = 334 196.9 x SUVR FBP -196.03. We then plotted all CL values obtained from our processing pipeline 335 against the values obtained through ADNI (Figure 1-2). The fit between the standard CL values 336 and our values was well within the ranges given by Klunk et al., i.e. slope = 0.997 and r 2 = 0.986. 337 Therefore, the CL values reported in the current manuscript meet the specifications delineated by 338 the Centiloid project. 339 340 Experimental design and statistical analyses 341 342 Differences in participant characteristics between diagnostic groups within cohorts were 343 assessed with Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, followed by Bonferroni-corrected 344 post-hoc Dunn tests to decompose statistically significant results.

Analyses were spatially restricted with a gray matter mask, and age, 408 sex, Braak I-II FTP SUVR, and diagnosis were included as covariates. Analyses were conducted 409 in the USC cohort (n=68), and in a subgroup of the ADNI dataset for which FBB PET scans 410 were available (n=60).</p>
<p>. In the discovery cohort, we observed several significant negative 452 correlations between CBF and FTP SUVR in cortical regions, including inferior / middle / 453 superior temporal gyri (ITG/MTG/STG), and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) (Figure 1A; Figure1-454 3A). No significant positive correlations were observed. Using regions showing significant CBF-455 tau correlations as ROIs, we found significant positive associations between CSF sPDGFR and 456 FTP SUVR in ITG/MTG (r=0.642, p=0.040), MTG/STG (r=0.592, p=0.040), and MTG 457 (r=0.578, p=0.040) regions. 458 459 Replication analysis. The majority of significant negative CBF-tau correlations observed 460in lateral temporal areas in the discovery analysis were replicated in the ADNI cohort (Figure 461</p>
<p>1B; Figure 1 - 483 Figure 3 -
148333A). There were no significant positive CBF-tau correlations. 462 463 Secondary analyses of ADNI cohort. Using a gray matter mask to restrict the search 464 volume, we observed significant negative CBF-tau associations in numerous cortical regions, 465 including temporal, parietal, and frontal areas (Figure 2A; Figure 2-1A). Within the AD-MCI 466 subgroup (n=65), significant negative correlations between CBF and FTP SUVR were observed 467 in similar regions to the whole group analysis (Figure 2B; Figure 2-1B). Within the CN subgroup 468 (n=73), significant negative CBF-tau associations were observed in a smaller subset of regions 469 observed in the whole group analysis, including dlPFC, temporal-parietal cortex, and lateral 470 parietal areas (Figure 2C; Figure 2-1C). No positive correlations were detected for any of the 471 secondary CBF-tau analyses. 472 473 CBF-and sPDGFR -tau correlations differ depending on cognitive performance 474 475 CBF-tau correlations. From the USC discovery analysis, significant MoCA<em>CBF 476 interaction effects on FTP SUVR were observed in all five lateral temporal and frontal ROIs 477 (Figure 3A; Figure 3-1A), indicating that individuals with poorer global cognition have a steeper 478 negative relationship between CBF and tau levels. In the replication analysis, both MTG/STG 479 and ITG ROIs exhibited a significant MoCA</em>CBF interaction (Figure 3B, Figure 3-1B). In the 480 secondary analysis of the ADNI cohort, significant MoCA<em>CBF interaction effects on FTP 481 SUVR were detected in all temporal, parietal, and frontal regions showing significant negative 482 CBF-tau associations (Figure 2A), with the exception of entorhinal cortex (EC; Figure 3C, 1C) across all participants. In the AD-MCI ADNI subgroup analysis, significant 484 interactions between MoCA performance and CBF were observed in many of the same regions 485 observed in the whole group (Figure 3-1C, Figure 3-2A). In the CN ADNI subgroup, a 486 significant MoCA</em>CBF interaction was observed only in the temporal-parietal cortex (Figure 3-487 1C, Figure 3-2B). 488 sPDGFR -tau correlations. Significant MoCA<em>sPDGFR interactions were detected in 489 ITG/MTG/STG regions (Figure 3D, Figure 3-1D), indicating that individuals with poorer 490 cognitive performance exhibit a steeper positive relationship between tau and pericyte 491 deficiency. 492 493 CBF-and sPDGFR -tau correlations are affected by amyloid levels 494 495 CBF-tau correlations. From the USC discovery analysis, significant amyloid</em>CBF 496 interaction effects on FTP SUVR were observed in three of the five lateral temporal and frontal 497 ROIs (Figure 4A; Figure 4-1A), which indicates that higher amyloid levels are reflected by 498 stronger negative CBF-tau relationships. In the replication analysis, only MTG/STG exhibited a 499 significant amyloid<em>CBF interaction (Figure 4B, Figure 4-1B). From the secondary analysis of 500 the ADNI cohort, significant amyloid</em>CBF interaction effects on FTP SUVR were detected in 501 all ROIs except S1, mPFC, ITG and MTG/STG (Figure 4C, Figure 4-1C). In the AD-MCI ADNI 502 group analysis, a significant amyloid<em>CBF interaction was observed only in the inferior parietal / 503 supramarginal gyrus (IPL/SMG) ROI (Figure 4-1C, Figure 4-2A). In the CN ADNI group, 504 significant amyloid</em>CBF interactions were observed in all ROIs except dLPFC (Figure 4-1C, 505</p>

Significant amyloid<em>sPDGFR interactions were detected 507 in ITG/MTG/STG regions (Figure 4D, Figure 4-1D), demonstrating that individuals with higher 508 amyloid burden exhibit a steeper positive relationship between tau levels and pericyte deficiency. 509 510 Interactions between cognitive performance and CBF-tau correlations are driven by 511 amyloid positivity 512 513 Based on our results suggesting that both cognitive performance and amyloid burden 514 affect the relationship between vascular markers and tau levels (Figures 3 and 4), we wanted to 515 further determine whether the MoCA</em>CBF interactions differed as a function of amyloid 516 positivity. When groups were stratified by amyloid positivity (&gt;19 CL), we observed significant 517 MoCA<em>CBF interactions only in amyloid+ groups. These were present in the MTG/STG ROI 518 from the replication analysis, MTG/STG, SFG, and temporal-parietal ROIs from the secondary 519 analysis in the ADNI group (Figure 5, Figure 5-1B,C), and the ITG/MTG ROI from the ADNI 520 AD-MCI subgroup (Figure 5-1B, Figure 5-2). Several additional regions in the amyloid+ group 521 showed significant MoCA</em>CBF interactions but did not survive multiple comparisons correction 522 (Figure 5-1). 523 524 Tau mediates the association between CBF/sPDGFR and cognition 525 526</p>
<p>comes from PET studies utilizing tau ligands and [ 18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), which is a 566 marker of glucose metabolism, a process coupled to CBF. Previous studies documented negative 567 tau-FDG PET relationships within regions similar to those reported in the current study (Saint-568 Aubert et al., 2016; Hanseeuw et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2017; Whitwell et al., 2018), which may 569 indicate vascular dysfunction, e.g. impaired glucose transport across the blood brain barrier 570 (BBB), in addition to neuronal dysfunction (Sweeney et al., 2019a). It is noteworthy that 571 although CBF measured with ASL-MRI and FDG PET are generally positively correlated 572 spatially and show similar diagnostic accuracy for AD (Chen et al., 2011; Musiek et al., 2012), 573 several studies reported large variability in regional correlations across modalities (Cha et al., 574 2013; Yan et al., 2018), emphasizing differences between the two measures. Importantly, the 575 regions showing negative CBF-tau associations in the current study consistently exhibited 576 hypoperfusion, as measured with ASL-MRI or [ 15 O]-water PET, throughout the progression of 577 AD, from early CBF decreases in healthy aging individuals (Chen et al., 2011), to MCI and AD 578 dementia (Alexopoulos et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Okonkwo et al., 2014; Binnewijzend et 579 al., 2016). Temporal-parietal and frontal regions also exhibited elevated tau levels in cognitively 580 unimpaired individuals that increased during AD progression (Pontecorvo et al., 2017; Lowe et 581 al., 2018; Harrison et al., 2019), and showed early associations with cognitive performance 582 (Ossenkoppele et al., 2019). The combined evidence from this study and previous studies 583 demonstrating negative CBF-tau associations suggests that increasing tau deposition and 584 decreasing CBF may be linked mechanistically. 585 Mechanisms underlying CBF-tau associations are poorly understood. Evidence from 586 human patients and animal stroke models suggested that chronic hypoperfusion can induce tau 587 hyperphosphorylation and accumulation (Qiu et al., 2016; Pluta et al., 2018; Shimada et al., 588 2019). Conversely, data from human post-mortem studies and animal models of AD showed that 589 tau oligomers deposit in microvasculature (Castillo-Carranza et al., 2017) and that pathological 590 tau can induce abnormal remodeling of brain vasculature (Merlini et al., 2016; Bennett et al., 591</p>
<p>(
Kisler et al., 2017). Pericyte damage results in cleavage of soluble PDGFR , and increased CSF 598 sPDGFR has recently been observed in early stages of cognitive impairment (Nation et al., 599 2019). Importantly, a pericyte-deficient AD mouse model exhibited tau accumulation (Sagare et 600 al., 2013), further supporting a link between vascular dysfunction and tau accumulation. 601 Another major finding of the study is that CBF/sPDGFR -tau associations differed as a 602 function of amyloid burden (Figure 4, Figure 4-1). Numerous post-mortem and in vivo human 603 studies posit an interactive model where early amyloid accumulation potentially promotes tau 604 tangle formation (Ingelsson et al., 2004; Hanseeuw et al., 2019; Jack et al., 2019). The current 605 study augments this model by uncovering a vascular component, and it appears that not only tau 606</p>

6273622 al., 2019). Further research is needed to disentangle the cellular interactions between tau, 623 vascular function, and amyloid-. 624 Finally, we reported differential associations between CBF/sPDGFR and tau PET as a 625 function of global cognition. Across cohorts, participants with lower global cognition, as 626 measured by MoCA performance, displayed steeper CBF/sPDGFR -tau relationships (Figure 3, -1). Investigating tau and CBF independently in aging or cognitively impaired cohorts, 628 tau PET signal in temporal, parietal, and lateral frontal regions was negatively correlated with 629 cognitive performance (Saint-Aubert et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2017; Ossenkoppele et al., 2019), 630 while CBF in similar regions showed positive correlations with cognitive performance (Mak et 631 al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Okonkwo et al., 2014; Binnewijzend et al., 2016; Benedictus et al., 632 2017). However, instead of assessing cognition-imaging correlations separately for CBF and tau 633</p>
<p>638 Furthermore
638, we also showed in the majority of regions showing MoCA*CBF interactions that 639 this effect was largely driven by amyloid-positive individuals (Figure 5; Figure 5-1). This is 640 consistent with a two-hit vascular hypothesis of AD (Zlokovic, 2011), as CBF-tau relationships 641 appear to precede amyloid, but are exacerbated with the accumulation of amyloid-. 642 Subsequently, CBF-tau relationships are strengthened even further in amyloid-positive 643 individuals with poorer global cognition, suggesting that cognitive deficits are worse when all 644 three pathological factors are present. Results from the mediation analysis were consistent with 645 evidence that vascular dysfunction occurs early in the progression of AD, followed by 646 accumulation of misfolded proteins and clinical decline (Iturria-Medina et al., 2016). However, 647the cross-sectional nature of the study makes it difficult to dissect the causal order of these events 648 and our interpretation of these mediating effects needs to be validated in longitudinal studies. 649</p>

The study and procedures were approved by the Institutional 189 Review Board (IRB) at USC, and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to 190 enrollment. Participants in the USC cohort were recruited from the greater Los Angeles area and 191 data were collected between October 2016 and November 2019. All participants were between 192 the ages of 46 and 80 and had no current or prior history of any major psychiatric illness, organ 193 failure, epilepsy, and hydrocephalus. All participants received a battery of neuropsychological 194 tests assessing attention/executive function and episodic memory and were categorized as 195 cognitively normal (CN) if they scored within 1SD of published normative values. If participants 196 scored more than 1SD outside the normal range on at least one test, they were categorized as 197 being at risk for mild cognitive impairment (MCI-risk), as the 1SD threshold has been suggested 198 to have high predictive power to determine progression to dementia (Busse et al., 2006). A 199 subset of participants (n=31) received additional screening for MCI in accordance with NACC 200 guidelines (https://www.alz.washington.edu/). Briefly, a clinician or formal consensus panel 201 determines an MCI diagnosis based on each annual visit. MCI criteria includes abnormal 202 cognition (global Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR]&gt;0 and/or neuropsychological testing &gt;1.5SD 203 outside of normative values) and no diagnosis of clinical dementia. The NACC MCI diagnostic 204 assessment also incorporates the Petersen criteria, similar to ADNI. No participants had 205 ADNI Replication Cohort. ADNI protocols were approved by the IRB of all 208 participating institutions and written informed consent was obtained from all participants at each 209 site. Data collection occurred between January 2017 and December 2019. Details of clinical 210 diagnoses have been previously described (Petersen et al., 2010; for general methods see 211 http://adni.loni.usc.edu/adni-3/). Briefly, CN participants had a Mini-Mental State Examination 212 (MMSE) score 24 and a CDR of 0. MCI participants had a MMSE score 26 and a CDR of 213 0.5. Participants with probable AD had a MMSE score between 20 and 24, and a CDR of 0.5 or 214 1.0. Additionally, MCI and AD participants were required to express both subjective memory 215 concerns and objective memory loss based on scoring below adjusted cutoffs on the Logical 216 Memory II subscale of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. 217 Global cognition was measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; 221 Nasreddine et al., 2005), as this test was available for all participants across both cohorts. 222 The quantitative Western blot analysis was used to detect sPDGFRβ in human CSF 226 (ng/mL), as previously reported (Montagne et al., 2015; Nation et al., 2019). Briefly, CSF 227 samples and recombinant human PDGFRβ carrier-free protein (Cat. No. 385-PR-100/CF, 228 R&amp;DSystems) were subjected to 4-12% Bis-Tris SDS/PAGE gel electrophoresis (Thermo 229 Scientific) for 2h at 150 V, and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The 230 membrane was blocked for 1h with a superblock blocking buffer (Cat. No. 37537, Thermo 231 Scientific). The membrane was incubated with a primary antibody for PDGFRβ (Cat. No. 232 AF1042, R&amp;D Systems) overnight, then incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG secondary 233 antibody (Cat. No. A15999, 1:5000 dilution, Thermo Scientific) for 1h at room temperature, 234 treated with Western ECL detection solution (Cat. No. 34075, Thermo Scientific), exposed to 235 CL-Xposure film (Cat. No. 34091, Thermo Scientific), and developed in an X-Omat 3000 RA 236 film processor (Kodak). Images were acquired, and densitometry analysis was performed using 237 USC Discovery Cohort. All MR images were acquired on a Siemens 3T Prisma scanner. Structural T1-weighted MPRAGE images were acquired with the following parameters: 243 repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) 2400/2.2ms, field of view (FOV) 176x240x256mm, 244 resolution 1.0mm 3 isotropic. 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeled (pCASL) images were 245 acquired with background suppression and the following parameters: TR/TE/post-label delay 246 (PLD) 4300/36.7/2000ms, FOV 240x240x120mm, resolution 2.5mm 3 isotropic, label duration 2471500ms.
