                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4 is identified and KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, is identified as a key factor linked to resilience.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Single-cell omics is advancing our understanding of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), revealing specific subtypes that are either susceptible or resilient to neurodegeneration. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to compare neocortical regions affected early (prefrontal cortex and precuneus) or late (primary visual cortex) in AD, we identified a resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. Layer 4 neurons in association neocortex also remained relatively preserved as AD progressed and shared overlapping molecular signatures of resilience. Early in the disease, resilient neurons upregulated genes associated with synapse maintenance, synaptic plasticity, calcium homeostasis, and neuroprotective factors, including GRIN2A, RORA, NRXN1, NLGN1, NCAM2, FGF14, NRG3, NEGR1, and CSMD1. We also identified KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, as a key factor linked to resilience. KCNIP4 was consistently upregulated in the early stages of pathology. Furthermore, AAV-mediated overexpression of Kcnip4 in a humanized AD mouse model reduced the expression of the activity-dependent genes Arc and c-Fos, suggesting compensatory mechanisms against neuronal hyperexcitability. Our dataset provides a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms underlying resilience to neurodegeneration.</p>

<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Single-cell omics is advancing our understanding of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD), revealing specific subtypes that are either susceptible or resilient to neurodegeneration. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to compare neocortical regions affected early (prefrontal cortex and precuneus) or late (primary visual cortex) in AD, we identified a resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. Layer 4 neurons in association neocortex also remained relatively preserved as AD progressed and shared overlapping molecular signatures of resilience. Early in the disease, resilient neurons upregulated genes associated with synapse maintenance, synaptic plasticity, calcium homeostasis, and neuroprotective factors, including GRIN2A, RORA, NRXN1, NLGN1, NCAM2, FGF14, NRG3, NEGR1, and CSMD1. We also identified KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, as a key factor linked to resilience. KCNIP4 was consistently upregulated in the early stages of pathology. Furthermore, AAV-mediated overexpression of Kcnip4 in a humanized AD mouse model reduced the expression of the activity-dependent genes Arc and c-Fos, suggesting compensatory mechanisms against neuronal hyperexcitability. Our dataset provides a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms underlying resilience to neurodegeneration.</p>
<h2>MAIN</h2>
<p>Advancements in single-cell omics have been pivotal in characterizing the transcriptomic diversity of the human neocortex and elucidating selective cell vulnerability in neurodegenerative dementias such as $\mathrm{AD}^{1-6}$. Single-nucleus profiling of the neocortex in AD has identified neuronal populations that are vulnerable and depleted early in the disease, such as layer 1 inhibitory interneurons expressing NDNF/RELN and layer 2/3 excitatory neurons expressing CUX2/COL5A2 ${ }^{2,7,8}$. In contrast, few studies have focused on neuronal subtypes that, despite residing in similar microenvironments, remain preserved even in advanced stages of AD. Identifying these resilient subtypes and the mechanisms underlying their preservation could provide valuable insights for therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing disease progression.</p>
<p>We leveraged the progression of AD in the human neocortex-from association cortices to primary cortices ${ }^{9-12}$ - to compare early-affected regions (prefrontal cortex, BA9; precuneus, BA7) with lateaffected regions (primary visual cortex, BA17) using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). Although the neocortex follows a canonical 6-layer pattern, significant quantitative differences exist across regions ${ }^{13-15}$. For instance, layer 4 (L4) is expanded in primary sensory areas, while layers 2/3 and 5 (L2/3, L5) are more prominent in association cortices ${ }^{3,6,16-19}$. Comparing early- and late-affected</p>
<p>areas thus provides a robust framework for examining cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental factors influencing selective vulnerability.</p>
<p>Neocortical L4, or the internal granular cell layer, is densely packed with small, granular neurons that serve as major postsynaptic targets of thalamic sensory nuclei and project locally or to nearby cortical regions. Its thickness varies considerably across different cortical areas, comprising $38 \%$ of the cortical ribbon in BA17 and $8.6 \%$ in BA9. In BA17, also known as the striate cortex, layer 4 contains a distinct band of myelinated fibers called the line of Gennari ${ }^{17,19}$. L4 has long been considered a resilient area in AD due to its lower burden of tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), although it exhibits amyloid plaques ${ }^{9,20-22}$. However, the composition of L4 at the single-cell level in AD progression remains poorly understood. In an unbiased manner, our study identified a resilient population of L4 neurons in the BA17 characterized by the co-expression of RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. Whether the resilience of these neurons is due to their specific connectivity, molecular properties, or interactions within the microenvironment remains unresolved, underscoring the importance of single-cell approaches in dissecting these complex factors and advancing research into neuronal resilience.</p>
<p>Our dataset includes samples from three neocortical regions (BA9, BA7, BA17) collected from 46 donors spanning all stages of disease progression (Braak stages 0-VI). To enrich for neurons, we performed fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) for NeuN, resulting in 424,528 nuclei after quality control, of which 362,224 were neuronal. By integrating single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics, we validated the layer-specific expression of 18 excitatory neuronal subtypes and identified the resilience of L4 neurons. We employed machine learning methods to validate neuronal subtype annotations across large-scale publicly available AD datasets ${ }^{5,8,23}$. Robust differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, utilizing linear mixed models, bootstrap resampling, and DESeq2 on pseudobulk aggregated counts, identified candidate genes associated with resilience. As proof of principle, we focused on KCNIP4, a gene encoding a voltage-gated potassium channel-interacting protein that regulates neuronal excitability in response to changes in intracellular calcium. We found that KCNIP4 was upregulated in resilient L4 neurons during early disease stages. Furthermore, AAVmediated delivery of KCNIP4 in a humanized App knock-in AD mouse model $\left(\right.$ App $^{S A A}{ }^{24}$ reduced Arc and c-Fos expression, suggesting potential roles in regulating hyperexcitability. Our dataset is a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms of resilience in neurodegeneration.</p>
<h1>RESULTS</h1>
<h2>Neuronal cell type composition during the spatiotemporal progression of AD in the neocortex</h2>
<p>In the AD neocortex, neurodegeneration and tau pathology progress from association to primary cortices ${ }^{9-12}$. We profiled nuclear transcriptomes from 243 samples obtained from two association</p>
<p>cortices (BA9, BA7) and one primary cortex (BA17) from 46 donors who died at various stages of disease progression and age-matched healthy controls (Braak stages 0-VI). The donors were categorized into three pathology groups-low, intermediate, and high (18, 10, and 18 donors, respectively)—based on neuropathological diagnoses using current consensus criteria ${ }^{10}$ (Fig. 1a; Supplementary Table 1). For each tissue sample, we collected two single-nucleus suspensions using FANS: one containing all nuclei and one enriched for neurons (NeuN*). In total, we profiled 655,407 nuclei. After rigorous QC to remove nuclei with low gene counts, high mitochondrial content, and doublets, we retained 424,528 high-quality nuclei for downstream analysis (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Table 1). The major cell types included 362,224 neurons (282,930 excitatory and 79,294 inhibitory), astrocytes $(14,691)$, microglia $(5,071)$, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs; 5,770), oligodendrocytes $(36,589)$, and vascular cells (183) (Fig. 1c-f).</p>
<p>We identified 18 excitatory (Ex) and 19 inhibitory (In) clusters, corresponding to neocortical neuronal subtypes, using stringent criteria. Our clustering strategy employed unsupervised Leiden clustering, combined with strict thresholds based on silhouette scores and Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS), to enhance clustering reliability and ensure reproducibility. Clusters were named according to canonical markers for major subclasses (CUX2, RORB, THEMIS, and FEZF2 for excitatory; LHX6, ADARB2, PVALB, SST, VIP, and LAMP5 for inhibitory) along with 1-3 top marker genes for each cluster (Fig. 1g-h; Supplementary Table 2). Additionally, we selected gene sets (7-10 genes per subtype) whose combined expression precisely labeled each neuronal subtype across neocortical regions (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2). The clusters and their marker genes showed consistent expression across BA9, BA7, and BA17. As expected, we observed significant differences in the abundance of neurons in specific excitatory clusters between association cortices and the primary visual cortex, reflecting their different cytoarchitecture ${ }^{3,13}$. For instance, Ex5, characterized by the expression of CUX2, RORB, and EYA4, was overrepresented in BA17 (Fig. 1i). In contrast, all inhibitory clusters were well represented across the three regions (Fig. 1j).</p>
<p>We further assessed cluster reliability by comparing them with clusters from a large-scale AD reference dataset (Seattle Alzheimer's Disease Brain Cell Atlas [SEA-AD] $)^{23}$, which includes nearly 1.4 million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), using a cosine distance matrix to assess the similarity between the gene expression profiles of both datasets (Fig. 1k). Our annotations closely matched the reference dataset. Additionally, we used the semi-supervised single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI) model to annotate two AD reference datasets (SEA-AD DLPFC ${ }^{23}$ and Green and colleagues ${ }^{5}$ ), based on predictions from our 18 excitatory and 19 inhibitory neuron clusters. Our gene sets consistently labeled the clusters across datasets (Extended Data Figs. 1 and 2).</p>
<p>Glial cell states closely matched those from previous studies ${ }^{2,5,25}$ and included 4 astrocyte states, labeled by: SLC1A2/WIF1 (homeostatic-protoplasmic), GFAP/CHI3L1/OSMR (reactive-inflammatory), GFAP/AQP1/VCAN (reactive-fibrous), and SLC1A2/SMTN; 4 microglia states: CX3CR1 (homeostatic), AIF1 or CACNA1B (reactive inflammatory), and CD163 (reactive-phagocytic); and 2 oligodendrocyte states: OPALIN (myelinating) or COL18A1 (immature) (Fig. 1k-m).</p>
<p>To spatially map the cortical layer distribution of the 18 excitatory clusters, we performed 10x Genomics Visium on 16 tissue sections from multiple neocortical regions in AD and control donors. We employed a custom-designed panel of 197 genes, which included cluster-specific marker genes identified from our snRNA-seq data, along with the commercial Human Neuroscience gene expression panel (1,186 genes) (Fig. 2a-c). We then integrated the spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomics data and applied variational autoencoders and deconvolution methods to quantify specific neuronal cell types based on the spatial distribution of marker genes. This approach allowed us to map the spatial distribution of each cluster on the tissue sections, with cortical layer boundaries delineated based on high-resolution H\&amp;E-stained images (Fig. 2a,b). Besides assigning layer identities to each cluster, this method highlighted regional differences, such as the overrepresentation of cluster Ex5 within L4 of BA17 (Fig. 2b). Thus, our integrated single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics data identified robust clusters characterized by specific marker genes and gene sets, and mapped their spatial laminar distribution across neocortical brain regions (Fig. 2c,d).</p>
<h1>Relative preservation of layer 4 excitatory neurons during AD progression</h1>
<p>The thickness of neocortical L4 varies significantly across regions, comprising about one-third of the cortex in BA17 ${ }^{3,17}$. In advanced AD, L4 in BA17 shows amyloid plaques but minimal tau pathology ${ }^{9,20-}$ ${ }^{22}$. However, it remains unclear whether L4 is resilient across neocortical regions. To investigate this, we first identified marker genes for L4 excitatory neuronal subtypes (Ex5, Ex6, and Ex7; L4 IT). Consistent with previous studies, many genes expressed in L4 exhibited spatial gradients extending into layers 3 and $5^{3,16,26,27}$. L4 was characterized by co-expression of CUX2 (labeling L2-4) and RORB (labeling L3-5), with high expression of CUX1. The top cluster-specific markers for Ex5 included EYA4, KCNH8, LAMA3, VAV3, KCNIP1, and TRPC3 (Fig. 3a). While Ex5 was particularly enriched in BA17, most of its marker genes were either absent or only detected in rare cells in BA9, except for LAMA3, which was expressed in a subset of Ex5 neurons across neocortical regions (Fig. 3b). Notably, all these Ex5 marker genes were also highly conserved in a reference dataset from the mouse neocortex ${ }^{28}$ (Fig. 3c). The other two clusters in L4, Ex6 (RORB/MME) and Ex7 (RORB/GABRG1), were both well represented in BA9 and BA7 but were rudimentary in BA17 (Fig. 3a,b, Extended data Fig. 1). While BA9-Ex5 did not share many marker genes with BA17-Ex5, Pearson correlation analysis of gene</p>
<p>expression showed that BA9-Ex5 was more closely related to BA17-Ex5 than to other L4 clusters (Ex6 and Ex7) in BA9 or BA7 (Fig. 3d).</p>
<p>In situ hybridization (ISH) for EYA4 and KCNH8 in human BA17 tissue sections from the Allen Human Brain Atlas ${ }^{29}$ confirmed their expression in L4 and was consistent with labeling of L4 granule neurons. The highest expression was observed in deep layer 4c, with a sharp boundary at L5 (Fig. 3c,d), while expression in layers 4 a and 4 b was low. Notably, the most commonly used laminar nomenclature distinguishes three sublayers within L4: 4a, 4b, and 4c, although some authors classify layers 4 b and 4 c as part of L3, a view supported by tract-tracing studies in macaques ${ }^{30,31}$. The expression of VGLUT2 (Fig. 3d), which labels presynaptic terminals from the lateral genicular nucleus (LGN) projecting to L4 in BA17 across species ${ }^{32,33}$, matched the expression of EYA4 and KCNH8. Therefore, EYA4 and KCNH8 preferentially label what is considered layer 4 proper in BA17.</p>
<p>To identify our L4 clusters in external datasets, we used scANVI to predict our annotations in three reference datasets from the prefrontal cortex (SEA-AD DLPFC ${ }^{23}$; Green et al., 20245; Mathys et al., $2023^{8}$ ) and one from the primary visual cortex (Jorstad et al., 20233) (Fig. 3e-j; Extended data Fig. 1b). We observed high similarity across datasets originating from the same brain region based on cosine distance scores, the expression of cluster-specific markers, and by plotting author-annotated and predicted clusters (Fig. 3g-I). As expected, the number of Ex5 cells predicted in the BA17 reference dataset was high: 63,870 cells ( $34.42 \%$ ) out of 185,565 excitatory cells. In contrast, it was low in the prefrontal cortex reference datasets: 2,152 cells ( $0.33 \%$ ) out of 660,751 excitatory cells in the SEA-AD dataset; 19,360 cells (3.03\%) out of 637,968 in Green et al.; 3,361 cells (3\%) out of 112,143 in Mathys et al., compared with 7,943 cells ( $4.36 \%$ ) out of 182,140 in our BA9 dataset. Ex5 cells were most closely related to supertypes L4 IT_2, L4 IT_3, L4 IT_5, and L4 IT_6 from Jorstad et al., 20233 (WithinArea_clusters) (Fig. 3I). In contrast, Ex6 (SEA-AD supertype L4 IT_4) and Ex7 (SEA-AD supertype L4 IT_2) were well represented in the prefrontal cortex across datasets and underrepresented in the BA17 dataset (Fig. 3h,k).</p>
<p>To evaluate neuronal loss in L4 relative to other cortical neuronal cell types, we analyzed neuronal composition in low, intermediate, and high pathology disease groups for each neocortical region (Fig. 4a,b Supplementary Table 3). The relative proportion of Ex5 L4 IT to total neurons increased significantly with disease progression, from $~ 1.8 \%$ to $7.6 \%$ in BA9 and from $~ 24 \%$ to $36.5 \%$ in BA17, comparing low to high pathology groups (Fig. 4a,c). The two other L4 excitatory populations, Ex6 L4 IT and Ex7 L4 IT, did not show significant changes. We obtained similar statistical results indicating the resilience of Ex5 using various methods, including a linear mixed model, Kruskal-Wallis test, beta regression, and scCODA-a model specifically designed to evaluate compositional changes in singlecell transcriptomic data ${ }^{34}$. Additionally, we observed a relative decrease in populations previously</p>
<p>described as vulnerable, including L2/3 IT excitatory neurons (Ex1-Ex3), L5 IT excitatory neurons (Ex8), and a subpopulation of SST interneurons (In4) (Fig. 4a-c).</p>
<p>Because Ex5 L4 IT neurons have small cell bodies and expressed up to 5-6 times fewer median number of genes compared to other excitatory neurons in the neocortex (Fig. 4d,e), we considered whether the QC filter for low gene counts (&lt;300 genes) might have excluded them, potentially biasing our neuronal composition quantification. To address this, we selected previously filtered neuronal nuclei with gene counts ranging from 200 to 300 (62,498 nuclei) and used scANVI to predict their cell identities, using our high-quality dataset as a reference. After incorporating 48,849 nuclei (78\%) that were confidently assigned ( $99 \%$ probability) to annotated clusters, we found that the overall neuronal composition remained unchanged, and the relative preservation of Ex5 neurons was statistically significant (Fig. 4f). Overall, our combined transcriptomic and histological data identified conserved marker genes for L4, revealing that the resilient Ex5 L4 IT population, which labels the internal granular cell layer, becomes increasingly prominent as neighboring neurons degenerate during disease progression. These findings were consistent across datasets and methods.</p>
<h1>Differential gene and pathway expression in vulnerable vs resilient neocortex in AD</h1>
<p>To identify genes and pathways altered during disease progression in vulnerable and resilient regions, we performed DGE analysis comparing two disease stages ('early': low vs. intermediate pathology; 'late': intermediate vs. high pathology) and two neocortical regions (BA9 and BA17) for each neuronal subtype. Statistical power to detect differentially expressed (DE) genes is influenced by technical and biological factors, such as the number of nuclei, sequencing depth, RNA integrity, and age-dependent epigenetic changes ${ }^{35,36}$. To address the heterogeneity of the samples and ensure the reliability of our findings, we applied several DGE methods, including a linear mixed model implemented in MAST and Ime4, bootstrap resampling with 100 iterations, and DESeq2 on pseudobulk aggregated counts. (Fig. 5a, Extended data Fig. 3). We defined 'high-confidence' DE genes as those consistently identified across methods.</p>
<p>The total number of DE genes was higher in BA9 compared to BA17 and in the 'late' disease groups compared to the 'early' groups, reflecting gene expression changes associated with AD progression (Fig. 5b,c, Supplementary Table 4). Subtypes previously identified as vulnerable, such as L2/3 IT excitatory neurons (Ex1, Ex2), exhibited more DE genes across both regions and disease stages. However, in BA9, some excitatory clusters, including the vulnerable Ex2 (L2/3 IT) and the resilient Ex5 (L4 IT), showed more significant changes in the 'early' compared to 'late' stages. Most DE genes in BA9 were downregulated, except for Ex5, where over 50\% were upregulated in the 'early' stages. In contrast, in BA17, the majority of DE genes were upregulated, especially in the 'early' stages, in both vulnerable (Ex2) and resilient (Ex5) subtypes (Fig. 5b).</p>
<p>A total of 986 genes were categorized as 'high-confidence' DE genes. To distinguish between genes that were shared or unique across brain regions and disease stages (i.e., BA9-Early, BA9-Late, BA17Early, BA17-Late), we generated UpSet plots showing intersections among these four conditions for each excitatory neuronal type (Fig. 5d). Although most genes were unique, likely due to the stringent criteria used to define 'high-confidence' DE genes, 15-27\% were shared across at least two conditions within clusters with a high number of nuclei (Ex1, Ex2, Ex5, Ex12). The overlap of DE genes was greater between 'early' and 'late' disease stages within the same region than across brain regions, supporting the existence of vulnerability and resilient factors influenced by the microenvironment. Nevertheless, we identified 54 high-confidence DE genes common across all four conditions. Heatmaps of their expression changes revealed a consistent pattern: greater changes in BA9 compared to BA17, with downregulation increasing with disease progression in BA9 and upregulation shifting to downregulation with disease progression in BA17 (Fig. 5e). Genes exhibiting this pattern included KCNH7, KCNQ5, DLG2, SNTG1, NALF1, CNTNAP2, FGF14, AUTS2, and MAGI2. In contrast, a few genes, such as COPG2 and SLC24A2, were upregulated at early stages in both BA17 and BA9. Notably, several highconfidence DE genes have previously been identified as genetic risk factors for AD, including CSMD1, NRG3, SYN3, NRXN1, SLC24A2, DLG2, and KCNIP4 ${ }^{37-42}$.</p>
<p>Pathway enrichment analysis revealed shared pathways across regions and stages, including those involved in regulating synaptic organization, membrane potential, neurotransmitter levels, ion (calcium, sodium, and potassium) transport, intracellular calcium homeostasis, glutamate receptor signaling, synaptic vesicle clustering, and cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 5f,g; Supplementary Table 5). The same pattern persisted: enrichments were more significant in BA9 compared to BA17, and genes within the involved pathways were generally downregulated, except in the resilient regions (BA17-Early) and resilient neuronal subtypes (Ex5) (Fig. 5g).</p>
<h1>Genes and pathways associated with resilience in AD neocortex</h1>
<p>To further define genes and pathways associated with resilience, we compared two neuronal subtypes: prototype vulnerable neurons (Ex2; L2/3 IT) and resilient neurons (Ex5; L4 IT) (Fig. 6a,b, Supplementary Table 6). We hypothesized that resilience-associated genes would be enriched and upregulated in Ex5, particularly at early stages and in BA17, consistent with disease progression and the preservation of L4 in AD. 'High-confidence' genes upregulated in Ex5 neurons at early stages in both BA9 and BA17 included: CSMD1, which encodes a synaptic protein that protects against complement-mediated synapse elimination ${ }^{43}$; GRIN2A, GRM7, PTPRT, and KCNIP4, which are involved in regulating neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic organization, and synaptic plasticity; SLC24A2, a member of the calcium/cation antiporter superfamily involved in calcium homeostasis; UBE2E2, encoding an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; LINGO2, a negative regulator of neuronal growth and survival; TAFA1 and TAFA2, homologous genes encoding chemokine-like</p>
<p>proteins with roles in neuronal survival; and AUTS2, involved in transcriptional activation and actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Some of these genes, such as CSMD1, GRIN2A, and PTPRT, were also upregulated in Ex2 and other excitatory neuronal subtypes at early stages in BA17, suggesting shared neuroprotective roles across different neuronal subtypes. Other DE genes upregulated early in BA17 and involved in synapse organization and function included: CSMD2, NRXN1, NRG1, NRG3, TENM2, CACNA1B, GRID2, SLC8A1, SYN3, DLG2, DLGAP1, STXBP5L, NCAM2, RIMS2, and ADGRB3. Additionally, genes upregulated at early stages in Ex5 included those encoding neurotrophic factors and proteins with neuroprotective properties, such as NRG3, FGF14, and NCAM2 (Fig. 6a,b, Supplementary Table 6).</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA) data to compare systems-level changes in vulnerable (Ex2; L2/3 IT) and resilient neurons (Ex5; L4 IT) (Fig. 6c,d, Supplementary Table 7). In Ex5 neurons from BA17, we identified two candidate resilient modules, M2 and M3, where network genes were predominantly upregulated at early disease stages. The top 10 hub genes in these modules are: KCNIP4, CADM2, NRG3, ADGRB3, NRXN1, NALF1, NEGR1, FGF14, TENM2, and CUX1 (for M2), and PTPRD, LRRC4C, CNTN5, RORA, ANKS1B, NLGN1, RALYL, IQCJ-SCHIP1, SNTG1, and RIMS2 (for M3). For Ex5 neurons from BA9, we identified three candidate resilient modules: M2, M3, and M4 (Fig. 6c). A biological function network representation of these hdWGCNA genes, integrating the candidate resilience modules BA17-M2, M3 and BA9-M2, M3, M4, underscored the central roles of trans-synaptic signaling, calcium homeostasis, and neuronal excitability in resilience. Relevant genes within these modules include GRIN2A, GRM5, GRM7, CACNA1B, CACNA1C, CACNG5, KCNIP4, NALF1, NRXN1, NLGN1, NRG3, PTPRD, and FGF14 (Fig. 6d).</p>
<h1>Increased KCNIP4 expression is associated with resilience in AD</h1>
<p>We focused on KCNIP4, a gene specifically upregulated in resilient Ex5 neurons at early disease stages in both BA17 and BA9 (Fig. 6a), as a proof of principle to validate our approach for identifying genes associated with resilience. This gene encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel-interacting protein (KCHIP4 or KCNIP4) that regulates neuronal excitability. KCNIP4 also interacts with Presenilins and has been previously linked to $\mathrm{AD}^{44,45}$. Our analysis showed that KCNIP4 is predominately expressed in excitatory neurons (except Ex14; L5/6 NP) and OPCs (Fig.7a), as well as a microglia cluster characterized by high expression of synapse-related genes (cluster Microglia-Reactive-CACNA1B; Supplementary Table 2). Using ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) to estimate KCNIP4 expression across disease stage groups while controlling for fixed covariates (assay, sex, RIN, total counts) and random effects (donor), we consistently observed increased KCNIP4 expression in Ex5 as disease progressed (Fig. 7b).</p>
<p>To quantify KCNIP4 protein levels in resilient versus vulnerable neurons, we performed immunohistochemistry for KCNIP4, EYA4, and NeuN in sections of BA17 from low, intermediate, and high pathology groups (Fig. 7c). EYA4 labels L4 granule cells in the cerebral cortex and is also expressed by a subset of GABAergic interneurons, which are sparse and located predominantly in the superficial layers. The mean intensity of KCNIP4 in neuronal somas was significantly higher in L4 EYA4 ${ }^{+}$neurons at intermediate disease stages compared to controls, and lower in supragranular (L2/3) neurons at intermediate and high stages compared to controls (Fig. 7d).</p>
<p>To evaluate KCNIP4 upregulation in excitatory neurons, we induced Kcnip4 expression using AAVmediated delivery in a humanized App knock-in mouse model of familial AD $\left(\right.$ App $^{S A A} \mathrm{KI} / \mathrm{KI})^{24}$. We generated the AAV vector PHP.eB-CaMKIIa-Kcnip4-P2A-EGFP, using the PHP.eB serotype to efficiently transduce neurons in the CNS, the CaMKIIa promoter to selectively target excitatory neurons, the mouse Kcnip4 transcript, and the P2A-EGFP sequence as a reporter. As a control, we used the same AAV containing only EGFP (Fig. 8a). To evaluate the ability of the Kcnip4 AAV to increase KCNIP4 protein levels in the mouse brain, we performed Western blotting on cortex tissue lysates from 12-month-old WT mice treated with 2 different doses of Kcnip4 AAV ( $5 \times 10^{\wedge} 10 \mathrm{vg}$ and $1 \times 10^{\wedge} 11 \mathrm{vg}$, retroorbitally). Mice treated with the higher dose showed a significant increase in KCNIP4 (Fig. 8b). We injected 12-month-old homozygous App ${ }^{S A A}$ mice, which exhibit amyloid plaques, microgliosis, and plaque-associated dystrophic neurites ${ }^{24}$, with Kcnip4 AAV and control AVV ( $1 \times 10^{\wedge} 11 \mathrm{vg}$, retroorbitally). WT mice from the same genetic background and age received control AAV. Mice were sacrificed, and brain tissue was collected one month after injection. GFP ${ }^{+}$neurons were detected throughout the cerebral cortex, and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus (Fig. 8c). To estimate transduction efficiency, we quantified the percentage of $\mathrm{GFP}^{+}$neurons in cerebral cortex. In the three animal groups, GFP labeled approximately 10\% of total neuronal population (Fig. 8d). AD pathology in the treated mice was not significantly modified by Kcnip4 overexpression, as no significant differences were found in amyloid plaques (determined by an anti-human amyloid beta antibody, Fig. 8e) or in reactive astrogliosis (determined by GFAP, Fig. 8f). A trend toward decreased microgliosis was observed (as determined by IBA1 staining), although it did not reach statistical significance ( $p=0.08$ ) (Fig. 8g).</p>
<p>KCNIP4 is an integral component of Kv4 channel complexes and belongs to the EF-hand family of small calcium-binding proteins. Like other Kv channel-interacting proteins, it may control neuronal excitability by regulating A-type outward potassium currents ${ }^{46}$. Thus, we hypothesized that increased KCNIP4 expression may reduce neuronal hyperexcitability in AD. To investigate this, we quantified cFos and Arc, two immediate-early genes widely used as markers of neuronal activation ${ }^{47}$. These markers increase with excessive neuronal stimulation and seizures and have been shown to be altered in $\mathrm{AD}^{48}$. Using GFP as a marker of transduced neurons, we found that Kcnip4 AAV-mediated delivery</p>
<p>in 12-month-old $A p p^{S A A}$ mice reduced the proportion of c-Fos ${ }^{+}$neurons in the GFP ${ }^{+}$compared to GFP ${ }^{-}$ populations (Fig. 8h-k). No changes in c-Fos proportions were observed in App ${ }^{S A A}$ mice treated with control AAV. When comparing all cortical neurons in $A p p^{S A A}$ and WT mice, we found that $A p p^{S A A}$ exhibited increased levels of c-Fos, which were reversed by Kcnip4 AAV (Fig. 8i-k). We observed similar results for Arc expression, with reduced intensity in GFP ${ }^{+}$compared to GFP ${ }^{-}$neurons in $A p p^{S A A}$ mice treated with Kcnip4 AAV, and a reversal in Arc expression in treated App ${ }^{S A A}$ mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 8l-o). Thus, increased KCNIP4 expression in excitatory cortical neurons in a humanized mouse model of AD reduced c-Fos and Arc, markers of neuronal activation and hyperexcitability, suggesting a role in promoting resilience against hyperexcitability in AD.</p>
<h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
<p>Our strategy leveraged the spatiotemporal progression of AD to explore cellular resilience. The primary visual cortex exhibits mild degeneration, even in end-stage AD, yet it has not been fully explored for potential resilience factors ${ }^{9-11,49}$. Layer 4 neurons, considered resilient in AD due to low tau pathology, have not been consistently characterized in previous snRNA-seq studies. We identified a cluster, Ex5, enriched in BA17 and comprising granular L4 IT neurons, that remains relatively preserved in earlyand late-stage AD cortices. This resilience was linked to upregulated genes related to synaptic function and calcium homeostasis, including KCNIP4, suggesting compensatory mechanisms against hyperexcitability—an early feature in AD pathogenesis observed in human and animal models ${ }^{50-52}$.</p>
<p>Layer 4 cytoarchitecture varies across neocortical regions and is highly specialized in areas receiving topographic sensory input from the thalamus, such as BA17 ${ }^{19,53}$. BA17 is relatively thin, highly myelinated, and has a low interneuron-to-excitatory neuron ratio. It features an expanded L4 with high neuronal density and distinct sublayers that receive input from the LGN and project to nearby regions. Morphologically, BA17 contains different types of excitatory neurons: a dominant population of granular neurons enriched in L4c, a smaller population of pyramidal neurons enriched in L4a and L4b, and rare "giant" stellate cells arranged horizontally in L4b. In association neocortex, L4 is thin but visible, appearing discontinuous and segmented into vertical columns in some regions, blending with pyramidal neurons of layers 3 and $5^{17,31}$. Our analysis identified three distinct molecular subtypes across neocortical regions: Ex5 (CUX2/RORB/EYA4/LAMA3), Ex6 (RORB/MME), and Ex7 (RORB/GABRG1), which we validated across publicly available datasets ${ }^{3,5,8,23}$. Ex5 was overrepresented in BA17, while Ex6 and Ex7 were more prominent in association cortices (BA9, BA7). We found that the Ex5 clusterdefining genes EYA4 and KCNH8 preferentially label granule neurons in deep layer 4c, the same area receiving VGLUT2+ terminals from the LGN. Previous snRNA-seq studies of BA17 from healthy individuals have identified specialized L4 excitatory neuron subtypes with greater granularity. The Ex5 cluster closely matches L4_IT3, a dense pan-L4 marker, and includes L4_IT2 and L4_IT5, enriched in</p>
<p>layers $4 c \beta$ and $4 c \alpha$, respectively ${ }^{3}$. Our analysis validates L4 excitatory neuronal subtypes across neocortical regions and stages of AD progression, providing a framework for identifying gene expression changes associated with resilience.</p>
<p>In excitatory neurons, gene upregulation under hyperexcitability-associated conditions, such as AD, may indicate pathological hyperexcitability, a maladaptive cellular response, or a compensatory response aimed at preventing excitotoxic damage. For instance, snRNA-seq profiling of cortical biopsies from living subjects with early pathology revealed molecular and electrophysiological properties indicative of hyperactivity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons prior to their loss. This study identified the upregulation of APP, PRNP, ATP1A3, SNAP25, SYT1, and CDK5 as a signature of pathological hyperexcitability in vulnerable L2/3 IT neurons. In contrast, in resilient L4 IT neurons, we observed the upregulation of genes associated with neuroprotection-GRIN2A, RORA, NRXN1, NLGN1, NCAM2, FGF14, NRG3, NEGR1, and CSMD1—suggesting resilience and broadening our understanding of gene expression changes associated with hyperexcitability in AD.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed an early upregulation of KCNIP4 in resilient Ex5 L4 IT neurons; in contrast, KCNIP4 was downregulated in vulnerable Ex2 L2/3 IT neurons during stages of cell death, with an overall decline observed in late-stage disease. KCNIP4 is a member of the K-channel interacting proteins (KChIPs), which include KChIP1, KChIP2, KChIP3 (DREAM/calsenilin), and KChIP4 (CALP), encoded by the KCNIP1-4 genes. KChIP4 interacts with Kv4.2 channels, a subtype of voltage-gated potassium channels that are key regulators of neuronal excitability. KChIP4 expression influences the subcellular localization and biophysical properties of Kv4 channels. Increased binding of KChIP4 enhances the recovery from inactivation of Kv4.2, thereby exerting an inhibitory effect on neuronal excitability ${ }^{54}$. Additionally, KCNIP4 interacts with presenilins PSEN2 and PSEN1, potentially modulating APP processing and $A \beta$ levels ${ }^{44,55}$. Notably, KCNIP4 belongs to the recoverin branch of the EF-hand superfamily, characterized by four EF-hand calcium-binding motifs. Several members of this family have demonstrated neuroprotective properties ${ }^{56}$. Thus, KCNIP4's role in regulating neuronal excitability and APP processing may confer neuroprotection against excitotoxicity within hyperexcitable networks, particularly in response to elevated intracellular calcium levels.</p>
<p>Hyperexcitability has also been implicated as a pathogenic mechanism in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease, and is associated with aging. For example, hyperexcitability in sleep circuits can lead to sleep instability and fragmentation, particularly in older adults ${ }^{52,57-59}$. Thus, hyperexcitability may serve as an early biomarker of neurodegeneration and a therapeutic target. Recent interventions targeting neuronal hyperexcitability in AD include the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam and emerging non-pharmacological brain stimulation techniques ${ }^{60-62}$. Our study identifying neurons preserved in end-stage AD and genes associated with</p>
<p>neuronal excitability in these cells, such as KCNIP4, provides insights into cellular resilience in neurodegeneration and may guide the development of interventions to slow disease progression.</p>
<h1>METHODS</h1>
<h2>Postmortem brain tissue</h2>
<p>Brain tissue from AD and age-matched control donors was obtained from the UCLA Department of Pathology and Easton Center, the NIH Neurobiobank (Sepulveda repository in Los Angeles, CA, and Mt. Sinai Brain Bank in New York City, New York), and Stanford's Department of Pathology and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. AD neuropathology was evaluated by a neuropathologist using the ABC score (National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework criteria) ${ }^{10}$. Relevant information such as age, sex, ethnicity, brain weight, and postmortem interval (PMI) were recorded when available. APOE genotyping was performed using the SNP Genotyping service from Genewiz (Azenta Life Sciences) with genomic DNA isolated from fresh-frozen brain tissue samples. No cases with imaging or gross findings consistent with large vessel territorial infarction, hemorrhage, primary or metastatic neoplasms, or CNS infection were included. Cases with histological evidence of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury were excluded. Tissue blocks selected for snRNA-seq underwent immunohistochemical assessment, including H\&amp;E and Nissl stains to confirm tissue integrity and the absence of microinfarcts or other focal pathologies. NeuN immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm the absence of decreased NeuN immunostaining, which could bias the sorting of NeuN ${ }^{+}$neuronal nuclei by FANS. Tau and amyloid immunohistochemistry were also performed to assess the extent of pathology in the same blocks utilized for snRNA-seq.</p>
<p>The tissue samples were collected from three regions: the prefrontal cortex (BA9), precuneus (BA7), and primary visual cortex (BA17), encompassing all stages of disease progression. A total of 46 donors contributed to the study ( 42 for BA9, 15 for BA7, and 24 for BA17). The stages of disease progression were categorized into three groups: low pathology (18 donors; 6 females, 12 males), intermediate pathology ( 10 donors; 7 females, 3 males), and high pathology ( 18 donors; 12 females, 6 males). The criteria for each group were based on the presence and distribution of tau aggregates, according to the Braak staging system ${ }^{9}$, and of amyloid pathology, including diffuse and neuritic amyloid plaques. The density of neuritic amyloid plaques was semi-quantified using the CERAD (C) staging system ${ }^{63}$. The low pathology group included cases with no tau or amyloid pathology, with low AD neuropathologic change (AD), and cases of primary age-related tauopathy (PART), a pathology associated with aging that features NFTs with similar morphology and distribution as in AD in the absence of amyloid ${ }^{64}$. The PART cases in this study had a Braak stage I-III. The intermediate pathology group included cases with Braak stage III-IV and diffuse plaques or sparse (C1) neuritic plaques. The high pathology group</p>
<p>included cases with Braak stage V-VI and moderate (C2) or abundant (C3) neuritic plaques. The mean age of the donors in the low, intermediate, and high pathology groups were $70.5 \pm 9.2,81.9 \pm 13.6$, and $82.4 \pm 10.4$ years, respectively.</p>
<p>RNA integrity number (RIN) was measured in all the tissue blocks selected for snRNA-seq. Total RNA extraction from $\sim 20 \mathrm{mg}$ of tissue was performed using Trizol reagent followed the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen cat # 74134) according to the manufacturer instructions. Purified RNA was quantified using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 RNA Nano chips (Agilent Technologies cat # 5067-1511) according to the manufacturer instructions. There were no significant differences in the RIN ( $5.8 \pm 0.7,6.2 \pm 0.7$, and $6.2 \pm 0.7$, respectively) and in the PMI ( $15.6 \pm 8.2,12.8 \pm 8.2$, and $13.8 \pm 9.7$ hours, respectively) between the low, intermediate, and high pathology groups.</p>
<h1>Single nuclear isolation and neuronal nuclei enrichment</h1>
<p>The fresh-frozen brain tissue blocks ( $\sim 3 \times 2 \times 0.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ ) were stored at $-80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Adequate orientation of the blocks was ensured to enable full-thickness sectioning of the cortical ribbon with a proper representation of all layers. To that end, thick sections ( $\sim 500 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) were cut spanning the entire thickness of the cerebral cortex, from the leptomeninges to the underlying white matter. The cryostat was set at $-12^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to facilitate the cutting of these thick sections while preserving the remaining tissue block frozen for further experiments. Under a stereomicroscope, the tissue slices were dissected to remove the white matter and leptomeninges. For each experiment, $\sim 100 \mathrm{mg}$ of cortical gray matter was utilized. To prevent further RNA degradation, all subsequent steps were conducted on ice under RNase-free conditions. The tissue was chopped into small pieces ( $&lt;1 \mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ ) using a chilled razor blade and homogenized with a Dounce tissue grinder (Kimble cat # 885300-0007). Each tissue sample was dissociated in 2.4 mL of homogenization buffer containing 10 mM Tris $\mathrm{pH} 8,5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}{ }_{2}, 25 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}$, 250 mM sucrose, $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ DTT, 0.5 x protease inhibitor (cOmplete, Roche cat # 46931590010), $0.2 \mathrm{U} / \mu \mathrm{L}$ RNase inhibitor, and 0.1\% Triton X-100. Typically, 30 grinder strokes with pestle B (0.020-0.056 mm clearance) were required. Microscopic examination using a hemocytometer was conducted to assess the number of nuclei and the presence of clumps and debris. The homogenates were subsequently filtered through a $40-\mu \mathrm{m}$ cell strainer and transferred into two $1.5-\mathrm{mL}$ Eppendorf tubes.</p>
<p>Iodixanol gradient centrifugation was used to further clean-up the nuclei and remove myelin debris. The homogenate was first centrifuged at $1000 \times \mathrm{g}$ for 8 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were gently resuspended in $450 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of homogenization buffer. An equal volume ( $450 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ ) of $50 \%$ $\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v}$ iodixanol medium ( 41.25 mM sucrose, $24.75 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl2}, 10 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris [pH 8], and $50 \%$ $\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v}$ iodixanol) was added to the homogenate and gently mixed with a pipette. The mixture was then transferred to a new 2-mL Eppendorf tube containing $900 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of $29 \%$ iodixanol medium ( 125 mM sucrose, $75 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 15 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl2}, 30 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris [pH 8], and $29 \% \mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v}$ iodixanol) by slow layering on the</p>
<p>top. The tubes were centrifuged at $13,500 \times \mathrm{g}$ for 20 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, resulting in the sedimentation of nuclei. The top layer, containing abundant myelin, and the supernatant were removed and discarded carefully, avoiding contamination of the nuclei pellet. The pellets were detached by carefully pipetting with $\sim 50$ $\mu \mathrm{L}$ of immunostaining buffer ( 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline [PBS; pH 7.4], $0.5 \%$ bovine serum albumin [BSA], $5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}{ }_{2}, 2 \mathrm{U} / \mathrm{mL}$ DNAse I, and $0.2 \mathrm{U} / \mu \mathrm{L}$ RNase inhibitor), transferred to clean tubes, and gently resuspended in a total volume of $200 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of immunostaining buffer. After a $15-\mathrm{min}$ incubation with immunostaining buffer, at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, with gentle rocking, NeuN primary antibody was added (mouse anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody, 1:1000, Millipore Sigma, MAB377), and incubated for 40 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with gentle rocking. The samples were then washed by adding $500 \mu \mathrm{~L}$ of immunostaining buffer and centrifuging at $500 \times \mathrm{g}$ for 5 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in immunostaining buffer containing goat-anti-mouse antibody (Alexa Fluor 647, 1:500) and a nuclear stain (Hoechst 34580; 2,5 $\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml}$ ). Aliquots of unstained, only secondary antibody-treated, and singlestained (Hoechst, NeuN) nuclei were saved for use as controls. The number and integrity of the nuclei were evaluated microscopically after each critical step and before FANS. The typical yield for $\sim 100 \mathrm{mg}$ of cerebral cortex tissue was between $1-3 \times 10^{6}$ nuclei.</p>
<p>FANS was used to collect two single nuclear suspensions per sample (NeuN ${ }^{+}$and all nuclei). Sorting was performed using a BD FACSAria II or a Sony SH800. The sheath fluid consisted of PBS with a sheath pressure of 20 psi . Sorting was performed using a $100-\mu \mathrm{m}$ nozzle tip or microfluidic sorting chip $(100-\mu \mathrm{m})$. For the excitation of forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), a 488-nm laser was employed. Hoechst 34580 and Alexa Fluor 647 were excited using 405-nm and 640-nm lasers, respectively. FANS gating was performed in the following order: FSC height vs. SSC height; SSC area vs. Hoechst fluorescence (bandpass filter 450/50); and Alexa Fluor 647 (bandpass filter 665/30) vs. Hoechst fluorescence. The FSC versus SSC gates were set with permissive limits to discard the smallest and largest particles. Hoechst fluorescence was used to distinguish single nuclei from doublets, clumps, and damaged nuclei. Alexa Fluor 647 was used to distinguish neuronal (NeuN ${ }^{+}$) from non-neuronal nuclei. Controls including unstained, only secondary antibody-treated, and only single primary antibody-treated cell suspensions were included to adjust gates thresholds and minimize false positives from nonspecific staining or autofluorescence. Two populations, all nuclei (Hoechst ${ }^{+}$) and neuronal nuclei (Hoechst ${ }^{+ / N e u N}{ }^{+}$), were collected. The sorted nuclear suspensions were collected in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes containing 100-200 $\mu \mathrm{L}$ of collection buffer consisting of 0.1 M PBS, pH 7.4 , and $0.1 \mathrm{U} / \mu \mathrm{L}$ RNase inhibitor. After collection, BSA was added to each tube for a final concentration of $1 \%$. To prevent nuclei from adhering to the tube walls, the collection tubes were precoated with BSA. Precoating was performed by filling the tubes with $10 \%$ BSA in PBS for 5 min , followed by rinsing with PBS and drying overnight at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.</p>
<p>We used either a modified Drop-seq method ${ }^{65}$ or the standard 10x Genomics Chromium Single Cell 3' v2 or v3 assays to profile the transcriptomes of nuclei from postmortem human brain tissue. For Dropseq, the input single nuclei were diluted to a concentration of 200 nuclei/ $\mu$ l. To encapsulate individual nuclei and barcoded beads (Chemgenes, cat # Makosko-2011-10), we employed a microfluidic system (FlowJEM) and adjusted the flow parameters to generate $\sim 100 \mu \mathrm{l}(\sim 0.5 \mathrm{nl}$ ) droplets (nuclei loading concentration: 200 nuclei/ $\mu$ l; bead concentration: 165 beads/ $\mu$ l; flow rate: $3 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{h}$ ). With these parameters, both the cell occupancy and the expected doublet rates were $\sim 5 \%$. These rates were confirmed by observing the beads and Hoechst" nuclei within the droplets by fluorescent microscopy. Standard methods proved challenging for digesting nuclear membranes from human brain nuclei, resulting in low transcript detection. To overcome this, we tested various lysis methods (sarkosyl, SDS, and triton) at different concentrations, with or without heat. Lysis buffers containing 1\% sarkosyl yielded optimal results without disrupting droplet generation. Furthermore, brief heating of the dropletencapsulated nuclei ( 5 min at $72^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) improved lysis efficiency. Reverse transcription and PCR amplification followed previously described protocols ${ }^{65}$. PCR reactions, each containing 4,000 beads (i.e., 200 nuclei), were individually run and subsequently pooled (typically 5-15 PCR tubes, i.e., 1,000-3000 nuclei) for library preparation and sequencing.</p>
<p>For 10x Genomics, the input single nuclei were centrifuged at $400 \times \mathrm{g}$ for 5 min at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to achieve a concentration of $\sim 350$ nuclei per $\mu \mathrm{L}$. Nuclear concentrations were determined using a hemocytometer. On average, $\sim 12,500$ nuclei were loaded to capture around 5,000 nuclei per sample (with an expected capture efficiency of $\sim 40 \%$ ). cDNA amplification and library construction followed the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>The paired-end libraries generated by Drop-seq or 10x Genomics were sequenced on either Illumina NextSeq 500 or Novaseq 6000 platforms. A total of 243 samples (184 Drop-seq and 59 10x Genomics) were sequenced in 37 sequencing batches. For each sequencing batch, the concentration of each sample was normalized to the total number of nuclei to ensure similar numbers of reads per nucleus. Nuclei were sequenced to a depth of $\sim 75,000$ reads per nucleus.</p>
<h1>Preprocessing, quality control, and integration of snRNA-seq data</h1>
<p>The paired-end raw sequence reads were preprocessed using the Kallisto bustools package (kbpython:0.26.0) ${ }^{66}$. An alignment index was constructed based on the human reference pre-mRNA (GRCh38, Ensembl 105). Following the Lamanno workflow, we generated separate count matrices for spliced and unspliced transcripts. These matrices were then merged to obtain the total nucleus count matrix. The quantification of total transcriptome abundance was performed for each of the three matrices. Downstream analysis, including quality control, integration, cell type annotations, and differential gene expression, was performed using the unspliced transcript counts.</p>
<p>Empty droplets were removed by comparison with ambient RNA levels using the DropletUtils package ${ }^{67}$. The identification of empty droplets was performed by analyzing the knee and inflection points on the cumulative transcript counts plots for each sample individually. Nuclei with an FDR $&lt;0.05$ were removed, resulting in a total of 665,407 nuclei. Further filtering was applied to exclude nuclei with fewer than 200 genes, leaving 549,074 nuclei.</p>
<p>To identify potential doublets, we used the DoubletFinder package version $4.2^{68}$. Among the 10x Genomics samples, an average doublet rate of $2.85 \%$ and $1.74 \%$ was detected in v2 and v3 samples, respectively, while the Dropseq samples had a doublet rate of $0.003 \%$. The identified doublets were labeled and retained during batch correction and data integration. Following clustering and dataset annotation, the majority of labeled doublets clustered together. These clusters, containing doublets, were excluded from further downstream analysis.</p>
<p>To analyze the raw count data, we used Scanpy in the python package version 3.9.1 ${ }^{69}$. First, we used a series of preprocessing steps for normalization and scaling. Highly variable genes were identified using default parameters and a dispersion threshold of 0.5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensionality, generating 50 principal components. Subsequently, a neighborhood graph was constructed using default parameters with 15 neighbors, and Leiden graph-based clustering was performed using correlation distance metrics. To address batch effects and integrate data from different brain regions and disease stages, we evaluated various methods for batch correction and integration, including SCT, Harmony, BBKNN, and Scvi-tools. We selected Harmony (v1.2.2769) ${ }^{70}$ as the integration method based on silhouette score values of 0.8 or higher, as well as visual inspection of UMAP plots representing experimental assay, sequencing batch, donor, brain region, disease stage, sex, and UMI abundance. The selected integration variables were the experimental assay (Dropseq, 10x Genomics v2, and 10x Genomics v3) along with brain region (BA9, BA7, and BA17). After integration, the neighborhood graph and Leiden graph-based clustering were generated again. Marker genes for each cluster were determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with a significance threshold of adjusted p-value (padj) $&lt;0.05$.</p>
<p>The integrated dataset contained 549,074 nuclei. To further optimize the lower gene cutoff, thresholds from 200 to 500 genes were tested, and 300 genes were chosen as the final cutoff. All clusters comprised nuclei from every donor, and no clusters exclusively contained nuclei with low UMI counts. Three small clusters containing doublets, totaling 17,442 nuclei, were excluded. Mitochondrial gene content was measured and annotated, but only outlier nuclei with higher than 5\% mitochondrial genes (1,778 nuclei) were discarded, resulting in a total of 424,528 high-quality nuclei (362,224 neuronal and 62,304 non-neuronal) for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Major cell type, neuronal subtype, and glial cell state annotations</p>
<p>The major neuronal and non-neuronal populations were identified based on the expression of known marker genes: SLC17A7 (excitatory neuron), GAD1 (inhibitory neuron), FGFR3, AQP4, and GFAP (astrocyte), CSF1R, CX3CR1, and CD163 (microglia), PLP1 and MOG (oligodendrocyte), PDGFRA and CSPG4 (OPC), CLDN5 and FLT1 (endothelial), NOTCH3 (pericyte), and CYP1B1 and COL15A1 (VLMC).</p>
<p>These major cell type clusters were subsetted and reclustered within the integrated PC space to identify neuronal subtypes and glial states. Clustering reliability was determined based on silhouette score values of 0.8 or higher and WCSS (Within Cluster Sum of Squares). The first 30 PCs and a resolution of 1.0 were employed for both the excitatory subset (282,930 nuclei) and the inhibitory subset (79,294 nuclei). Marker genes for each cluster were ranked using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with the following criteria: minimum expression fraction (either in the tested cluster or in all other nuclei combined) of 0.2, log-fold change $&gt;0.5$, padj $&lt;0.05$. After merging two excitatory clusters that lacked marker genes to reliably distinguish between them and discarding two small inhibitory clusters (207 nuclei) with mixed markers, a total of 18 excitatory (Ex) and 19 inhibitory (In) clusters were obtained. We visualized the UMAP with a minimum distance of 0.6 and a spread of 1.4.</p>
<p>To identify the top marker genes for each cluster, the following criteria were applied: expression fraction within the cluster (pts) $&gt;0.2$; expression fraction within all other nuclei (pts_rest) $&lt;0.1$; ratio pts/pts_rest $&gt;3$; log-fold change $&gt;1.5$; and padj $&lt;0.05$. For Ex1, Ex2, and Ex5, the pts_rest was set at $&lt;0.2$ and the ratio pts/pts_rest was set at $&gt;2$. The clusters were named based on canonical markers for major subclasses (i.e., CUX2, RORB, THEMIS, and FEZF2 for excitatory; and LHX6 and ADARB2 for inhibitory), followed by 1-3 top marker genes. Additionally, we compiled gene sets consisting of 7-10 genes for each neuronal subtype, selected from the top marker genes. These marker genes and gene sets precisely labeled each of our annotated neuronal subtypes in our dataset and a reference dataset ${ }^{23}$, and thus are useful to identify neuronal subtypes computationally and by histology.</p>
<p>To compare our neuronal clusters and their marker genes with a reference dataset, we utilized a publicly available dataset containing over one million neuronal nuclei from the DLPFC of donors with dementia and healthy controls ${ }^{23}$. To determine the degree of similarity between the annotations in the two datasets, we subset both count matrices keeping only highly variable genes (3,000 genes), identified the top 10 markers for each cluster, and calculated the cosine similarity distance between the mean expression values of genes for each cluster. A lower distance in the similarity matrix indicates a higher level of agreement.</p>
<p>The non-neuronal subset clusters included: astrocytes (14,691), microglia (5,071), oligodendrocytes $(36,589)$, OPCs $(5,770)$, and vascular cells (183). These populations were reclustered using the first 10 PCs, with a resolution of 0.3 for astrocytes, 0.2 for microglia and oligodendrocytes, and 0.1 for other</p>
<p>types. The top marker genes for each cluster were identified using the same method as for the neuronal clusters, using the following thresholds: pts $&gt;0.2$; pts_rest &lt; 0.1; ratio of pts/pts_rest &gt; 2.5; log-fold change &gt; 1.0; and padj &lt; 0.05. We annotated 4 astrocyte, 4 microglia, and 2 oligodendrocyte cell states. Other non-neuronal types were not subclassified further due to their relatively low nucleus numbers.</p>
<h1>Cell identity prediction using scANVI</h1>
<p>We employed the scANVI ${ }^{71}$ machine learning method to predict the identity of unannotated neuronal nuclei with relatively low UMI counts from our dataset and to predict the identity of neuronal populations from public datasets using the annotations from our dataset. For model training, we utilized our excitatory (18 neuronal clusters) and inhibitory (19 neuronal clusters) datasets as training set. We selected 2,000 highly variable genes and the top 200 marker genes for each cluster (Wilcoxon rank sum test, log-fold change $&gt;0.8$, padj $&lt;0.05$ ), along with our cell-type-specific gene sets. The model underwent training for a maximum 200 epochs with 3 layers and 50 latent spaces. To address batch effects during training, we introduced a combined batch effect key considering both the profiling assay (DropSeq, 10x v2, 10x v3) and brain region (BA9, BA7, and BA17). We monitored model convergence and loss for each epoch using an elbow plot to determine the optimal number of epochs for effective convergence. To prevent overfitting, we employed a single-layer perceptron with the 'linear_classifier' parameter set to 'True', promoting model simplicity and reducing bias towards the training data. Additionally, we applied the var activation (torch.nn.functional.softplus) function to ensure stable optimization. To represent rare cell types adequately, we set the 'n_samples_per_label' to 1000. Probabilities of cell cluster assignments from the latent space were computed using the 'soft' function, providing a confidence measure for each prediction. Model accuracy was assessed by comparing true labels with predictions using sensitivity and specificity measures. Additionally, we conducted differential testing using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, employing predicted annotations to validate the reliability of the neuronal subtypes inferred from our predictions. We assigned identity to query data using a probability threshold of 0.99 to minimize false positives. We predicted excitatory cell identity labels for five public reference datasets (SEA-AD DLPFC and MTG; Mathys et al., 2023; Green et al., 2024; Jorstad et al. 2023) ${ }^{3,5,8,23}$ to demonstrate that the pretrained model can be applied across datasets.</p>
<h2>Neuronal subtype proportion quantification</h2>
<p>To quantify the relative proportions of each neuronal subtype within each disease group (low, intermediate, high pathology) and each region (BA9, BA7, BA17), we calculated the relative abundance of each subtype per donor in relation to all neurons and either excitatory or inhibitory neurons. To test for statistically significant differences in cell composition among disease groups, we conducted three different analyses: beta regression (modeled for data measured as proportions), Kruskal-Wallis H test (a rank-based nonparametric test for non-normally distributed data), and a linear mixed model (for</p>
<p>modeling variances and covariances). Each of the three analyses was conducted both with and without the inclusion of nuclei with relatively low UMI counts (200-300 genes per nucleus), as annotated by scANVI predictions.</p>
<p>For beta regression, we utilized the R package betareg version 3.1-4 with the formula Relative.Abundance Condition and the bias-corrected maximum likelihood estimator ( $\mathrm{R}&gt;$ betareg(Relative.Abundance Condition, data=data, type="BC")). We excluded data from two donors for BA9 and one donor for BA17 from this analysis due to their low cell counts ( $&lt;500$ nuclei). To account for multiple hypothesis testing, we applied Holm's method to adjust the p-values obtained from beta regression using the 'p.adjust' function of the R Stats package, considering the number of tested neuronal subtypes as the 'length' variable.</p>
<p>We conducted linear mixed modeling using both absolute cell counts and cell proportions. The fixed covariate was profiling assay (Dropseq, 10x v2, and 10x v3). Donor was considered a random effect. Our analysis focused on evaluating the differences in each neuronal subtype across the disease group (used as a predictor), with the low pathology group serving as the reference category. Subsequently, we computed the coefficients, t-values, p-values, and corresponding Z-scores for each neuronal subtype, and applied the Benjamin-Hochberg correction to account for false positives in the p-values.</p>
<p>Differential population analysis was performed using scCODA ${ }^{34}$, which applies a Bayesian model to assess significant changes in cell populations. We generated raw count data (donor * Author_Annotation) for each brain region (BA9 and BA17), with donor as the covariate. We then calculated cell type proportions, fitted the Bayesian model to the data, and evaluated the effects across disease progression groups.</p>
<h1>Spatial transcriptomics</h1>
<p>We used the 10x Genomics Visium platform (Spatial 3' v1 chemistry) to spatially map 37 neuronal subtypes (18 excitatory and 19 inhibitory), astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, OPCs, and microglia in freshfrozen tissue sections from the neocortex of AD and healthy control donors. A total of 16 tissue sections were studied, including controls (BA9, BA7, BA17, motor cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus from a control donor, and two additional sections of BA9 and BA7 from another donor) as well as AD (BA9 and BA7 from 3 donors with high AD pathology and BA9 from 2 donors with intermediate pathology). The sections were cut at a thickness of $12 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ on a cryostat and mounted on fiduciary frames of four 10x slides. H\&amp;E staining was performed, and the slides were temporarily coverslipped with mounting medium ( $85 \%$ glycerol containing $0.2 \mathrm{U} / \mu \mathrm{L}$ RNAse inhibitor) and digitally scanned at 200x magnification using a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 microscope equipped with a color digital camera (Axiocam) and MBF Stereo Investigator with a 2D slide scanning extension module. Permeabilization enzyme treatment was applied to the tissue for 15 minutes at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, as determined by the Tissue</p>
<p>Optimization protocol provided by 10x Visium. Reverse transcription, second strand synthesis, and cDNA amplification were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. We utilized the targeted Human Neuroscience gene expression panel, which consists of 1,186 genes, and supplemented it with a custom panel comprising 197 cell type-specific marker genes. The marker genes were selected from our snRNA-seq dataset based on their specificity to label our annotated neuronal clusters and their expression levels. The custom hybridization capture panel oligos were obtained from IDT (IDT NGS Discovery Pools). Library sequencing was performed on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform at a depth of 15,000 reads per spot, resulting in a sequencing saturation of approximately $96 \%$. This 1,383 gene panel provides a cost-efficient tool for mapping neuronal vulnerability in the human AD brain while allowing to sequence at a $90 \%$ lower cost compared to whole transcriptome sequencing. To evaluate the quality of our spatial data, we used the 10x Space Ranger pipeline, which maps the transcriptomic data on the high-resolution microscopic images. On average, we detected 1,336 out of the total 1,383 targeted genes. The median number of targeted genes and UMI counts detected per spot were 221 and 392, respectively.</p>
<h1>Integration of snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics</h1>
<p>We used Stereoscope ${ }^{72}$ to integrate the spatial transcriptomics (ST) data generated with 10x Genomics Visium and the snRNA-seq data. First, we subsetted the snRNA-seq data based on the genes present in the Visium spatial transcriptomics dataset ( 1,383 genes). We trained variation auto encoder model using the snRNA-seq data to construct a single-cell reference latent variable for inferring cell typespecific gene expression patterns. For model training, we used the following parameters: layer = 'unspliced'; labels_key = 'Author_Annotation'; max epochs = 200. We checked the model convergence by elbow plot. Then, we trained the spatial model using the Visium data and the pre-trained snRNAseq data for a maximum of 2000 epochs. This allowed us to identify cell types using negative binomial latent variables. We performed different iterations to visualize cell populations in the Visium space considering different combinations of cell types (i.e., all major cell types; each of the excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and glial populations; and each excitatory neuronal subtype). To visualize each of the cell subtypes in each ST tissue section slide, we utilized the matplotlib and seaborn plotting Python packages.</p>
<h2>Co-expression network analysis</h2>
<p>We performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on our high-dimensional snRNA-seq data using the hdWGCNA R package ${ }^{73}$ to compute co-expression gene modules of interconnected genes within each neuronal cell subtype and brain region. We constructed meta-cells using the following parameters: group.by = "Author_Annotation", $k=25$, and minimum cell threshold of 50. After constructing the meta-cells, we normalized the object using default parameters, including the</p>            </div>
