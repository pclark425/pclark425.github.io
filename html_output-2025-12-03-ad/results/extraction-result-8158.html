                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent. The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps. During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries. Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p>

Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications.However, LLM agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious.In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, without assuming that the attacker can directly modify the memory bank of the agent.The attacker injects malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via queries and output observations.These malicious records are designed to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to a different target query during the agent's execution of the victim user's query.Specifically, we introduce a sequence of bridging steps to link victim queries to the malicious reasoning steps.During the memory injection, we propose an indication prompt that guides the agent to autonomously generate similar bridging steps, with a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when processing later victim queries.Our extensive experiments across diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent memory.With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to influence agent memory, highlighting the risk.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated strong capabilities across various applications, such as autonomous driving [8,19,24], finance [46,11], healthcare [1,29,31], code generation [17,16], and web tasks [10,54,52].Compared with standalone LLMs, an LLM agent is typically equipped with a planning module, an array of tools, and a memory bank [36].These additional modules facilitate LLM agents in tackling intricate real-world problems via context-rich reasoning, interaction with the environment, and learning from past experiences [50].</p>
<p>As one of the key features distinguishing LLM agents from LLMs, the memory of LLM agents can be divided into short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) [49].STM serves as a temporal workspace that retains an agent's reasoning and actions while processing the current input query.Conversely, LTM maintains records of the agent's past interactions with the environment, typically encapsulating both the input queries to the agent and their corresponding outputs.When a new query is presented, the most relevant records will be retrieved from the memory bank as demonstrations for effective task execution.</p>
<p>Despite performance improvements, the integration of the LTM also introduces potential security concerns.If the memory bank is compromised, the malicious records retrieved for demonstration may mislead the agent, significantly increasing the risk of malicious outputs.Consider an autonomous driving agent, for example [24].If the memory bank is poisoned with records that execute 'stop' at an extremely high speed, users may experience a sudden stop when driving on a freeway, potentially causing a fatal accident.</p>
<p>There are recent attempts exploring this threat [5].They often assume that the attacker can poison the memory bank by directly manipulating the memory bank and primarily focus on designing the malicious record that is most effective in eliciting harmful outputs when retrieved for demonstration.For instance, the malicious records of AgentPoison [5] are designed with a trigger in the agent input and an adversarial target in the agent output.The attacker needs to directly inject these malicious records into the agent's memory bank to elicit target output for test queries containing the same trigger.However, this assumption faces a tremendous feasibility challenge where the attacker often does not have privileged access to the agent's memory bank or other users' queries; they often can only interact with the agent via queries and output observations.Given these constraints, we ask the following question:</p>
<p>Is it still feasible for the attacker to inject malicious records into the agent's memory bank?</p>
<p>If the answer is affirmative, then technically, any user of the agent could potentially become an attacker, posing immense safety concerns in various applications involving LLM agents.However, these constraints on an attacker's capabilities make memory injection particularly challenging.Without direct access to modify the memory, the attacker is limited to inducing malicious responses through carefully crafted queries.Furthermore, the inherent logic gap between a benign query and the desired malicious reasoning steps creates additional obstacles to a successful injection.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, against LLM agents that injects specially designed malicious records into the agent's memory bank solely through interacting with the agent.For any query from a prescribed victim user containing a specific victim term (e.g. the patient ID in the context of a medical agent), MINJA aims to elicit a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to the same query but with the victim term replaced by a target term (e.g. the ID of another patient with different prescriptions), leading to a harmful agent decision that could be fatal.Thus, malicious records to be injected are designed with the same victim term in the input query and a sequence of malicious reasoning steps corresponding to the same target term in the agent output.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints on the attacker's capabilities, the agent output in each malicious record can only be generated by the agent itself.However, directly generating the malicious reasoning steps from benign queries without the target term is almost infeasible for the agent.Thus, we propose a set of specially designed bridging steps as the intermediate steps to logically connect the benign query and the desired malicious reasoning steps.We also propose an indication prompt appended to the benign query to induce the agent to generate both the bridging steps and the malicious reasoning steps autonomously.Finally, we propose a novel progressive shortening strategy to gradually remove the indication prompt, leading to malicious records with plausible benign queries that can be easily retrieved when executing the victim user's query.Our main contributions are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>• We propose MINJA, a novel memory injection attack on LLM agents that injects malicious records, solely via queries, to trigger malicious reasoning for queries containing a certain victim term.• We evaluate MINJA on three agents designed for highly distinct tasks and consider four different types of victim-target pairs.Across all settings, MINJA achieves a high average success rate of 98.2% for injecting malicious records into the memory, and a high average attack success rate of 76.8% in eliciting the malicious reasoning steps.• MINJA uncovers critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents under much weaker attack assumptions than prior works, where attackers are limited to interacting with the agent via querying and observing its outputs, therefore posing significant real-world risks.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>LLM Agents &amp; Memory Utilization LLM agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive the environment, process information, and execute actions to achieve specific objectives [36].They are widely applied across various domains, including healthcare [29,31], commerce [46,11], web tasks [10,54,52], and security [38].LLM agents typically employ an LLM for reasoning-based task planning and utilize a variety of tools for task execution [43,30].A crucial component common to most LLM agents is a memory bank that stores records from past activities, serving as a reference for future task execution [49].Recent studies have focused on enhancing the effectiveness of memory storage and utilization by developing innovative memory management strategies [44,47,53].However, the risks associated with the agent memory bank are severely underexplored [9], with only a few works addressing this emergent issue [5].In this paper, we explore the risks associated with the current agent memory design -we show that the memory bank can be easily compromised through interaction with the agent.</p>
<p>Poisoning of Agent Memory Recent works studying the influence of poisoned memory of LLM agents are mainly inspired by backdoor attacks targeting neural networks.A conventional backdoor attack seeks to elicit targeted output for inputs containing a special trigger by poisoning the model's training data [13,22,4,3,48,28,23]. Different from the training data of a model, records in the memory bank serve as in-context demonstrations of LLM agents during inference only, creating a new paradigm where conventional backdoor attacks are not applicable.In the first backdoor attack against LLMs for in-context learning, the demonstrations are assumed to be poisoned with a special trigger in the input and an adversarial target in the demonstrative output [37].The attack effectively elicits the same adversarial target during inference when the input query is injected with the same trigger.This attack was then extended to LLM agents, demonstrating a stronger attack performance using an optimized trigger [5].However, these attacks focus on the design of malicious records or demonstrations; they assume that the attacker can directly inject the malicious records into the agent's memory bank.Conversely, MINJA addresses the challenge of memory injection without direct memory manipulation; the attacker is also not allowed to inject any trigger into other users' queries.These additional constraints make our problem more challenging than the existing ones.</p>
<p>Threat Model</p>
<p>Agent Settings We consider a reasoning-based agent pipeline where for each input user query q, the agent generates a sequence of reasoning steps R q that inform the subsequent actions through in-context learning [37].The in-context demonstrations are retrieved from a long-term memory bank storing records from past use cases, each consisting of a user query and the corresponding reasoning steps.Specifically, k past records will be retrieved based on query similarity to create a prompt {(q 1 , R q1 ), (q 2 , R q2 ), . . ., (q k , R q k ), q} when generating R q for the query q.This memory retrieval mechanism is widely adopted by many existing agents, as will be validated in Appendix I.After the execution of query q, the user will provide feedback as the basis for the agent to decide whether or not the record (q, R q ) will be stored in the memory bank, which is a common practice in AI applications, including Waymo [33], ChatGPT [26], Alexa [2], and many others.</p>
<p>Attacker's Objectives Consider a victim user whose query q v contains a victim term v prescribed by the attacker.The attacker's objective is to manipulate the agent's outputs by poisoning its memory bank, such that for the victim query q v , the agent generates a target sequence of reasoning steps R qt corresponding to a target query q t .Here, q t is nearly identical to q v except that the victim entity v is replaced with a designated target entity t.Specifically, the attacker aims to poison the memory bank by injecting a set of malicious records before the victim user interacts with the agent.These injected malicious records are expected to be retrieved as in-context demonstrations for the victim user's query q v , guiding the agent's reasoning to generate R qt .</p>
<p>Consider a medical agent for example.An attacker sets their sights on a potential victim with a specific patient ID v.For any medical query q v by this victim containing ID v, such as "retrieving user v's prescription from the database", the attacker aims to have the agent respond to the same query but for an alternative target patient t.In other words, if the attack is successful, the agent's reasoning for q v will be R qt associated with the target query q t : "retrieving user t's prescription from the database".As a consequence, the victim user will potentially consume the incorrect prescription, posing a serious risk to their health and even life.</p>
<p>Realistic Constraints and Assumptions</p>
<p>In contrast to prior work that relies on strong assumptions, such as the attacker having privileged access to directly manipulate the agent's memory or inject triggers into other users' queries [5,55,37], we consider a more challenging and realistic threat model with the following constraints: 1) The attacker behaves like a regular user and cannot directly manipulate any part of the agent beyond what is accessible to them.This includes the agent's responses and records stored in the memory bank.</p>
<p>2) The attacker cannot modify or interfere with queries from victim users.We do, however, make one assumption about the agent system that a shared memory bank is adopted to support the execution of all user queries.This design is common in existing agent frameworks due to deployment and performance considerations (e.g., the need for substantial execution records from diverse use cases) [12,18,29,24,20,7].For example, ChatGPT [27] recently released the "Improve the model for everyone" enabling all users to share their saved memories.Even in agent systems with isolated memory, identity disguise strategies, such as account hijacking, remain far more feasible than the designer-level or system-level privileges assumed by previous attacks.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>To achieve the attacker's objective, an ideal malicious record should contain an attack query a v containing victim v, and target reasoning steps R at related to target t.Since the victim v and target t are totally different terms, there exists a logic gap between the attack query a v and target reasoning steps R at (as well as q v and R qt ).Therefore, a dedicated design of malicious records is required so that the agent can be misled to generate a coherent logic chain between q v and R qt when the malicious record is retrieved for demonstration.Another obstacle comes from the realistic constraints that prevent direct manipulation of records.As a result, attackers must rely on inducing the agent to autonomously generate and store malicious records.In general, we face two significant challenges: 1) What design of malicious records can effectively mislead the agent?; and 2) How to induce agents to generate and inject these malicious records autonomously?</p>
<p>To solve the first challenge, we introduce bridging steps, to logically connect a v and R at in the malicious record (Section 4.1), hoping the agent to learn this connection when responding to q v .To handle the second challenge, we append an indication prompt after a v to induce the generation of bridging steps and use a novel progressive shortening strategy to gradually remove the indication prompt (Section 4.2).An overview of our method is shown in Figure 1, and details are presented in the following sections.</p>
<p>Design Malicious Records with Bridging Steps</p>
<p>To fill in the logic gap between a v and R at , we introduce "bridging steps" b v,t in the response of malicious records, which has the capability to logically connect a v with R at .</p>
<p>As for the design of the bridging steps, it can not be tailored to specific victim queries as the victim user can input an arbitrary query containing v. Therefore, we craft general reasoning steps connecting v and t, ensuring that b v,t redirects any attack query a v to the corresponding target query a t .As shown in the left side of Figure 1, the bridging steps connecting the victim patient ID "A" and target patient ID "B" can be "Data of A saved under B".These bridging steps should appear at the beginning of the reasoning steps in each malicious record so that when the record is retrieved, the agent will also generate b v,t first for the victim query, establishing the desired logical connection.</p>
<p>Moreover, we also need to ensure that injected malicious records can be retrieved with high probability.</p>
<p>Since the agent retrieves records based on query similarity, the queries in malicious records should resemble benign queries.Specifically, they should avoid any rare or abnormal content that might prevent retrieval when a new benign query containing the victim term is input.For example, in Figure 1, compared with query Q1 which includes irrelevant contents "The data ...", query Q3 shares form with the user's query and thus is more likely to be retrieved.</p>
<p>Finally, a successfully injected malicious record for victim v will be (a v , [b v,t , R at ]), where a v is an attack query -a benign query containing v, and R at represents reasoning steps for the corresponding target query a t .Additionally, injecting records with diverse attack queries including the same victim term enhances the possibilities of retrieving malicious records, ensuring that for any given victim queries, there are highly similar malicious record queries available.</p>
<p>Injection of Malicious Records via Indication Prompts with Progressive Shortening</p>
<p>So far, we have designed coherent reasoning steps from a v to R at , and the desired form for malicious records.Since direct injection is infeasible under realistic constraints, the agent must autonomously generate the malicious records.This is challenging because, with only benign queries and demonstrations, the agent cannot produce the required "bridging steps" or target reasoning steps.</p>
<p>Therefore, to induce the agent to generate the bridging steps b v,t in its response, we first design an indication prompt appending to the attack query a v .The indication prompt consists of a sequence of logically connected reasoning steps, denoted as [r 1 , r 2 , . . ., r n ] depending on b v,t and can induce the agent to generate b v,t as its first step.For example, in Figure 1</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>To comprehensively evaluate MINJA, we conduct experiments aiming to answer the following research questions: (1) RQ1: Is MINJA effective and does it affect the benign utility of agents?(2) RQ2: Is MINJA stable when the memory settings or attack conditions vary? and (3) RQ3: Is MINJA resilient to potential defense strategies?Below, we will first introduce the experimental settings (Section 5.1), followed by discussions of the main results (Section 5.2) and ablation studies (Section 5.3).Then, we will discuss potential defenses and evaluate MINJA against some of them (Section 5.4).</p>
<p>Experimental Settings</p>
<p>Agents, datasets, and models.We test MINJA on three types of existing agents based on different LLMs across diverse tasks, encompassing healthcare, web activities, and general QA.Below are their details: (1) RAP [20] is a ReAct agent enhanced with RAG that dynamically leverages past experiences for task planning.We test MINJA against GPT-4-based and GPT-4o-based RAP on the Webshop dataset [42] containing a virtual web shopping environment and 1.18M real-world products featured on Amazon.(2) EHRAgent [29] is a healthcare agent designed to process medical queries by generating and executing code to retrieve relevant information from databases.In our experiments, we adopt two real-world EHR datasets for GPT-4 based EHRAgent, MIMIC-III, and eICU, which are large-scale relational databases containing extensive tables with comprehensive administrative and clinical information.(3) We build a QA Agent that addresses generic reasoning tasks via Chain-of-Thought [34] augmented with memory.The objective is to demonstrate the threat of MINJA on generic QA tasks.The prompt template of the QA Agent is detailed in Appendix B.</p>
<p>MINJA is evaluated on GPT-4 based and GPT-4o based QA Agent using the MMLU dataset [15], a benchmark of multi-choice questions covering 57 subjects across STEM fields.</p>
<p>Memory Banks of the Agents.We generally follow the original pipeline of each agent including their memory settings.For RAP, a memory record includes an input query and the corresponding sequence of interactions between the agent and the environment, such as the agent's reasoning and actions.For EHRAgent, a memory record comprises the input query, the detailed reasoning steps that inform subsequent code generation, and the generated code.For the QA Agent, each memory record includes an input question, the chain-of-thought reasoning steps, and the final answer.For RAP on web shopping, the user can easily determine whether the agent actions are satisfactory or not (e.g.purchasing the desired item), and only correctly executed queries will be stored in the memory bank.For EHRAgent and the QA Agent, all execution records will be stored due to the lack of user judgment of the agent outcomes.For RAP, EHRAgent, and QA Agent, 3/4/5 memory records with the highest input similarities are retrieved from the memory bank as demonstrations, respectively.In this work, we mainly use the cosine similarity computed on text embeddings of all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for EHRAgent and RAP, and text-embedding-ada-002 for QA Agent.The performance of MINJA with other embedding models is shown in Section 5.3.</p>
<p>Selection of victim and target.For each agent and dataset configuration, we conduct 9 independent experiments, each with a unique victim-target pair.For EHRAgent and MIMIC-III, we consider Patient ID pairs, where the attacker's objective is to misdirect an information retrieval request from the victim patient to an alternate target patient.For EHRAgent and eICU, we consider Medication pairs, with the attacker's aim being to substitute the victim's prescribed medication treatment with an alternative target medication treatment.For RAP and Webshop, we focus on Items pairs, where the attacker seeks to redirect a shopping query for a specific victim item to a different target item, leveraging target selection on the webshop to promote certain items.For QA Agent, we consider Terms from specific subjects, where the attacker's goal is to alter the multiple-choice answer by shifting it 4 letters forward in the alphabet whenever the victim term appears in the question, leading to an incorrect answer.The full list of victim-target pairs is presented in Appendix C.  MINJA details.For each victim-target pair on MMLU, we randomly select 10 queries containing the victim term as the attack queries.For the other three datasets, we randomly select 15 attack queries for each victim-target pair.These attack queries are supposed to elicit malicious reasoning steps from the agent -together they form a malicious record to be injected.For each victim-target pair, we design the indication prompts to induce the generation of the bridging steps, which typically claim the missing situation or perniciousness of data related to the victim and redirect the query to the prescribed target.For Patient ID, Medication, Items, and Terms, we shorten the indication prompt 4, 5, 5, and 5 times respectively.All indication prompts and the shortening cutoffs are shown in Figure 2. Example attack queries on the four datasets are shown in Appendix D.More details of MINJA on each agent are in Appendix E.</p>
<p>Memory injection procedure.We simulate a realistic scenario where both the attacker and other regular users engage with the agent without specific ordering.For the initial memory banks, EHRAgent stores four benign records initially as demonstrations, whereas the memory banks of RAP and MMLU start empty.Then for each victim-target pair, we reserve 50 additional benign queries for EHRAgent and RAP, and 30 benign queries for QA Agent irrelevant to the victim term for regular users.The attack queries for memory injection are randomly shuffled with these benign queries.For each attack query, the injection follows the description in Algorithm 1.The impact of the number of benign queries will be discussed in Section 5.3.</p>
<p>Evaluation metrics.We consider the following three metrics: (1) Inject Success Rate (ISR).ISR measures how effectively MINJA injects malicious records into the agent's memory.Specifically, a successful injection occurs when the agent generates the targeted reasoning steps for an attack query.ISR is defined as the ratio of successfully injected records to the total number of attack queries used for a given victim-target pair.(2) Attack Success Rate (ASR).ASR measures how effectively the injected malicious records further induce the target outputs.After all attack queries are submitted (regardless of whether they successfully injected a malicious record), we evaluate the agent on a separate set of victim queries (10 for MMLU, 30 for other datasets) that include the victim term.ASR is defined as the proportion of these test queries whose responses contain the targeted malicious reasoning steps, evaluated independently of the agent's original task performance to isolate the poisoning effect.(3) Utility Drop (UD): UD measures the extent to which the agent's original task (other than those that include victim terms) performance degrades due to the injection of malicious records, capturing the side effects of the attack beyond the targeted victim queries.Specifically, for memory banks with and without MINJA, we evaluate the agent on a set of benign queries (10 for MMLU, 30 for other datasets) that do not contain the victim term, respectively.</p>

<p>To investigate RQ1, we evaluate MINJA on different agents across all victim-target pairs following the aforementioned settings.We observe the following:</p>
<p>MINJA achieves exceptional ISR and high ASR.As shown in Table 1, MINJA achieves ISRs higher than 90% for most agent, victim-target pair, and dataset configurations, while ASR exceeds 70% in half of the cases and surpasses 90% for GPT-4-based EHR on eICU and GPT-4o-based RAP on Webshop.The high ISRs stem from MINJA's well-designed injection strategy: (1) the indication prompt reliably elicits the generation of "bridging steps" and target reasoning steps; (2) PSS progressively injects semantically similar malicious records, successfully increasing the number of malicious demonstrations being retrieved during injection.The high ASR likely results from the exceptional ISR, which ensures abundant malicious records are retrieved as in-context demonstrations to guide the agent toward malicious outputs.</p>
<p>ISR demonstrates higher mean and lower variance than ASR.As shown in Table 1, for all datasets, the overall ISR uniformly exceeds 95% with a low variance, while the overall ASR ranges from around 60% to more than 90% and exhibits higher variance across pairs.This statistical difference arises from the relative complexities of the procedures measured by the two metrics.ISR measures the success of malicious record injection, a relatively easy process where the agent replicates the bridging and target reasoning steps from the PSS-injected in-context demonstrations.</p>
<p>In contrast, ASR measures the effectiveness of the agent in generating malicious targets in response to victim queries, where the retrieved malicious records are typically less similar to the victim query.Additionally, the relatively higher variance in the ASR across various victim-target pairs reflects the inherent differences among pairs rather than instability in the MINJA attack itself.To validate the consistency of MINJA, we conducted repeated experiments on fixed pairs and observed small variance for each pair.The detailed results are reported in Appendix K.</p>
<p>MINJA can preserve benign utility.Despite the impressive attacking performance, the overall UD remains subtle in MIMIC-III, eICU, and Webshop, with all three datasets showing less than a 2% decrease.For MMLU, however, we observe a moderate UD of -10.0%, likely resulting from an insufficient number of benign demonstrations being retrieved.Under the default 5-demo setup, only about 3.2 benign examples are retrieved for each test query on average, which is potentially insufficient to preserve the agent's utility.To validate this hypothesis, we first rule out factors such as query difficulty and embedding diversity.By increasing the total number of demonstrations to retain more benign ones, we observe an improvement in the UD.More details are deferred to Appendix G.</p>
<p>These results thoroughly address RQ1: MINJA is highly effective while preserving benign agent performance.Furthermore, such effectiveness generalizes well across diverse agents, models, and victim-target pairs, demonstrating MINJA's robustness in realistic deployments.</p>
<p>Ablation Studies</p>
<p>To investigate RQ2, we first evaluate the stability of MINJA under varying memory settings, including both the retrieval mechanism and the density of benign records.These settings emulate realistic deployment scenarios where both retrieval behavior and memory content may fluctuate or vary significantly.We further assess MINJA under different attack conditions, such as the presence of prior poisoning and variations in the agent's model choice.Such conditions pose substantial challenges to our attack, as it must remain robust across diverse and dynamic environments.</p>
<p>Choice of the embedding model for memory retrieval We demonstrated the stability of MINJA when different embedding models are used for memory retrieval on EHRAgent.Under the default attack setting, we tested six embedding models: DPR [21], REALM [14], ANCE [40], BGE [25], textembedding-ada-002(ada-002), and all-MiniLM-L6-v2(MiniLM).Details of embedding models are presented in Appendix H.As shown in Figure 3, MINJA performs stably for all embedding models.</p>
<p>Retrieval noise</p>
<p>We evaluate the robustness of MINJA under retrieval noise by adding Gaussian noise (σ = 0.01) to the embedding vectors during memory retrieval.The noise level is comparable to the scale of real embeddings (~e-2), making it a moderate perturbation.We evaluate three arbitrarily selected pairs -Pairs 1, 4, and 7 -on the RAP Agent with GPT-4o and report the average performance.As shown in Table 3, ISR remains 100%, and ASR only slightly drops from 97.8% to 95.6%, indicating MINJA 's strong robustness to noisy retrieval.showing the reliability of MINJA in malicious record injection.This is likely because indication prompt reliably triggers malicious reasoning even with benign demonstrations, and PSS ensures the retrieval of sufficient malicious records for shortened malicious queries.In contrast, ASR shows mixed trends.For EHRAgent on MIMIC-III, ASR drops quickly from 68.9% to 31.1% as benign data increases.However, for EHRAgent on eICU and RAP, ASR remains relatively stable and consistently above 80%.This discrepancy may stem from MIMIC-III queries, which are typically short and structurally similar across patients, making it harder to retrieve malicious records for victim queries.</p>
<p>Prior Poisoning We evaluate MINJA 's effectiveness under prior poisoning, where the memory bank has already been compromised by a previous attack.Specifically, we first inject 15 attack queries for an initial victim-target pair along with 100 benign records, followed by a second injection using 15 attack queries of a different pair.In the clean-memory baseline, the initial attack is omitted, but the same 100 benign records and the second injection are retained.ISR is evaluated during the second injection, and ASR is measured on 30 victim queries for the second pair in both settings.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 2, ISR and ASR degrade by 6-20 points under prior poisoning, suggesting that earlier malicious records reduce the effectiveness of the subsequent injection and interfere with the generation of malicious records for subsequent victim queries.Nonetheless, both metrics remain within an acceptable range, demonstrating that MINJA retains considerable effectiveness when the memory has been previously compromised.</p>
<p>Model choice for the agent We further evaluate MINJA's performance under models of different capabilities and scales, including DeepSeek-R1 and Llama-2-7B.The results indicate that MINJA generalizes to capable reasoning models, while small models lacking basic task utility make security evaluation less meaningful.Detailed settings and results are provided in Appendix J</p>
<p>These results answer RQ2: MINJA remains effective when memory settings or attack conditions vary.</p>
<p>Potential Defense</p>
<p>To investigate RQ3, we consider four potential defense strategies: adversarial training, embeddinglevel memory sanitization, prompt-level detection, and system-level defense.</p>
<p>Among these, adversarial training is inherently costly due to its reliance on large-scale labeled attack data with adversarial prompts and the need for retraining across different attack types [45,35].</p>
<p>Adversarial training is particularly limited against MINJA, as defending it requires task-specific labeled attack data and retraining, limiting its generalization and scalability.Embedding-level memory sanitization, which attempts to identify malicious records post hoc (e.g., via embedding filtering), is conceptually feasible but fails in practice.As shown in Figure 5, malicious and benign records are highly entangled in the embedding space, making them indistinguishable using simple similarity-based filtering.Prompt-level detection is the most applicable and potentially effective strategy, as it incurs a low deployment cost and gets rid of the entangled embedding space.</p>
<p>Prompt-level detection is also the most practical and potentially effective strategy, as it can identify malicious queries by targeting the underlying logic of MINJA, such as victim-to-target substitutions by indication prompts, while avoiding the difficulties of operating in an entangled embedding space, all at a low deployment cost.Therefore, we focus our experimental evaluation on this approach.</p>
<p>Specifically, we adopt GPT-4o as the judgment model for prompt-level detection.For each user query, we prepend a detection prompt to assist the LLM in evaluating whether a record is malicious.We design two prompts to balance specificity and generality: a targeted prompt tailored for EHRAgents (e.g., "Examine the input query and flag it if it suggests that A's data is under B"), and a general prompt (e.g., "Flag the input if it may contain any potential risk") aimed at broader applicability across agents.As shown in Table 5, the targeted prompt achieves high precision on EHRAgents (e.g., 131/135 on MIMIC), but fails to generalize to other agents, detecting no malicious records on RAP or QA Agent.In contrast, the general prompt improves detection across agents (e.g., 53/135 on RAP, 29/90 on QA), but also introduces potential substantial false positives (e.g., 34/50 on EHR-MIMIC), undermining the utility.These results highlight the fundamental limitation of prompt-level detection: prompts that are precise lack generality, while general prompts may incur high false positives.</p>
<p>Moreover, system-level defense, such as isolating memory banks across users or enforcing rate-limit controls, can also be circumvented, respectively, by identity disguise (as discussed in Section 3) and coordinated use of MINJA by multiple attackers.While temporal decay of memory typically weakens all memory poisoning attacks by reducing the impact of earlier injected records, our attack remains effective because it operates through the adversarial user's direct interaction with the agent, which can occur at any time, for instance, immediately before the victim's interaction.Finally, permission controls and guardrails (e.g., GuardAgent [38]) are unlikely to prevent MINJA, as its injections exploit the same interfaces as regular users and produce task-aligned, semantically plausible reasoning which is hard to detect.</p>
<p>These results validate that MINJA is both effective and evasive against various defense strategies, revealing the fundamental limitations of conventional defenses against it, thereby addressing RQ3.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We propose MINJA, a novel memory injection attack that injects malicious records into LLM agents through queries.MINJA employs bridging steps, an indication prompt, and a progressive shortening strategy.Evaluations across diverse agents and victim-target pairs reveal MINJA's high success rate, exposing critical vulnerabilities in LLM agents under realistic constraints and highlighting the urgent need for improved memory security.</p>
<p>Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?</p>

<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.</p>
<p>• All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced.• All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.</p>
<p>• The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.• Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.• Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.</p>
<p>Experimental result reproducibility</p>
<p>Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?</p>
<p>Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper provides sufficient detail to reproduce the main experiments: Section 5.1 (Experimental Settings) specifies the agents, datasets, and procedures; Figure 2 shows the full indication prompt design; Appendix A provides Algorithm 1 to describe PSS; and Appendix B lists the victim-target pair selection.The code will be released to further support reproducibility.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.</p>
<p>• If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.• If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.• Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways.</p>
<p>For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model.In general.releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.• While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.(d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility.</p>
<p>In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.</p>
<p>Open access to data and code</p>
<p>Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?</p>

<p>Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?</p>
<p>Answer: [Yes]</p>
<p>Justification: Detailed experimental settings of the main experiments are given in Section 5.1, including the LLMs (GPT-4, GPT-4o), datasets (MIMIC-III, Webshop, MMLU), and metrics (ISR, ASR, UD), while each ablation study and potential defense explicitly mention their experimental settings.Appendix B-G provide further implementation details.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.</p>
<p>• The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.• The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.</p>
<p>Experiment statistical significance</p>
<p>Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?</p>
<p>Answer: [Yes]</p>
<p>Justification: We report standard deviation (as error bars) for both ISR and ASR across all victim-target pairs in the main experiment (Table 1), providing a measure of variability.These variations are explicitly discussed in Section 5.2.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.</p>
<p>• The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.• The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).• The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).</p>
<p>• It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.• It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it.The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.• For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g.negative error rates).• If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.</p>
<p>Experiments compute resources</p>
<p>Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?</p>
<p>Answer: [Yes]</p>
<p>Justification: We conducted all experiments using API access to OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-4o models, as described in Section 5.1.</p>

<p>• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.</p>
<p>• The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.• The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.• The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>• If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>• The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).10.Broader impacts Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include an Impact Statements to discuss societal implications, including risks of memory poisoning in deployed LLM agents, the importance of agent hardening, and the need for preventive defenses.Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.</p>
<p>• If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.• Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.• The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments.However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out.For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation.On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.• The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.• If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).</p>
<p>Safeguards</p>
<p>Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?Answer: [NA] Justification: No new models or datasets have been released.The work does not expose high-risk assets requiring special safeguards.Guidelines:</p>
<p>• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.</p>
<p>• Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.• Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks.The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.• We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.12.

<p>A Algorithm of progressive shortening Strategy</p>
<p>The progressive shortening Strategy is a novel method aiming to inject malicious records with an attack query into the memory bank.Here, we demonstrate the user &amp; agent interaction of EHRAgent and MMLU respectively.</p>
<p>B.1 EHRAgent</p>
<p>The interaction between the user and EHRAgent begins when a clinician inputs a clinical query in natural language.These queries often involve retrieving patient information or analyzing EHRs to support clinical decision-making.Once a query is received, EHRAgent enhances its understanding by integrating relevant medical information.It extracts domain-specific knowledge from metadata and column descriptions of EHR tables, helping it to accurately interpret the query.To further refine its response, EHRAgent retrieves relevant past cases from its long-term memory.By selecting the most appropriate few-shot demonstrations, the agent learns from prior successful interactions, improving its ability to generate accurate and contextually appropriate solutions.</p>
<p>Next, EHRAgent translates the clinician's question into a structured, executable plan.Rather than relying solely on predefined templates, it generates a code-based solution by leveraging metadata, tool functions, retrieved demonstrations, and integrated medical knowledge.The generated code is then executed, and EHRAgent continuously monitors its performance.If errors arise during execution, the agent engages in an interactive feedback loop, analyzing error messages and refining the code iteratively.Through this iterative process, EHRAgent ensures that the final code execution retrieves the correct information.Once the query is successfully processed, the agent presents the final answer to the clinician, completing the interaction.</p>
<p>B.2 QA Agent</p>
<p>The user begins by entering a multiple-choice question on a specific topic into the QA Agent.Then the QA Agent searches its memory bank for the three most similar stored questions, retrieving their corresponding interaction records as reference examples.Subsequently, QA Agent leverages these retrieved records to serve as demonstrations, combine them with the current question, and provide input to the LLM inside.Then, through in-context learning, the LLM analyzes the question, formulates reasoning steps, and ultimately selects the most appropriate answer.</p>
<p>C Vitim-target pairs for each dataset</p>
<p>In Table 1, we denote all the pairs simply from pair 1 to pair 9.However, these pairs are selected differently from datasets where we adopt MINJA.The specific victim-target pairs we used for each dataset are presented in Figure 4.The pairs in Figure 4 correspond to those used in the respective datasets in Table 1.For example, on MIMIC-III, the pair labeled as 3 (13837-3125) represents a victim-target patient ID pair, which corresponds to Pair 3 in the main results for EHR (GPT-4) on MIMIC-III.The ISR, ASR, and UD values for this pair are those in the Pair 3 column EHR (GPT-4) on MIMIC-III row in Table 1: 100.0, 76.7, and +3.3.</p>
<p>D Example attack queries on four datasets</p>
<p>On different datasets, we randomly selected 10 queries for QA Agent and 10/15 queries containing a certain victim term as attack queries based on different victim-target pairs.These queries were directly extracted from the dataset without any modification.A selection of attack queries for MIMIC-III and eICU are presented in Figure 6, while a selection of attack queries for Webshop and MMLU are presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 respectively [Shen:at the end of the appendix].</p>
<p>E Details of MINJA on each agent</p>
<p>We present the details of implementing MINJA on different agents and datasets as follows.Victim, target, bridging steps are highlighted with green, purple, and blue respectively.</p>

<p>F Comparison between MINJA and prior reasoning-based attacks</p>
<p>We clarify the MINJA's resemblance to prior reasoning-based attacks such as PANDORA [6], and point out that MINJA is unique and totally different.Although both involve multi-step reasoning, MINJA differs fundamentally in its motivation, threat model, and attack mechanism as shown in Table 6.</p>
<p>G Analysis of moderate UD on MMLU</p>
<p>From the results, it is evident that the moderate utility drops (UD) observed on MMLU in Table 1 primarily stem from an insufficient number of benign demonstrations retrieved during in-context learning (ICL).Specifically, as shown in Table 7, the average UD improves -shifting from an average drop of -11.1% under the 2-demo setting, to -10.0% under the default 5-demo setting, and further to -4.4% under the 8-demo setting -clearly demonstrating that increasing the number of retrieved demonstrations boosts the absolute count of benign examples, thereby better maintaining utility despite the presence of poisoned records.</p>
<p>To further rule out query complexity as a confounding factor, we evaluated the same test queries used in the main QA Agent experiments under zero-shot conditions (i.e., no demonstrations).As shown in Table 8, there is no clear correlation between query accuracy and UD.Besides, embedding space diversity analysis (Table 9) shows no clear relationship between diversity change and UD, confirming that the dominant factor is the number of benign demonstrations within the retrieved records.</p>
<p>These findings collectively highlight that the moderate UD on MMLU is mainly a result of insufficient benign demonstrations during ICL.</p>

<p>text-embedding-ada-002 is OpenAI's most advanced embedding model, mapping text into a 1536dimensional vector space, optimized for large-scale applications like semantic search, clustering, and retrieval across diverse domains.</p>
<p>I Validation of experimental setup under memory retrieval filtering</p>
<p>To validate the soundness of our experimental setup, we first clarify that similarity-based memory retrieval is a scalable and widely adopted strategy across LLM-based agents (e.g., RAP [20], EHR Agent [29]).Even if retrieval is not based on embedding similarity, e.g., by directly querying an LLM, our attack remains effective.This is because agents typically reuse prior records as in-context demonstrations.Our PSS strategy ensures that the most informative record (from the previous shortening step) remains highly relevant and thus likely to be selected.While real-world systems may employ stricter filtering or security checks, we show in Section 5.4 that both embedding-level sanitization and prompt-level defenses are limited: semantic overlap makes it hard to distinguish benign vs. malicious records, and LLM-based filtering either fails to generalize (targeted prompts) or suffers from high false positives (general prompts).These findings suggest that MINJA remains effective even under more advanced or stricter memory filtering settings, making it a broadly applicable threat model for memory-based agents.</p>
<p>J Extended evaluation on model variants</p>
<p>We extend our evaluation to DeepSeek-R1 and investigate the effect of model scale using Llama-2-7B for broader evaluation.As shown in Table 10, on QA Agent, DeepSeek-R1 achieves consistently high Injection (100%) and Attack Success Rates (over 90%), closely matching GPT-4's performance, confirming that MINJA generalizes across capable reasoning models.By contrast, when adopting Llama-2-7B, we find it only achieves 19.3% and 17.1% task accuracy for pairs 1 and 7, respectively, even lower than random guessing on MMLU with four answer choices (25%).This highlights an important consideration for evaluating security in LLM-based agents: meaningful analysis of attack effectiveness presupposes that the underlying model possesses sufficient task utility, as evaluating attacks on underpowered models is inherently less meaningful.</p>
<p>K Stability evaluation of MINJA's ASR</p>
<p>To validate the stability of MINJA, we conduct additional evaluations on both RAP and QA agents, using GPT-4 and GPT-4o as core models.We selected three arbitrary victim-target pairs (Pairs 1, 4, and 7), and sampled 18 test queries for each pair (with replacement for QA Agent due to its limited test queries).We repeated this process across three runs (test 1,2,3) and measured the standard deviation of ASR.The results in Table 11 demonstrate that ASR remains stable within each pair (standard deviation lower than 3% in RAP Agent, and lower than 6% in QA Agent).</p>
<p>L Number of shortening steps in PSS</p>
<p>We validate the effectiveness of PSS by experimentally assessing how reducing the number of shortening steps in the PSS process affects MINJA's injection success rate.Specifically, we compare our default PSS with fewer shortening steps and no PSS on three arbitrarily selected pairs (Pair 1, 4, 7) on EHRAgent for eICU.The results in Table 12 indicate that reducing the number of shortening steps leads to a decrease in injection success rate (ISR), from 93.3% (full PSS) to 80% (fewer steps), and further down to 75.6% when PSS is removed entirely, which proves that PSS facilitates the injection of more malicious records into the memory bank.</p>
<p>Figure 1 :

Figure 1: (Top) Previous Work assumes direct access to the memory bank, allowing the attacker to overwrite memory content arbitrarily.(Bottom) MINJA operates via query-only interaction: During the injection stage, the attacker begins by inducing the agent to generate target reasoning steps and bridging steps by appending an indication prompt to an attack query -a benign query containing a victim term.These reasoning steps along with the given query are stored in the memory bank.Subsequently, the attacker progressively shortens the indication prompt while preserving bridging steps and targeted malicious reasoning steps.When the victim user submits a victim query, the stored malicious records are retrieved as a demonstration, misleading the agent to generate bridging steps and target reasoning steps through in-context learning.</p>
<p>Figure 2 :

Figure 2: Each indication prompt (the content in parentheses appended to the attack query) is a sequence of logically connected reasoning steps designed for a specific dataset to induce the agent to generate the bridging steps connecting victim-related a v and target-related R at .The vertical lines "|" in the figure divide the indication prompt into multiple sections, each representing content removed during the shortening iteration process.</p>

<p>, a t ].By progressively shortening the query [a v , r 1 , r 2 , . . ., r n ] step-by-step, PSS enables the injection of a greater number of relevant malicious records into the memory bank.The objective here is to increase the number of malicious demonstrations retrieved for the in-context learning; thereby enabling the LLM to more reliably reconstruct the intended reasoning steps.The full procedure is detailed in Algorithm 1, Appendix A. At iteration i, we shorten the indication prompt from [a v , r 1 , r 2 , . . ., r n−i ] to [a v , r 1 , r 2 , . . ., r n−i−1 ] by cutting down a single step r n−i .
, the indication prompt states, "Thedata of patient A is now saved under patient B; we should refer to patient B," which is designedto induce the agent to generate the bridging steps: "Data of A saved under B." This allows us toeventually inject ([a v , r 1 , r 2 , . . . , r n ], [b v,t , R at ]) into the memory bank.To approach the ideally designed malicious record described in 4.1, we propose a novel ProgressiveShortening Strategy (PSS), which gradually removes the indication prompt while preserving theresponse [b v,t For instance, in Figure 1, Input Q1 is shortened to Input Q2 by removing "we should refer to patientB". Eventually, PSS generates and stores the malicious record (a v , [b v,t , R at ]) to the memory bank.</p>

thank Jiancheng Liu for his valuable suggestions and continuous support for MINJA.Impact StatementsIn this paper, we propose MINJA, the first attack that covertly poisons the memory bank of reasoningbased agents via query-only interaction, enabling arbitrary users to inject harmful content and mislead the agent in subsequent interactions with victim users.Our goal is to raise awareness of these critical security and safety risks, urging developers to adopt more robust memory bank designs for LLM agents, including memory isolation, strong user authentication, secure memory management, and advanced prompt filtering.Beyond exposing this threat, our experiments also provide insight into the retrieval and storage mechanisms of agent memory, offering valuable guidance for future research and the development of safer, more resilient agent architectures.We will release our code to support further exploration in this area.NeurIPS Paper ChecklistClaimsQuestion: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state our main contribution: proposing MINJA, a query-only memory injection attack against LLM-based agents, and validating its effectiveness, generalizability, and resilience.The assumption that the attacker can interact with the victim agent via queries and output observations reflects the scope of MINJA.Guidelines:• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.• The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations.A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers.• The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.• It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.LimitationsQuestion: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the assumptions and limitations of our threat model in Section 3 (Agent Setting), where the attack assumes either a shared memory setting or an isolated memory setting with feasible identity disguise.Guidelines:• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.• The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.• The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally).The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.• The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs.In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.• The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach.For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting.Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.• The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.• If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.• While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper.The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.Theory assumptions and proofs N Additional VisualizationWe present a tSNE[32]visualization of the poisoned memory of MINJA, shown in Figure5.O Potential Extension to More Agent TypesIn this work, we focus on a diverse set of malicious targets, including a target patient ID and a target item to purchase.The target set can be further expanded.For example, a target destination for autonomous driving agents[24], a target bacteria for ecological agents[39], or a target procedure for self-diagnosis agents[41].Moreover, MINJA can be potentially extended to multi-agent systems where the memory injection for one agent can affect the operation of other agents through inter-agent communication[16,51].
