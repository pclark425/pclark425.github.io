                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI. While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect accuracy across all tasks. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/naiqili/Logic-of-Thought.</p>

Method relies on manually curated few-shot examples and accurate translation; occasional translation errors occur even with strong LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o).

<p>Logic-of-Thought: Empowering Large Language Models with Logic Programs for Solving Puzzles in Natural Language
22 May 20253D05158B14EA3DBF2F242FBBB031BD1BarXiv:2505.16114v1[cs.AI]
Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI.While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search.In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem.Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter.This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs.We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating nearperfect accuracy across all tasks.Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/naiqili/Logic-of-Thought.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Solving puzzles expressed in natural language has long been regarded as a cornerstone task for artificial intelligence, which requires a diverse set of advanced skills, including natural language understanding, logical reasoning, abstract thinking, and the ability to plan and infer (Mittal et al., 2024;Li et al., 2024).</p>
<p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), andLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) have shown remarkable progress in tasks like numerical and commonsense reasoning.These models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in few-shot and zero-shot learning, which lead to the development of several prompting strategies including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022), Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023), and Program-of-Thought (PoT) (Chen et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Puzzle Example: Hitori</p>
<p>Rule Specification: Hitori is a puzzle on a grid filled with numbers.The objective is to eliminate duplicates by marking some cells as black in each row and column according to following rules: 1) Eliminate numbers by marking them black, so that no row or column has duplicate numbers; 2) Blackened cells cannot be horizontally or vertically adjacent; 3) Not blackened cells must form a single connected group.Question Instance: Answer Instance: These prompting techniques aim to guide LLMs to reason more systematically, and have further enhanced LLMs' ability in handling simple tasks.</p>
<p>However, when facing more involved puzzles such as Hitori in Figure 1, current LLM-based methods are still inadequate.The puzzles considered in this work require a combination of deep reasoning and precise understanding.Even small misinterpretations can lead to entirely incorrect solutions, as there is little tolerance for ambiguity or error in the problem representation.The need for precise understanding, extensive search, and exact inference exceeds the capabilities of current LLMs and prompting methods.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we propose to bridge LLM and logic programming.Logic programs have been well-investigated and are with broad applications in planning, diagnosis, and knowledge representation (Lifschitz, 2019;Kowalski, 2014).A key principle of logic programming is its declarative nature: instead of specifying how to solve a problem, one specifies what the problem is, which contrasts with popular algorithmic languages.The advantages of logic programs include elaboration tolerance (small changes in specification result in minimal changes to the program), separation of knowledge and reasoning algorithms, and the use of powerful off-the-shelf solvers that can perform systematic and exhaustive search (Gelfond and Kahl, 2014).</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Logic-of-Thought (Logot), which combines the strengths of large language models with the reasoning capabilities of logic programs.Our key idea is to first translate puzzle descriptions into formal logic programs using LLMs.Then logic program interpreters are used to search for solutions with utmost accuracy and high efficiency.This hybrid approach leverages the language understanding and generative capacity of LLMs, while offloading the heavy reasoning and search tasks to well-established logic program engines.</p>
<p>Our main contributions are as follows:</p>
<p>• We propose a novel framework to solve puzzles in natural language, which is a task that remains to be a major challenge.</p>
<p>• We introduce a new paradigm that integrates LLMs with logic programming.</p>
<p>• We curate a diverse set of benchmark puzzles to evaluate our method, including three grid puzzles and four dynamic puzzles involving actions.</p>
<p>• Our experiments demonstrate near-perfect accuracy across all puzzle types, showing the effectiveness and generality of our method.</p>
<p>• We make our code and dataset publicly available to facilitate future research.</p>
<p>2 Related Work</p>
<p>Puzzle Solving in Computer Science</p>
<p>The endeavor of employing machines for puzzle solving can date back to Alan Turing, who cracked the Enigma code during World War II.In modern research communities, solving puzzles expressed in natural language has long been regarded as a cornerstone task, as it require a diverse set of advanced cognitive skills, including natural language understanding, logical reasoning, abstract thinking, and the ability to plan and infer.Successfully solving such tasks is crucial for showing an agent can approach human-level intelligence (Lake et al., 2017;Bisk et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Early AI research attempt puzzle solving via formal logic and mathematical modeling.Some recent works still follow this paradigm: Costa and Poças (2018) introduced a tableaux-based deductive system capable of solving Smullyan's puzzles involving propositional logic and first-order logic.Groza (2021) illustrated how various logic puzzles can be modeled in first-order logic, and then be solved by mathematical proving tools.Maeda and Inoue (2024) proposed a mathematical framework to formalize pencil puzzles like Slither and Sudoku, allowing for the application of constraint-based solvers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, planning tasks that require searching a sequence of actions to transition from an initial state to a goal state, can also be viewed as a type of structured puzzles.Formal approaches to planning have leveraged logical representations such as STRIPS (Fikes and Nilsson, 1971) and the situation calculus (Reiter, 2001).The Blocks World domain, in particular, has served as a long-standing benchmark for evaluating planning algorithms, due to its simplicity in structure and implications in various reasoning capacities (Li et al., 2013;Li and Liu, 2015).</p>
<p>However, these methods face several practical limitations.First, they are tailored to specific puzzle types, making them difficult to generalize.More critically, translating puzzles from natural language into formal representations requires substantial manual effort and expertise.</p>
<p>Large Language Models</p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have witnessed rapid development in recent years since the introduction of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which laid the foundation for modern neural language models.GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) marked a significant leap by demonstrating the power of large-scale autoregressive training, which further leads to ChatGPT and GPT-4 (Mao et al., 2024;Kalyan, 2024).Current LLMs include both commercial models such as Claude and Gemini (Minaee et al., 2024), as well as open-source models like LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023), and DeepSeek (Liu et al., 2024).</p>
<p>A remarkable property of LLMs is their ability to perform in-context learning and few-shot reasoning, i.e., a model can solve unseen tasks based on a few examples provided in the prompt without any parameter updates.Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) enables models to decompose problems into intermediate reasoning steps.Self-consistency (Wang et al., 2023) aggregates multiple reasoning paths to improve robustness.Least-to-Most prompting (Zhou et al., 2023) guides LLMs through progressive refinement.Tree-of-Thought (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023) introduces explicit decision paths with branching logic.Most relevant to our work is Program-of-Thought (PoT) (Chen et al., 2022), which use LLMs to generate algorithmic code (e.g., Python) to solve complex problems.However, our method differs fundamentally: instead of generating procedural programs, we generate declarative logic programs.Declarative programs specify what the solution should satisfy, rather than how to compute it.These prompting techniques have been successfully applied to a variety of tasks, including commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021;Ling et al., 2017;Talmor et al., 2019).Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with solving combinatorial and structured puzzles.For instance, Li et al. (2024) assessed GPT-4's capability on Minesweeper puzzles and revealed consistent reasoning failures.Mittal et al. (2024) proposed PuzzleBench to systematically benchmark LLMs on first-order logic puzzles, concluding that current models still underperform without external tools.</p>
<p>Answer Set Programming</p>
<p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a wellestablished paradigm in the field of declarative programming and non-monotonic reasoning.It has a broad range of applications, due to its expressive power, clear semantics, and availability of efficient solvers (Baral, 2003;Gelfond and Kahl, 2014;Leone and Ricca, 2015).</p>
<p>An ASP program consists of a set of rules of the form:
L 0 ; ... ; L k :- L k+1 , ..., L m , not L m+1 , ..., not L n .
where each L i is a literal.Intuitively, if all literals in the body are true and none of the negated literals can be proven, then at least one literal in the head must be true.A rule with an empty body is called a fact, while a rule with an empty head is a constraint.ASP also supports choice rules, such as:
m {p(X) : q(X)} n :-L 1 , ..., not L n ,
which allows flexible inclusion of subsets of atoms in answer sets.To solve ASP programs, we employ Clingo (Gebser et al., 2011), a state-of-the-art ASP interpreter that performs both grounding and solving efficiently.</p>
<p>ASP has also been applied to puzzle solving (Mitra and Baral, 2015), where handcrafted programs were written to solve logic grid puzzles.However, the types of puzzles addressed are narrow and rely on highly regular logical structures.ASP programs must be manually designed, a process that is often non-trivial and requires deep expertise in both the puzzle and logic programming.</p>
<p>Our work addresses these limitations by proposing a novel method that combines the reasoning power of ASP with the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models.Instead of manually writing ASP programs, we leverage the in-context learning ability of LLMs to automatically translate natural language puzzle descriptions into executable ASP logic programs.This ushers in a new paradigm for solving complex puzzles that require precise understanding, deep reasonin, and exhaustive search.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Problem formulation: We define a puzzle instance as a tuple P = ⟨B, R, I q ⟩, where B represents background information (e.g., a short textual introduction of the puzzle), R = {R i } K i=1 represents a set of rules (e.g., blackened cells cannot be horizontally or vertically adjacent), and I q represents a particular question instance (e.g., the initial state of the grid).The goal is to design a function f (P ) = I a , such that the output answer instance I a is a proper solution for the puzzle P .</p>
<p>Figure 2 presents the overall framework of our method.The key idea is to translate the puzzle's rule specifications and question instance into the corresponding logic program separately.Subsequently, off-the-shelves logic programming interpreters are used to ground and search for solutions.During the translation, the in-context and few-shot learning abilities of large language models are utilized.To facilitate this, two sets of few-shot examples
D r = {⟨R ′ i , R′ i ⟩} N i=1 and D q = {⟨Q ′ i , Q′ i ⟩} M i=1
are introduced, which correspond to the translations of rule specifications and question instances.</p>
<p>Here ⟨R ′ i , R′ i ⟩ denotes the translation between the rule's textual form and logic program representation (similar for
⟨Q ′ i , Q′ i ⟩).
With these notations, the ultimate objective is to design a function f (P ; D r , D q ) = I a , such that the answer I a resolves the puzzle P .</p>
<p>In what follows, we use L(s) to denote the output of the LLM when s is given as input, and use s 1 |s 2 |...|s k to denote the concatenation of strings.</p>
<p>Few-Shot Rule Specification Translation Module</p>
<p>One of the core components of our framework is the Few-Shot Rule Specification Translation Module, which is designed to transform natural language rule descriptions R = {R i } K i=1 into formal logic programs { Ri } K i=1 that can be interpreted and executed by logic programming engines.These rules define the constraints and structure of the puzzle, and are expressed in natural language.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we exploit the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), using a set of few-shot examples D r = {⟨R ′ i , R′ i ⟩} N i=1 as demonstrations.Each pair in D r consists of a textual rule R ′ i and its corresponding logic representation R′ i .These demonstrations are drawn from puzzles of similar domains and serve as guidance for translating new rules.</p>
<p>Given a new rule R i ∈ R and the full puzzle instance P = ⟨B, R, I q ⟩, the rule translation function is defined as:
RT (R i ; P, D r ) = L(R ′ 1 | R′ 1 | . . . |R ′ N | R′ N |B|R i ), RT (R; P, D r ) = {RT (R i ; P, D r ) | R i ∈ R} K i=1 ,
where L(•) denotes the output of the LLM given the concatenated string of examples and the rule R i to be translated.The inclusion of the background description B provides additional context about the specific puzzle domain, helping the model ground its understanding of the rule semantics.</p>
<p>--(Few-shot examples from other puzzles)--R ′ 1 : Fill each row with the numbers 1 through 9 without repeating any number.R′ 1 : :-pos(X, Y1, N), pos(X, Y2, N), Y1 != Y2.R ′ 2 : Fill each column with the numbers 1 through 9 without repeating any number.----------------------B: Hitori is a puzzle on a grid filled with ... Ri: Eliminate numbers by marking them black, so no row or column has duplicate numbers.</p>
<p>-------(LLM output, Ri)-------:-pos(X, Y1, N), pos(X, Y2, N), Y1 != Y2, not black(X, Y1), not black(X, Y2).:-pos(X1, Y, N), pos(X2, Y, N), X1 != X2, not black(X1, Y), not black(X2, Y).Q ′ 1 : 112435 115446 ... Q′ 1 : pos(1, 1, 1).pos(1, 2, 1).pos(1, 3, 2).pos(1, 4, 4).pos(1, 5, 3).pos (1,6,5).pos(2, 1, 1).pos(2, 2, 1).pos (2,3,5) (1,3,5).pos (1,4,4).pos(1, 5, 4).pos(1, 6, 4).pos(1, 7, 6).pos(1, 8, 1).pos(1, 9, 4).pos(2, 1, 5).pos(2, 2, 7).pos(2, 3, 4).... This translation process allows the LLM to infer the appropriate formal structure for a rule based on analogical reasoning from the provided demonstrations.An example of such a translation is shown in Figure 3.
. ... ...... ---------------------- Iq: 875444614 594728321 ... -------(LLM output, Ĩq)------- pos(1, 1, 8). pos(1, 2, 7). pos
By leveraging LLMs for rule translation, Logot presents a novel method for converting humanreadable rules into executable logic, serving as a critical bridge between natural language and symbolic reasoning in our system.</p>
<p>Few-Shot Puzzle State Translation Module</p>
<p>The Few-Shot Puzzle State Translation Module is responsible for converting the puzzle's initial state I q into ASP statements Ĩq .</p>
<p>Given a puzzle instance P = ⟨B, R, I q ⟩ and a set of few-shot examples
D q = {⟨Q ′ i , Q′ i ⟩} M i=1
from the same puzzle domain, where Q ′ i is a textual representation of a puzzle's initial state and Q′ i is its corresponding logic encoding, the mod-ule generates the translated logic program Ĩq by prompting the LLM as follows:
ST (I q ; P, D q ) = L(Q ′ 1 | Q′ 1 | . . . |Q ′ M | Q′ M |I q ).
Here L denotes the output of the language model given the prompt, which is constructed from concatenating M few-shot examples and the input I q .This formulation leverages the LLM's ability to learn translation patterns from a small number of demonstration pairs.An illustrative example of this translation process in the Hitori puzzle is shown in Figure 4.</p>
<p>Inference and Postprocessing</p>
<p>Once the puzzle rules and the question instance have been translated into their respective logic program representations, the next step is to perform automated reasoning to obtain a solution.</p>
<p>Specifically, we combine the outputs of the Rule Specification Translation Module and the Puzzle State Translation Module to form a complete answer set programming specification.We then invoke a state-of-the-art ASP solver, Clingo (Gebser et al., 2011), to compute the answer sets that satisfy all constraints in the program.Finally, a lightweight postprocessing component D(•) is applied to convert the ASP output into a humanreadable answer instance I a .This decoder interprets the logic atoms in the answer set (e.g., black(2,3), pos(1,1,5)) and formats them into a structured representation consistent with the puzzle's original format.</p>
<p>Formally, the overall pipeline of our method can be represented as:
I a = f (P ; D r , D q ) = D (ASP (RT (R; P, D r ) ∪ {ST (I q ; P, D q )})) ,
where RT (R; P, D r ) denotes the translated set of puzzle rules, and ST (I q ; P, D q ) represents the logic encoding of the initial puzzle state.The union of these two components yields a complete ASP program that fully specifies the puzzle constraints and configuration.</p>
<p>To summarize, the key advantage of our method lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with the rigorous reasoning framework of logic programming, establishing a new paradigm for puzzle solving and reasoning.</p>
<p>Comparison</p>
<p>To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare it against several baselines across a variety of puzzles.</p>
<p>Baselines.We consider the following baseline methods:</p>
<p>• Standard Prompting: Directly prompts the language model with the puzzle description and expects the answer.</p>
<p>• Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022): Prompts the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at an answer.</p>
<p>• Finetuning: Finetunes language models on task-specific datasets.We adopt the results reported in (He et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Each baseline is evaluated using different LLM backbones, including Deepseek-V3, RoBERTa, GPT-2, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-4o.</p>
<p>Accuracy Analysis.The comparison results are shown in Table 1."N/A" indicates that the method is not applicable or is difficult to adapt.For example, it is challenging to design effective chainof-thought (CoT) prompts for grid puzzles such as Sudoku.The results show that:</p>
<p>• Logot consistently achieves superior performance across both classic grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles with actions.</p>
<p>• Notably, Logot+GPT-4o achieves near-perfect accuracy on all tasks.</p>
<p>• Even when using smaller or less capable models like Deepseek-V3 or GPT-4o-mini, Logot still demonstrates robust performance.</p>
<p>• Although CoT performs competitively on some dynamic puzzles (e.g., BW-LG, BW-PJ), such applications were not explored in previous work (He et al., 2023), suggesting that further investigation into prompting strategies may yield useful insights.An example of the CoT prompts we used is shown in Figure 5.   Cost Analysis.We further analyze the costefficiency tradeoff of different methods, based on Table 2 and Figure 6.</p>
<p>Table 2 reports the total cost (in USD) required to solve 200 instances for each puzzle category.Figure 6 provides a clearer summary by illustrating the trade-off between cost and accuracy averaged over all instances in each puzzle category.</p>
<p>From the results, we observe that our proposed method is highly cost-effective.When paired with GPT-4o, Logot achieves near-perfect accuracy (over 99%) across all puzzles.Although this comes at a relatively higher cost, the performance gain is significant.</p>
<p>More importantly, Logot can also be deployed with more affordable language models, such as Deepseek-V3 or GPT-4o-mini.In these settings, it Translated ASP Program: ...... pos(1, 2, 5).pos(1, 5, 2).pos (1,6,3).pos (1,8,6).pos (1,9,4).pos(2, 1, 1).pos (2,3,4).pos(3, 1, 8).pos (3,2,6).pos(4, 1, 9).pos(4, 3, 5).pos(4, 9, 2).pos (5,4,5).pos (5,6,7).pos(6, 1, 4).pos (6,7,9).pos (7,2,9).pos (7,4,4).pos (7,7,8).pos (8,3,6).pos (8,4,7).pos(8, 8, 1).pos(9, 7, 5).pos(9, 8, 9).still achieves strong accuracy (over 95% and 98%, respectively), while incurring significantly lower costs.All evidences suggest that, Logot is not only highly accurate but also resource-efficient, making it practical and accessible for solving various challenging puzzles.</p>
<p>Failure Case Study</p>
<p>In this section, we analyze representative failure cases of our method to better understand its limitations and potential areas for improvement.Specifically, we focus on two puzzle categories: Sudoku (Figure 7) and Blocks World -Legality (Figure 8), which are representative of grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions.</p>
<p>Across all examined cases, we find that the few errorsstem entirely from the state translation stage, i.e., incorrect interpretation of the initial state.These mistakes are generally straightforward to identify and are easy to be corrected by humans.</p>
<p>Interestingly, even with powerful LLMs such as GPT-4o, these seemingly simple translation errors can still occur.This highlights a key challenge in achieving full robustness: while logic interpreters are precise and reliable, they depend heavily on accurate input representations, making the translation step a critical bottleneck.</p>
<p>To address this, one promising direction is to integrate more advanced prompting methods such as  Program-of-Thought (PoT), which uses language models to generate intermediate algorithmic code (e.g., Python) to assist with the transaction of rules and states.By combining PoT with our pipeline, it is possible to further enhance translation accuracy and eliminate residual errors, which we leave for future investigation.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this paper, we proposed Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that combines large language models with logic programming to solve puzzles expressed in natural language, which remains a challenging task.Our method leverages the fewshot in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to translate both puzzle rules and instances into declarative logic programs, which are then executed using an Answer Set Programming interpreter to accurately and efficiently infer solutions.Experiments show that Logot achieves near-perfect accuracy across a range of puzzle at a reasonable cost.Overall, Logot introduces a new paradigm that combines the strengths of LLM and logic programming, with potential applications extending well beyond the puzzle domain.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>While our proposed method demonstrates strong performance across a range of puzzle types, we acknowledge a few minor limitations that open up promising directions for future research.First, the number of puzzle types and categories evaluated in this work is relatively modest.Future work can further enhance generality by curating a broader and richer collection of puzzles, particularly by exploring more tasks in the planning domain.Second, our method currently relies on manually annotated few-shot examples to bootstrap performance, which is a common setup in in-context learning.Nonetheless, future research could explore the information retrieval techniques Rubin et al. (2022) to automatically retrieve high-quality examples, potentially reducing the annotation effort even further.Finally, occasional errors still occur during the puzzle state translation stage.The accuracy of our method can be further improved using advanced prompting techniques such as Program-of-Thought (PoT), or by leveraging diagnostic tools from the logic programming community.</p>

<p>A.1 Classic Grid Puzzles Sudoku Sudoku is a popular logic-based number placement puzzle.The puzzle is played on a 9×9 grid divided into nine 3×3 subgrids (also called regions, boxes, or blocks).The goal is to fill in the grid so that each number appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3×3 subgrid.Specifically, the puzzle requires completing grid under the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Fill each row with the numbers 1 through 9 without repeating any number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill each column with the numbers 1 through 9 without repeating any number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill each 3×3 subgrid with the numbers 1 through 9 without repeating any number.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 9 presents a question-answer pair of the Sudoku puzzle.</p>
<p>Hitori</p>
<p>Hitori is a logic-based puzzle game originating from Japan.The name "Hitori" means "alone" or "one person" in Japanese, reflecting the puzzle's goal of isolating numbers.It is typically played on a square grid filled with numbers, and the objective is to eliminate duplicates in each row and column according to following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Eliminate numbers by marking them (usually shaded or blacked out) so that no row or column has duplicate numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot shade two adjacent cells (cells sharing an edge) -shaded cells must not touch horizontally or vertically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All unshaded (white) cells must form a single connected group, meaning you can move from any unshaded cell to any other through neighboring unshaded cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shaded cell is considered "eliminated" and cannot be part of the connected group.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 10 presents a question-answer pair of the Hitori puzzle.</p>
<p>Fillomino</p>
<p>Fillomino is a logic puzzle played on a rectangular grid where some cells may initially contain numbers.The goal is to divide the grid into regions, or "polyominoes," such that each region contains exactly one number and has an area (number of cells) equal to that number.The specific rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Divide the grid into regions where each region consists of connected cells (horizontally or vertically adjacent).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each region must contain exactly one number that matches the total number of cells in that region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regions of the same size must not be orthogonally adjacent (they cannot share a side).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empty cells must be filled with numbers during solving to satisfy the above conditions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 11 presents a question-answer pair of the Fillomino puzzle.</p>
<p>A.2 Task with Actions</p>
<p>Blocks World is a classic domain in knowledge representation and action reasoning.It involves a set of blocks placed on a table, where blocks can be stacked or moved by an agent under certain physical constraints.</p>
<p>Specifically, the domain is formalized using the following fluents-state properties that may change over time due to actions-and a set of corresponding actions:</p>
<p>Fluents:</p>
<p>• on(x, y): block x is on top of y, where y is a location that can be a block or the table.</p>
<p>• clear(x): block x has nothing on top of it.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<p>• move(x, y, z): move a block x from location y to location z.</p>
<p>Our dataset is based on the recent work of He et al. ( 2023), which introduces a structured and large-scale Blocks World benchmark for exploring the capacity of pretrained language models for reasoning about actions and change.We consider the four sub-tasks proposed in their paper, i.e., projection, legality, plan verification, and goal recognition.</p>
<p>Projection</p>
<p>The projection task focuses on reasoning about the outcomes of actions.It involves determining whether a given proposition will be true after performing a specific sequence of actions starting from an initial state.Example 1 (Projection Task).The following is an example of negative cases, i.e., the query proposition does not hold after performing the action sequence from the given initial state.• Action sequence: Jane moves the turquoise block from the teal block to the brown block.Jane moves the turquoise block from the brown block onto the table.Jane moves the tan block from the table to the turquoise block.</p>
<p>• Query: The teal block is on top of the brown block.The green block is clear.</p>
<p>• Label: False.</p>
<p>Legality</p>
<p>This task focuses on action preconditions.It requires determining whether a given sequence of actions can be executed in order, starting from an initial state, without violating any preconditions.</p>
<p>Example 2 (Legality Task).The following is an example of negative cases, i.e., the query action sequence is not executable in the given state.• Query: Jane moves the green block from the blue block onto the table.Jane moves the green block from the purple block to the blue block.Jane moves the pink block from the green block to the blue block.</p>
<p>• Label: False.</p>
<p>Plan Verification</p>
<p>Planning involves identifying a sequence of actions that leads to a desired outcome.In this task, the focus is on verifying whether a given sequence of actions, when applied to an initial state, successfully results in the intended goal.</p>
<p>Example 3 (Plan Verification Task).The following is an example of negative cases, i.e., starting from the given state, the query action sequence leads to a state satisfying the goal.navy block.The silver block is on the table.The magenta block is clear.The violet block is clear.The magenta block is on the table.</p>
<p>• Goal: The silver block is not on the table and the red block is on the table.</p>
<p>• Query: Jane moves the violet block from the navy block to the magenta block.Jane moves the navy block from the silver block to the red block.Jane moves the silver block from the table to the navy block.</p>
<p>• Label: True.</p>
<p>Goal Recognition</p>
<p>This task focuses on identifying the intended goal based on a partial observation of actions.Starting from an initial state and given a candidate goal along with an observed sequence of actions, the objective is to determine whether the observed actions are consistent with pursuing that goal-specifically, whether they form the beginning of an optimal plan to achieve it.</p>
<p>Example 4 (Goal Recognition Task).The following is an example of negative cases, i.e., the observed sequence of actions is not a prefix of any optimal plan that achieves the goal.pos_(1, 1, 0). pos_(1, 2, 0).pos_(1, 3, 0).pos_ (1,4,8).pos_(1, 5, 5)... pos_(2, 1, 0). pos_(2, 2, 2).pos_(2, 3, 0).pos_(2, 4, 0).pos_(2, 5, 0)... pos_(3, 1, 0). pos_(3, 2, 1).pos_(3, 3, 0).pos_ (3,4,9).pos_(3, 5, 0)... pos_(4, 1, 0). pos_(4, 2, 7).pos_(4, 3, 0).pos_(4, 4, 0).pos_(4, 5, 2)... pos_(5, 1, 4).pos_(5, 2, 0).pos_(5, 3, 2).pos_(5, 4, 0).pos_(5, 5, 0)... pos_(6, 1, 0). pos_(6, 2, 0).pos_(6, 3, 0).pos_(6, 4, 0).pos_(6, 5, 0)... pos_(7, 1, 0). pos_ (7,2,9).pos_ (7,3,7).pos_ (7,4,5).pos_(7, 5, 0)... pos_(8, 1, 5).pos_ (8,2,6).pos_ (8, 3, 3). pos_(8, 4, 0).pos_(8, 5, 0)... pos_(9, 1, 0). pos_(9, 2, 0).pos_(9, 3, 0).pos_(9, 4, 0).pos_(9, 5, 0)... Output: pos (1,4,8).pos(1, 5, 1).pos(2, 2, 2).pos(3, 2, 1).pos (3,4,9).pos(3, 7, 7).pos(4, 2, 7).pos(4, 5, 2).pos(4, 6, 5).pos(4, 8, 9).pos(4, 9, 3).pos(5, 1, 4).pos(5, 3, 2).pos(6, 7, 5).pos (7,2,9).pos (7,3,7).pos (7,4,5).pos(8, 1, 5).pos (8,2,6).pos (8,3,3).pos(8, 9, 4).pos(9, 7, 6).pos (9,8,8).</p>

We use four tasks from theBlocks World domain introduced in He et al.(2023): Projection, Legality, Plan Verification, andGoal Recognition. The Blocks World consists ofan unbounded table surface and a set of blocks thatcan be stacked to form towers. Each block caneither be on another block or directly on the table.Movement of a block is constrained by precondi-tions, such as whether it is clear. As an example,the Legality task asks whether a given sequence ofactions can be executed from an initial state. In theoriginal dataset of (He et al., 2023), each task con-tains 12,000 training and 1,000 test instances. Inour experiment, we randomly sample 200 instancesper task for evaluation.Due to space constraints, detailed descriptionsand examples for all puzzles are left in the Ap-pendix.</p>
