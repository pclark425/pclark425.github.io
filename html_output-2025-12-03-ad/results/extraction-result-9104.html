<p>arXiv:physics/0211114v1 [physics.space-ph] From Wormholes to the Warp Drive: Using theoretical physics to place ultimate bounds on technology
27 Nov 2002
The serious study of such science fiction staples as wormholes, time travel, and the warp drive, as a means of understanding and constraining possible realistic solutions within General Relativity is reviewed.</p>
<p>"You cannot change the laws of physics, Captain." -Lt. Commander Montgomery Scott, Chief Engineer U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701</p>
<p>Wormholes. Time travel. The "warp drive". These staples of science fiction have today become subjects of serious study by theoretical physicists. Each of these concepts can be identified with mathematical solutions to the equations of Einstein's theory of general relativity -the modern theory of gravity, in which the phenomena of gravity are explained in terms of the geometry of curved spacetime. By studying these solutions in detail, theoretical physicists seek to better learn what bounds exist on the behavior of matter and geometry in our present physical theories. Such studies can yield new insights into the developing quantum theory of gravity, and can also help establish ultimate limits on technology -not based on the degree of scope or difficulty of an engineering challenge, but by compatibility with our core understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.</p>
<p>Three decades ago, adequate theories were first developed for three of the four fundamental forces of nature: the so-called "strong" and "weak" nuclear forces which operate on subatomic scales, and the electromagnetic force which is responsible for most of what we experience in everyday life: chemistry, biology, and technology (non-nuclear). The theoretical model of these three forces has been so successful in matching experiment that it has been termed the "Standard Model" of particle physics. Professor Howard Georgi of Harvard has testified to the robustness of the model in saying "Everything anyone has ever seen can be explained in terms of the Standard Model." While there are some highly interesting aspects of the Standard Model where new developments in particle physics are still taking place (e.g., the study of neutrino properties), the development of the Standard Model of particle physics must rank as one of the premier scientific accomplishments of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The fourth fundamental force in nature, the gravitational force, remains in many ways an enigma. Gravity was the first force for which a detailed mathematical theory was developed, by Isaac Newton, over three hundred years ago. That theory is still adequate to successfully navigate our planetary spacecraft, such as Voyagers 1 and 2, around the solar system. Einstein developed our modern theory of gravity not because Newton's theory had been found to disagree with experiment, but because Newton's theory was mathematically incompatible with the dictates of Einstein's special theory of relativity, which requires that all observers measure the same value for the speed of light, c, regardless of their state of motion (this feature of nature has been overwhelmingly confirmed by experiment and observation). Einstein's new theory, finalized in 1916, is usually called "general relativity", a name that unfortunately obscures the fact that it is actually a theory of the gravitational interaction.</p>
<p>Einstein's theory is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful theories in all of science. It describes gravity in terms of the curved geometry of the four dimensional (three space, one time) world we inhabit. Physicist John Wheeler has beautifully summarized the content of general relativity in a sentence: "Matter tells space how to curve; space tells matter how to move". The first part of the sentence tells us the origin of spacetime curvature. Matter (in any form, including energy, as per Einstein's famous E = mc 2 ) is the source of gravity, causing the curvature of space (or "spacetime", a shorthand for our four-dimensional world). The second part of the sentence describes how matter behaves in this curved four dimensional world, namely that it follows paths which are the curved space generalization of "straight lines" -geodesics. The "great circle" route of an airplane flying from New York to Tokyo is an example of a geodesic; it is not a straight line (which would pass through the solid Earth), but is the shortest path connecting the two cities along the curved surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>Despite these great strides that have been made in the understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the fundamental level, there are still many unresolved questions to attract the attention of physicists. Perhaps the greatest of these is the search for an understanding of how gravity fits together with the other three fundamental forces. It is clear that a truly fundamental theory of gravity must be quantum in nature, and general relativity is not. The contrast between the Standard Model, built on the foundation of quantum field theory, and general relativity, highly accurately tested but still inadequate because of its classical nature, has caused many to term the theory of quantum gravity to be the "holy grail" of theoretical physics. How-ever, despite decades of effort, little is year truly clear about the nature of quantum gravity. Should gravity be able to stand alone in a quantum theory, independent of the other fields that constitute nature, or can gravity only be understood in terms of a unified theory that attempts to handle all aspects of matter and its interactions at once? M-theory (sometimes called "the theory formerly known as superstrings") is a bold attempt at a theory of everything, solving the problem of the quantum theory of gravity by merging all matter and interactions into a single theory in which the fundamental objects are not point particles, but are higher dimensional objects such as loops of "superstring".</p>
<p>In ordinary matter, quantum effects become quite evident when one reaches the atomic scale, at roughly 10 −10 meters. Today's high energy particle accelerators allow us to study the behavior of matter and energy at scales as small as 10 −17 meters, where the existence of particles such as quarks, gluons, and W and Z bosons are evident that are completely invisible back up at the atomic scale. Quantum gravitational effects are expected to become important when one reaches the Planck scale, about 10 −35 meters. If superstring theory describes nature, this is the size of a typical loop of superstring material. The large difference in scale between the Planck scale of superstrings and today's experiments -some 18 orders of magnitude, a billion billion -is one reason why it is so difficult for physicists working on superstring models to make experimental predictions from their theory that can be tested with our present level of technology.</p>
<p>The even larger span between the scales at which quantum effects become evident in matter, and the Planck scale of quantum gravity, twenty-five orders of magnitude, is a realm where the semiclassical theory of gravity may be a good tool to help us understand how gravity and quantum physics are to be married. In semiclassical gravity, the gravitational field is still treated classically, being described by the curved spacetime of general relativity. The matter which creates the spacetime curvature, however, is treated using quantum field theory. The resulting theory cannot be ultimately acceptable, since it mixes classical and quantum physics, but it should be a valuable tool and approximate description of the behavior of nature over length scales (and energy scales) that reach down towards the realm where string theory may provide an ultimate exegesis.</p>
<p>Theoretical physicists expand their understanding of the strengths, limits, and behavior of a particular theory by "pushing" the theory to its limiting cases. For example, we understand general relativity much better by studying the properties of black hole solutions to the Einstein equations than we would if we restricted attention to the tiny differences between the predictions of Newtonian gravity and general relativity for, say planetary orbits. These tiny differences provide valuable experimental tests of GR, since we don't have any black holes in our near neighborhood that we can study in detail; but understanding the full range of behavior allowed by the theory is best enhanced by examining the nature of its predictions for situations that are far from "normal" -e.g., for black holes, and much more speculative solutions to the equations such as those called "wormholes", the "warp drive", and those which lead to the possibility of time travel.</p>
<p>Each of these concepts can be identified with particular spacetime geometries, and hence with mathematical solutions to Einstein's theory of general relativity. In fact, any four-dimensional geometry for a spacetime can be termed a solution of Einstein's theory -the question physics must answer is whether the matter necessary to curve spacetime into a particular "shape" is of a form compatible with nature as we understand it. If one postulates a spacetime geometry with some exotic property (e.g., a wormhole), then it is likely that "exotic" matter is necessary to generate that geometry. By "exotic matter" we mean matter that has properties not usually seen in ordinary situations -such as negative mass or energy densities. Such properties are so far from those exhibited by normal matter that we must seriously ask whether such behavior is compatible with the quantum field theory description of matter in the Standard Model. This then provides a link between extreme quantum behavior of matter and exotic geometries, and hence insight into the possibilities of quantum gravity. Next, one may ask whether the exotic geometry is stable -would small changes destroy the exotic structure, for example by closing off a wormhole. In some cases, the small change necessary to drive the instability is provided by quantum mechanics, again providing a link between these exotic spacetime structures and quantum aspects of gravity. A pencil balanced on its point is an example of a mathematical solution of the laws of mechanics which is unstable; the smallest motion will cause it to fall in one direction or another. The goal is to continue to make the model of the geometry more realistic, adding more aspects of physics to its description, and determining whether the original exotic geometry is compatible with this more realistic treatment. If physics rules the feature out, then no amount of clever engineering can hope to turn science fiction to fact; on the other hand, if no incompatibility with known physics is found, then it might be possible for future engineers to create such geometric structures in spacetime. It is important to note that the work of physicists does not aim to place limits on the potential scope of engineering, except where violations of well-tested and accepted laws of physics is involved. Simply because an engineering solution might involve energies and scales many orders of magnitude beyond what Earthly technology can achieve today does not daunt the inquiring physicist at all.</p>
<p>An example of how such a study proceeds is provided by the story of how the present interest in these concepts largely began -surprisingly enough, with science fiction, namely the writing of the novel "Contact" by Carl Sagan. Sagan asked Kip Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Physics at Caltech, for advice to help ensure that the method chosen to transport the novel's heroine across the Galaxy would not be scientifically ludicrous. Thorne suggested replacing the notion of diving through a black hole as a portal to distant realms with the idea of using a wormhole.</p>
<p>A black hole is a spherical region of spacetime surrounded by an "event horizon", which functions as a one-way "gate". Anything that crosses the event horizon into the black hole -rocks, spaceships, light itself -cannot escape the black hole. In the simplest model of a black hole, where the black hole has no spin or electric charge, any matter falling into the hole is inevitably crushed into a spacetime singularity, where the gravitational tidal forces are infinitely strong. There is no escape. The notion that black holes might provide "tunnels to elsewhere" first arose in the 1960's, when physicists found that if a black hole had an electric charge, or if it was spinning, matter (e.g., a spaceship) falling into the hole could avoid being crushed into a singularity and would eventually emerge from the confines of the hole into "another universe". This "other universe" might be identified with a distant region of our own universe, which led quickly to science fiction authors using black holes as interstellar shortcuts through spacetime. However, the physics did not stop there: through the 1970's, work by a large number of physicists (including Nobel Laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar) showed that the "tunnel" structure inside such models of black holes is unstable, both classically and quantum mechanically. By including more physics in the model, we find that the tunnel is closed off, replaced by a singularity as in the simpler black hole case. Thus, by studying these exotic models of black hole interiors in greater detail, the "science fiction" aspects were actually ruled out when nature was examined more closely.</p>
<p>For this reason, Thorne suggested that Sagan use a wormhole in his novel, rather than a black hole. A "wormhole" is, as the name suggests, a topologically distinct route between two locations which are the "mouths" of the wormhole (think of an actual wormhole which has two ends on the surface of an apple). A priori, the distance through the wormhole, from mouth to mouth, could be either longer or shorter than the conventional distance traveled through ordinary space (or over the surface of the apple). For the purposes of science fiction, wormholes that provide shortcuts through spacetime are of course preferred. Unlike a black hole, wormholes do not generally possess event horizons, there are no "one-way gates" in spacetime involved.</p>
<p>The serious study of wormhole geometries in general relativity began in the late 1980's when Thorne and his students, and subsequently many other theoretical physicists, showed that wormholes inevitably must involve "exotic matter". In order to hold the "throat" of the wormhole (between the two mouths) open, there must be some form of matter or energy present which has negative mass or energy. Every form of classical matter known to physics has positive mass, hence the term "exotic" for this alternate possibility. This is where the truly interesting research questions begin, for when one combines a quantum description of matter and energy with curved spacetime, it is known that situations involving negative mass can arise. This has even been demonstrated in the laboratory, in the Casimir effect, a very weak attractive force that exists between two uncharged parallel plates made of electrically conducting material. This force exists due to the negative energy in the volume between the two plates, which is caused by the conducting plates eliminating some of the usual vacuum modes between them. While this is an example of how quantum effects can create an effective negative mass, it is a very weak effect -the negative mass is small in magnitude (much smaller than the mass of the plates) and occupies a very small volume of space. For wormholes, the key question still being investigated today is whether any plausible configuration of quantum fields in curved spacetime could create sufficient negative mass to hold open a macroscopic wormhole -one large enough for a starship, a person, or even a single atom to pass through. So far, the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely such structures could ex-ist: strongly negative mass such as that required to hold a wormhole open has never been observed and is considered unlikely to exist (even antimatter has positive mass). The final word here is certainly not yet written; our understanding continues to improve as new models incorporating more particle physics are examined.</p>
<p>Physicists are also interested in microscopic wormholes, much smaller than a proton, down at the scale of the Planck length. These might play an important role in quantum gravity, where spacetime is often viewed as a foaming sea of tiny wormholes, forming and disappearing every instant. Another significant problem for anyone enthusiastic about wormholes is the "worm" problem: how do you create a wormhole? Perhaps a small, quantum wormhole (if they exist) could be caught and expanded to useful size. This important question has not really been addressed yet in any satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>The "warp drive" is another example of an interesting geometry that is yielding new insights to general relativity. In 1994, Miquel Alcubierre, at the time a graduate student at the University of Wales in Cardiff, published a mathematical description of a spacetime geometry that embodies the properties usually associated in science fiction with a "warp drive". In this geometry, a "starship" can apparently travel faster than the speed of light, traversing interstellar distances of many lightyears in an arbitrarily short time -both as measured by those on the starship, and those at the destination. I say "apparently", because the starship never exceeds the speed of light as measured by a local observer -the basic tenet of Einstein's special relativity is not violated. The motion of the ship occurs because the spacetime in front of the starship contracts while that behind the starship expands, transporting the starship forward. Further study has shown that such solutions are probably all unphysical, for several reasons. The foremost difficulty was noted by Alcubierre in his original paper: such solutions inevitably involve a large concentration of negative mass, which appears to be just as implausible in this context as in the case of wormholes. Still, research continues in this area, as there are enough significant variations on Alcubierre's original idea to keep theoreticians busy for some time to come.</p>
<p>Is time travel possible? Ignoring the pedestrian everyday progression of time, the question can be divided into two parts: Is it possible, within a short time (less than a human life span), to travel into the distant future? And is it possible to travel into the past? Our current understanding of fundamental physics tells us that the answer to the first question is a definite yes, and to the second, maybe.</p>
<p>The mechanism for traveling into the distant future is to use the time-dilation effect of special relativity. Special relativity teaches us that time is not absolute and universal for all possible observers: a moving clock will appear to tick more slowly the closer it approaches the speed of light. This effect, which has been overwhelmingly supported by experimental tests, applies to all types of clocks, including biological aging. Departing from Earth in a spaceship that could accelerate continuously at a comfortable one g (an acceleration that would produce a force equal to the gravity we feel everyday at the earth's surface), one would begin to approach the speed of light relative to the Earth within about a year. As the ship continued to accelerate, it would come ever closer to the speed of light, and its clocks would appear to run at an ever slower rate relative to the Earth. Under such circumstances, a round trip to the center of our Galaxy and back to the Earth-a distance of some 60,000 light-years-could be completed in only a little more than 40 years of ship time. Upon arriving back at the Earth, the astronaut would be only 40 years older, while 60,000 years would have passed on the Earth. (Note that there is no "twin paradox," because it is unambiguous that the space traveler has felt the constant acceleration for 40 years, while a hypothetical twin left behind on an identical spaceship circling the Earth has not.) Such a trip would pose formidable engineering problems: the amount of fuel required, even assuming a perfect 100% efficient conversion of mass into energy, greatly exceeds the mass of a planet. But nothing in the known laws of physics would prevent such a trip from occurring.</p>
<p>Time travel into the past is a much more uncertain proposition. There are many solutions to Einstein's equations of general relativity, including some involving wormholes in motion, that allow a person to follow a timeline that would result in her encountering herself-or her grandmother-at an earlier time. The problem, as we've seen before, is deciding whether these solutions represent situations that could occur in the real universe, or whether they are mere mathematical oddities incompatible with known physics. Much work has been done by theoretical physicists in the past decade to try to determine whether, in a universe that is initially without time travel, one can build a time machine-in other words, if it is possible to manipulate matter and the geometry of space-time in such a way as to create new paths that circle back in time. The main possible roadblock to creating a time machine seems to be a quantum instability of the spacetime -any attempt to "turn on" a time machine would result in spacetime changing its geometry to prevent the machine's operation. This instability was first discovered by Deborah Konkowski of the U.S. Naval Academy and myself in 1982. Once again, the question of the possibility of time travel remains open and an active area of research; there are serious questions as to whether this quantum instability is truly strong enough to prevent time travel, and whether there are not special quantum states that avoid the instability altogether.</p>
<p>These concepts associated with science fiction continue to be useful areas of research for real, serious, theoretical physics. By studying these solutions to Einstein's equations, we can gain new insights about the ultimate limits of gravity and its relation to quantum field theory descriptions of matter.  -Verlag 1996).</p>
