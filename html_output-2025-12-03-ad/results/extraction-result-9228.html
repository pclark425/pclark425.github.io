                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising solutions for a variety of medical and clinical decision support applications. However, LLMs are often subject to different types of biases, which can lead to unfair treatment of individuals, worsening health disparities, and reducing trust in AI-augmented medical tools. Aiming to address this important issue, in this study, we present a new model alignment approach for aligning LLMs using a preference optimization method within a knowledge distillation framework. Prior to presenting our proposed method, we first use an evaluation framework to conduct a comprehensive (largest to our knowledge) empirical evaluation to reveal the type and nature of existing biases in LLMs used for medical applications. We then offer a bias mitigation technique to reduce the unfair patterns in LLM outputs across different subgroups identified by the protected attributes. We show that our mitigation method is effective in significantly reducing observed biased patterns. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/healthylaife/FairAlignmentLLM}.</p>

<p>Aligning (Medical) LLMs for (Counterfactual) Fairness
22 Aug 20241EF2A803FCCE2778366291275FEE6951arXiv:2408.12055v1[cs.CL]
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising solutions for a variety of medical and clinical decision support applications.However, LLMs are often subject to different types of biases, which can lead to unfair treatment of individuals, worsening health disparities, and reducing trust in AI-augmented medical tools.Aiming to address this important issue, in this study, we present a new model alignment approach for aligning LLMs using a preference optimization method within a knowledge distillation framework.Prior to presenting our proposed method, we first use an evaluation framework to conduct a comprehensive (largest to our knowledge) empirical evaluation to reveal the type and nature of existing biases in LLMs used for medical applications.We then offer a bias mitigation technique to reduce the unfair patterns in LLM outputs across different subgroups identified by the protected attributes.We show that our mitigation method is effective in significantly reducing observed biased patterns.Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/healthylaife/FairAlignmentLLM.</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) has generated immense excitement across various applications, including in business, education, and healthcare.In healthcare, LLMs hold the promise of revolutionizing clinical decisionmaking processes and enablers of AI generalists [1].With their capacity for natural language understanding, they have shown promise in applications like summarizing medical notes, answering patient questions, and generating discharge letters [2].Their potential to assist in clinical decision support (CDS), through tasks such as disease diagnosis, patient triage, and treatment planning, is particularly noteworthy [3,4].</p>
<p>Despite their potential benefits, the application of LLMs in medicine raises significant concerns about the responsible development and deployment of those, including the concerns about the potential for biased and unfair treatment of individuals [5,6,7,8,9].The high-stakes nature of clinical decisionmaking necessitates a critical examination of the fairness of LLMs in these domains.Existing studies have documented the presence of biases in LLMs, across various medical scenarios and protected groups [10,11,12].</p>
<p>These biases can be sourced from various stages of model development, including the training data, training procedure, and inference mechanism [13].For instance, a common source of biased behavior of LLMs (similar to other ML models [14,15,16]) relates to learning spurious relationships between the protected attributes (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender) and the desired health outcomes, leading to underperformance for his-torically marginalized populations and potentially exacerbating existing health disparities.</p>
<p>In general, methods for mitigating bias patterns in ML models can be categorized into pre-, in-, and post-processing categories [17].For LLMs, a better way [18] of categorizing such methods relates to the same three sources of biases highlighted above and includes: (a) data-related (modifying the original data to reflect/represent less biased data), (b) model parameter-related (changing the parameters of LLMs via gradient-based updates or by adding new regularisation or loss function), and (c) inference-based (modifying the behavior of inference, like the weights or decoding behavior).</p>
<p>Each of these categories of bias mitigation methods has its own limitations.Specifically, both data-related and model parameter-related methods often have scalability issues, as both types generally require access to auxiliary datasets that are hard to collect/generate at a large scale and can be the source of new biases.Model parameter-related methods also often require access to model parameters and extensive computing resources for training.Moreover, inference-based methods face challenges of maintaining output diversity and relying on the performance of auxiliary classification methods.</p>
<p>Focusing on medical LLMs, in this study we present a new model parameter-related approach that aligns the Target LLM (i.e., the LLM that we aim to improve) using a preference optimization method within a knowledge distillation framework.Our approach uses a teacher LLM to create a preference dataset to ensure that the Target (student) LLM's responses, even when prompted with questions containing sensitive attributes, closely match the unbiased answers provided by the teacher model.We demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique through our evaluation framework.</p>
<p>Prior to presenting our mitigation approach, we first conduct a large-scale analysis across multiple clinical datasets and tasks, evaluating a diverse range of general-purpose and clinically focused LLMs.This allows us to rigorously demonstrate the extent of bias in LLMs in various medical applications and pinpoint specific tasks and patient populations at risk.In our empirical analysis, we use a comprehensive framework for evaluating the fairness of LLMs in clinical applications.While several prior studies have followed a similar path to study the bias patterns in medical LLMs, the scale of our empirical analysis (across dimensions of LLM types, protected attributes, and prompting methods) is larger than those.</p>
<p>This way, our contributions can be formulated as follows:</p>
<p>• We present an evaluation framework to conduct a comprehensive evaluation to quantify social biases in LLMs used in medical applications.We extensively analyze multiple LLM types, datasets, and prompting techniques, demonstrating existing fairness challenges in medical LLMs.</p>
<p>• We propose a mitigation technique for fairness concerns using model alignment techniques, in a knowledge distillation framework.We show that our mitigation method is effective in reducing observed biased patterns.</p>
<p>II. COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF BIAS PATTERNS</p>
<p>We first run an extensive series of experiments to show the type of bias patterns that LLMs show when used in medical tasks.In this study, we adopt a common way to conceptualize fairness in ML models (including LLMs), which is through the lens of counterfactual fairness [19].Counterfactual fairness examines how model predictions change when sensitive attributes are altered (for simplicity, we refer to counterfactual fairness as fairness).This way of framing fairness is the basis of the "red-teaming" strategies to examine bias patterns in medical LLMs [20,12].</p>
<p>To comprehensively assess the bias patterns, we follow our comprehensive evaluation framework.Leveraging standardized question-answering (QA) datasets [11,21,10], we employ a red-teaming strategy to systematically rotate patient demographics (e.g., race, ethnicity, gender) within each clinical query, allowing us to construct realistic scenarios.By quantifying discrepancies in LLM responses across these demographic groups for each question, we can identify and measure bias.This approach enables us to identify discrepancies in LLM responses attributable to demographic factors, providing a quantitative measure of bias.Our framework further examines the influence of model architecture and prompting techniques on bias manifestation by analyzing responses across generalpurpose and clinical-focused open-source LLMs, as well as through zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain of Thought prompting.Figure 1 shows our evaluation framework, consisting of three dimensions of datasets (studied scenarios), LLMs, and prompting techniques.</p>
<p>A. Dimension 1: Datasets</p>
<p>To assess and quantify the social biases encoded within LLMs, we leverage clinical QA datasets using vignettes.Clinical vignettes serve as standardized narratives depicting specific patient presentations within the healthcare domain.These narratives typically include a defined set of clinical features and symptoms, with the aim of simulating realistic clinical scenarios for controlled evaluation.Notably, we evaluated social biases in LLMs' answers to clinical questions using vignettes from three angles: pain management [11] through the Q-Pain dataset, treatment recommendations [21], and patient triage [10].To effectively assess the extent to which demographics impact LLMs' responses, we run each vignette multiple times while randomly rotating the vignettes' patient demographics and perform this process for all three datasets.All vignettes are carefully designed such that the studied sensitive attributes (gender and race) are neutral with respect to the outcomes of interest (for example, treatment of appendicitis patients).We briefly present the three datasets in the Appendix.</p>
<p>B. Dimension 2: LLMs</p>
<p>We examine both general-purpose LLMs and open-source clinical LLMs to gain insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of domain-specific fine-tuning to mitigate bias in clinical settings.</p>
<p>• General-purpose: Llama 3.1 (8B) [22] and Gemma 2 (9B) [23] • Domain-focused: Meditron (7B) [24] and Llama 3-OpenBioLLM [25] (8B) This selection of LLMs, with different architectures and (pre-)training data, allows us to assess the potential benefits of certain architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical tasks.</p>
<p>C. Dimension 3: Prompting Strategies</p>
<p>Prompting methods can play a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs [26].We investigate different prompting and reasoning techniques to explore how these models engage with complex tasks and queries.Specifically, we use the following three techniques: zero-shot (no prior examples or guidance), few-shot [27] (provides a few examples to guide the LLMs), and Chain of Thought [28], which extends fewshot prompting by providing step-by-step explanations of the answers to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities and further improves the accuracy and interoperability of the LLM's answers.</p>
<p>Since only Q-Pain [11] provides detailed explanations for each sample case, we investigate prompt engineering on this dataset and we employ zero-shot prompting for the other datasets.We provide further details on the prompting process in the Appendix.</p>
<p>D. Bias Evaluation</p>
<p>To quantify potential social biases in LLM responses, we use the following statistical framework.For the Q-Pain (pain management) and treatment recommendation tasks, where LLM outputs were binary (yes/no for medication or referral), we employ a framework centered around the concept of minimax fairness [29], aiming to minimize the maximum disparity between different demographic groups.Rather than focusing on equalizing outcomes across all demographic groups (group fairness), minimax fairness prioritizes the worst-performing group, ensuring that no group population is systematically disadvantaged [30].We report the maximum probability difference between any two demographic groups for each question in the datasets.We report the average maximum differences across all questions.</p>
<p>We also use Welch's ANOVA tests to determine if there are statistically significant discrepancies in the output probabilities.This non-parametric approach is robust to violations of the</p>
<p>E. Results of Empirical Evaluation</p>
<p>We report the observed patterns across the three datasets.To prevent "fairness gerrymandering" [31], we report combined results for gender and race.Additionally, we explored the influence of different prompting techniques on fairness for the Q-Pain dataset.</p>
<p>a) Q-Pain: We first evaluated the impact of the rotating demographics on Q-Pain's vignettes [11] and report the average maximum difference in each question between two subgroups in Figure 3 (blue hues).We compare three prompting techniques, as indicated by: Base (Zero-Shot), Base (Few-Shot), and Base (CoT), where Base refers to the base LLM, without any modification to it.Meditron, a medical LLM, seems to be more sensitive to changes in demographics than other LLMs, on average.Notably, we have found significant discrepancies (under Welch's ANOVA test with a p-value ≤ 0.05) in the CNC (Chronic Non-Cancer) and ANC (Acute Non-Cancer) tasks with Few-Shot Prompting, and in the CNC task with Chain of Thought.This suggests the potential for bias amplification in clinically-tuned models.In addition, some tasks appeared to be more prone to bias than others, which is helpful in identifying potential prejudices in real-world applications.For example, the impact of rotating demographics is larger for the CNC task than for the other tasks for almost all models.</p>
<p>b) Treatment Recommendation: We assessed the biases in the context of treatment recommendations, where given a summary of a patient case, the models were asked whether the patient should be referred to a specialist and whether it was necessary to perform advanced medical imaging.Similar to the Q-Pain dataset, we computed the maximum difference in probabilities for closed-ended responses (yes/no) across demographic subgroups.We report the results in Figure 4 (blue bars).While we found no statistically significant discrepancies between any pairs of demographics at a global level for either the Referral or Imaging, we found differences in the probability outputs of more than 15% in 6 of the 10 imaging referral questions for Llama 3-OpenBioLLM, with the biggest difference being 35%, and 2 out of 10 for both Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2. While Meditron showed the most biased generations in the Q-Pain task, it showed no alarming results on this dataset, with the biggest discrepancy being less than 2%.c) Triage: We have also investigated biases in a task designed to evaluate nurses' perception of patients [10], which is particularly critical in triage.Here, the LLMs were asked about their agreement to a statement given a specific case.The models were specifically asked to answer on a 1-5 Likert scale.We report the results of our experiment on this task in Figure 5 (top row).The stacked bar charts visually depict the proportion of ratings (1-5) assigned to each demographic group.A similar distribution of rating categories for each demographic group would indicate unbiased model behavior.Deviations from this ideal suggest potential biases in the models' assessments.We have found that Llama 3-OpenBioLLM exhibited statistically significant biases for the majority of demographic pairs, as shown by a Pearson Chi-Squared test (Figure 6), with a p-value ≤ 0.05.Additionally, we have found significant differences in the results of Gemma 2 and Meditron.</p>
<p>Clinically fine-tuned models showed the most prevalent biases in almost all tasks, pushing for more scrutiny in the development of such specialized LLMs.These findings highlight the potential for biases in medical decisions based on demographic factors, emphasizing the need for robust fairness evaluation and mitigation.</p>
<p>III. ALIGNING MEDICAL LLMS TO IMPROVE FAIRNESS</p>
<p>To address bias patterns seen in medical LLMs, we propose a novel model alignment technique centered on improving fairness from preference datasets.We leverage a teacher model to serve as a reference point, and guide the Target LLM towards fairer decision-making through a Preference Optimization (PO) method.The teacher model serves as a gold standard, responding to medical queries.Before presenting the detailed steps of our method, we present a very brief background on aligning LLMs.</p>
<p>A. A Short Background on LLM Alignment</p>
<p>The core process to reduce unwanted (such as dangerous or biased) outcomes in pre-trained LLMs involves aligning the LLM outcomes with the desired values.Supervised finetuning (SFT) based on human feedback (the gold standard for alignment) is not scalable and can introduce new biases.Accordingly, alternative approaches are used to 'generalize' from finite human preferences, often in the form of reinforcement learning (RL) approaches.When learning directly from human preferences, the process is commonly referred to as RL from human feedback (RLHF), and when learning from a strong (teacher) LLM to scale human preferences, the process is referred to as RL from AI feedback (RLAIF, a knowledge distillation process).</p>
<p>The most common method to implement the RL framework has been PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) [32] to work with preferences.Due to the complex nature and instability of PPO-based method, various types of PO algorithms have been presented in the literature, including DPO [33], ORPO [34], and SimPO [35].Per the Bradley-Terry model [36] for converting pairs (of preferences) to Elo scores (i.e., assigning numerical values to the responses), existing PO methods have an objective in the form of:
max π θ E (x,yw,y l )∼D [Ψ(p * (y w &gt; y l |x))] − τ D KL (π θ ||π ref ),
where p * is the human preference, π ref and π θ refer to the 'policy' encoded by the existing and the updated LLMs, respectively; τ is a hyperparameter, (x, y w , y l ) ∈ D is the tuple containing the prompt x, the winning response y w , and the losing response y l drawn from a preference dataset D, and D KL shows the KL divergence.A 'policy' that is being optimized here refers to the 'action' that the LLM takes (i.e., picking winning versus losing).Importantly, replacing Ψ with different functions yields different PO techniques, like, Ψ = Logit() and Ψ = I() yield DPO [33] and IPO [37], respectively.These methods require a reference policy, which can increase the computational requirements.</p>
<p>Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) offers another variation by introducing a simpler reward function without requiring a reference policy.The SimPO objective is:
a = β |yw| log π θ (y w |x), b = β |y l | log π θ (y l |x), L SimP O (π θ ) = −E (x,yw,y l )∼D [log σ (a − b − γ)] ,(1)
where γ is the target reward margin term, β a tradeoff hyperparameter, and σ is the sigmoid function.By learning directly from preference pairs, SimPO effectively aligns models with desired outcomes.However, constructing fair preference datasets remains a challenge.</p>
<p>B. Proposed Method</p>
<p>At a high level, our proposed method prompts a teacher model with a medical query, generating a reference answer.The same query goes through a Random Prompt Modifier unit, which injects sensitive attributes (e.g., demographics) into the question, acting as a red teaming agent.The Target LLM is then prompted to answer the modified query twice, producing two candidate answers (Answer 1 and 2 in the figure).The candidate answers are ranked based on their closeness in semantics to the reference answer, generating a preference dataset.The preferences are then used to align the LLM through a PO method.Figure 2 (left panel) shows the three steps in our proposed aligning technique, including (1) data generation, (2) preference ranking, and (3) model alignment.</p>
<p>a) Data Generation: First, we introduce a methodology to create a set of counterfactual questions, to be used later in the preference-ranking stage.From a set of neutral (with no information about the patient demographics) questions, we ask a teacher LLM to add demographic information to the question, while keeping the original meaning intact.The sensitive attributes (gender, race, and ethnicity) to be added are randomly chosen from a curated list, that is, not chosen by the LLM itself.This ensures that this random process is truly random and not influenced by the LLM's own potential biases.The teacher model could be a larger, pre-trained LLM, or the Target Model itself within an agentic workflow [38].</p>
<p>This process leaves us with pairs of similar questions.While the presence of demographics in the question differs within the pair, the underlying question remains the same, and the answers should thus be the same in both scenarios.Deviations from this can indicate a violation of counterfactual fairness.The right panel in Figure 2 shows an example scenario.</p>
<p>In medical scenarios, it is pivotal to carefully check the reference queries to ensure that the scenarios have no justifiable differences from one demographic to the other.For example for pain management, the race of the patient should not change their treatment.However, in treating pregnancy complications, males should be excluded due to the biological impossibility.This approach allows for a direct comparison of LLM responses under varying demographic conditions while controlling for the underlying medical query.</p>
<p>b) Preference Ranking: The two generated answers are ranked during the preference ranking phase.We first leverage the teacher model, which acts as a reference point.We start by asking the reference question (the one without sensitive information) from the teacher model and note the resulting answer as the reference answer.In parallel, each modified question (containing explicit referral to sensitive attributes) is presented to the target LLM and asked to answer in two different ways, resulting in two candidate responses.To determine how close in meaning the candidate answers are to the reference answers, we first extract the sentence embeddings produced by a text embeddings model specifically pre-trained for Semantic Textual Similarity [39].Then, we calculate the cosine similarity between the two candidate answers and the reference answer.The response exhibiting the highest  similarity to the teacher's response is then deemed as the winning answer, while the other response is considered as the losing answer.For each medical query x, we then obtain a tuple (x, y w , y l ), where y w is the winning answer and y l is the losing answer.By iterating this process across all queries, we construct a preference dataset D = {(x i , y wi , y li )} N i=1 , where N is the total number of queries.</p>
<p>c) Model Alignment: Finally, we use SimPO [35], as described in Eq. 1, to fine-tune the target LLM based on the newly constructed preference dataset D. To reduce the overall computational constraint of fine-tuning such models and preventing overfitting, we fine-tune the models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) [40,41].LoRA decomposes the weight matrix update, ∆W , into the product of two smaller matrices, A and B: ∆W = AB, where ∆W ∈ R d×k , A ∈ R d×r , and B ∈ R r×k .Because r ≪ min(d, k), LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters.By preserving the original weights and introducing low-rank matrices, LoRA accelerates training, reduces memory consumption, and helps prevent catastrophic forgetting.</p>
<p>C. Results of Proposed Alignment Method</p>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation technique, we fine-tuned the LLMs previously evaluated in our empirical evaluation and applied our evaluation framework.This comparative analysis allows us to quantify our method's impact on reducing bias in LLM outputs.Throughout our experiments, we have used Gemini [42], a commercial LLM, as our teacher model, and Gecko [43], as our text embeddings model for semantic text similarity.Lastly, we used clinical questions derived from the EquityMedQA dataset [44], a collection of seven datasets containing both human-authored by 80 medical experts and AI-generated medical queries, designed to elicit biased responses from LLMs as a basis for our preference dataset.After curating the datasets for our particular use case, we were left with a dataset of about 1,500 queries.</p>
<p>a) Q-Pain: We report our mitigation results on the Q-Pain dataset in Figure 3 (brown hues).Similar to the previously discussed results from the base models, we report the results with our proposed mitigation method with three prompting techniques: Aligned (Zero-Shot), Aligned (Few-Shot), and Aligned (CoT).This process allows us to compare our mitigation technique to the base models as well as the impact of the prompting techniques.</p>
<p>Our results indicate that our proposed alignment technique effectively mitigates bias, as evidenced by reduced maximum differences compared to baseline models.Notably, Meditron no longer shows significant biases under our Welch's ANOVA test for any prompting strategy.Additionally, Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2 exhibit the best improvement when aligned, showcasing minimal discrepancies in the probabilities between subgroups for almost all tasks and prompting techniques.While the magnitude of improvement differs between models and tasks, the overall improvement is consistently observed for all models and tasks.A more granular analysis reveals that the effectiveness of our mitigation method varies across different tasks and model combinations.For instance, Gemma 2 showed its worst improvements on the Post Op (postoperative) task, the same task where Llama 3.1 saw the greatest improvement.Although CoT prompting generally outperforms both Zero-Shot and Few-Shot prompting, the combined use of the alignment and CoT yields the most promising results, advocating for a multi-faceted approach to mitigate bias in clinical LLMs.</p>
<p>b) Treatment Recommendation: As shown in Figure 4 (orange bars), our mitigation technique reduced bias in both imaging and referral tasks within the Treatment Recommendation dataset.This is evidenced by a consistent decrease in maximum difference across all models relative to their base counterparts.Notably, Llama 3-OpenBioLLM and Gemma 2 demonstrated particularly pronounced bias reductions.c) Triage: Consistent with our previous findings, our mitigation technique greatly reduced social biases on this task as shown by the bottom row in Figure 5.This is particularly visible for Llama 3.1, Llama 3-OpenBioLLM and Gemma 2. These baseline models exhibited statistically significant biases during our red-teaming test, as depicted in Figure 6.These biases were effectively mitigated through the application of our proposed method.While our alignment method effectively reduced the statement rating disparities between models, residual differences in rating distributions remain.However, statistical tests indicate these discrepancies are likely attributable to random variation rather than the models' systematic biases.d) Impact of the Teacher Model: To study the degree to which the choice of the teacher model (its power and biases) may impact the performance of our mitigation method, we run a similar series of experiments while having the same Target Model also act as the teacher model (acting as the teacher and student agent).Following such an agentic workflow, for each tested LLM, we applied our mitigation method and then performed our evaluation framework.

We report the results of our experiments in Figures 7, 8, and 9.These results show a consistent ability to reduce observed bias patterns, compared to using a separate stronger teacher model in our method (only slightly lower, but still significant as shown in Figure 10).These experiments also show that mitigating fairness using our knowledge distillation framework can be achieved even when the teacher model has a limited capacity to generate unbiased outcomes (i.e., when the Target model generates biased patterns as a student).</p>
<p>e) Impact on Target LLM's Performance: To evaluate the trade-off between bias reduction and model performance, we assessed the quality of LLM-generated responses on a subset of 500 PubMedQA questions [45].PubMedQA is a popular benchmarking dataset collected from biomedical abstracts indexed on the PubMed platform.As shown in Figure 11, we found no major decrease in the LLMs' performance (accuracy) after using our alignment technique.</p>
<p>IV. RELATED WORK</p>
<p>While our work builds upon a rich body of existing research, here, we focus on two key areas related to our work.</p>
<p>a) Medical LLMs: The emergence of LLMs has precipitated a paradigm shift in numerous domains, including healthcare.General-purpose LLMs (e.g., Claude [46], Llama [22], Gemini [42], and GPT-4), often trained on medical text as well, have been applied to tasks such as generating discharge documents [47], converting clinical narratives into structured data with standard format [48], and education [49].In addition to general-purpose LLMs, specialized models for medical applications are present.For instance, Med-PaLM [50] extends Google's PaLM [51], developed with prompttuning for medical queries, and Palmyra-Med [52] leverages a custom medical dataset.Additionally, Meta's Llama [53] has been adapted in various ways, including Meditron [24] which extends pre-training on a curated medical corpus.While these models show promise, their potential biases remain a critical area of investigation.</p>
<p>Assessing bias in LLMs is crucial for responsible deployment in medical applications.Prior research has employed various methods, including specialized datasets like Q-Pain [11] and comparative studies against human experts [54,12].Similarly, Pfohl et al. [44] proposed a new framework and dataset to assess LLMs' bias and fairness against human ratings and evaluated Med-PaLM on the proposed dataset.Furthermore, Zack et al. [10] evaluated whether GPT-4 encodes racial and gender biases and explored how these biases

<p>might affect medical education, diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient assessment.Reported findings highlight the potential for biased LLMs to perpetuate stereotypes and lead to inaccurate clinical reasoning [55].While these efforts provide valuable insights, a comprehensive framework is needed to evaluate fairness across diverse LLM applications and mitigate potential biases.b) Model Alignment: Given the limitations of pre-trained LLMs in accurately following human instructions, researchers have explored various techniques to enhance their alignment with human preferences [56].Recent advances in model alignment [33,57,37] have shown promising results in aligning LLMs' generations to human preferences.Although such alignment techniques have been used to improve factuality [58] or reduce toxicity [59], they often overlook the fundamental problem of bias embedded within the models themselves.Specifically, in the clinical domain, a study by Manathunga and Hettigoda [60] used a parameter and dataefficient solution for fine-tuning GPT 3.5 for medical questionanswering.Moreover, Han et.al [61] fine-tuned medical LLMs (Medalpaca [62], and Meditron [24]) on demonstrations of general safety [63], and medical safety.However, these studies have not investigated the issue of counterfactual fairness within medical LLMs</p>
<p>V. DISCUSSION</p>
<p>This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in mitigating bias in LLMs applied to clinical tasks.Our proposed bias evaluation framework enabled a rigorous assessment of model performance, revealing consistent reductions in maximum difference across various models and datasets.Our bias evaluation framework and our mitigation technique represent a critical step toward ensuring the fairness and reliability of AI-driven clinical systems.</p>
<p>By aligning the Target LLM within our PO framework, our technique can ensure that the generated responses are consistent and fair when presented with prompts containing sensitive information.This approach is particularly relevant in clinical settings, where unbiased predictions are crucial for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient care.Furthermore, our technique can be easily integrated into existing clinical LLM workflows, making it a practical and effective solution for mitigating bias in healthcare applications.</p>
<p>While we rank both candidate answers according to their semantic similarity to the reference answer, it is important to note that this does not inherently imply a fairness disparity between the two.Both responses may be considered fair (or unfair), with the winning answer simply aligning closer to the reference answer.Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate that even without knowing the exact fairer answer, our method can help mitigate fairness concerns.Such an unsupervised approach enables scalable application of our method.</p>
<p>Although our method yielded improvements across the board, some of the model-task combinations seemed to perform better than others, highlighting potential areas to further maximize bias mitigation.Additionally, our findings show the impact of teacher model strength in our bias mitigation approach.A stronger teacher model leads to greater bias reduction and better knowledge preservation than using the Target LLM itself.</p>
<p>Our study is limited in a few ways.First, we focused on counterfactual fairness, which, while relevant to many practical scenarios, does not encompass all facets of bias.Moreover, our method (in its current form) relies on opensource LLMs with access to model parameters, which might be restrictive in working with closed-source models.However, we expect a similar method where the Target LLM is kept frozen and alignment is performed through soft prompting layers would achieve comparable results.Lastly, while we focus on addressing fairness concerns within computational settings, real-world implementation requires careful consideration of ethical implications and potential unintended consequences beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>APPENDIX</p>
<p>A. Prompting Strategies</p>
<p>In this study, we have examined how zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain of Thought prompting methods affect LLMs and their potential biases in healthcare applications.</p>
<p>a) Zero-shot: Zero-shot prompting is a common prompting approach for guiding large language models (LLMs) on new tasks.It involves providing the LLM with clear instructions and a brief prompt, rather than extensive additional data.The prompt sets the context and desired outcome for the LLM, allowing it to leverage its existing knowledge and understanding of language to complete the task.While not as powerful as tailored prompting techniques, zero-shot prompting offers a convenient way to expand the capabilities of LLMs without a heavy investment in data or training time.</p>
<p>b) Few-shot: Few-shot prompting is a technique that builds upon zero-shot prompting for guiding large language models (LLMs) on new tasks.While zero-shot prompting relies solely on clear instructions and a brief prompt, few-shot prompting goes a step further.It provides the LLM with a few real-world examples alongside the prompt.These examples help the LLM grasp the nuances of the task and improve its performance compared to zero-shot prompting.While requiring slightly more data than zero-shot, few-shot prompting offers a good balance between efficiency and effectiveness, making it a popular choice for various LLM applications.c) Chain of Thought: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting is an advanced prompting technique that aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).Unlike zero-shot or few-shot prompting, which focus on providing instructions and examples, CoT prompting encourages the LLM to explain its thought process.It achieves this by incorporating prompts that ask the LLM to break down its reasoning steps into a series of logical explanations.While CoT prompting offers significant advantages, it can also be computationally more expensive compared to simpler prompting techniques.However, its ability to improve transparency and potentially accuracy makes it a valuable tool for tasks where understanding the LLM's reasoning is crucial.</p>
<p>B. Tasks and Prompt Examples</p>
<p>a) Q-Pain: Q-Pain is a vignette-based dataset for assessing bias in medical QA in the context of pain management [11].The dataset is split into 5 different medical contexts related to pain management.In all cases, we asked the models whether the patients should receive pain management medication or not.Because this is a closed question, we can use the probability distribution of each word in the sequence to infer the impact of the demographics on the probability of answering no to the question, that is, refusing to administrate a pain medication.This allows us to directly evaluate the impact of the demographic changes without the need to run the experiments a significant amount of times.Here, we report sample prompts for the three different prompting techniques using the Q-Pain dataset.</p>
<p>Zero  [10] proposed a vignette-based dataset containing 8 different challenging cases to simulate a triage scenario where the LLMs would need to make decisions based on their perception of the patients' pain and illness severity.The LLMs would then be shown a statement related to the case and asked about their agreement with the statement on a Likert scale (from 1 to 5, where 1 means the model strongly disagrees and 5 means the model strongly agrees).Each of the 22 questions relates to one of the following five categories: perception of patient dishonesty, perception of patient understanding, perception of relationships, treatment decisions regarding pain, and other treatment decisions.Because the questions are non-binary by default, we cannot use the probabilities to infer the true token probability distribution.Therefore, we run each prompt multiple times and infer the underlying distribution from the results.As an example, we report a sample prompt used to query the LLMs on this task: You will be given a situation and a statement.You will then be asked to rate your agreement with the statement on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree.Situation: A 48-year-old [race] [gender] presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and 4 days of constipation.Workup reveals a mass in [subject] right colon for which [subject] undergoes a hemicolectomy.The operation is uncomplicated and, after awakening from anesthesia, the patient is sent to recover on the surgical floor.You assess the patient on postoperative day 1 and the patient reports extreme unbearable pain, saying that [subject] did not sleep at all through the night.However, it was reported that [subject] did sleep intermittently through the night and whenever [subject] woke up all [subject] asked for is "stronger pain medicine."Statement: This patient is exaggerating their level of pain. 1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree Select the option that best describes your decision.c) Treatment Recommendation: Additionally, we use the vignettes from NEJM Healer [21] presented for evaluating social bias in treatment recommendation [10].In this task, the models would be given a short summary of a case and would then be asked whether the patient would need to be referred to a specialist or if any advanced medical imaging was needed, as defined by CT scans, MRIs, or abdominal ultrasounds.Similar to the method used for Q-Pain, we design the questions to be of closed form so we can leverage the tokens' probabilities to evaluate the differences in the likelihood of answering yes to the questions with the rotating demographics.As an example, we report a sample prompt used to query the LLMs on this task:</p>
<p>You are a master diagnostician with extensive clinical expertise and knowledge.I will present a very brief summary of the case and I would like you to produce the following
