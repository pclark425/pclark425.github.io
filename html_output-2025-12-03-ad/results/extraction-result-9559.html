<p>This introduction provides an overview of the transformative impact of AI/ML in the context of DevSecOps, highlighting key trends, challenges, and opportunities.It sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the strategies and best practices for leveraging AI/ML to revolutionize software development.</p>
<p>In recent years, the proliferation of AI/ML technologies has revolutionized various industries, offering unprecedented capabilities for data analysis, pattern recognition, and decision-making.In the realm of software development, AI/ML holds immense promise for enhancing security, efficiency, and innovation.</p>
<p>The traditional approach to software development often entails siloed processes, with security considerations addressed as an afterthought.However, in today's threat landscape, characterized by sophisticated cyber attacks and stringent regulatory requirements, embedding security into the development process from the outset is imperative.This is where DevSecOps emerges as a guiding philosophy, advocating for the seamless integration of security practices into every stage of the software development lifecycle.</p>
<p>The convergence of AI/ML with DevSecOps enables organizations to address security challenges with unprecedented agility and effectiveness.By harnessing AI/ML algorithms, organizations can automate threat detection, predict vulnerabilities, and intelligently automate security processes.This not only enhances the security posture of software systems but also accelerates the pace of development by reducing manual intervention and streamlining workflows.</p>
<p>However, the integration of AI/ML into DevSecOps is not without its challenges.Organizations must navigate issues related to data privacy, algorithm transparency, and ethical considerations.Moreover, the complexity of AI/ML models and the need for specialized expertise pose additional hurdles for implementation and adoption.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of AI/ML in DevSecOps are immense.By embracing this convergence, organizations can strengthen their security defenses, accelerate time-to-market, and drive innovation.This paper explores the strategies, best practices, and real-world examples that illustrate the transformative power of AI/ML in revolutionizing DevSecOps practices.Through a comprehensive analysis, it aims to provide insights and guidance for organizations seeking to harness the full potential of AI/ML in their software development endeavors.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a notable surge in interest surrounding Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) within the realm of Software Engineering (SE).GenAI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT have swiftly gained traction across diverse professional domains due to their remarkable ability to generate human-like content.However, the increasing adoption of these tools has reignited longstanding concerns regarding productivity and quality when integrating new technologies into existing workflows.</p>
<p>Notably, tasks such as code generation and test case optimization within SE stand to directly benefit from the advancements offered by recent large language models (LLMs) [1,2,3,4].</p>
<p>Beyond the conventional scope of applied Machine Learning (ML) research, GenAI tools have introduced a new dimension of usability and accessibility.By harnessing AI-generated content, these tools cater to a broader spectrum of professionals, requiring less technical expertise for integration into existing work environments.Furthermore, GenAI tools exhibit promising potential beyond coding-related tasks, extending their utility to areas such as requirements engineering, software processes, and project management.</p>
<p>Currently, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) stands as an active research domain, replete with various challenges and unresolved inquiries.Large language models (LLMs), in particular, necessitate fine-tuning or training to excel in specific tasks.Research endeavors have predominantly focused on achieving consistent and scalable GenAI output across a spectrum of Software Engineering (SE) tasks.</p>
<p>However, it's crucial to note that GenAI models inherently exhibit non-deterministic behavior, as the same prompt may yield different responses across different inference executions [5].Furthermore, the output of GenAI tools can significantly vary based on input parameters or settings, thereby posing challenges for their reliable application [6,7].A recurring concern with AI-generated content is the potential for hallucination, where outputs may deviate from reality and manifest as imaginary or fictional content [8].Despite these challenges, the potential for AI automation in SE appears promising, particularly when these open challenges are adequately addressed [9].</p>
<p>A research agenda serves as a valuable tool for guiding and organizing research efforts within specific domains [10,11,12,13,14,15]. Typically, it comprises a review of existing literature, alongside directions, visions, and priorities, thereby enabling researchers to make meaningful contributions and tackle pertinent challenges within their respective fields.This research agenda, rooted in past and ongoing work on GenAI in SE, is crafted based on insights garnered from focus groups and literature reviews.</p>
<p>While the literature review may not encompass every aspect due to the rapidly evolving nature of the topic, the focus groups offer practical insights into the anticipated future roles of GenAI in software development.The research agenda delineates 11 key areas of concern, namely: Requirements Engineering, Software Design, Software Implementation, Quality Assurance, Software Maintenance and Evolution, Software Processes and Tools, Engineering Management, Professional Competencies, Software Engineering Education, Macro Aspects, and Fundamental concerns of GenAI.This work draws upon two international events as its foundation.The first focus group was conducted as part of the inaugural international workshop on AI-assisted Agile Software Development, aimed at exploring the benefits and challenges of integrating AI into Agile software development practices.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the Requirements Engineering (RE) conference, the second international workshop on Requirements Engineering for Software Startups and Emerging Technologies (RESET) was organized, with a special emphasis on GenAI and Requirements Engineering.These events provided invaluable insights and discussions that inform the research agenda outlined herein.</p>
<p>Literature review</p>
<p>The application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) in Software Engineering (SE) research has a longstanding history [16,17,18].However, the specific utilization of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) represents a more recent and burgeoning area of interest.While the potential of GenAI has been recognized for some time, advancements in this field have accelerated rapidly in recent years.Although earlier studies have explored the use of models like GPT-2 for code generation [19], the widespread integration of GenAI into SE research did not gain prominence until around 2020.The release of services such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT-3 has catalyzed a surge in research interest across various disciplines, including SE.Currently, numerous papers are available through self-archiving repositories such as arXiv and paperwithcode.To provide a foundation for further discussion within our research agenda, this section presents relevant terms and definitions (Section 2.1), traces the historical development of GenAI (Section 2.2), and delves into the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Section 2.3).-Natural Language Processing (NLP): A branch of AI focused on facilitating interactions between computers and human language, involving the development of algorithms and models enabling computers to comprehend, interpret, and generate human language.</p>
<p>Terminologies</p>
<p>-Language Model: A statistical AI model trained to predict the subsequent word in a sequence, applied across various NLP tasks such as classification and generation [23].</p>
<p>-Large Language Model (LLM): A language model featuring a substantial number of weights and parameters, along with a complex training architecture enabling it to perform diverse NLP tasks, including text generation, classification, and conversational question answering [21].</p>
<p>While the concept of LLM is widely utilized, particularly in the context of GenAI models, defining precisely what constitutes 'large' remains ambiguous.Nonetheless, given its prevalent usage, we adopt this term in this paper, acknowledging its inherent ambiguity.Additionally, we introduce the concept of prompt engineering, which involves designing and refining prompts to instruct or query LLMs effectively.</p>
<p>History of GenAI</p>
<p>To contextualize GenAI and elucidate its evolution, we provide a succinct historical overview of AI development over the past 80 years:</p>
<p>Fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs):</p>
<p>LLMs, or Large Language Models, represent a class of artificial intelligence systems specifically designed to comprehend and process natural language.These models are a subset of machine learning (ML) models that utilize deep artificial neural networks to analyze vast amounts of language data.Trained on extensive datasets comprising millions of sentences and words, LLMs undergo a training process that involves predicting the next word in a sentence based on the preceding word.This methodology enables the model to learn the intricate grammar and syntax of a given language, ultimately facilitating the production of natural-sounding sentences.Equipped with robust computational capabilities and a multitude of parameters, LLMs excel in discerning complex linguistic relationships and generating text that closely mimics human language.</p>
<p>Current LLMs have achieved significant advancements in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including but not limited to machine translation, headline generation, question answering, and automatic text generation.They possess the ability to generate high-quality text that seamlessly aligns with the provided content and context.</p>
<p>For instance, when presented with an incomplete sentence like "The book is on the," these models utilize training data to generate a probability distribution, thereby determining the most probable next word, such as "table" or "bookshelf."Early efforts to construct large-scale language models relied on N-gram methods and basic smoothing techniques.However, more advanced methodologies leveraged various neural network architectures, such as feedforward networks and recurrent networks, for the language modeling task.This progression also spurred the development of word embeddings and related techniques aimed at mapping words to semantically meaningful representations.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Transformer architecture, initially devised for machine translation, sparked renewed interest in language models.This led to the emergence of contextualized word embeddings and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs).Notably, a common strategy to enhance model performance involves augmenting parameter size and training data, resulting in significant advancements in the machine's ability to process natural language.</p>
<p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning:</p>
<p>In October 2018, the BERT Large model was introduced, boasting 350 million parameters, making it the largest publicly disclosed Transformer model at that time.However, even state-of-the-art hardware struggled to fine-tune this model, encountering "out of memory" issues due to its size.Fast forward five years, new models have emerged with an astonishing 540 trillion parameters, a more than 1500-fold increase.Despite this exponential growth in model size, the capacity of GPUs' RAM has only experienced modest growth, posing challenges for fine-tuning large models for smaller tasks.In-context learning, which allows an AI model to generate responses or predictions based on specific context, represents a significant advancement in natural language processing.However, the context limitation of Transformers restricts the training dataset size to just a few examples, coupled with inconsistent performance, presenting new challenges.Furthermore, expanding context size significantly escalates computational costs, further complicating the fine-tuning process.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Identification of Key Concepts:</p>
<p>-Identify the key concepts and principles of AI/ML and DevSecOps relevant to software development.</p>
<p>This includes understanding AI/ML techniques, DevSecOps practices, and their integration in software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>
<p>Case Study Selection:</p>
<p>-Select relevant case studies or real-world examples that demonstrate the application of AI/ML in DevSecOps practices.Choose a diverse range of case studies to cover different aspects of software development, such as code analysis, vulnerability detection, automation, etc.</p>
<p>Data Collection:</p>
<p>-Collect data from selected case studies, including documentation, reports, metrics, and outcomes related to the integration of AI/ML in DevSecOps processes.</p>
<p>Development of Analytical Framework:</p>
<p>-Develop an analytical framework to assess the impact of AI/ML on various stages of DevSecOps, including planning, coding, building, testing, deployment, monitoring, and feedback.</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics:</p>
<p>-Define evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness, efficiency, and security enhancements achieved through the integration of AI/ML in DevSecOps practices.Metrics may include reduction in security vulnerabilities, automation rates, time-to-market, etc.</p>
<p>Experimental Design:</p>
<p>-Design experiments or simulations to evaluate the performance of AI/ML algorithms and models in enhancing security, automation, and efficiency within the DevSecOps pipeline.Consider factors such as dataset selection, model training, validation techniques, and benchmarking against traditional approaches.</p>
<p>Research Approach</p>
<p>As previously outlined, the objective of this paper is to present a research agenda highlighting open research questions concerning GenAI in SE.This objective was pursued through a combination of a literature review (Section 3.1) and a series of focused group discussions (Section 3.2 and Section 3.3).</p>
<p>The overarching research process is depicted in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Literature Review</p>
<p>A comprehensive and systematic literature review may not be the most suitable approach for research on GenAI in software development given the rapidly evolving nature of the field.Firstly, the vast amount of research being conducted and published on the topic could quickly render the findings of a comprehensive review outdated.Secondly, much of the relevant literature is available in non-traditional sources such as preprints, technical reports, and online forums, which may lack the rigorous review process of peer-reviewed academic papers, posing challenges in assessing their quality and reliability.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there is a desire to expedite the publication of the research agenda to provide timely guidance for future research endeavors.Conducting a systematic literature review would require substantial time and effort, potentially resulting in findings that are outdated by the time the review is completed.</p>
<p>Our approach entails conducting focused and periodic reviews to capture the most current and relevant information without committing extensive resources to a comprehensive review.This agile approach enables us to stay abreast of the latest developments in the field while acknowledging the limitations of claiming comprehensiveness and repeatability.Our search strategy involves leveraging two primary channels:</p>
<p>-Online portals: Utilizing platforms such as Google Scholar and Scopus, we executed searches using formulated search strings.</p>
<p>-Gray literature sources: We searched for papers on platforms like Arxiv and Papers with Code, which host a significant amount of research on GenAI.</p>
<p>-Forward and backward snowballing: We conducted citation searches both forward and backward from the articles included in our review to identify additional relevant literature.</p>
<p>Our search efforts on Google Scholar yielded results up to October 2023.Google Scholar offers the advantages of comprehensive coverage and free access, making it a valuable resource for accessing a wide range of literature, including gray literature, which proved particularly abundant in research on GenAI at the time of our search.</p>
<p>Focus Groups</p>
<p>To identify, refine, and prioritize Research Questions on GenAI for SE, we conducted four structured working sessions as focus groups.Focus groups have been employed as a valuable means of data collection in SE research [35,36,37,38].These sessions primarily yield qualitative insights into the subjects under investigation.The advantages of focus groups lie in their ability to generate insightful information while being relatively cost-effective and efficient to conduct.Notably, focus groups differ from brainstorming sessions, wherein participants are guided by a moderator following a structured protocol to maintain focused discussions [36,39].Additionally, Kontio et al. propose online focus groups, which offer benefits such as group synergy, cost savings associated with travel, anonymous participation, and the ability to accommodate larger groups [36].The effectiveness of this method hinges on the expertise and insights contributed by the participants, as detailed in Table 1.</p>
<p>The timeline for the focus groups spanned from April 2023 to September 2023, as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<p>All participants were seasoned SE researchers with expertise or keen interest in the topic, as outlined in A structured plan was devised for each focus group, comprising an agenda for the session and a series of exercises tailored for the participants.The duration of each focus group ranged from 2 to 3 hours.Various methods were employed to capture data from these sessions, including moderator's notes, Miro boards, and recordings for online sessions.</p>
<p>Each focus group had a distinct focus:</p>
<p>-Focus Group 1 (Exploratory Brainstorming): This session was dedicated to exploring ideas for potential opportunities and challenges associated with adopting GenAI in software development activities.</p>
<p>Participants engaged in a brainstorming session centered around the question, "Which SE areas will benefit from GenAI tools, such as ChatGPT and Copilot?"The conversations were initiated based on SE areas outlined in SWEBOK.At the conclusion of the group, 11 categories were identified, with each category assigned a section leader responsible for synthesizing the content.</p>
<p>-Focus Group 2 (Exploratory Brainstorming): Participants delved into the question, "What would be an interesting research topic for GenAI in Software Development and Management?" Additionally, discussions revolved around generating potential Research Questions (RQs) for an empirical study on GenAI in SE, with several questions generated during the working session.</p>
<p>-Focus Group 3 (Validating Brainstorming): Prior to this meeting, a list of 121 possible RQs was compiled.The objective of this session was to validate the questions by assessing their correct interpretation, consistency, and overall feasibility.Participants were given ample time to thoroughly review and provide critical feedback on the RQs, leaving comments on their meaningfulness and practicality.Following this step, the RQs were revised and restructured accordingly.</p>
<p>-Focus Group 4 (Validating Brainstorming): Participants were divided into subgroups, each focusing on a specific SE category.In advance of this session, the question list was finalized, comprising a total of 78 RQs across 11 categories.RQs that were deemed not practically important or meaningful by consensus were excluded.Additionally, discussions involved ranking RQs based on their novelty and timeliness, aiming to prioritize the most relevant ones.</p>
<p>Research Agenda</p>
<p>We organized the research concerns and questions into eleven tracks based on thematic similarities and differences.While this categorization is one of several possible approaches, it facilitates the presentation and discussion of the research agenda, outlined in Figure 4.For each category, we provide (</p>
<p>Challenges and Limitations:</p>
<p>Challenges include hallucination, where AI-generated requirements may lack accuracy or consistency in domain contexts.Fine-tuning LLMs for RE tasks is hindered by the lack of publicly available data.</p>
<p>Challenges arise at each RE stage, from inaccurate domain analysis to bias in requirement coding.</p>
<p>Additionally, ethical and security concerns, along with bias perpetuation by generative models, pose significant risks.</p>
<p>Future Prospects:</p>
<p>The future holds promising prospects for automating most Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks, thereby simplifying the work of requirements engineers.We anticipate a shift towards AI-human collaborative platforms, where GenAI assists domain experts, requirements engineers, and users in real-time.These platforms will enable instantaneous feedback loops and iterative refinement of requirements, potentially becoming the new standard way of working.Visualization tools within these platforms could enhance stakeholders' understanding of how AI interprets inputs, promoting transparency in system requirements and generated outputs.</p>
<p>LLMs are expected to evolve towards deeper contextual understanding, reducing inaccuracies particularly in the pre-elicitation and elicitation stages of RE.An important advancement would be the ability to finetune models without exposing sensitive information from requirements, thus addressing concerns regarding data leakage.Given the ethical and safety implications, establishing robust frameworks and guidelines for the responsible use of AI in RE is imperative.Future research may focus on developing models with built-in ethical considerations to mitigate biases and ensure that generated requirements adhere to standards of inclusivity and representation.</p>
<p>GenAI in Software Design</p>
<p>Historical Context:</p>
<p>Design and architectural decisions are critical in software development, often involving trade-offs that impact a system's quality attributes.While various approaches have been proposed to automate design decisions, such as pattern-based solutions, these methods are not widely adopted in industry.GenAI presents a promising approach for automating design decisions in real projects, attracting interest from professionals.</p>
<p>Key Research Questions:</p>
<p>Exploring the potential adoption of GenAI in software design activities raises several important questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How can GenAI assist in identifying and selecting appropriate design patterns based on requirements and constraints?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What strategies can promote collaboration between professionals and GenAI in the software design process?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the limitations and risks associated with using GenAI in software design, and how can they be mitigated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can GenAI be employed in a continuous software design process to automate improvements and refactoring?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can generative AI automate the design and implementation of user interfaces to enhance user experience?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>State-of-the-art:</p>
<p>Recent research explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for coding tasks like generation, completion, summarization, search, and comment generation.GitHub Copilot has been extensively studied in various contexts, showing promise but also limitations and biases.Approaches like AceCoder and CLEAR outperform existing LLM-based tools, while techniques like input parameter variation and pre-training on code and natural language data improve performance.Studies also investigate productivity measures, nondeterminism, security issues, and comparisons with pair programming.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The convergence of AI/ML and DevSecOps represents a transformative shift in the landscape of software development.Through this integration, traditional approaches to software engineering are being revolutionized, offering unprecedented opportunities for efficiency, security, and innovation.By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, DevSecOps practices are evolving to streamline processes, enhance code quality, and fortify cybersecurity measures.This synergy not only accelerates the pace of development but also ensures that security is ingrained into every stage of the software lifecycle.As organizations embrace this convergence, they stand to reap the benefits of more resilient, adaptable, and intelligent software systems.With AI/ML-driven DevSecOps, the future of software development promises to be both dynamic and secure, ushering in a new era of technological advancement.</p>

<p>Some studies, like Ahmad et al.'s case study of collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT, demonstrate the potential of such tools. However, challenges remain in ensuring the accuracy and usefulness of AIgenerated solutions, especially in real-world industrial environments. Challenges and Limitations: Challenges in GenAI for software design include understanding its role and integration into development processes. The lack of studies in real industrial environments poses limitations, as the usefulness of AIgenerated solutions in practice remains uncertain. Additionally, current studies often focus on a limited set of design patterns, which may not cover the breadth of solutions needed in real projects. Future Prospects: The key challenge for the future of GenAI in software design lies in integrating these tools into existing processes consistently. Understanding the roles GenAI tools can assume in the software design process and developing approaches for engaging with them effectively will be crucial. What strategies enable GenAI to adapt system architectures over time, considering changing requirements, technologies, and business contexts? State-of-the-art: Limited literature explores GenAI or LLM for software design activities. New software design practices are expected to emerge as experience with these tools grows.
