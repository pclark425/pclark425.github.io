                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A quantitative investigation of the visual identification and auditory comprehension deficits of 4 patients who had made a partial recovery from herpes simplex encephalitis finds category specificity in the organization of meaning systems that are also modality specific semantic systems.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> SUMMARY We report a quantitative investigation of the visual identification and auditory comprehension deficits of 4 patients who had made a partial recovery from herpes simplex encephalitis. Clinical observations had suggested the selective impairment and selective preservation of certain categories of visual stimuli. In all 4 patients a significant discrepancy between their ability to identify inanimate objects and inability to identify living things and foods was demonstrated. In 2 patients it was possible to compare visual and verbal modalities and the same pattern of dissociation was observed in both. For 1 patient, comprehension of abstract words was significantly superior to comprehension of concrete words. Consistency of responses was recorded within a modality in contrast to a much lesser degree of consistency between modalities. We interpret our findings in terms of category specificity in the organization of meaning systems that are also modality specific semantic systems.</p>

Resumen. La Afasia Progresiva Primaria-variante semántica (APP-vs) se caracteriza por la afectación progresiva del conocimiento conceptual. Algunas investigaciones han reportado la mayor afectación de los conceptos abstractos en relación con los concretos, es decir, un efecto de concretud. No obstante, otros investigadores dan cuenta de un efecto de concretud inverso, es decir, un mejor desempeño con conceptos abstractos en relación con concretos. En esta investigación se compara el desempeño, por medio en una tarea de juicios de sinonimia, de un grupo de 8 pacientes diagnosticados con APP-vs y un grupo de 20 controles emparejados en edad y nivel educativo. Los resultados dan cuenta de un efecto de concretud, es decir, un mejor desempeño con conceptos concretos tanto con sustantivos como con verbos. Estos hallazgos se alinean con las investigaciones previas en las que se detecta un peor rendimiento de los pacientes con APP-vs con conceptos abstractos. El efecto de concretud encontrado apoyaría la hipótesis de un centro semántico amodal relevante para el procesamiento de conceptos concretos y abstractos. La menor afectación de los conceptos concretos observada podría explicarse por su mayor riqueza semántica.

<h1>[en] Semantic processing of concrete and abstract concepts in semantic variant- Primary Progressive Aphasia</h1>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (sv-APP) is characterized by progressive affectation of conceptual knowledge. Previous investigations have reported a higher affectation for abstract concepts than for concrete ones. This is known as a concreteness effect. Nonetheless, there are works that have spotted an inverse concreteness effect, that is, subjects better performance with abstract concepts. In this investigation we compared the performance of 8 sv-APP patients to a group of 20 healthy controls matched in age and education level, using a synonyms task. Results show a concreteness effect, this means, a better performance with concretes concepts for nouns and verbs. These findings agree with previous research that found a worse performance with abstract concepts in sv-APP patients. These findings support the idea of an amodal semantic hub which processes both types of concepts. The observed low affectation in concrete concepts could be explained by higher semantic richness.</p>

<h2>Introducción</h2>
<p>La memoria semántica es el sistema de memoria de largo plazo que permite elaborar una representación interna del mundo. Su principal función es almacenar y organizar conceptos (Hodges \&amp; Patterson, 1997; Patterson \&amp; Hodges, 1995; Renoult et al., 2016; Tulving, Donaldson, \&amp; Bower, 1972). Los conceptos representan tanto entidades que pueden ser percibidas por medio de los sentidos (conceptos concretos), como por ejemplo "kiwi" o "teléfono", como también otros que denotan ideas que carecen de un referente perceptual y que únicamente pueden ser representados en forma léxica (conceptos abstractos), como "justicia" o "destino" (Crutch \&amp; Jackson, 2011; Paivio, 1971; Paivio, Yuille, \&amp; Madigan, 1968).</p>
<p>La evidencia comportamental da cuenta de una ventaja en el procesamiento de conceptos concretos (James, 1975; Kroll \&amp; Merves, 1986), denominada "efecto de concretud" (EC). Este efecto se evidencia en tareas experimentales en menores tiempos de respuesta y mayor precisión para responder ante conceptos concretos (Paivio, 1991). Una posible explicación de este desempeño podría estar basada en la ventaja de procesamiento que suponen los conceptos concretos, al tener un referente sensorial definido, información contextual y mayor cantidad de características semánticas agregados a la etiqueta léxica (Paivio, 1986; Plaut \&amp; Shallice, 1993; Schwanenflugel \&amp; Shoben, 1983). El EC ha sido identificado tanto en sujetos sanos como en pacientes con lesiones cerebrales adquiridas, focales y difusas (Catricalà, DellaRosa, Plebani, Vigliocco, \&amp; Cappa, 2014; Coltheart, Patterson, \&amp; Marshall, 1980; Crutch \&amp; Warrington, 2010; Gvion \&amp; Friedmann, 2013; Kroll \&amp; Merves, 1986; Warrington \&amp; Shallice, 1984). No obstante, en pacientes con Afasia Progresiva Primaria-variante</p>
<p>semántica (APP-vs) muchas investigaciones han detectado un patrón de desempeño diferente.</p>
<p>La APP-vs es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa que se caracteriza por la afectación progresiva del conocimiento conceptual (Hodges \&amp; Patterson, 2007; Snowden, Goulding, \&amp; Neary, 1989). Los pacientes que sufren este tipo de patología presentan dificultades en la evocación de palabras (anomias), en la comprensión de palabras aisladas y en el conocimiento del mundo en general; además suelen presentar alexia y agrafia de superficie tal y como han descripto Gorno-Tempini et al. (2011). La literatura postula que los pacientes con APP-vs presentarían un "efecto de concretud inverso" (ECI), esto es, un mejor desempeño ante conceptos abstractos (Bonner et al., 2009; Breedin, Saffran, \&amp; Coslett, 1994; Catricalà, et al., 2014; Cousins, York, Bauer, \&amp; Grossman, 2016; Joubert et al., 2017; Macoir, 2009; Papagno, Capasso, \&amp; Miceli, 2009; Reilly, Cross, Troiani, \&amp; Grossman, 2007; Reilly, Grossman, \&amp; McCawley, 2006; Warrington, 1975; Yi, Moore, \&amp; Grossman, 2007). Puesto que el ECI ha sido frecuentemente reportado en pacientes con APP-vs, incluso se ha postulado que la comprensión conservada de palabras abstractas sería una característica típica de la APP-vs y un punto de importancia para el diagnóstico (Grossman et al., 2004). La diferencia en el procesamiento de conceptos concretos y abstractos se ha identificado no solo en tareas que involucran sustantivos, sino también con verbos (Bonner, et al., 2009; Reilly, et al., 2007; Yi, et al., 2007).</p>
<p>Una posible explicación que daría cuenta del ECI se fundamenta en que la atrofia de las cortezas de asociación del lóbulo temporal ventral afectaría una región de modalidad específica, crucial para la codificación de las propiedades visuales de los objetos que sería fundamental para la organización de los conceptos concretos (Bonner, et al., 2009; Breedin, et al., 1994; Macoir, 2009; Yi, et al., 2007) y menos relevante para los abstractos, que dependerían más de asociaciones verbales (Paivio, 1986). Puesto que en los pacientes con APP-vs se comprometen las porciones anteriores del lóbulo temporal (LTA) en forma bilateral, la afectación de los conceptos concretos sería mayor que la de los abstractos según algunos autores (Bright, Moss, Longe, Stamatakis, \&amp; Tyler, 2007).</p>
<p>A pesar de ser un efecto frecuentemente reportado en este tipo de pacientes, hay investigaciones que no identifican el ECI en pacientes con APP-vs (Hoffman, Jones, \&amp; Lambon Ralph, 2013; Hoffman \&amp; Lambon Ralph, 2011; Jefferies, Patterson, Jones, \&amp; Lambon Ralph, 2009). Según estos autores, una explicación posible a la presencia de un ECI estaría en relación con el nivel de escolaridad y ocupación de los pacientes evaluados (Jefferies, et al., 2009). Un mayor nivel educativo facilitaría el procesamiento de conceptos abstractos, siendo este el caso de muchos de los pacientes reportados.</p>
<p>Otra posible explicación para el ECI en este perfil de pacientes se fundamenta en el tipo de material que se utiliza en la evaluación del lenguaje. Los estímulos usados deberían estar controlados en función de las variables de frecuencia léxica e imaginabilidad, puesto que utilizar palabras abstractas de alta frecuencia léxica o de alta imaginabilidad (palabras que fácilmente generan una imagen mental) podría favorecer el procesamiento de palabras abstractas y generar así un ECI.</p>
<p>La progresión de la APP-vs también se ha postulado como un factor que podría explicar la presencia/ausencia de un ECI. Macoir (2009) identificó, a partir del estudio de un único paciente de forma longitudinal, que el ECI se presentaba únicamente al inicio de la enfermedad, dejando en evidencia un mejor procesamiento de concep-</p>
<p>tos abstractos en relación con concretos. En este caso, a medida que esta enfermedad progresó, el ECI desapareció. De esta forma, el ECI podría ser únicamente un síntoma presente en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad y no manifestarse en pacientes en estadios más avanzados.</p>
<p>Otra fuente de evidencia sobre este fenómeno proviene de estudios con imágenes cerebrales, más específicamente estudios con fRMF y PET que dan cuenta de áreas de representación diferenciadas para conceptos concretos y abstractos (Sandberg \&amp; Kiran, 2014; Wang, Conder, Blitzer, \&amp; Shinkareva, 2010). Wang et al. (2010) concluyeron que los conceptos abstractos provocan una mayor actividad del giro frontal inferior izquierdo y del giro temporal medial izquierdo. En tanto que ante los conceptos concretos se observa una mayor activación del cíngulo posterior, del precúneo y de los giros fusiforme y parahipocampal izquierdos. Por otra lado, y en un trabajo más reciente, Kumar (2016) encontró que gran parte de las áreas de activación (giro frontal inferior bilateral, área parietal superior izquierda, giro fusiforme izquierdo y área occipital medial bilateral) de los conceptos concretos y abstractos coinciden. Sin embargo, para los conceptos abstractos se hallaron áreas de activación adicionales, específicamente de las regiones temporales superiores y mediales bilaterales.</p>
<p>El estudio de las áreas afectadas en la APP-vs es de fundamental importancia puesto que permite conocer las bases neurales involucradas en el procesamiento semántico (Hoffman \&amp; Lambon Ralph, 2011). Aunque el compromiso en este tipo de pacientes se inicia muy frecuentemente en el lóbulo temporal anterior (LTA) izquierdo, a medida que la enfermedad avanza, la afectación también impacta en el temporal derecho (Hodges, Patterson, Oxbury, \&amp; Funnell, 1992). La importancia de esta región cerebral ha sido postulada por la Teoría de centro semántico distribuido (Patterson, Nestor, \&amp; Rogers, 2007). Según esta teoría, los conceptos son producto de la interacción de cortezas de asociación de modalidad específica con un centro de modalidad invariante. Este centro de modalidad invariante, ubicado en LTA en forma bilateral, integra la información perceptual-sensorial y las características de acción-motora de un mismo concepto (Hoffman \&amp; Lambon Ralph, 2011; Patterson, et al., 2007). El compromiso del centro semántico invariante sería el responsable del ECI frecuentemente observado en los pacientes con APP-vs (Pobric, Lambon Ralph, \&amp; Jefferies, 2009). Se ha postulado que el LTA es particularmente importante para el procesamiento de los aspectos sensoriales de los conceptos, los cuales son una parte constitutiva fundamental de los concretos pero no de los abstractos. Una revisión reciente a la teoría de centro semántico da cuenta de la idea del LTA como "un centro semántico graduado" (Lambon Ralph, Jefferies, Patterson, \&amp; Rogers, 2017). Estos autores proponen que la región ventrolateral del LTA constituye el centro de modalidad invariante, pero subregiones del LTA sustentan la función semántica de manera gradual. Así, por ejemplo, la porción medial del LTA responde a conceptos visuales o concretos por su mayor conexión con los sistemas visuales, en tanto que el surco temporal superior y el giro temporal superior responden más a conceptos abstractos por su mayor conectividad con sistemas del lenguaje (auditivos o lingüísticos). La evidencia conductual obtenida de pacientes con APP-vs apoyaría la hipótesis de una mayor indemnidad del conocimiento semántico que no depende de características visuales dado que, además de la preservación en el procesamiento de conceptos abstractos y verbos, se conservaría el conocimiento numérico, los símbolos musicales y la composición musical (Silveri, Brita, Liperoti, Piludu, \&amp; Colosimo, 2017).</p>
<p>Hasta la actualidad, el debate acerca de un posible ECI en pacientes con APP-vs continúa vigente. En base a lo expuesto anteriormente, el objetivo de esta investigación es comparar el desempeño en el procesamiento de conceptos concretos y abstractos, en los que se incluyen sustantivos y verbos, en un grupo de pacientes con APP-vs y un grupo control emparejado por edad y nivel educativo utilizando una tarea de Juicios de Sinonimia que está incluida en la Batería de Evaluación de la Afasia (BEA, Wilson, Jaichenco, \&amp; Ferreres, 2005).</p>
<h1>Metodología</h1>
<h2>Muestra</h2>
<p>Se evaluaron 8 pacientes con APP-vs ( 5 mujeres y 3 hombres) y 20 controles (10 mujeres y 10 hombres), todos hablantes nativos del español de Argentina. Para el diagnóstico de los pacientes se siguieron los criterios clínicos propuestos por Gor-no-Tempini et al. (2011).</p>
<p>Los controles no presentaban antecedentes neurológicos ni psiquiátricos. Tampoco tenían historia de dificultades en la adquisición del lenguaje ni en el aprendizaje de la lecto-escritura. Los pacientes y controles evaluados aceptaron participar de la investigación en forma voluntaria. Todos los participantes fueron evaluados después de firmar el consentimiento informado. Este estudio se realizó bajos los principios de la Declaración de Helsinski.</p>
<p>Los grupos no diferían en edad $\left(t_{(26)}=1.390 ; p=.176\right)$, nivel de escolaridad $\left(t_{(26)}=1.012 ; p=.321\right)$ ni sexo $\left(\chi_{(1)}^{2}=.143 ; p=.705\right)$. La muestra de pacientes con APP-vs tenían una edad media de 74.12 años (D.E. $=8.89$ ) y de 14.50 años de estudios formales (D.E. $=3.75$ ). El grupo de controles tenía una media de 70.05 años de edad (D.E. $=8.34$ ) y 16.3 años de escolaridad (D.E. $=4.41$ ). La evolución media de la enfermedad de los pacientes incluidos en esta muestra, según los datos reportados por los familiares, es de 3 años y 10 meses.</p>

La prueba está compuesta por un total de 60 pares de estímulos, 30 pares de sinónimos: 20 pares de sustantivos y 10 pares de verbos. Los otros 30 estímulos son pares de palabras sin relación de significado. La mitad de las palabras de cada grupo son de alta concretud y la otra mitad, de baja. Para el armado de la prueba los autores manipularon factorialmente las variables psicolingüísticas de concretud (alta y baja) y clase gramatical (sustantivos y verbos). Para poder determinar si dos palabras eran o no sinónimos se consultaron diccionarios de sinónimos de nuestra lengua. Los grupos de palabras se equipararon en longitud silábica con el BuscaPalabras (Davis \&amp; Perea, 2005) y por frecuencia léxica con el LEXESP (Sebastián-Galles, Martí-Antonín, Carreiras-Valiña, \&amp; Cuetos-Vega, 2000). Para medir la concretud se administró una escala lickert ( 7 puntos) a 20 hablantes nativos del español rioplatense (Dubé, Monetta, Martí-nez-Cuitiño, \&amp; Wilson, 2014).</p>
<h1>Análisis</h1>
<p>Con el objetivo de comparar posibles diferencias en el procesamiento de conceptos concretos y abstractos se realizó un análisis factorial de varianza (ANOVA) tomando como variable intersujeto el grupo (APP-vs vs. controles) y como variables intrasujeto la concretud (alta vs. baja) y la categoría gramatical (sustantivos vs. verbos).</p>
<h2>Resultados</h2>
<p>A continuación, en la tabla 3, se muestra el desempeño, en proporción de respuestas correctas, en conceptos concretos y abstractos y en sustantivos y verbos en controles y pacientes con APP-vs en la Tarea de Juicios de Sinonimia de la BEA (Wilson, et al., 2005).</p>

<p>Tabla 3: Proporción de aciertos y Desvío Estándar (D.E.) de controles y pacientes con APP-vs en conceptos concretos y abstractos de diferente categoría gramatical (sustantivos y verbos).</p>
<p>En primer lugar, se realizó un análisis factorial de varianza (ANOVA) $2 \times 2 \times 2$ tomando como variable intersujeto al grupo (controles vs. pacientes con APP), y como variables intrasujeto a la concretud de la palabra (alta vs. baja), y a la categoría de la misma (sustantivos vs. verbos). Al analizar la normalidad se observó que la distribución no difiere significativamente de la distribución normal asintótica ( $K-S=1.33, p$ $=.06$ ) pero al llevar a cabo el análisis de varianza se detectó que las distribuciones entre los grupos de controles y pacientes no cumplen con el requisito de homocedasticidad $\left(F_{(1,110)}=30.47, p&lt;.001\right)$, lo cual indica que sus varianzas son diferentes. Con el propósito de modelar la ausencia de homocedasticidad, se analizaron los datos a través de un modelo linear general, utilizando el método de máxima verosimilitud restringida. Se estimaron los coeficientes para cada una de las variables predictoras y se analizó cuál de ellas resulta significativa, a partir de la estimación de probabilidad de los parámetros utilizando el estadístico de Wald (ver Tabla 4) (Hutchenson \&amp; Sofroniou, 2006).</p>

<p>El análisis realizado detecta un efecto significativo del grupo (controles vs. pacientes) $(\beta=.16, p&lt;.001)$, también un efecto de interacción entre el grupo y el nivel de concretud de las palabras (alta vs. baja) ( $\beta=.16, p=.01$ ), no así un efecto de la categoría gramatical (verbos vs. sustantivos) ( $\beta=.00, p=.24$ ), ni de concretud por sí misma $(\beta=.02, p=.14)$.</p>
<p>Para analizar la interacción se empleó como análisis post-hoc la prueba de contraste de Tuckey (HSD), en dicho análisis se observa que el grupo de pacientes con APP muestra una diferencia significativa a favor de las palabras de alta concretud, en comparación con las de baja concretud ( $\mathrm{z}=2.73, p=.02$ ), mientras que el grupo de controles no muestra diferencias ( $\mathrm{z}=0.72, p=.88$ ) (ver Figura 1). En palabras de alta concretud los controles se diferencian marginalmente de los pacientes ( $\mathrm{z}=$ $2.41, p=.06$ ), en palabras de baja concretud la diferencia entre los controles y los pacientes es significativa ( $\mathrm{z}=4.78 ; p&lt;.001$ ).

<h1>Conclusiones</h1>
<p>El objetivo del presente trabajo era estudiar el procesamiento de conceptos concretos y abstractos en pacientes con APP-vs. Los resultados muestran que los pacientes tienen un peor desempeño que los controles tanto ante conceptos concretos como abstractos.</p>
<p>El peor desempeño de los pacientes con APP-vs, en relación con el grupo control, también se manifiesta ante ambas categorías gramaticales evaluadas, sustantivos y verbos.</p>
<p>En la literatura, la evidencia de un ECI en pacientes con APP-vs ha sido reportada frecuentemente en tareas que implican sustantivos y verbos (Bonner, et al., 2009; Breedin, et al., 1994; Catricalà, et al., 2014; Cousins, et al., 2016; Joubert, et al., 2017; Papagno, et al., 2009; Reilly, et al., 2006; Warrington, 1975; Yi, et al., 2007). Sin embargo, en la investigación realizada no se observa este patrón de resultados. Los pacientes con APP-vs presentan un EC en su desempeño y no muestran efecto de categoría gramatical.</p>
<p>Un aspecto interesante de los resultados obtenidos en este estudio es que los controles no muestran diferencias en rendimiento entre conceptos concretos y abstractos. Esto debe ser señalado puesto que en general las palabras concretas son más fácil y rápidamente procesadas que las abstractas (Paivio, 1991). Si bien es difícil dar cuenta de este hallazgo, existe un reporte de un estudio previo en el que tampoco se detectó esta diferencia en sujetos controles utilizando una tarea de juicio semántico (Joubert, et al., 2017). Los autores explicaron que esto podía deberse a que la tarea fuera fácil. También indicaron que el EC suele aparecer al registrar los tiempos de respuesta en tareas de decisión léxica. La ausencia del EC en los resultados de este estudio también podría deberse a la simplicidad de la tarea, ya que fue específicamente diseñada como parte de una batería de evaluación para el diagnóstico de pacientes afásicos.</p>
<p>En lo que respecta a posibles disociaciones de categoría gramatical, los controles no muestran diferencias significativas, aunque en palabras de baja concretud se identifica un mejor desempeño con verbos. Este hallazgo es significativo, ya que la literatura postula que los verbos son clases de palabras semánticamente más complejas para procesar (Jackendoff, 1983; Shapiro \&amp; Caramazza, 2003). En el grupo de pacientes estudiado, aunque tampoco se detectan diferencias significativas, se identifica también un mejor desempeño con verbos. En la bibliografía hay algunos reportes de un mejor desempeño en pacientes con APP-vs en verbos (Cotelli et al., 2006; Silveri \&amp; Ciccarelli, 2009; Silveri \&amp; Di Betta, 1997; Silveri et al., 1997). El compromiso de las áreas del lóbulo temporal característica de los pacientes con APP-vs debería afectar principalmente el procesamiento de sustantivos. Esto podría explicar la ventaja relativa de los verbos, ya que el procesamiento de esta clase de palabra se ha relacionado con la activación de las áreas posteriores del lóbulo frontal (Hillis, Oh, \&amp; Ken, 2004; Shapiro \&amp; Caramazza, 2003). Sin embargo, es importante tener en cuenta que el progreso de la atrofia que se inicia por el lóbulo temporal en estos pacientes también puede comprometer áreas del lóbulo frontal, específicamente la corteza frontal ventromedial, a medida que la enfermedad progresa (Nestor, Graham, Bozeat, Simons, \&amp; Hodges, 2002). En este sentido, la falta de diferencias estadísticamente significativa en esta muestra de pacientes podría relacionarse con el estadio de la enfermedad.</p>
<p>Se ha contemplado la progresión de la enfermedad como una variable que permite dar cuenta de una evolución longitudinal en las dificultades semánticas que presentan los pacientes con APP-vs. Según Macoir et al. (2009), el ECI es un fenómeno que únicamente se observa en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Este efecto desaparecería conforme la patología avanza. Si bien en esta investigación se han evaluado pacientes con APP-vs cuyos familiares reportan una aparición reciente de los síntomas (menos de 4 años desde el inicio de los mismos), no es posible asegurar que estén aún dentro de los estadios iniciales. Una forma posible de sortear esta dificultad podría ser la evaluación de pacientes con quejas iniciales que aún no pueden tener un diagnóstico de APP, estudiados en forma longitudinal, permitiendo conocer retrospectivamente, en caso de confirmarse el diagnóstico, su desempeño ante conceptos concretos y abstractos. Incluso, se podría realizar estudios longitudinales de pacientes que servirían para identificar la progresión de la afectación semántica en los diferentes estadios y con diferentes categorías gramaticales.</p>
<p>Si bien se suele considerar el ECI como una característica típica de la APP-vs, los datos obtenidos en este trabajo no apoyan esta afirmación. Nuestros resultados están en consonancia con otros trabajos en los que se identificó un EC en estos pacientes (Hoffman, et al., 2013; Hoffman \&amp; Lambon Ralph, 2011; Jefferies, et al., 2009). Una de estas investigaciones reportó, incluso, que el EC en pacientes con estas características se observa tanto ante sustantivos como verbos (Hoffman, et al., 2013). Los datos de nuestro estudio también acuerdan con este hallazgo. La ventaja postulada para el procesamiento de conceptos concretos frente a los abstractos (Crutch \&amp; Warrington, 2010) parecería mantenerse en esta patología. La explicación de la organización conceptual a partir del ECI encontrado en algunos estudios postula la afectación de áreas de asociación de modalidad específica (visuales) que incidirían diferencialmente en el procesamiento de conceptos concretos y abstractos. La mayor dependencia de los conceptos concretos de la información visual causaría su mayor afectación. Sin embargo, estos datos están más en relación con la idea de un centro de procesamiento amodal que participaría en forma homogénea en el procesamiento de ambos tipos de conceptos, manteniéndose la ventaja para los concretos por sobre los abstractos. Estos últimos, al tener menor cantidad de información asociada, serían más susceptibles al daño (Hoffman, et al., 2013). El EC observado en nuestros pacientes evidenciaría la menor afectación de los conceptos concretos.</p>
