                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their fairness, safety, and societal impact. However, quantifying LLM bias remains a fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what"bias"entails. This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use, while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed. In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target domain. We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively. Applying our framework to several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods, offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for comparative bias analysis in LLMs.</p>

<p>Relative Bias: A Comparative Framework for Quantifying Bias in LLMs

The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their fairness, safety, and societal impact.However, quantifying LLM bias remains a fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what "bias" entails.This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use, while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed.In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target domain.We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively.Applying our framework to several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods, offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for comparative bias analysis in LLMs.Preprint.Under review.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the processing, understanding, and generation of human-like text, leading to their widespread integration into various systems and applications due to their powerful capabilities and diverse use cases [50,10,13].However, these models can learn, retain, and even amplify biases-whether intentionally or unintentionally-which has intensified concerns on misuse, misinformation, or censorship of the generated information [67,21].</p>
<p>A key source of bias in LLMs stems from their dependence on massive-scale training data, which often reflects the social, cultural, and political biases present in real-world text [21].As a result, LLMs may internalize and reproduce these biases in their generated responses.Furthermore, the training and fine-tuning processes of many state-of-the-art LLMs are secret and proprietary, allowing model developers to potentially steer outputs in specific directions-whether for alignment, moderation, or other intended objectives [59] -without public accountability or transparency.In addition, posttraining censorship mechanisms, such as deployment-time filters or refusal behaviors can further suppress certain outputs, making it difficult to distinguish between model behavior and externally imposed constraints [45,53,7].</p>
<p>Despite extensive research on detecting and mitigating bias in LLMs [21,42,20,49,11,39,65,32,24,52], quantifying bias remains fundamentally challenging.The definition of bias is inherently ambiguous-bias is deeply contextual and subjective, shaped by cultural, political, and social norms that vary across regions and audiences.What may be perceived as biased in one setting could be seen as neutral or appropriate in another, making universal judgments difficult [21].Therefore, there is no clear ground truth in all cases and information domains for what constitutes an "unbiased" response, especially when dealing with controversial or nuanced topics.This absence of a definitive standard makes it difficult to design a systematic approach to evaluate model behavior flexible to different domains and objectives.As a result, proposing a universal bias measurement method is inherently limited by the lack of a universally accepted and context-independent definition of bias itself.</p>
<p>To address this issue, we propose a shift in perspective: rather than analyzing a single LLM in isolation, we suggest evaluating it in comparison to other models.By examining the behavioral differences across multiple LLMs when responding to the same set of questions, we can effectively identify potential relative biases and alignments in a given model.We refer to this comparative approach as relative bias, where the bias of a target LLM is quantified based on its deviation from a set of baseline models.</p>
<p>Building on this idea, we introduce the Relative Bias Framework-a systematic methodology for identifying and quantifying the bias of LLMs in a comparative manner.We demonstrate its effectiveness across several widely discussed but previously unquantified bias cases [26, 75,64,18].Our methodology begins with selecting a target model, alongside by choosing a set of baseline models for comparison.Next, we select the target bias domain of our interest that we aim to analyze (e.g., political, gender-related, etc.) and use a proper LLM to generate a set of questions designed to elicit potentially biased responses.</p>
<p>In the next step, we propose two methods to evaluate the relative bias of the selected LLMs: (1) Embedding-Transformation, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge.In the Embedding-Transformation approach, we use an instruction-tunable embedding model [63] to project all LLM responses into an embedding space tailored to the specified bias topic.This allows the model to represent relatively biased responses in a distinguishable manner.We then measure the deviation of the target LLM's responses from those of the baselines and apply appropriate statistical tests to assess the significance of these deviations.In the LLM-as-a-Judge approach, we employ a detail-guided LLM to assign bias scores to the responses, followed by statistical testing to identify relative bias.</p>
<p>The primary contributions of our study are:</p>
<p>• We introduce the concept of Relative Bias and demonstrate how it can be used to identify potential biases in LLMs in a fast and practical manner.</p>
<p>• We are the first to propose Embedding-Transformation technique for bias analysis, offering a deterministic, efficient, and reproducible method adaptable to various bias domains.</p>
<p>• We present a properly designed LLM-as-a-Judge method tailored to detect relative bias, and we enhance its interpretability through rigorous statistical testing.</p>
<p>• We provide the first quantitative analysis of several widely reported-but previously unverified-cases of bias, alignment, and censorship in LLMs, using interpretable statistical techniques that can be broadly applied to detect potential biases in language models.</p>
<p>By shifting the focus from absolute definitions of bias to relative behavioral comparisons, our framework offers a scalable and principled approach for detecting emerging biases in modern LLMs.</p>
<p>As LLMs continue to evolve rapidly, our methodology provides a timely tool for systematic evaluation, enabling researchers and practitioners to assess model behavior with greater nuance, flexibility, and statistical rigor.</p>

<p>Identifying and evaluating bias in large language models (LLMs) is essential to ensure their fairness, safety, and societal alignment.A growing body of research has focused on both detecting and mitigating biases in LLMs, particularly on stereotypes or unequal treatment of marginalized groups [21,43,27,40,57,52].The general methods that have been proposed can be categorized as: (1) Embedding-based methods analyze how identity-related and neutral concepts are positioned within the model's internal vector space [39,65,32].(2) Probability-based methods assess disparities in token-level likelihoods by prompting a model with pairs or sets of template sentences with their biassensitive (e.g.gender) attributes perturbed and compare the predicted token probabilities conditioned on the different inputs to measure bias [72,34,6,46].(3) Classifier-based methods treat the LLM as a black box and directly analyze the output of LLMs using a trained classifier to detect bias [31,23,41,30,81,37].However, most existing methods are tailored to specific types of bias, largely due to the inherent ambiguity in defining bias in a universal way.Therefore, we propose the comparative way of analyzing bias across LLMs and show the effectiveness and flexibility of this approach by analyzing it over a diverse set of politically and socially sensitive domains.</p>
<p>3 Relative Bias Framework</p>
<p>Relative Bias Definition</p>
<p>We define an LLM as relatively biased when, in response to the same set of prompts, its outputs systematically deviate in a specified domain compared to those of a set of baseline models.Put simply, the goal of our framework is not to determine whether an LLM is inherently biased, but rather to detect the relative bias of a target model compared to a set of baseline models within a specified domain.</p>
<p>In statistics, bias refers to the systematic deviation of an estimator's expected value from the true value it aims to estimate [71].In our definition of relative bias, we argue that treating the consensus of baseline LLMs as a proxy for ground truth allows us to quantify how much a target LLM deviates from the normative model behavior.This way, the framework does not assume the existence of a "perfectly unbiased" model; instead, bias is defined relatively, and using multiple credible baselines mitigates the risk of comparing against any single outlier.If all LLMs do not have deviation compared to each other, we can not make any claim on the relative bias of the models.</p>
<p>Model and Domain Selection</p>
<p>We first select the target model whose behavior we aim to evaluate for potential bias.This model serves as the central point of the analysis, and its responses are compared against those of baseline models to determine relative bias.Next, we select a set of baseline LLMs to serve as reference points for assessing the deviation of the target model.We assume that we only have black-box access to the models.Afterwards, we set the target bias topic that we aim to evaluate the target model on.The choice of domain depends entirely on the goals of the evaluation and the type of bias or behavior one aims to investigate.Once the domain is defined, we need to design/gather a set of questions to be asked from both target and baseline LLMs.To do so, we employ an LLM to generate those question with the aim of eliciting bias on the chosen LLMs.</p>
<p>Prior research has explored the reliability and effectiveness of state-of-the-art LLMs in generating informative content when prompted with carefully constructed instructions [60,51], and several works have also demonstrated the utility of using LLMs to generate domain-specific questions [84,69,78,12,81].In line with this, we employ ChatGPT-4o in our experiments to generate sensitive or bias-inducing questions for the target LLMs, building on findings that highlight its ability to produce high-quality evaluation data [78].After gathering the question prompts, we push all questions to both target and baseline LLMs and store their responses for further analysis of their relative bias and skewness.</p>
<p>Bias Evaluation Methodology</p>
<p>Since our access to the models is black-box, and we have a set of LLMs' responses to the same set of questions on the target topic, we need a method to analyze these outputs with respect to the specified target bias.Furthermore, this method needs to be generalizable, as our framework is designed to work across any given bias topic.At a high level, we require a generalized classifier to categorize the outputs of LLMs based on the target bias.Various papers in the literature have focused on sentiment analysis using classifiers tailored to well-defined bias topics such as gender bias, stereotyping, and toxicity [21,48,14,31,41,11].However, these methods are not generalizable to be used on different topics and bias cases.Therefore, we propose two distinct methods to identify and quantify the relative bias that are both straightforward to use, and also generalizable across different domains.</p>
<p>Embedding Transformation</p>
<p>The main goal of our framework is to identify the deviation of the target LLM compared to the baseline LLMs and find a way to quantify the deviation reliably.We hypothesize that by utilizing a proper embedding model designed or fine-tuned for detecting the specified bias, the responses of a relatively biased target LLM will be embedded differently and appear deviated in the embedding space compared to those of less-biased or unbiased LLMs.</p>
<p>Choosing Embedding Model</p>
<p>A suitable embedding model for relative bias evaluation must satisfy several key requirements.First, it should generalize well across a wide range of topics and domains, as bias can manifest differently depending on the context.Second, it must be sensitive and powerful enough to capture the deviation of the biased responses compared to others, while keeping the non relatively biased responses close to each other.Third, and the most important one in our case, it should be easily tunable to be used on different contexts and topics without the need of additional fine-tuning.Traditional embedding models such as SimCSE [54], Sentence-BERT [54] or Sentence-T5 [47] are typically optimized for narrow objectives like textual similarity or classification, and often require additional fine-tuning to perform well in new settings, which is not a favorable option for us to fine-tune embedding models each time on different bias topics since it is costly and impractical.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, we choose the INSTRUCTOR embedding model [63], an instructiontuned embedding model that can generate task-aware embeddings.INSTRUCTOR is an embedding model which takes a text input besides a task instruction, and produce a vector embedding of the input with regards to the described task in the instruction.The instructions have a simple format of "Represent the (domain) (text type) for (task objective)1 ", and directly put alongside the text input and passed through the embedding model, which is trained to embed the input based on the given instruction.This property makes this embedding model well-suited for our bias evaluation task, in which we can project the responses of both target and baseline LLMs into the embedding space tuned to represent the bias topic target.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTOR is trained on a multitask dataset (MEDI) comprising 330 tasks with diverse instructions, enabling it to generalize well to unseen tasks and domains without requiring further finetuning.Furthermore, it is evaluated across diverse domains (e.g.finance, medicine, and news) on various embedding evaluation dataset and benchmarks, and showed strong performance on doing instructionbased embedding without the need of further fine-tuning [63].Overall, INSTRUCTOR's flexibility, instruction-awareness, and strong empirical performance make it well-suited for our relative bias scoring framework.</p>
<p>Embedding-Based Scoring</p>
<p>Definition 1.Let Q = {q 1 , q 2 , . . ., q N } denote a set of N questions.For each question q i , let M = {M 1 , M 2 , . . ., M K } be the set of language models.Let e (j) i ∈ R d denote the embedding of the response from model M j to question q i , where d is the dimensionality of the embedding space.</p>
<p>We define the per-question distance between model M j and the other models for question q i as:
δ(q i , M j ) = 1 K − 1 K k=1 k̸ =j cos-dist e (j) i , e (k) i (1)
The mean deviation score for model M j over the full question set is then defined as:
D embed (M j ) = 1 N N i=1 δ(q i , M j )(2)
By using the proposed deviation score, we can systematically capture the deviation of each target model from the aggregate behavior of the baseline models.This formulation provides a quantitative measure of how much a model's responses diverge from others across a shared set of questions, thus highlighting potential relative bias.However, to ensure the statistical significance of these deviations and to confidently identify systematic bias, we complement this scoring mechanism with statistical hypothesis testing, as described with detail in Section 3.6.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that the absolute values of the bias score are not directly interpretable in isolation.For example, a score of 0.7 versus 0.9 does not convey a concrete or semantic difference in magnitude; instead, the score is explicitly designed to capture relative deviation.The sole purpose of the score is to compare models against each other within the same evaluation context, and identify which models exhibit consistent divergence-i.e., relative bias.</p>
<p>This approach offers several practical benefits.First, it is deterministic and reproducible, which yields consistent results given the same inputs, avoiding the variability often associated with other generalizable classifiers like LLM-as-a-Judge methods.Second, it is fast, relying solely on embedding computations without requiring any fine-tuning or additional learning stages.Furthermore, This method represents one of the minimal complex computational approaches to textual analysis, as it relies solely on a single pass through an embedding model to convert each response into its vector representation.</p>
<p>However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of this method is directly connected to the capability of the embedding model.The INSTRUCTOR embedding model has been evaluated by various benchmarks on different topics and showed a great generalizable performance, as well as our experiments that show its powerful capabilities in Section 4. We suggest checking the evaluation benchmarks of the original paper [63] and its relevance to the desired target bias topic before use to ensure its capability and reliability for different use cases and target domains.</p>
<p>LLM-as-a-Judge</p>
<p>LLM-as-a-Judge refers to using large language models as automated evaluators of content based on predefined rules or criteria, offering a scalable alternative to costly human assessments [83,25].</p>
<p>From the appearance of LLMs, employing them for judgment have been used in various domains, and several studies have shown the promising capabilities of using LLMs with appropriate prompts to evaluate LLMs across different topics and contexts [25,82,17,68,79].However, LLM-as-a-Judge methods have several important limitations.First, their results are non-deterministic and not always reproducible due to the internal randomness and temperature settings [61].Moreover, various analyses showed that simple perturbations, paraphrasing, formatting, and orderings can change the evaluation output of the judger LLM [9,77,82,8,28].Second, they suffer from a lack of explainability: LLMs generate evaluations in a black-box manner due to their complex architecture, making it difficult to trace or justify their judgment logic [80,19].Finally, concerns remain around the reliability of LLMs as judges, especially in the cases that the LLM itself may be biased on making evaluations [25].</p>
<p>Although the embedding-based method addresses the problem of reproducibility, and also has significantly less complex structure compared to LLM-based method, in terms of reliability, both embedding and LLM-based evaluations ultimately depend on the quality and capability of their underlying models.To increase the reliance of the judgments, recent work suggests combining multiple automated methods and aggregating their outputs to improve reliability [25,20].Following this direction, we develop an LLM-as-a-judge approach tailored to our relative bias evaluation framework and accompany it with our embedding-based method.</p>
<p>Model Selection and Instruction Design</p>
<p>We adopt Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o as the judgment model in our LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation setup, known for their strong reasoning capabilities, consistent performance, and reliability in approximating human judgment across multiple benchmarks [38,82,25,44].Next we have to design the instruction prompt to be passed to the judger model.Outlining an effective bias evaluation prompt requires detailed, clear, and objective-oriented instructions to ensure the reliability and consistency of LLM-generated results [78,9,60].While several prior studies have employed LLMs for bias analysis [36,81], a key limitation lies in the oversimplified structure of their prompts-often asking the model to assess whether a response is biased without giving it exact criteria.Such simplistic prompting tends to undermine both the interpretability and consistency of the resulting evaluations.</p>
<p>To address this problem, we design a fine-grained bias scoring rubric ranging from 1 to 10, with detailed descriptions for each score level to be used consistently across all experiments and bias domains (see Table 1 in the appendix).For each evaluation, we provide the judging model with the target bias domain of our interest, the defined bias criteria, the input question, and the response generated by the target LLM.The judge model is then asked to assign a bias score and provide a justification referencing the rubric and the defined bias domain, to maximize the explainability of why it makes such a decision.The evaluation prompt is provided in Appendix A.1.</p>
<p>LLM-Judged Scoring</p>
<p>Definition 2. Let s (j)</p>
<p>i ∈ [1,10] represent the bias score assigned by a judge model to the response generated by model M j for question q i .</p>
<p>Step 1: Peer Mean per Question.For each question q i , we first compute the average bias score of all peer models excluding model M j :
µ (−j) i = 1 K − 1 K k=1 k̸ =j s (k) i (3)
Step 2: Mean Relative Bias Score.We compute the overall relative bias score for model M j by averaging the absolute deviation of its bias scores from the peer average across all N questions:
D LLM (M j ) = 1 N N i=1 s (j) i − µ (−j) i(4)
A higher D LLM (M j ) value indicates that model M j deviates more strongly from its peer models across the question set, suggesting higher relative bias.Similar to the embedding-based scoring method, we emphasize that these bias scores are not meant to be interpreted in isolation and we use them in a comparative way to make claim relative bias.</p>
<p>Statistical Validation</p>
<p>To ensure the robustness of our relative bias measurements and confirm that observed deviations are practically meaningful rather than due to random fluctuations, we apply equivalence hypothesis testing using the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure [58,35].Unlike classical statistical tests such as ANOVA [62] or post-hoc comparisons [5,22]-which test whether any difference exists across the means of several groups (LLMs in our case)-our objective is to evaluate whether a target model deviates from the behavior of baseline models by a meaningful amount.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, our framework does not assume that all models are unbiased or equivalent by default-they also have their own bias compared to each other.Instead, we test whether the target model's mean bias score lies outside a region of acceptable deviation, defined by a threshold δ derived from baseline model variability.</p>
<p>Equivalence Hypothesis Setup</p>
<p>Let µ T be the mean bias score of the target model, and µ B the mean of the bias scores across all baseline models.We define an equivalence margin δ such that deviations within [−δ, +δ] are considered practically insignificant.The hypothesis test is then defined as:
H 0 : |µ T − µ B | &lt; δ where δ = k • σ(5)
The threshold δ represents the smallest deviation considered practically meaningful in the context of relative bias.We define δ in a data-driven manner based on the variability across baseline models as k • σ, where σ is the standard deviation of the mean bias scores of all baseline models, and k is a tunable constant that controls the allowable range of deviation.Under the assumption that the distribution of baseline model means is approximately normal (which is held by assuming that the assigned bias scores are independent due to the Central-Limit-Theorem), k defines the confidence level of acceptable variation.For example, k = 2 corresponds to a 95% interval under the empirical rule [56], meaning that any model deviating beyond this range is treated as relatively biased.This formulation enables a principled and interpretable threshold for statistical deviation.</p>
<p>To evaluate the null-hypothesis, we conduct two one-sided Welch's t-tests2 [35] and reject the null hypothesis only if both p-values fall below the significance threshold (α = 0.05).This way, we control the acceptable natural deviation of bias on baseline LLMs via the δ parameter.</p>
<p>4 Experiments and Results</p>
<p>Experimental Setting</p>
<p>We employed GPT-4o for question generation across our target domains (Section 3.2).For the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation, we used Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o by running them independently and performing statistical tests on each of them and see whether their answers are aligned with each other or not (Section 3.5).For the embedding-based method, we used INSTRUCTOR as our instruction-based embedding model (Section 3.4).</p>
<p>For baseline comparisons, we selected 8 widely recognized, state-of-the-art LLMs: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Cohere Command R+, DeepSeek R1 (from the original DeepSeek website [2]), DeepSeek R1 third-party hosted (via AWS Bedrock [1]), Llama 4 Maverick, Meta AI Chat (Llama 4 official chatbot hosted by Meta [4]), Jamba 1.5 Large, and Mistral Large.We accessed these LLMs through the AWS Bedrock platform for API requests, except for the original DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Flash [3], GPT-4o, and Meta AI chat, which were accessed via their own APIs, and all queries were sent independently to the LLMs.To prevent self-enhancement bias [82], we deliberately excluded Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o as an evaluation baseline model.For the statistical tests, we set the significance level to α = 0.05 for p-value and k = 2.81 in Equation 5 to reflect the range that includes 99.5% of expected variation in baseline model bias scores, based on the empirical rule of normal distribution [56].We assume that LLMs are independent from each other, and the question set that we ask from LLMs are also independent.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Bias Analysis of DeepSeek R1</p>
<p>Several media reports have claimed that the DeepSeek R1 model is sensitive to topics related to the Chinese government and historical narratives [26, 55,75], suggesting it may have been trained to respond cautiously to certain questions.However, these claims have not been quantitatively evaluated and are based on oral observations.We address this gap using our framework to systematically assess the model's behavior across politically sensitive prompts by analyzing it relatively to the set of baseline LLMs.</p>
<p>To conduct this evaluation, we generate 100 questions spanning 10 categories on sensitive topics related to China, ask them from the models, and evaluate their responses.Figures 1(a), 2(a), and 3(a) in Appendix A.2 present the mean bias scores for several models using both the embedding-based and LLM-as-a-Judge methods, respectively.Notably, DeepSeek R1 exhibits consistently higher bias scores across all categories compared to the baseline models.However, the AWS-hosted version of DeepSeek R1 does not show deviation from the other models, indicating a difference between the publicly released version and the one hosted on the DeepSeek website.Consequently, the statistical tests confirm that DeepSeek R1 shows significant relative bias in this target domain compared to the baseline models.Note that our baseline models are mostly Western-developed; choosing different baselines (e.g., Eastern LLMs) could yield different results.Thus, the relative bias of DeepSeek R1-or any other experiment in our framework-is measured compared to the set of baseline LLMs.</p>
<p>To assess whether DeepSeek R1's sensitivity extends to political topics more generally or is specific to China-related content, we conducted a parallel experiment using 100 questions across 10 categories addressing politically sensitive issues in the United States.As illustrated in Figures 1(b) , 2(b), and 3(b) in Appendix A.2, all evaluated models including DeepSeek R1 consistently received low bias scores.Furthermore, statistical tests indicated no significant relative bias among the models in this domain.Notably, the results for both the original DeepSeek R1 and its AWS-hosted variant were nearly indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Bias Analysis of Meta AI Chat / Llama 4</p>
<p>Several reports have raised concerns about commercial chatbots that avoid answering questions related to their own parent companies, suggesting the presence of internal censorship or alignment constraints [64,18].To investigate this, we applied our bias evaluation framework to the Meta AI chatbot, the online chatbot version of Llama 4 language model, using 10 questions across 5 categories targeting potentially sensitive topics related to Meta.</p>
<p>As shown in Figures 1(c), 2(c), and 3(c) in Appendix A.2, the Meta AI chatbot exhibits a clear deviation in bias scores across nearly all categories when compared to the baseline models, confirmed by the statistical test.This indicates a consistent pattern of alignment or evasiveness in handling prompts that may concern the company.Interestingly, DeepSeek R1 also displays elevated bias scores in the questions related to the censorship by Meta company (categorized as "Censorship" in Figures 1, 2, 3 (c)), despite the questions not being directly related to China.In contrast, the open-source version of Llama 4 does not exhibit any significant relative bias compared to the baseline models across the same question set.</p>
<p>More information about all experiments including statistical tests and distributions is provided in Appendix A. 4.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>How alignments can introduce or remove bias, and how our framework can measure it.A key insight from our experiments is the observable behavioral difference between identical model architectures deployed in different environments.For instance, DeepSeek R1 hosted on its original website demonstrates clear relative bias on politically sensitive topics related to China, while the same model hosted on AWS does not.Similarly, Meta AI's chatbot (built on Llama 4) exhibits consistent evasiveness on company-related questions, whereas the open-source Llama 4 model does not show such behavior.These behaviors are due to the applied alignments on these models, showcasing how alignment can introduce or remove bias.By leveraging relative comparisons across models, our framework provides a principled way to detect and measure these alignment-induced behaviors.It is important to emphasize on the evaluation of not just the model itself, but also its deployment context before integrating into sensitive applications.Bias/Alignment evaluation is missed over LLM benchmarks.Various LLM evaluation benchmarks have been proposed and continue to grow rapidly, serving as a primary tool for selecting suitable models across diverse use cases [16,66,44,29,70,41,74].However, most of these benchmarks focus predominantly on performance and accuracy metrics, while other important aspect like bias and (mis)alignment fall behind, as the experiment results we showed in this paper have not presented via these benchmarks.This omission can lead to unexpected or harmful behaviors of LLMs in real-world applications, especially when models are deployed in sensitive or high-stakes scenarios.</p>
<p>The need for scalable bias auditing in a rapidly evolving LLM landscape.As LLMs are released and adopted at an increasingly fast pace, often with minimal transparency around their internal training, fine-tuning, and alignment mechanisms, the need for rapid, systematic auditing tools becomes more urgent.Our framework provides a principled method for detecting bias under blackbox access, making it especially useful for evaluating newly released or proprietary models flexibly on different bias contexts.</p>
<p>Bias Mitigation.Our embedding-based bias score offers potential for bias mitigation, or to be integrated in prior mitigation methods [52,33,57,15,43,76,27].Its speed, determinism, and reproducibility make it suitable for integration into fine-tuning pipelines as a penalty term on the loss-function to resolve bias and achieve desired alignment.We leave this direction as a future work for further exploration.</p>
<p>Limitations.The proposed framework has several limitations.First, it assesses bias only in a relative manner-its conclusions depend on comparing the target LLM's behavior against a set of baseline models.As such, it does not make claims about the absolute level of bias in any single LLM.Second, the framework does not provide a comprehensive analysis of all possible biases.</p>
<p>Bias is an open-ended problem that spans an unbounded range of topics and social dimensions, making it impossible to enumerate or capture exhaustively.Instead, this framework is designed to confirm suspected biases within a specified bias target domain, and its effectiveness depends on both the granularity of that domain and the ability of the question-generation LLM to probe it.Lastly, the reliability of the evaluation depends on the quality of the embedding model and the LLM used as the judge, and limitations or biases in these components may influence the results.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this paper, we proposed the Relative Bias framework-a comparative methodology for analyzing the bias of LLMs by measuring their behavioral deviations from each other.By combining embedding-based distance metrics with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, our approach enables scalable and statistically grounded bias evaluation under black-box conditions.Our experiments show how pre-training, fine-tuning, and deployment-time modifications can lead to significant differences in model behavior-even for the same model across different deployments-and how analyzing these differences through relative comparisons offers a fast and practical solution for bias assessment in the rapidly evolving landscape of language models.</p>
