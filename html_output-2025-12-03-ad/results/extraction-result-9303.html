                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Warning: This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately. Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation. While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs. Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias. Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts. Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance. Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs. We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs.</p>

Warning: This paper contains examples of stereotypes and biases.Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit considerable social biases, and various studies have tried to evaluate and mitigate these biases accurately.Previous studies use downstream tasks as prompts to examine the degree of social biases for evaluation and mitigation.While LLMs' output highly depends on prompts, previous studies evaluating and mitigating bias have often relied on a limited variety of prompts.In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of LLMs when changing prompt variations (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, debias-prompt) by analyzing task performance and social bias of LLMs.Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts to the extent that the ranking of LLMs fluctuates when comparing models for task performance and social bias.Additionally, we show that LLMs have tradeoffs between performance and social bias caused by the prompts.Less bias from prompt setting may result in reduced performance.Moreover, the ambiguity of instances is one of the reasons for this sensitivity to prompts in advanced LLMs, leading to various outputs.We recommend using diverse prompts, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>While LLMs have high performance, they also have unfair, severe social biases, which can harm specific groups (Sheng et al., 2019;Kirk et al., 2021;Blodgett et al., 2020).In response to these concerns, many prior studies have tackled to assess and mitigate social bias in LLMs.Social biases in LLMs are often evaluated using the LLMs' predictions in downstream tasks such as question answering (Li et al., 2020;Parrish et al., 2022), natural language inference (Akyürek et al., 2022; Anantapray- (3) debias-prompt.These variation factors can affect the scores.The instance was sampled from the BBQ dataset (Parrish et al., 2022).oon et al., 2024), commonsense reasoning (An et al., 2023), sentence completion (Dhamala et al., 2021;Nozza et al., 2021).Recent LLM developers adopt downstream task style assessment for their own LLMs' bias evaluation and release LLMs with bias evaluation results comparing existing models (Touvron et al., 2023;Zhang et al., 2022).As for mitigation of social bias, various methods have also been proposed, such as counterfactual data augmentation (Zmigrod et al., 2019), decode intervention (Schick et al., 2021), and text intervention (Mattern et al., 2022;Ganguli et al., 2023).Although LLMs should have both higher task performance and less social bias, challenges remain in the evaluation due to the sensitivity regarding the prompts (Zhao et al., 2021b;Lu et al., 2022;Robinson and Wingate, 2023;Li et al., 2024).Previous Table 1: Comparison with Existing Studies on Prompt Variation: We summarize the prior work, using BBQ style datasets, from three perspectives: prompt format, shot setting, and debias-prompt.</p>
<p>studies have highlighted that LLMs have the sensitivity to task instruction and prompt (Jang et al., 2023;Sclar et al., 2024;Yin et al., 2024), and verification with multiple prompts is crucial in task performance evaluation of LLMs (Gu et al., 2023;Mizrahi et al., 2024).Whereas prompt sensitivity to task performance in LLMs has been recognized, bias evaluation still requires further exploration to understand the challenges.In bias evaluation, identifying the worst-case scenarios is important when considering potential risks associated with social bias in LLMs (Shaikh et al., 2023;Sclar et al., 2024).The sensitivity hinders evaluating and mitigating social bias in LLMs, leading to either underrating or overrating social biases in LLMs and the effectiveness of debiasing.</p>
<p>In this paper, we empirically studied the sensitivity of 12 LLMs to prompt variations in evaluating task performance and social bias 1 , focusing on a question-answering dataset, BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022).We categorized three prompt variation factors to assess the sensitivity of task performance and social bias in LLMs comprehensively, as illustrated in Figure 1: 1) task instruction and prompt for task recognition, 2) few-shot examples for task performance improvement, and 3) debias-prompt for bias mitigation such as adding Note that the sentence does not rely on stereotypes.Table 1 compares prompt variations from the three perspectives in previous work.Although previous work provided insight into social bias in LLMs, their evaluation settings are limited and could be more extensive in the three perspectives.</p>
<p>Our experimental results reveal that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompts in bias evaluation.The ranking of LLMs and debiasing effectiveness fluctuate when comparing models for task performance and bias scores, even though the prompt format does not affect the semantics ( §4.1).We also show 1 https://github.com/rem-h4/llm_socialbias_prompts that LLMs have tradeoffs among task performance and social bias caused by the prompts; for example, bias increases in the prompt where task performance increases ( §4.2).Furthermore, we confirmed that the ambiguity of instances contributes to the sensitivity in the advanced LLMs ( §4.3).Our investigation can shed light on the vulnerability of LLMs in bias evaluation.We recommend using diverse prompts to compare the effects of social bias in LLMs.</p>
<p>Bias Evaluation on LLMs Using the Downstream Task</p>
<p>This paper focuses on bias evaluation using multiple choice questions (MCQs).In the MCQs setting, the LLMs are required to choose the most suitable answer from the candidate answers ( §2.1).We prepared three prompt variation factors to confirm LLMs' sensitivity in bias evaluation ( §2.2).</p>
<p>Multiple Choice Question on LLMs</p>
<p>When evaluating LLMs using MCQs, the LLM receives the context, the question, and symbolenumerated candidate answers as a single prompt, following previous work about MCQs (Robinson and Wingate, 2023).The symbol assigned the highest probability answer is LLMs' answer for the MCQs.Our prompt template, designed for MCQs with three options, is described below.Each {} means placeholder for values from datasets.</p>
<p>Prompt Variations</p>
<p>We vary the following three perspectives in evaluating bias in LLMs: 1) task instruction and prompt, 2) few-shot examples, and 3) debias-prompt.Previous studies showed that these factors could affect task performance, i.e., LLMs' prediction.In realworld use cases, users of LLMs can employ any prompt format.Such deviations can introduce gaps between real-world and evaluation environments, unintentionally leading to adverse outcomes such as task performance degradation or bias amplification.Therefore, verification with prompt variations is needed.</p>
<p>Task Instruction and Prompt Task instructions and prompts describe task setting, how to solve the task briefly, and how to format the task instance for LLMs.They are the minimal settings for solving tasks using LLMs as the zero-shot settings.Previous work showed the vulnerability of task instruction (Gu et al., 2023;Mizrahi et al., 2024) or prompt formatting (Shaikh et al., 2023;Sclar et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Few-shot Examples Few-shot examples are demonstrations for LLMs to recognize and learn tasks in the manner of in-context learning.Fewshot prompting can improve task performance despite the simple method of not updating parameters (Brown et al., 2020).Moreover, creating few-shot examples is more practical and reasonable than developing a large amount of training data, even when solving an unseen task.Therefore, few-shot prompting is often adopted for LLMs' evaluation (Gao et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Debias-Prompt Prompting style debias is a promising method to mitigate social bias because it does not require additional model training and can only work with additional text input.We call this kind of prompt debias-prompt.Although prior work verified the effectiveness of debiasprompt on bias evaluation dataset to some extent (Si et al., 2023;Ganguli et al., 2023;Oba et al., 2024), they only verified limited prompts or models2 .Therefore, comparing the effectiveness of debias-prompts differences is important.</p>
<p>Based on debias-prompts proposed in previous work, we categorized three perspectives for debiasprompts, (1) Level: stereotypes can be subdivided into levels such as general, gender, occupation, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Style: debias-prompts can be broadly classified into two types: instructive text including expressions such as Note that (Ganguli et al., 2023;Si et al., 2023), and plain text like (Oba et al., 2024;Mattern et al., 2022;Zhao et al., 2021a).</p>
<p>(3) Negation: the previous prompts have included and excluded negation, which is one of the most important aspects of prompt (Jang et al., 2023).We created twelve different prompts using the template based on three categories3 .</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>In this section, we first investigated the sensitivity of LLMs in the zero-shot setting ( §3.1).After that, we also investigated whether the few-shot setting can mitigate LLMs' sensitivity and how it affects task performance and bias scores compared to the zero-shot setting ( §3.2).Then, we finally examined how the debias-prompt can affect metrics ( §3.3).</p>
<p>To quantify sensitivity, we calculate the sensitivity gap, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum LLMs' score on each metric.</p>
<p>Dataset (BBQ): BBQ dataset aims to evaluate various social biases via the question answering task (Parrish et al., 2022).This dataset was created using templates carefully written by humans.Each BBQ instance contains context and question with three answer candidates: stereotype answer, antistereotype answer, and unknown answer.In BBQ, four instances are combined, with two different context types (either ambiguous or disambiguated) and two different question types (negative or nonnegative).The disambiguated contexts comprise ambiguous context and additional information supporting the answers to questions.The additional information leans toward either stereotype or antistereotype.We extracted gender categories and filtered some instances with proper names regarded as bias category proxies from the original dataset according to prior work (Huang and Xiong, 2023).</p>
<p>We used 2016 instances, and Table 2 shows the example of BBQ datasets.</p>
<p>Metrics:</p>
<p>In this paper, we use two existing metrics for BBQ following Jin et al. (2024) and intro-</p>
<p>Context ambiguous</p>
<p>We couldn't start the board meeting at 9am today because a man and a woman were late.disambiguated (stereotype) {ambiguous context} + We had to wait for the man because they were running the meeting, and the woman was responsible for taking all the notes.disambiguated (anti-stereotype) {ambiguous context} + We had to wait for the woman because they were running the meeting, and the man was responsible for taking all the notes.</p>
<p>Question negative</p>
<p>Who was the secretary?non-negative Who was the board chair?</p>
<p>Options</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>The man B Not enough information C</p>
<p>The woman Table 2: BBQ Instance Example: This example assesses the gender bias in the occupations; a woman seems to be the secretary, and a man seems to be the board chair.</p>
<p>duce an additional metric:</p>
<p>(1) accuracy: This metric indicates the task performance.In ambiguous contexts, the correct answer is always 'unknown' regardless of the questions.In disambiguated contexts, the correct answers correspond to the question.We denote the accuracy in ambiguous and disambiguated contexts as Acc a , Acc d , which are calculated as follows:
Acc a = n u a n a ,(1)Acc d = n s sd + n a ad n sd + n ad ,(2)
where n a , n sd , n ad means the number of instances with ambiguous context, stereotypical disambiguated context, and anti-stereotypical disambiguated context, respectively.The superscript of each n stands for the predicted labels: stereotypes ( s ), anti-stereotypes ( a ), and unknown ( u ).</p>
<p>(2) consistency: We introduce another metric for evaluating whether LLM can distinguish the context difference partly inspired by An et al. (2023).BBQ has negative and non-negative questions, so LLM should answer different choices for each question in the disambiguated context.If the LLMs can recognize context, the answers to negative and nonnegative questions should differ.Based on this idea, we formulate the measure as follows:
Consist d = 2 n d n d 2 i I[a i neg ̸ = a i nonneg ],(3)
where n d means the number of instances with disambiguated context, a i neg means LLMs' answer for negative quesiton on i-th instance, a i nonneg for nonnegative question.A higher value indicates that LLMs can distinguish context information when answering questions.</p>
<p>(3) diff-bias: This metric indicates how much LLMs lean toward stereotype or anti-streotype.We calculate this as the accuracy difference in answers to stereotype and anti-stereotype.
Diff-bias a = n s a − n d a n a ,(4)Diff-bias d = n s sd n sd − n a ad n ad .(5)
Here, the bias score ranges from -100 to 100.A positive score indicates biases toward stereotypes, while a negative score indicates biases toward antistereotypes.The ideal LLM has 100, 100, and 0 for accuracy, consistency, and diff-bias, respectively.</p>
<p>Model We used 12 LLMs from four types of publicly available billion-size LLM variants with varying parameters and whether they were instructiontuned or not: Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), MPT (Team, 2023), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023), details in Appendix A. We used the huggingface transformer library4 and conducted all experiments on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB RAM.</p>
<p>Zero-shot Setting</p>
<p>Setting In a zero-shot setting, we varied the prompt formats.We prepared nine prompts in total: one with no task instruction, eight combinations of four types as task instruction, and two types of option id (lower-case or upper-case) as minimal changes5 .We used three cyclic permutation orders to mitigate position bias (Izacard et al., 2024):</p>
<p>(1,2,3), (3,1,2), (2,3,1), where 1,2,3 represents the original choice option.We calculated the sensitivity gap on the format change.</p>
<p>Result Table 3   with or without instruction tuning.These findings suggest that even advanced LLMs are vulnerable to format change not only in task performance but also in bias scores.</p>
<p>Few-shot Setting</p>
<p>Setting In a few-shot setting, we used 4-shot samples for BBQ evaluation 6 .We formatted the fewshot samples with the same option symbols in the target evaluation instance.The few-shot samples are inserted between the task instruction and the target instance.We must ensure that few-shot examples do not introduce additional social bias into LLMs from their textual content.To address this, we sampled the BBQ dataset from another stereotype category and modified the words related to stereotypical answers in samples into anonymous ones by replacing the man with Y.We fixed the few-shot examples and their order for simplicity.Our main focus is not finding the best few short examples and order, demonstrating the effect of prompt change for bias evaluation.Other setups are followed in the zero-shot setting.</p>
<p>Result Table 3 shows the sensitivity of few-shot prompting across formats on each model.It shows that few-shot prompting can mitigate the sensitivity gap on format variations in some metrics on some LLMs.However, there are still gaps, and few-shot prompting sometimes promotes the sensitive gap.This indicates that few-shot prompting does not entirely mitigate the LLMs' sensitivity to format difference, which is partly consistent with prior work concerning task performance (Pezeshkpour and Hruschka, 2024).</p>
<p>6 Table 9 shows few-shot samples in Appendix.</p>
<p>Debias-Prompt Setting</p>
<p>Setting We investigated the effectiveness of debias-prompts across formats and models in a fewshot setting.We inserted the debias-prompt at the beginning of the prompt.For simplicity, we only refer to max and minimum values across different debias-prompts on average concerning formats.</p>
<p>Result Table 4 shows the result of the debias effect on each metric across models.This result indicates that some debias-prompts contribute to task performance and debias improvement; conversely, some prompts worsen LLMs.This is consistent with prior work that showed that performance could be either up or down around the vanilla value in debias-prompt setting (Oba et al., 2024;Ganguli et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>To investigate the sensitivity of LLMs in more detail, we analyzed our results from three perspectives: the task instruction and prompt difference ( §4.1), the correlation among metrics ( §4.2), and the instance-level sensitivity ( §4.3).</p>
<p>How Much Difference Does the Format Make?</p>
<p>Having demonstrated that sensitivity in absolute metric values varies on three prompt variation factors in LLMs, we question whether format changes affect the relative relationship of evaluation values between different LLMs.In real-world use cases, users aim to understand the relative performance among different LLMs.To address this, we calculate the format-level Pearson correlation coefficient between each metric of compared LLMs.Table 5 in the upper rows shows the result of the correlation coefficients gap, which reports maximum and minimum values in the zero-shot and few-shot settings.In disambiguated metrics as Acc d and Diff-bias d , the maximum value is close to 1.0 and the gap is small.On the other hand, in ambiguous metrics as Acc a and Diff-bias a , the gap is larger than disambiguated ones.This indicates that format change varies the ranking of LLMs more in ambiguous metrics than disambiguated ones.Although this tendency is mitigated in fewshot settings, correlation coefficients in ambiguous metrics still have larger gaps across formats.We also calculate the model-level correlation coefficient between each metric of compared formats (Table 5 in the below rows.).This indicates that it depends on the model which format elicits better performance.Few-shot prompting does not mitigate the correlation gap on all metrics.Furthermore, we investigated the effectiveness of debias-prompts across different formats.Table 6 shows the result of the maximum and minimum format-level correlation coefficients.The effectiveness of debias-prompts also highly depends on formats.For example, mpt-7b-instruct shows both positive and negative correlations in debiasprompts, indicating that the effectiveness of debiasprompts can reverse with format change, which does not change semantics meaning.These findings highlight the importance of prompt variation in bias evaluation for LLMs, as even minor differences in prompt format can have severe impacts.</p>
<p>Are There Tradeoffs Between Task</p>
<p>Performance and Bias Score?</p>
<p>Having confirmed high sensitivity in both task performance and bias scores, an essential question arises: Does the high-performance setting also exhibit less social bias?Although LLMs should achieve high performance and less social bias, it has yet to be well known whether bias decreases with increasing performance in LLMs, and it is not obviously derived from definitions of metrics.Therefore, we analyzed how task performance and bias score correlate across models and formats.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the correlation between metrics.We see negative correlations between Acc a and Acc d .As for accuracy and bias scores, disam-   biguated metrics have a stronger correlation than ambiguous ones.This indicates that bias increases as accuracy increases from a score perspective in the disambiguated contexts.These findings indicated that the LLMs have a tradeoff between ambiguity recognition (Acc a ) and task-solving ability in enough information (Acc d ), and higher task performance (Acc) does not necessarily align with less bias (Diff-bias) in LLMs.This implies that evaluating multiple perspectives simultaneously, such as task performance and social bias, is important to reveal the LLMs' ability.</p>
<p>What Kind of Instances Are Sensitive for LLMs?</p>
<p>Having demonstrated a high level of sensitivity in LLMs in bias evaluation, another question arises: Does the specific instance contribute to this sensitivity across different formats and models?The uncertainty of instances affects the model predictions is reported (Pezeshkpour and Hruschka, 2024) and uncertainty of instance is also an essential aspect of bias evaluation dataset construction (Li et al., 2020;Parrish et al., 2022).Therefore, investigating the instance-level sensitivity is important.To address this, we divided the instances based on LLMs' predictions into two groups: non-sensitive instances, those with the same predictions across all formats in each model, and sensitive instances, those with at least one format with a different prediction.We also used types of context and question from BBQ categories for analyzing the ratio in sensitive instances.In this analysis, we focused on zero-shot and few-shot settings.</p>
<p>See Table 7 for the sensitive ratio and the ratio in sensitive instances of ambiguous contexts and negative questions.While more than half of the instances are sensitive in zero-shot settings, the few-shot setting can reduce sensitive instances in all models.This implies that the few-shot setting can enhance the robustness of LLMs to the prompt format change.As for ambiguous and negative ratios in sensitive instances, ratios are around 0.5 in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, except for Llama2-13b variants, which archive high consistency in ambiguous ratios.This indicates that ambiguity contributes to sensitivity more when LLMs can understand context differences.</p>
<p>We conducted another analysis to confirm whether the specific instances can be sensitive across models.Figrue 3 shows a histogram of instances about how many LLMs are sensitive regarding ambiguity.Specific instances are sensitive across many models in zero-shot and few-shot settings to varying degrees, and this tendency is salient in ambiguous contexts.Further analysis is required to assess the effect of ambiguity when evaluating social bias in LLMs.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Our work investigates LLMs' sensitivity in bias evaluation, which is aligned with various NLP work aspects.Here, we discuss its relation to social bias in NLP, bias evaluation in downstream tasks, and the robustness of LLMs.</p>
<p>Social Bias in NLP Various types of social biases in NLP models have been reported (Blodgett et al., 2020).Its scope has expanded to include word vectors (Caliskan et al., 2017), MLMs (Kaneko et al., 2022), and now LLMs (Ganguli et al., 2023;Kaneko et al., 2024).Moreover, various mitigation methods for social bias have been proposed in prior work such as data augmentation (Zmigrod et al., 2019;Qian et al., 2022), fine-tuning (Guo et al., 2022), decoding algorithm (Schick et al., 2021), also prompting (Si et al., 2023;Ganguli et al., 2023;Oba et al., 2024).Our work is based on evaluating the social bias of LLMs from prompt perspectives.</p>
<p>Bias Evaluation in Downstream Tasks.Existing studies investigate how to quantify social biases in downstream tasks such as text generation (Dhamala et al., 2021;Nozza et al., 2021), coreference resolution (Rudinger et al., 2018;Zhao et al., 2018), machine translation (Stanovsky et al., 2019;Levy et al., 2021), question answering (Li et al., 2020;Parrish et al., 2022).As for question answering, Li et al. (2020) developed UNQover datasets by using ambiguous questions to assess model biases related to gender, nationality, etc, and ambiguity was followed by later research (Mao et al., 2021).Parrish et al. (2022) developed BBQ that covers more bias categories and disambiguated questions.Prior work using the downstream task for LLMs mainly focuses on bias evaluation score on LLMs; in comparison, our work mainly focuses on LLMs sensitivity in bias evaluation.</p>
<p>Robustness of LLMs Our study is related to the robustness of LLMs (Zhao et al., 2021b;Lu et al., 2022;Ribeiro et al., 2020;Chen et al., 2023;Zheng et al., 2024;Hu and Levy, 2023) As for a specific task, such as MCQs, surface change can affect task performance.These include choice order (Zheng et al., 2024), prompt format (Sclar et al., 2024), task description (Hu and Frank, 2024), calculation of choice selection (Robinson and Wingate, 2023).</p>
<p>In this work, we investigated the robustness of task performance and social bias of LLMs simultaneously from multiple perspectives.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This study showed that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt variation (task instruction and prompt, few-shot examples, and debias-prompt) in task performance and social bias.The sensitivity can cause fluctuation in the ranking of LLMs.We confirmed that LLMs have tradeoffs between task performance and social bias caused by prompts.Our analysis indicated that instance ambiguity is a cause of sensitivity to the prompts in advanced LLMs.</p>
<p>Our findings shed light on the bias evaluation of LLMs derived from their sensitivity.We recommend using prompt variations, as in this study, to compare the effects of prompts on social bias in LLMs In future work, we will expand our investigation to other tasks.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>Our work has several limitations.First, our investigation requires much prompt variation regarding task prompt formatting, few-shot setting, and debias-prompts.Therefore, our investigation takes the computational costs compared to a limited evaluation setting.Second, we conducted bias evaluations using only English datasets.Social bias is also reported in languages other than English, and datasets are proposed to assess such bias in other languages.Third, we treated only gender bias datasets despite other bias categories such as religion, nationality, disability, etc.Finally, we used only the QA dataset for bias evaluation, though there are other bias evaluation datasets, as mentioned in §5.Although our work has limitations, our evaluation perspectives can be generalized to other tasks.</p>
<p>Ethics Statement</p>
<p>Our investigation shows the sensitivity of LLMs in bias evaluation.However, it is important to note that our study only shows that LLMs are vulnerable with respect to bias evaluation, and even if the bias scores of LLMs are low in our investigation, it does not mean that LLMs are shown to be free of bias.As mentioned in the limitation section, our work is limited to languages, bias categories, and downstream task types.Furthermore, our prompt variations are still limited compared to possible prompt variations in the real world.Then, other prompt variations may lead to worse generations for users.</p>
<p>A Model Details</p>
<p>Our experiments use 12 open-source LLMs, which can be downloaded from the huggingface hub.Table 8 shows the checkpoint URL of each model.</p>
<p>B Few-shot Samples</p>
<p>Table 9 shows the few-shot samples for our experiments.We sampled the few-shot samples from the BBQ dataset and converted words related to stereotype groups to anonymized words (X, Y).</p>
<p>C Verification of debias-prompt</p>
<p>We confirmed the effectiveness of debias prompts (Table 11) using the intrinsic bias evaluation dataset.We used CrowS-Pairs (CP) (Nangia et al., 2020) 7 and StereoSet (SS) (Nadeem et al., 2021) to ensure a minimum level of effectiveness of debias-prompt.Both datasets have sentence pairs containing a stereotypical sentence (s) He addressed the shareholders as the CEO of the company, and an anti-stereotypical sentence (a) She addressed the shareholders as the CEO of the company.We used log-likelihood to evaluate the bias on LLMs defined by (6) where I[x] returns 1 if x is true and 0 otherwise, θ means parameters of LLM, N is the number of datasets, and dp means debias-prompts.Ideal LLMs achieve BiasScore Intrinsic is 50, stereotypical LLMs are toward 100, and anti-stereotypical LLMs are toward 0. Table 10 shows the effectiveness of our derbies-prompt on intrinsic tasks.In both intrinsic bias evaluation datasets, CP and SS settings, almost debias-prompts can mitigate the bias.</p>
<p>D Task Instruction and Prompt Format Variation</p>
<p>Table 12 shows the four variations of task instructions and two variations of enumerated symbols for choice options.</p>
<p>E Other Results</p>
<p>Table 13 shows the maximum and minimum value of each score in zero-shot and few-shot settings.</p>

Figure 1: Prompt Variations on Bias Evaluation: This example shows prompt variations on bias evaluation using downstream task (1) task instruction and prompts, (2) few-shot examples, and (3) debias-prompt.These variation factors can affect the scores.The instance was sampled from the BBQ dataset (Parrish et al., 2022).</p>

Figure 2: Correlation between Metrics in Few-Shot Setting: Acc a and Acc d (left) have a negative correlation, which means a tradeoff on task performance exists between ambiguous and disambiguated contexts.Acc a and Diff-bias a (center left) have a little correlation.Acc d and Diff-bias d (center right) have a positive correlation; however, it indicates a bad trend, meaning that bias increases as performance increases in a disambiguated context.</p>

Debias-Prompt Effect on BiasScore Intrinsic</p>
<p>Though Chain-of-Thought prompting is also adopted to bias mitigation, it has another challenge on performance degradation due to wrong explanation made by LLMs(Shaikh et al., 2023; Turpin et al., 2023). Then, we mainly focus on simple types of prompting.
We have confirmed the effectiveness of our debiasprompts on the intrinsic bias evaluation dataset CrowS-Pair(Nangia et al., 2020) and Stereoset(Nadeem et al., 2021). The detail is described in Appendix C.

We used the task instructions based on the previous work(Jin et al., 2024). Details are described in Appendix D.
We used a revised version of dataset (https://gitlab. inria.fr/french-crows-pairs) proposed byNévéol et al. (2022) that addressed the issues reported inBlodgett et al. (2020).
