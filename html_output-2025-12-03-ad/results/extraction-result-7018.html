                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Graph-Enhanced Biomedical Abstractive Summarization Via Factual Evidence Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Infusing structured semantic representations into language models is a rising research trend underpinning many natural language processing tasks that require understanding and reasoning capabilities. Decoupling factual non-ambiguous concept units from the lexical surface holds great potential in abstractive summarization, especially in the biomedical domain, where fact selection and rephrasing are made more difficult by specialized jargon and hard factuality constraints. Nevertheless, current graph-augmented contributions rely on extractive binary relations, failing to model real-world n-ary and nested biomedical interactions mentioned in the text. To alleviate this issue, we present EASumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization empowered by event extraction, namely graph-based representations of relevant medical evidence derived from the source scientific document. By relying on dual text-graph encoders, we prove the promising role of explicit event structures, achieving better or comparable performance than previous state-of-the-art models on the CDSR dataset. We conduct extensive ablation studies, including a wide experimentation of graph representation learning techniques. Finally, we offer some hints to guide future research in the field.</p>

Infusing structured semantic representations into language models is a rising research trend underpinning many natural language processing tasks that require understanding and reasoning capabilities. Decoupling factual non-ambiguous concept units from the lexical surface holds great potential in abstractive summarization, especially in the biomedical domain, where fact selection and rephrasing are made more difficult by specialized jargon and hard factuality constraints. Nevertheless, current graph-augmented contributions rely on extractive binary relations, failing to model real-world n-ary and nested biomedical interactions mentioned in the text. To alleviate this issue, we present EASumm, the first framework for biomedical abstractive summarization empowered by event extraction, namely graph-based representations of relevant medical evidence derived from the source scientific document. By relying on dual text-graph encoders, we prove the promising role of explicit event structures, achieving better or comparable performance than previous state-of-the-art models on the CDSR dataset. We conduct extensive ablation studies, including a wide experimentation of graph representation learning techniques. Finally, we offer some hints to guide future research in the field.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>International experts argue that language is the highest manifestation of human intelligence [1]. This makes learning knowledge from text one of the greatest challenges of modern artificial intelligence. Language is ambiguous, consisting of several expressions that allude to the same fact and often lacking background knowledge for the mentioned entities. Despite capturing a massive amount of knowledge, current state-of-the-art language models-even with 10 11 parameters-struggle to separate high-level semantics from language structure [2,3], acting as memories rather than intelligent networks. Consequently, they notoriously suffer from hallucinations, biases, low robustness, and fragility (vulnerability to adversary attacks) [4,5] that severely limit their real-world application. Semantics is central to summarization, where humans are asked to grasp the relevant parts of the input document, link them, and rephrase the selected entangled facts to create an original short text conveying as much information content as possible. These challenges are further emphasized by the biomedical literature, characterized by documents having domain-specific terminology, elaborated links among entities, no space for interpretation, and no tolerance for factual mistakes. However, automatic summarization systems can substantially help healthcare professionals have a quick and reasonably close overview of the knowledge encapsulated in large scientific corpora, outlining a prerogative toolbox for efficient knowledge discovery [6][7][8][9]. Standing on the shoulders of AI is even more important when we consider the accelerated speed of publication, which since 2020 has exceeded the threshold of 1 million new papers on PubMed per year (3 per minute) [10].</p>
<p>Researchers together have cast doubt about whether pure data-driven methods based on deep neural architectures would be sufficient to achieve understanding. The interpretability requirement and the lack of grounding to the core interactions expressed in the document beg the question of whether symbolic representations may come to the rescue. Following this intuition, the community has recently investigated the integration of structured knowledge into neural language models [11], reckoning on external knowledge graphs [12] or structured representations obtained via semantic parsing [13] and latent semantic correlations [14][15][16]. Depending on the graph's nature, neuro-symbolic methods may thus target amplified understanding or knowledge acquisition capabilities. Reaching the latter goal only with traditional pretraining approaches can be inefficient and expensive. For example, acquiring a fact like "Paracetamol can treat cold" requires having a large number of cooccurrences of "paracetamol" and "cold" concepts in the pretraining corpus. While the combination of language models and knowledge graphs is a research path already widely explored, the same does not apply to semantic graphs. Existing contributions merely extract flat, open-domain, and binary relations, which can result in inferring incomplete or incorrect facts non-useful for biomedicine [10,17]. In this scenario, event extraction [10] appears as the most promising option for obtaining task-driven meaning representations. Under the umbrella of structured prediction, it aims to derive n-ary and potentially nested interactions between participants having a specific semantic role. We point out to the reader that events are released from the presence of a temporal element, and for clarity, we consider the following definition of event proposed in [10]: "An event is a specific occurrence of something that happens and involves an arbitrary number of attributes and participants covering a specific semantic role, depending on the event type. The interaction (i.e., dynamic relation) modeled by an event represents or leads to some state change"</p>
<p>In this paper, the keyword "event" therefore stays for medical evidence mentioned in the scientific literature, in accordance with previous works. Still, we are aware that this term may be misleading and requires revision [10].</p>
<p>We propose EASumm, the first model leveraging event extraction for abstractive single-document biomedical summarization, adopting a tandem architecture combining text and graph representations. We test our solution on the CDSR dataset [18], and we prove how biomedical event extraction contributes to reserving the essential global context and keeping the connection between the most relevant entities, thus generating a higher quality summary (see Fig. 1). Extensive ablation studies prove the contribution of each module and quantify the impact of multiple graph representation learning techniques.</p>
<p>This is an extension of [19], where we test multiple relation-aware graph representation learning modules, dissect event extraction in more details, clarify our methodology with details and algorithms, and openly release all code and data.</p>
<p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The following section examines related work. "Event extraction" provides a more extensive discussion on event extraction. Then, "Graph construction" presents our event-based strategy for deriving structured medical evidence from the source text. Next, "Model" details our model, from the architecture design to the training objectives. "Experimental setup" illustrates our experimental setup, while "Results" showcases the results obtained. Finally, "Conclusion" reports the conclusions and points out future directions. </p>

<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Abstractive Document Summarization</p>
<p>Summarizing text demands generating a concise summary discarding unnecessary attributes, and preserving the salient notions of the source document. Notably, abstractive summarization does not imply simply copying phrases from the source text but also coming up with new content, echoing a human-like interpretation and paraphrasis. Transformerbased language models have achieved astonishing results in recent years, mainly thanks to deep encoder-decoder architectures and self-supervised pretraining. In a nutshell, the encoder maps the source tokens into a sequence of continuous representations while the decoder reads them and autoregressively generates the summary one token at a time. Their ability to learn universal representations from large volumes of unlabeled text data and then transfer such knowledge to downstream tasks has revolutionized the abstractive summarization research sphere [20][21][22][23][24][25]-even in low-resource [26,27] and multi-document settings [28]. Nevertheless, quantitative studies and large-scale human evaluations [29] have confirmed that current text generators are still heavily victims of hallucinations and prone to produce summaries that are unfaithful to the input documents. For this reason, the latest solutions are mostly knowledge-driven or tend to complement training with reinforcement learning modules to improve informativeness and consistency [30][31][32].</p>
<p>Graph-Enhanced Summarization</p>
<p>Human language is highly ambiguous, with multiple ways to express the same concept unit, where the underlying meaning is oftentimes altered by high-level linguistic constructs. Additionally, a single sentence may incorporate various predicate-argument structures. Despite these observations, current language models only consider the superficial organization of the text document, which is almost irrelevant to identifying its real and deeper semantic content [13]. Climbing towards natural language understanding, an increasing number of researchers argue that a model trained purely on the form will never learn the meaning, lacking signals to learn non-linguistic relations [33].</p>
<p>To this end, structured representations allow different quality improvements (e.g., coherence, factuality, low redundancy, long-range dependencies, informativeness, consistency) depending on how they are constructed. In particular, semantic parsing graphs normalize lexical and syntactic variations, providing formal meaning representations capable of decoupling concept units (what to say) from language competencies (how to say it).</p>
<p>Graph structures have long been used for extractive summarization. In this sense, early approaches, such as Tex-tRank [34], propose unsupervised keyword and sentence extraction methods exploiting graph-based ranking algorithms to determine each vertex's importance. Extensions have been devised to incorporate document-level information [35] or introduce graph-based attention into encoderdecoder architectures [36]. As for abstractive summaries, results are mostly built on the cross-cutting success of graph neural networks (GNNs), a famed class of deep learning methods designed to process graph-represented data without imposing linearization or hierarchical constraints. Fernandes et al. [37] combine sequence encoders with GNNs feed with weakly-structured data inferred by the text through off-theshell NLP tools, including named entity recognition and coreference resolution; the final model compares favorably with baselines using only the sequential or graphical structure. Structured summarization also relates to the graph verbalization trend [38][39][40], where inputs may originate from knowledge graphs, information extraction or semantic parsing techniques. Instead of tackling a graph-to-text approach, An et al. [41] redefines the task of scientific papers summarization by utilizing a graph-enhanced encoder on top of a citation network. To concretize a text-graph complementary view-where GNN channels are used in addition to traditional document encoding-many researchers have tried different ways of automatically building a machinereadable knowledge representation linked to the underlying text [42][43][44], also considering different level of granularities, like entities and sentences [45]. OpenIE [46] and Stanford CoreNLP [47] are undoubtedly the two most popular libraries, targeting triplets and coreference resolution, respectively.</p>
<p>Importantly, graph-LSTMs appear as one of the most effective ways for constructing graph-guided summarizers [32,37,39,41,44,45], being competitive with large pretrained language models at a lower computational and environmental cost.</p>
<p>Event Extraction</p>
<p>Relation extraction (RE) systems primarily focus on highly-extractive binary relations, giving rise to a list of &lt; subject, predicate, object &gt; triplets connecting only entity-mention pairs. Despite their simplicity, flat triplets in biomedical science are notoriously inadequate to capture the source document's complete biological meaning (see "Comparison with Relation Extraction"). Per contra, event extraction (EE) systems can handle n-ary complex relations with nested and overlapping definitions. Remarkably, the EE history is very intertwined with biomedicine. Page 4 of 19</p>
<p>SN Computer Science</p>
<p>According to the BioNLP-ST competitions [48][49][50], events are composed of a trigger (a text span which testifies their occurrence, e.g., "interacts", "regulates"), a type (e.g., "binding", "regularization"), and a set of arguments with a specific role (e.g., "cause", which can be typed entities or events themselves. Please note that the event schemas (i.e., target event, entity, and role types) are pre-established, conforming to a reference ontology. Hence, differently from linguistically grounded semantic parsing techniques like abstract meaning representation (AMR), EE is domain-specific and-given an input sentence-outputs a graph only in case of evidence of interest.</p>
<p>Comparison with Relation Extraction</p>
<p>EE and RE have a lot of common ground. They both aim to detect relations from raw text and build structured, machine-readable representations. In RE settings, a relation can be defined as R = r(a 1 , a 2 , .., a n ) where r is a relation type and a i ∀i = 1, … n is typically an entity. When n &gt; 2 , we say that R is a complex relation. Most of the RE systems, such as Open-IE, are not capable of extracting complex relations, they usually detect general-domain directed or undirected binary relations ( n = 2 ). The set of triples r(a 1 , a 2 ) might not be sufficient to represent underlying knowledge correctly, especially in biomedicine. This simplification of the original ground-truth complex structure may lead to the extraction of incomplete, uninformative, or erroneous facts [10,17]. Events have been precisely designed to solve these limitations, targeting a set of sophisticated closed-domain interactions. Figure 2 illustrates a real-world biomedical example recapping the crucial expressiveness divergences between RE and EE outputs.</p>
<p>Biomedical Event Extraction</p>
<p>A series of datasets have been proposed to improve EE research. Among these, we highlight the series of BioNLP shared tasks (BioNLP-STs) [10]. The labeling process is curated by domain experts, resulting in gold standards that can be used for training or benchmarks. The availability and coverage of biomedical EE corpora are still retained by the extremely expensive annotating process. For instance, annotating the GENIA corpus-one of the most popular biomedical EE datasets -took 1.5 years with five part-time annotators and two coordinators [51]. Such complexity-motivated cost hinders the number of examples, with training sets that typically consist of &lt; 300 instances. Another known problem is related to class imbalance, meaning that a large portion of event types might be under-represented.</p>
<p>Annotations for a certain text document (.txt) are saved in standoff .a<em> files, where a distinction is made between .a1 and .a2. Pointedly, an .a1 file encodes information about gold entities; instead, an .a2 file encodes information about triggers and the events rooted in them (i.e., reference multirelational interconnections between entities and triggers). Figure 3 shows an example. Each line in an .a</em> file refers to a single annotation. In turn, each annotation is made of multiple attributes separated by a single TAB character, always including an identifier. Entity and trigger annotations are accompanied by their type (e.g., "Gene" for an entity, "Localization" for an event), the (start, end) character offset of their mention, and the marked text. Instead, an event annotation consists of a SPACE-separated set comprising the trigger and the related arguments (entities or other triggers in case of sub-events). The event trigger is specified as TYPE:ID, thus identifying the event type and its trigger through the identifier. The event arguments are indicated as ROLE:ID pairs, thereby listing the semantic role and the argument identifier filling that role. So, by convention, the event type is stated both in the trigger and event annotation. Note that several events can share the same trigger and that, while the event trigger should be specified first, the event arguments can appear in any order.</p>
<p>Graph Construction</p>
<p>We construct graphs from raw documents applying Deep-EventMine (shortened as DEM) [52], a sentence-level EE discriminative neural network with state-of-the-art results on seven biomedical tasks. DEM does not depend on gold entities but carries out named entity recognition in end-to-end without losing too much performance. Starting from SciB-ERT contextual representations [53], DEM enumerates all the possible text spans in a sentence up to a certain window length, then executes a joint detection and classification flow of (1) entities and triggers, (2) roles, (3) events and modifiers, through custom layers.</p>
<p>Following Frisoni et al. [54], we shape events as multirelational graphs. Ergo, an event graph G = (V, E) consists of a finite set of nodes V = v 1 , … v V -triggers or entitiesand a set of edges E ⊆ V × V modeling entity-trigger or trigger-trigger relations, with the seconds applying for nested events. Edges are directed, labeled, and unweighted, with no cycles. Both nodes and edges in G are associated with type information; hence, the graph is heterogeneous and multirelational. An edge e i,j connects node v i to node v j . Entities that don't belong to any event are ignored during graph construction. Node connections are encoded in an adjacency matrix A ∈ ℝ V×V , where a ij = 1 if there is a directed link from v i to v j , and 0 otherwise. We operate graph rewiring by adding a master node connecting all event nodes to enhance Page 5 of 19 500 SN Computer Science (https:// github. com/ dair-iitd/ OpenIE-stand alone). An event graph maps complex interactions mentioned in the text to a linkage between the trigger (dark gray) and entity (light gray) nodes, labeling edges and arguments with pre-defined roles and types aligned with an ontology. On the other hand, an OpenIE graph collects a possible set of triplets consisting of untyped text phrases. The OpenIE graph is merely extractive, error-prune, and devoid of additional metadata; worse, it does not capture semantic interconnections between n-ary participants, often ignoring crucial conditions for the correctness of a triplet or extracting incomplete facts difficult to merge with post-processing Figure taken from [19]  SN Computer Science the information flow and ensure we end up with a single graph rather than a set of small disjoint graphs.</p>
<p>Model</p>
<p>Our model observes a biencoder-decoder architecture (depicted in Fig. 4), taking inspiration from [32]. It takes two inputs, the sequence of all tokens present in the document x = x k and the event graph G, constructed as explicated in "Graph construction".</p>
<p>Document Encoders</p>
<p>The sequence of tokens x is fed to a bidirectional transformer-based encoder. We take token embeddings from the output of the last layer and pass them to a multi-layer bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), thus gaining the sequence of encoder hidden states h k . We implemented the following BERT [55] variants.</p>
<p>SciBERT</p>
<p>SciBERT [53] performs pretraining on a multi-domain corpus of scientific publications containing 1.14 M biomedical and computer science papers. It uses an in-domain vocabulary (SciVocab), characterized by a 42% token overlap with respect to the original BERT vocabulary, spotlighting a substantial difference in frequently used words between scientific and general-domain texts.</p>
<p>RoBERTa</p>
<p>RoBERTa [56] provides an updated version of BERT by optimizing its training process. The model is pretrained longer, with bigger batches and over more data. The next sentence prediction objective is removed. Longer sequences are taken into account, and the masking pattern-applied to the training data-is dynamically changed.</p>
<p>Graph Encoders</p>
<p>Node Initialization</p>
<p>Each node feature v i is initialized by taking into account both its text span and entity/trigger type. First, we average the per-token hidden states h k corresponding to the matched text. Then, we concatenate the acquired representation to the argument type embedding s a (or trigger type embedding s t ) learned by DEM. On this point, we believe that type metadata can play a vital role in augmenting the understanding capacity of the model and resolving ambiguities. The master node is represented by a 0-vector.</p>
<p>Graph Neural Network</p>
<p>Subsequently, the graph G is passed to a GNN. To assess the impact of edge features and broadly compare all the key graph representation learning techniques available in the literature, we explore both non-relation-aware and relationaware architectures (sketched in Fig. 5). Indeed, the demand for processing edge-featured graphs is quite common in biomedical tasks. For example, let's assume that the node "pantoprazole" is connected to "reflux": the edge type-"treat" or "cause"-can utterly change the meaning of the relation. It is clear that, in such a situation, edge features can be at least as significant as those of nodes. On the other side, traditional GNNs represent structural links through binary adjacency matrices and cannot handle multi-relational graphs  [19] equipped with additional edge-type information. Ergo, our work evaluates the presence or absence of benefits due to the consideration of the edge type for summarization purposes, based on current GNN contributions.</p>
<p>Graph Attention Network</p>
<p>We adopt a Graph Attention Network (GAT) variant introduced in [39], working with a self-attention setup where N independent heads are calculated and concatenated before a residual connection is applied. Fundamentally, each node embedding v i is obtained from a weighted average of its neighboring nodes N(v i ):</p>
<p>where n i,j is the attention mechanism tied to the n-th attention head, applied to node v i and node v j . W * are trainable parameters.</p>
<p>(1)

<p>Edge-Aware Graph Attention Network</p>
<p>Edge-Aware Graph Attention Networks (EGATs) [57] are a variant of GATs with an edge-type-aware message passing. The attention weights n i,j are not only influenced by the features of the two nodes v i and v i , but also by the features of the edge connecting them e i,j . We represent the latter through edge-type one-hot embeddings. The node representation learning process is the following:</p>
<p>where [… ‖ … ] indicates a concatenation and a learnable weight vector.

<p>SN Computer Science</p>
<p>Relational Graph Convolutional Network</p>
<p>Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCNs) [58] are an extension of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) capable of modeling multi-relational data. Intuitively, relation-specific transformations are introduced, depending on the type and direction of an edge:</p>
<p>where N(v i ) r denotes the set of neighbor indices of node i under relation r ∈ R . A central issue with applying Eq. (6) is the exponential growth in parameters as the number of relation types increases. This easily brings to large-size models and overfitting on rare relations. Centrally, R-GCNs treat edge types as class labels, which indicates that edges cannot include continuous attributes.</p>
<p>Levi Graph Transformation and Graph Attention Network</p>
<p>To ponder edge features, instead of modifying the model architecture by replacing the GAT module with an R-GCN or EGAT, we can transform the input graph into its equivalent Levi graph [59]. Similarly to [32,60,61], each edge e i,j is turned into an additional node directly connected to its original linking nodes v i and v j (Fig. 6). The new edge set contains an edge for every &lt; node, edge &gt; pair in the original graph. We end up with an unlabeled directed graph (bipartite by definition) without the risk of parameter explosion. Edges are represented and initialized in the same way as nodes, with features given by their type description. Using this strategy, the GNN naturally generates hidden states even for edges.
(6) v i = ReLU ∑ r∈R ∑ j∈N(v i ) r 1 |N(v i ) r | W r v j + W 0 v i ,</p>
<p>Decoder</p>
<p>The decoder uses a multi-layer unidirectional LSTM that generates summary tokens recurrently, exploiting at each time step t the graph and the document context vectors c v t (Eq. 7) and c t (Eq. 9).</p>
<p>Attending to the Graph</p>
<p>The graph context vector is computed based on the decoder hidden state s t :</p>
<p>where a v i,t denotes the attention mechanism from [62] corresponding to the ith node at time step t: u * are also trainable parameters.</p>
<p>Attending to the Document</p>
<p>Similarly, the document context vector is calculated over input tokens by considering c v t and encoder hidden states h k :</p>
<p>where a k,t denotes the attention corresponding to the k-th input document token at time step t: Fig. 6 Example of Levi transformation on an event-graph. Red nodes and edges are added as a kind of graph rewiring

<p>SN Computer Science</p>
<p>Token Prediction</p>
<p>The decoder hidden state s t is concatenated to the graph and document context vectors, expressing the salient content coming from both sources. This final representation is used to determine the probability distribution of the vocabulary vocab at time step t:</p>
<p>We also include a copy mechanism as in [32] to check out the embedding of the token generated at the previous time step y t−1 :</p>
<p>P copy,t ∈ [0, 1] is used as a soft switch to decide between generating a token from the vocabulary by sampling from P vocab,t , or copying a token from the input sequence by sampling from the attention distribution a k,t . The probability of generating the token w at time t is given by:</p>
<p>Training Objective</p>
<p>We employ a negative log-likelihood loss function between the generated summary ŷ and the ground-truth y:</p>
<p>where x are the source documents and y and are the target summaries from training set D, G is the graph constructed from x, and = {W * , u * } is the set of the model trainable parameters.</p>

<p>Experimental Setup</p>
<p>Dataset</p>
<p>We evaluate EASumm on the CDSR dataset [18], a publicly available corpus designed for assessing the automated generation of lay language summaries from biomedical scientific reviews. Besides creating accurate and factual summaries, this benchmark also requires a joint style transition from the original language of healthcare professionals to that of the general public. By imposing high abstraction and biomedical explanation constraints, CDSR is an ideal testbed. The training, validation, and test sets contain 5178, 500, and 999 samples. The documents can be downloaded directly from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review 1 As for EE, each source document was split into a set of sentences and passed to DEM; the results were saved in standoff .a * files. Statistics about the total numbers of events, entities, and triggers extracted by DEM are detailed in Table 9.</p>
<p>Training Details and Parameters</p>
<p>All experiments were run using a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. We used the cased version of SciBERT to extract Page 10 of 19</p>
<p>SN Computer Science token embeddings. Hyperparameters are listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>We implemented RGCN and EGAT with Pytorch Geometric [63], while GAT is drawn on [43]. We used the version of DEM pretrained on the MLEE task 2 [64]-the EE benchmark linked to the biomedical domain most aligned to CDSR based on empirical tests (see "Event extraction dataset selection").</p>
<p>Material</p>
<p>For replication purposes, the code and the dataset are publicly available at https:// github. com/ disi-unibo-nlp/ easumm.</p>
<p>Baseline Methods and Comparisons</p>
<p>We conduct comprehensive ablation studies by testing different EASumm variants (hereinafter shortened as EAS), which we denote through the suffix, with "−" symbolizing a module exclusion and " + " an addition/substitution:</p>
<p>• −G stands for the graph encoder exclusion; • + RB indicates the adoption of RoBERTa [56] instead of SciBERT to generate source document tokens embeddings; • −TypE refers to the node type exclusion during the initialization; • + EGAT + RGCN specify the adoption of EGAT and RGAT, respectively, in replacement of GAT; • + BIp suggests the employment of the Levi transformation on GAT-processed event graphs to treat nodes and edges equally.</p>
<p>For a comparative analysis, we experiment with two extractive methods:</p>
<p>• Oracle extractive: it creates an oracle summary by selecting the set of sentences in the document that generates the highest ROUGE-2 score with the ground-truth summary (i.e., syntactic match upper bound); • BERT [55]: inter-sentence encoder with classification head, supervised through an Oracle extractive signal;</p>
<p>and two abstractive methods:</p>
<p>• Pointer generator [65]: standard seq2seq model with a pointer network that allows both copying words from the source and generating new words from a fixed vocabulary; • BART [25]: full-transformer pretrained on large corpora by reconstructing text after a corruption phase with an arbitrary noising function. We also take into account a variant with additional pretraining steps on PubMed to compensate for the limited training data. Specifically, we use the PMC articles dataset, 3 containing 300K PubMed abstracts.</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
<p>Quantitative Analysis</p>
<p>As done in [18], we use ROUGE [66] to evaluate the summarization performance. ROUGE-n quantifies the overlap of n-grams between the model-generated summary and the human-generated reference summary, and ROUGE-L measures the longest matching sequence of words using the longest common subsequence. We report the Block-diagonal-decomposition (4 blocks) Aggregation scheme Mean ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores computed using pyrouge. 4 Given the supplementary scientific → public language translation objective of the CDSR task, other than informativeness, we are interested in measuring the ease with which a reader can understand a passage, defined as readability. We use three standard metrics for this goal: Flesch-Kincaid grade level [67], Gunning fog index [68], and Coleman-Liau index [69]. Their equations are as follows:
• Flesch-Kincaid grade level • Gunning fog index
where complex words are those words with three or more syllables.</p>
<p>• Coleman-Liau index</p>
<p>where L and S are the average numbers of letters and sentences per 100 words, respectively. All these evaluation metrics are computed using textstat 5 and estimate the years of formal education a person needs to understand the text. Lower scores indicate that the text is easier to read; for instance, scores of 13-16 correspond to college-level reading ability in the United States education system.</p>
<p>Qualitative Analysis</p>
<p>Automatic evaluation metrics for summarization are not able to grasp all the desired quality dimensions, particularly in highly abstractive settings grounded on semantics [70]. To fill this gap, we run an in-depth human evaluation study to analyze proper text properties and identify primary error sources. We randomly sample 50 CDSR test set instances and engage three native or fluent English speakers with biomedical expertise (average age: 24.6 years old; average time for completion: 2 h; education level: 1 PhD and 2 master students; no compensation). Selection criteria guarantee that our annotators are representative of the college-educated lay public. Precisely, we presented each human rater with the source document, the inferred summary, and the reference (15) 
(17) 0.0588L − 0.296S − 15.8,
summary. Then, we asked raters to judge the prediction along three quality criteria with a Likert scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).</p>
<p>• Informativeness. Does the summary supply enough necessary content coverage from the input article? • Fluency. Does the text progress naturally? Is it grammatically correct (e.g., no fragments and missing components) and coherent whole? • Understandability, CDSR-related [18]. Is the summary more effortless to understand than the source?</p>
<p>We even invite evaluators to binary label whether summaries contain any of the following classes of unfaithful errors: (1) Hallucination, fabricated content not present in the input; (2) Deletion or substitution, erroneously missing or edited elements (e.g., entities with altered semantic role);</p>
<p>(3) Repetitiveness, repeated fragments. Complete guidelines are in "Human evaluation guideline".</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Automated Summary Evaluation</p>
<p>Evaluation on full dataset Table 2 exhibits the results of our presented models compared to baseline methods. Notably, EASumm gives better ROUGE scores than all its variants. The positive effect of the event graph is motivated by the performance drop associated with EASumm−G. Features obtained via a domain-coherent language model like SciBERT contribute to superior results than RoBERTa. Further, the graph encoder in the RoBERTa implementation does not furnish any progress over the solution without it. Type-augmented node initialization techniques show clear advantages, confirming our hypotheses on the usefulness of domain-specific and semantic text augmentations pulled by DEM. EASumm significantly outperforms BERT, pointer generator, and plain Bi-LSTM architectures but does not beat BART (quality gap of ≈ 6 ROUGE points), despite greater readability on average. This behavior suggests a future direction of developing event-driven models on top of a large pretrained encoder-decoder model such as BioBART [71]. By contra, we emphasize the lightness of our final model compared to BART BASE∕LARGE , which counts 8 M trainable parameters instead of 139 M/406 M (up to 50x fewer weights). Finally, we mention the importance of expanding training data with more biomedical corpora. Page 12 of 19</p>
<p>SN Computer Science</p>
<p>Evaluation on Subsets</p>
<p>As documented in "Event extraction dataset selection", the number of events extracted in each document may be contained, leading to sparse graphs with few nodes. Thus, we suspect that the graph encoder contribution could be capped, expecting a more noticeable performance gap regarding EASumm−G for those documents containing a larger number of events extracted per sentence (abbreviated as EEpS). Following this line of thought, we assembled four subsets where source documents have an EEpS greater than 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. Table 3 reveals the ROUGE scores on each of the four subsets for the different model variants and BART BASE . As EEpS increases, the performance gap between the solutions with and without graph encoder widens, proving our speculation. We can also notice how the EASumm performance gets closer to BART BASE . Given the linear relationship between EEpS and the ROUGE gap-emerged from our empirical experiments, we conjecture that the deficit can be wiped out entirely with event extraction models pretrained on sentences conveying topics more aligned to the CDSR ones ( Table 4).</p>
<p>The Impact of Relations During Graph Representation Learning</p>
<p>As pointed out in Tables 5 and 6 from the point of view of ROUGE scores, the solutions adopting EGAT and Levi transformation yield the best results, underlining the major limit of RGCNs, which is not being able to process custom representations for edge features. Distinctly, EGAT is the graph modeling technique that most benefits from higher EEpS; by contra, the other two methods are characterized by fluctuating ROUGE scores with respect to EEpS. In terms of readability, EGAT dominates all three metrics, followed by RGCN and Levi transformation. Surprisingly, we couldn't improve the original solution that ignores relation types when encoding the graph. However, by looking at the distribution of relation types (see Table 4), we notice that it is extremely uneven. In particular, almost all nodes are linked by either an Instrument or Theme edge. The other 8 relation types don't seem to have a relevant impact; therefore, we can easily understand why this negatively affects the potential contribution of edge-aware solutions (Fig. 7).   Table 7 portrays the results of human evaluations. The average inter-rater agreement is 0.61 (Kendall's coefficient ∈ [ − 1, 1] indicating low to high association), a good score considering the subjectivity of the rating task. For full transparency, we publicly release the results of our human evaluation. 6 Besides the need for larger-scale studies, this work delivers helpful preliminary evidence. EASumm obtains suitable scores in fluency and understandability. Deletion and substitution in verbalized facts appear to be the most frequent error type, together with repetitiveness. After inspection, we find several utterances with swapped entities not belonging to event mentions, thus not attributable to a noneffectiveness of event injection. Low hallucinations testify to the advantage of leveraging event graph representations. With a closer look, we observe that human-written summaries also include a non-trivial amount of commonsense and world knowledge not mentioned by the input article. For example, for a source document discussing "spironolactone", the human writer may add "used since the 1960s" in the summary. Consequently, we invite the reader to reflect on attributing low factuality scores to generative models, weighting them against the dataset's properties.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We introduced EASumm, the first abstractive summarization model augmenting source documents with explicit, structured medical evidence extracted from them, thereby concretizing a tandem text-graph architecture. We demonstrated the significant positive influence of biomedical event extraction for summarization, allowing a model to better distinguish semantics and lexical surface. Indeed, we showed improvements in ROUGE and readability scores, observing a strong connection between the summer quality and (1) the number of events extracted from the input document, (2) the enhanced node features initialization considering both domain-specific pretrained language models and entity types. Contrary to expectations, event-graph representation learning does not benefit from the awareness of the relation type. The motivation is to be found in the task-driven nature of event extraction and in the poor capacity of current graph neural networks in managing multi-relational graphs.</p>
<p>Although the numerous newly introduced graph-LSTM models combined with structured knowledge, we establish that these architectures are far from being competitive with generative transformer-based solutions like BART.</p>
<p>Future Directions</p>
<p>Based on our findings, we suggest nine promising future research directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>using large pretrained encoder-decoder transformers to replace graph-LSTMs architectures [74]; 2. increasing the number of the events by merging available biomedical benchmarks thanks to generative event extraction approaches and non-discriminative architectures [75]; 3. increasing the size of the document-level graphs by combining events with linguistically-grounded abstract meaning representations [74]; 4. exploiting multimodal text-graph alignments with metric learning techniques as in [76][77][78]; 5. exploring end-to-end event extraction and document summarization; 6. discovering new connections between nodes useful for increasing summarization performance (i.e., dynamic event graph construction), conveying techniques like random perturbation [79,80] and iterative deep graph learning [81]; 7. performing node relevance scoring supported by term weighting [82] and/or perplexity metrics [12];  [74]; 11. pushing the interaction and mutual influence between graph and text encoders; 12. injecting subgraphs fetched from external structured memories using dense representations [85], devising retrieval-enhanced language models [86].</li>
