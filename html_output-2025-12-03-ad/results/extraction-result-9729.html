                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98\%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.</p>

Safer or Luckier? LLMs as Safety Evaluators Are Not Robust to Artifacts
9 Jul 2025D220D31B2529BA5ABC28EFD50CF872E0arXiv:2503.09347v3[cs.CL]
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain.This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing.Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations.Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98%.Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts.To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models.Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations.These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Evaluation of generative large language model (LLM) outputs is an ongoing challenge.Human evaluation is costly and too slow to be used for development, and automated evaluation remains an active and challenging area of research (Elangovan et al., 2024;Chaganty et al., 2018;Abeysinghe and Circi, 2024).This is particularly a challenge for long-form generations that cannot be easily parsed into short-form answers -such as common sense reasoning, general question answering, instruction following, and safety.These domains generally 2023; Koo et al., 2024).These artifacts can lead to significantly wider confidence intervals in automated LLM evaluation results than the field generally admits.Many works will check LLM performance against gold-standard human judgments, but will not control for artifacts, such that the LLM could agree with the human annotations for the wrong reasons, and high agreement won't generalise to new datasets that lack the artifact.Table 1 illustrates how deceiving artifacts may be present in the content to be evaluated, and gives a taxonomy of the artifacts investigated in this work ( § 2.1).For instance, if 80% of all 'safe' generations in the human annotated dataset include an apology like I am sorry then the dataset does not have the power to determine if high agreement between human and LLM judges is because the LLM can correctly label the concept of 'safety', or has just learnt a correlation between apology and safety.Beyond artifacts, there are other assumptions about the reliability of LLM judges that are also unexamined: LLM-as-a-judge evaluations tend to be run once, with the assumption that the LLMs are consistent.Many works assume that larger and more powerful models will be better judges, so they often default to the largest and most generally capable model (i.e.GPT4 or GPT4o in most cases) (Aakanksha et al., 2024;Zeng et al., 2024a), which is also unexamined as a choice.</p>
<p>In this work, we examine the reliability of LLMas-a-judge evaluations with respect to all of these, focusing on the under-explored safety domain.Our research questions are: RQ1) How robust to common artifacts are LLM-as-a-judge safety evaluations?RQ2) Can we improve robustness by using a panel of judges, instead of one model?and RQ3) How much do other factors (LLM size, LLM consistency across runs, varying safety subdomains etc.) influence results?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we take a dataset of human-annotated preference data across five critical safety domains: Misinformation, Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Toxicity, Sexually Explicit and Self-harm.We analyze the robustness of 11 models from 5 different families on this dataset (Llama3, Claude3, GPT4, Command R, and Mistral), sized from 8B to 100B or even larger in closed source models, to make the results insightful and relevant to the state of the art of the field.We test the vulnerability of these models to five different artifacts: two that are known from general LLM-asa-judge evaluation, and three novel ones specific to the safety domain (Table 1).We are to our best knowledge the first work that systematically evaluates a wide range of judge models for comparative safety assessment.</p>
<p>We discover that all models are highly susceptible to simple artifacts, with safety evaluations changing based on the presence of an artifact.We find significant variance between models, with some models having opposing preferences/dispreferences for a given artifact.This reveals that LLM judges, however large and capable, rely on statistical correlations over broader concepts such as safety.Crucially, we find that higher agreement rate with humans does not necessarily correlate with higher robustness towards artifacts -so they are two complementary axes to measure LLM as judge performance, implying that the focus on human agreement only is a significant gap in good evaluations.</p>
<p>Our findings also challenge other common misconceptions, for we find that LLMs can be inconsistent across repeated runs of the same task, and that larger and more capable models are not always better or more robust to artifacts.</p>
<p>We make some progress towards increased evaluator robustness: we find that with careful 'artifactaware' selection of jurors on a panel of LLMs, the overall reliability (in terms of alignment with humans and robustness in the presence of artifacts) can be improved.However, sensitivity towards artifacts is not fully resolved.Our findings highlight the risks of over-relying on untested LLM judges for safety, calling for more robust methodologies for such a high-stakes task.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>In the following sections, we detail our methodology, including dataset design and evaluator setup, followed by experimental results on evaluator agreement with humans and robustness to artifacts.We also analyze consistency of results, the comparative performance of smaller and larger models, and explore jury-based evaluations.</p>
<p>Judge Models We evaluate a comprehensive list of judges, both larger and smaller versions of a wide range of model families.In total, there are 11 models from 5 different families: Llama3 (AI@Meta, 2024), Claude3 (Anthropic), GPT4 (OpenAI, 2024a,b), Command R (Cohere, 2024a,b), and Mistral (Mistral AI, 2024;Jiang et al., 2024)), sizing from 8B to 100B or even larger in closed source models.We evaluate: llama3- 70B-chat, llama3-8b-chat, command-r-plus, command-r, mistral-large, mistral-8x7b, claude-3sonnet, claude-3-haiku, gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18.We explicitly choose a larger model and a smaller model from each model family, to gain insights into the impact of size on performance (analysis in §3.3).</p>
<p>Dataset A diverse set of 576 safety-related prompts are composed by human annotators who specialise in safety annotation.Each prompt concerns one of the five key safety areas that we study: Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), Misinformation, Self-harm, Toxicity, and Sexually Explicit.For each prompt, single-turn completions are drawn from a diverse set of models and grouped into pairs for preference evaluation.We remove error generations, for a total of 4606 sampled completions (thus number of pairs M is 2303).Each pair is triply annotated for which of the pair has better safety and quality.Appendix C contains further dataset and annotation details as well as definitions for the five safety areas.</p>
<p>Artifacts</p>
<p>Table 1 lists examples of all artifacts and how completions are modified to test evaluator sensitivity towards the artifacts.Position and verbosity are known from previous works (Zheng et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024;Koo et al., 2024;Liusie et al., 2024;Wu and Aji, 2023), though have not been explored for safety.We also test three novel potential artifacts that are strongly tied to safety.Except for the verbosity artifact, the injected part is constant for all samples (i.e.not input-dependent).</p>
<p>Apology LLMs commonly refuse unsafe requests with an apology, so the presence of an apology will strongly correlate with safety.We prepend an apology to a completion and do not otherwise change the completion.</p>
<p>Authority adds a fake authoritative source to a completion.Citations are correlated with safety especially for Misinformation, where safe responses often cite sources.</p>
<p>Halo adds a chatty ending sentence that offers to help with something else.We design this artifact based on two motivations: 1) the halo effect is attested in human psychology (Nicolau et al., 2020) where humans transfer or generalize a positive impression they have from one area to another unrelated area, 2) in LLM safety data, offering to help with something else co-occurs commonly after a refusal of an unsafe request and thus correlates with safe responses.</p>
<p>Verbosity rephrases the completion so it has the same meaning but is longer.Rephrasing is done with the Command R model (details in Appendix E).Verbosity is a factor commonly believed to influence LLM's judgment as a preference evaluator.We test this in the safety domain as well as in a more controlled setting where the completion content (i.e.semantics) is unchanged -unlike in past literature where more verbose responses tend to give more information.</p>
<p>Position swaps which completion is first in the evaluator input and does not otherwise change them.This bias has been previously reported in literature (Zheng et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024;Koo et al., 2024;Liusie et al., 2024;Wu and Aji, 2023), but we are the first to measure it in the safety domain.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>We test the reliability of judge models for both their preference on completions and their preference on completion models, namely samplelevel preference (Eq. 1) and model-level preference (Eq.2).For sample-level preference, we measured the self-consistency ( §2.2.3), robustness towards artifacts ( §2.2.1), and alignment with human ( §2.2.2).For model-level preference, we measure self-consistency and robustness towards artifacts.</p>
<p>Sample-level Preference Let J m (q, a, b) denote the preference of judge model m given prompt q and completion a and b.Numerically, we map the preference as following:
J m (q, a, b) =    −1, m prefers completion b 0, m votes tie 1, m prefers completion a(wr m,A,B = 1 M M i=1 J m (q i , o Ai , o Bi )(2)
where o A , o B denotes the set of completions from models A and B respectively.</p>
<p>Notations 1 condition denotes the indicator function that returns 1 if the condition is met and 0 otherwise.f x (o) denotes the text obtained by injecting artifact x into completion o, where x ∈ {halo, apology, authority, verbosity, position}.Now we define the reliability metrics.</p>
<p>Robustness towards Artifacts</p>
<p>As the artifacts introduced in § 2.1 are not expected to change either sample-level or model-level preference ideally, we test the judge models' preference invariability in both levels.</p>
<p>Test 1: Sample-level Tie Detection We create a hypothetical paired comparison task, where one completion is an artifact-injected version of the other completion in the pair -the task is
J m (q i , o i , f x (o i ))
. Ideally, a robust LLM judge should give 0 (tie) for all samples, as the artifact injection does not affect the quality or safety of the completion.But we also consider an equivalent winrate between artifact-injected vs original samples to be unbiased judging: the model has failed to accurately detect ties but has done so uniformly.Finally, the Tie Detection score of a model m with respect to artifact x is
T x,m = 1 N N i=1 (J m (q i , f x (o i ), o i ) (3)
where N is 4606, the number of promptcompletion samples (q, o) in our dataset.</p>
<p>Hence, a T x,m score of 100% indicates a complete favor towards the artifact, 0% indicates perfect robustness, and -100% a complete disfavor towards the artifact -save position artifacts, where a positive winrate indicates a preference toward the first position.</p>
<p>Test 2: Model-level Winrate Shift This test mimics a real-world judging scenario, in which the pair of completions are taken from two different models, and the overall preference of the judge on the model completions is aggregated across pairs into winrate of one model over the other.</p>
<p>We inject artifact x to all completions from model B -the winrate becomes
wr m,Ax,B = 1 M M i=1 J m (q i , f x (o A i ), o B i ) (4)
A perfect evaluator should give zero delta between wr m,Ax,B and wr m,A,B (discounting self-inconsistency, Appendix A).Finally, we also compute the delta when applying the artifact to model A, and report the average:</p>
<p>See Appendix F for the derivation steps.This metric definition leads to a positive score when the judge model m bias towards an artifact, and a negative score when it disfavors the artifact (save position artifacts, where a positive winrate indicates a preference toward the first position).</p>
<p>Correcting for Position Bias To discount potential position bias in experiments for other artifacts, we measure both position configurations (i.e.a-b and b-a) and then take the average.</p>
<p>Agreement with Human Annotations at Sample-level</p>
<p>We check each judge's agreement with human annotations, both to measure overall quality and to see if this common quality metric correlates with artifact robustness.We compare the majority vote of human (triple) annotations and compare it with the judge model (single) annotation, across all samples.We take this measurement twice, permuting the sample order, to account for position bias, and take the average.The score is defined mathematically as:
HA m = 1 M M i=1 1 Jm(q i ,o A i ,o B i )=J h (q i ,o A i ,o B i )
(6) where J h represents the preference by human annotation.The higher the score, the better.</p>
<p>Self-Consistency</p>
<p>Judge models are usually used as if their evaluations are consistent across reruns, given that the decoding temperature is 0. We measure whether this is true at both sample-level and model level.</p>
<p>Sample-level self-(in)consistency is measured by:
SSC m = 1 M M i=1 1 Jm(q i ,o A i ,o B i )=J ′ m (q i ,o A i ,o B i )(7)
where J ′ m represents the preference by the same model m but re-ran.</p>
<p>Model-level self-(in)consistency is measured by
MSC m = |wr m,A,B − wr ′ m,A,B |(8)
where wr ′ represents the winrate obtained by the same model m but re-ran.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the detailed performance of each judge model for each artifact robustness test.Figure 1: Deviation from tie judgments, with percentage winrate of artifact (x-axis) by artifact (y-axis), aggregated across judge models (where each x-marker is the aggregate for one model).Higher density near 0 indicates robustness among all judge models.The apology artifact is strongest, whereas some but not all judges are resistant to position and halo artifacts.</p>
<p>High-level takeaways 1) most models are deceived by Apology artifacts at both sample-level and model-level, though more so at sample-level.often rely more on statistical correlations than the concept of safety.4) higher agreement with humans does not necessarily correlate with higher robustness towards artifacts, therefore both are important metrics to test the validity of LLM-as-judge evaluations.

<p>Tie Detection Test Results</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows that apology is the most deceptive artifact, causing judges to rate a sentence as safer than it is.For one judge (GPT4 Turbo), this bias is nearly 100%.Many judges show resilience to the position artifact in tie detection tasks, likely because the completions are easily recognized as identical.Among judges who do exhibit position bias, the preference is more balanced, with some favoring the first completion and others the second.With specific results of each models in Authority Interestingly, no evaluator shows a significant preference due to authority.Some evaluators (Llama3 (70B) and Claude 3 Sonnet) are almost unaffected, while others have up to 8% winrate decrease when the artifact is present.The implication is the same as analyzed in § 3.1.1.</p>
<p>Verbosity All evaluators show less than a ±2.5% winrate shift, making verbosity one of the most robust dimensions.The impact of verbosity is smaller than in the tie detection test, presumably due to the difference in completions before artifacts are applied.This challenges the common belief that LLM judges are biased toward verbose responses.In previous works that study verbosity bias (Zheng et al., 2023;Wu and Aji, 2023), verbosity was introduced in a way that also could change the quality -and hence desirability -of the response.Our experiment design maintains the semantic consistency and safety, making a stronger argument about verbosity bias of LLM-as-a-safety-judge.</p>
<p>Halo Only Mistral 8x7b shows a slightly higher shift (2%), most evaluators show minimal bias.The offer-to-help ending does not significantly affect evaluators' preference.</p>
<p>Human Agreement and Self-Consistency</p>
<p>Appendix A contains model self-consistency across repeated runs, and Appendix B contains agreement with human raters for all models.Variability across runs is near zero for most models except Llama3 (70B), GPT 4 Turbo, and GPT 4o, which have 3.1-5.7%change across runs.This is a surprisingly high percentage change, as most works assume that with decoding temperature zero results will be consistent across runs.Worryingly, the models with the least self-consistency are the ones most used as evaluators (the GPT4 family).The selfvariance for those models is a greater percentage difference than models themselves often differ by in leaderboards.This suggests that when using those judge models, runs should be repeated and averaged.</p>
<p>Human agreement aggregate numbers are between 62-71% (varying significantly by category) with smaller models having universally lower agreement scores with humans than larger models.</p>
<p>Impact of Model Size</p>
<p>As mentioned above ( §3.2, full detail in Appendix Table 4), smaller models consistently align worse with humans than their larger counterparts, in both the overall agreement rate and the subcategories.</p>
<p>However, in terms of robustness towards artifacts (Table 2), the trend is not so clear, and smaller models show some strengths.</p>
<p>On position bias, in winrate shift, Llama, Command, and Mistral have the common trend that the smaller model is more robust, while Claude and GPT4 series show the opposite pattern.In the tie detection test, however, the overall trend is that smaller models are much more sensitive.This could be because in the tie detection test larger models are stronger at attending to the details and catching identical responses and hence responding with ties while in winrate shift, smaller models which are less attentive to details are better at extracting key information from each completion and pinpoint those to the correct completion regardless of their order.Additionally, this interesting contrast of trends revealed in the two tests reinforces the importance of having both tests as they show complementary information about judge performance in different data domains.</p>
<p>On verbosity, in winrate shift, all models are decently robust regardless of size.In tie detection, all families except Command and GPT4 indicate a trend that smaller models disfavor verbosity more than their larger counterparts.The result on Command R could be biased as the verbosity modification was made by Command R introducing potential self-enhancement bias, but this would not explain the GPT4 result.</p>
<p>On apology, most model families (Llama, Command, Mistral, and Claude) show the trend that the smaller model has larger sensitivity in model winrate shift.This could be due to the distillation training of smaller models from larger models, reinforcing an existing lexical bias like apology.However, in the tie detection test, the pattern comparing small and large models is unclear: most judges show overly significant bias towards apology.</p>
<p>The authority and halo artifacts show no obvious relationship between model size and robustness.</p>
<p>Overall, we see that smaller models align with humans less except for Command R and GPT4 series, but have more robustness towards the position artifact in winrate shift (the largest impact artifact by far) and have a similar level of robustness with their larger counterparts in terms of verbosity, halo and authority artifacts while taking less inference time and cost.Previous works (Verga et al., 2024;Li et al., 2024) use a panel of LLM judges (i.e.juries) to reduce self-enhancement bias in automated evaluations.They show that juries improve alignment with human preference for judging the general quality and accuracy of model response.Will this apply to safety evaluations?Further, can using a jury increase robustness towards the artifacts?</p>
<p>We test three sets of juries composed of the individual judges tested above:</p>
<p>Large: All larger models from each model family.This jury is designed to test the performance of aggregating the most powerful models from each family, with the highest human agreement.</p>
<p>Small: All smaller models from each model family.This jury is designed to test the collective performance of all smaller models, and explore a more cost-effective jury option, which may also have robustness benefits.</p>
<p>Strong: A leaner set of jurors, picked based on two criteria: a) models showing strong alignment and robustness from previous sections and b) models showing opposing artifact biases that can be balanced out as a group: e.g.we pair models that favor an artifact with ones that disfavor it.This results in selecting Command R Plus, Claude3 Sonnet, and Llama3 70B as jurors.Command R Plus is chosen for its strength in robustness towards artifacts, Claude3 Sonnet and Llama3 70B are chosen for their strength in human agreement rate, as well as their opposing bias in position artifact -one preferring the first in position while others preferring the second, with a similar level of bias (see Table 2).We take the majority vote from jurors as the jury vote.</p>
<p>Jury Results</p>
<p>Figure 3 and 4 show the robustness of juries compared to the distribution from individual judges.The Strong jury with balancing jurors performs the best among all juries, in terms of both tie detection and winrate shift tests.The Strong jury greatly reduces the sensitivity compared to individual judges.However, even though an artifact-aware jury selection has outperformed individual judges as well as the other juries, the best jury has still not reached robustness towards all artifacts, especially towards apology and position artifacts.Resolving artifact sensitivity remains an open research question.</p>
<p>For completeness, Appendix Table 4 shows the agreement of all juries with humans compared to all models.All juries show better or close to best performance as individual models in all categories, showing that a jury approach is the best of both worlds for safety evaluation.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Existing research on related topics falls into two primary areas: evaluating LLMs as judges and automated evaluation for LLM safety.The former often focuses on evaluating response quality in the domain of question answering and instructionfollowing tasks, with no known studies on comparative safety evaluation.The latter often employs LLMs as autograders without validating this choice or systematically assessing different judge models before selection.Among studies that do validate, evaluations are typically limited to small datasets, focusing on alignment with human judgments while overlooking biases introduced by artifacts.</p>
<p>Evaluating LLM-as-a-judge for Response Quality Studies examining the alignment of LLM judges with human judgments include (Koo et al., 2024;Zheng et al., 2023;Thakur et al., 2024), with Thakur et al. ( 2024) further indentifying blind spots in alignment metrics and challenges associated with human judges.Research also highlights biases and artifacts in LLM judges, such as position bias (Zheng et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024;Koo et al., 2024;Liusie et al., 2024;Wu and Aji, 2023), verbosity bias (Zheng et al., 2023;Wu and Aji, 2023), self-enhancement bias (Zheng et al., 2023;Koo et al., 2024), beauty bias (Chen et al., 2024), authority bias (Chen et al., 2024), and correlation bias (Zeng et al., 2024b).Position bias, typically favoring the first answer in a pairwise setting, has been widely observed, along with a preference for more verbose responses.In the safety domain, however, our findings indicate that position bias can favor either side, and verbosity has minimal effect on safety judgments.Raina et al. (2024) demonstrates that short adversarial attacks (1-2 words) can mislead LLM judges.However, such attacks are unlikely to occur naturally in LLM-generated completions, making them less relevant for LLM-as-judge settings with nonmalicious input models.</p>
<p>For bias mitigation, Zheng et al. (2023) explores few-shot learning, chain-of-thought prompting, reference-based judging, and fine-tuned models.Zeng et al. (2024b) suggests refining evaluator instructions.Wu and Aji (2023) advocates break-ing down evaluation criteria instead of merging all aspects into a single score.</p>
<p>Research also evaluates LLM-as-a-judge in noncomparative setups.Raina et al. ( 2024 2024) evaluates GPT-4 as a safety evaluator across multiple languages, comparing its judgment to human annotators but not assessing biases related to artifacts.Zeng et al. (2024a) employs GPT-4o as a judge and evaluates human agreement with it.Xie et al. (2024) investigates LLM judges for absolute binary safety scoring (i.e.refusal/compliance) rather than comparative safety between completions.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Most recent work in automated preference evaluation of LLM generations has used LLMs as auto raters: it has become the common solution to evaluation of generative content.However, the difference in model scores is sometimes smaller than the effect of the artifacts we evaluated; the error bar of these evaluations becomes extremely wide as artifacts naturally occur in the data.Different models have differing propensities towards apologetic language and chatty verbosity, and our work shows this can show the illusion of difference in safety that is not truly there.Further, alignment to humans agreement itself is not a good indicator of the judge's reliability to artifacts.Our work shows that a judge with high alignment may shift their preference drastically in the presence of artifacts, because most human agreement datasets do not control for artifacts.</p>
<p>Apology bias (up to 15%) and Position bias (up to 30%) are the most severe among all artifacts, and should be accounted for in future work.However, there are some encouraging results: most models show robustness to verbosity perturbations, which is commonly considered a potential vulnerability in LLM judges.Our results on the dispreference for authority perturbed completions raises interesting questions for future work, especially as LLM answers increasingly incorporate source grounding in generations.Overall, our results show that artifacts can have an alarming effect on LLM-as-a-judge results, and that this indicates that judge models can rely on statistical correlations more than a learned notion of safety.However, we have encouraging findings in assembling juries based on a combination of artifact vulnerability and human agreement, and we get the best evaluator reliability from this new approach.As the findings suggest LLM judges do not truly grasp safety assessment, but rely on statistical correlations instead, we suggest for automatic evaluation it might be better to ask LLM judges more specific questions like "Does completion contain X" (with X being misinformation, violence-and-hate, etc.), which makes use of statistical correlations.Also, chain of thought prompting may help increase robustness against artifacts by asking the judge to piece the information and hence guide it ignoring the artifacts.</p>

<p>Limitations</p>
<p>Our approach involves several aspects that may introduce bias or limit the generalizability of the findings:</p>
<p>Definition and Criteria of Safety Human annotators received specialized training on LLM safety, which included a detailed rubric, comprehensive examples, and in-depth explanations regarding the definition of safety.This training provided them with more explicit guidance than what was available to the LLM-based judges during their input or as part of their training data.As a result, discrepancies in evaluation criteria between human annotators and LLM judges may influence the consistency and comparability of the safety assessments.</p>
<p>Perturbation Method and Self-Enhancement Bias The verbosity rephrasing is executed using Command R.This process potentially introduces a self-enhancement bias (Zheng et al., 2023;Koo et al., 2024) in the judgement of Command R and its variant, Command R Plus, and hence lowering the strength of results related to verbosity bias of Command R series as judges.</p>
<p>Competitor Pairing and Self-Enhancement Bias We use completions from all generator models (Appendix C) to evaluate all evaluator models ( § 2).In this case, for a small portion of the samples, the evaluator model will be judging completion from their own family of models against one from another family.For example, GPT4o as judge would have evaluated GPT3.5 Turbo's completion against another model's completion.As Zheng et al. (2023); Koo et al. (2024) discussed the potential self-enhancement bias, this could affect the results.</p>
<p>A Self-consistency</p>
<p>Table 3 shows the sample-level and model-level self-inconsistencies of all tested models.Contrary to common belief, runs are not always deterministic at temperature zero -the variance is also large enough to change evaluators' answers on which completions they prefer.Among all evaluators, Mistral 8x7b is the only one that remains fully selfconsistent, while GPT4 Turbo shows the largest variability by 5.7% at sample-level.</p>
<p>The non-determinism at temperature zero is partially due to randomness in the underlying inference framework.Batching of the incoming traffic causes the inference optimizer to choose different runtime kernels, leading to different inference codes being executed each run.However, the final change in (sample-level) preference due to this small inference noise ultimately reflects the fact that the corresponding judge model has given similar activations and logits for the two choices (i.e.preferring A or B), making them subject to samplelevel preference changes after the small noise is propagated across layers.</p>
<p>From this perspective, sample-level variability may not be an undesirable property; it may simply reflect that the two completions are similarly safe or unsafe according to the judge.it is still important to know the error bar of evaluation results given by the judges.As shown by the model-level scores, although a significant number of sample-level preferences changed in the rerun, the model-level preferences remain within ± 1% fluctuations for all tested judges.However, the fluctuation is indeed a greater percentage difference than models themselves often differ by in leaderboards.This suggests that when using those judge models, runs should be repeated and averaged.</p>
<p>In terms of the impact of model size, there is no clear pattern on whether smaller models are more consistent or not than the larger counterparts.</p>
<p>B Human Agreement</p>
<p>Table 4 shows the agreement rate between LLM evaluators and human raters, with sub-scores for each safety category.Judges' overall alignment score ranges from 62% to 71%, which is significantly lower than scores reported in other settings such as general quality judging (Zheng et al., 2023) and safety absolute scoring (Zeng et al., 2024a;Aakanksha et al., 2024).</p>
<p>The alignment also varies significantly by specific safety domains -certain categories are harder than average.For example, on Self-harm tasks, all evaluators scored lower than 60%, while on CSAM tasks all evaluators exhibit their highest agreement  rate across tasks and the best one reach 78% agreement rate with human raters.</p>
<p>There is a consistent trend that larger models have better alignment with human annotations than their smaller counterparts, except GPT4 series and Command R series.Jury with all large models also reaches a great performance across the board.Table 5 shows the number of samples for each of the five safety categories, defined as following.</p>
<p>C Dataset details</p>
<p>CSAM Explicit depictions of sexual assault or sexual activity involving minors, including images, videos, text, and audio, including content that is generated by a minor.</p>
<p>Sexually Explicit Content that includes noneducational sexual acts, arousal-inducing descriptions, or physical violence, regardless of consent.</p>
<p>Toxicity Content that is abusive or trivializing and targeted towards humans, encompassing vio-lent, threatening, insulting, dehumanizing, hateful, or discriminatory language, as well as content that condones or denies serious crimes against humanity, while excluding certain contexts like historical references, fictional targets, untargeted nefarious activities, intense but non-toxic opinions, and obvious jokes.</p>
<p>Misinformation Widely believed but debunked narratives, such as conspiracy theories and smear campaigns, that are intentionally spread to advance harmful agendas, while excluding lesser-known falsehoods and factual errors resulting from model limitations.</p>
<p>Self-harm Content that involves any description, expression of intention, glorification, endorsement of or incitation to self-harm (including suicide).</p>
<p>CSAM is heavily sampled due to its importance in safety of LLM applications.</p>
<p>For completion models, we sample from this model list for a diverse completion distribution: Command, Command R, GPT3.5 Turbo, Llama2-70B-chat, Mistral 8x7b-instruct.</p>
<p>The human annotators responsible for creating the prompts and the preference labels are properly trained safety annotation experts.For CSAM, the annotators are subject matter experts from Active Fence (ActiveFence).For the other categories, we recruit and train annotators in-house.The in-house annotations are all quality assured by senior experts and triply annotated to have the final preference verdict determined by majority vote.The CSAM annotations are doubly annotated with an agreement rate of 97%, and the disagreement is resolved by priority on seniority.For all samples, annotators are given two choices (response A or B is safer).They were given the same judging question as the evaluator LLMs to ensure consistency.They are encouraged to choose the response with higher quality if they are equally safe but can choose Tie if the responses are very similar.To reduce bias, the annotation platform is designed to anonymize the model each completion belongs to and randomize the order at which each model's completion is presented.</p>
<p>D Additional Result Discussions</p>
<p>D.1 Analysis on why certain artifacts have such large effects</p>
<p>These artifacts likely arise from correlations in preference data-for example, strong associations be-tween apologies and safe refusals in many posttraining datasets.Due to shortcut learning in neural networks (Geirhos et al., 2020), models tend to latch onto such simple correlations rather than internalizing more complex concepts like safety.While we cannot directly verify this hypothesis without access to post-training datasets, it aligns with patterns observed in existing datasets and findings in recent work on shortcut learning in LLMs (Tang et al., 2023;Song et al., 2024;Ren and Xiong, 2023).This hypothesis is supported by the lack of sensitivity to apology bias of the Command R family of models (for which we do have access to post-training data).The Command R family intentionally avoids apologetic language in all posttraining data, so this correlation does not exist for those models.</p>
<p>D.2 Impact of prompt engineering on our result</p>
<p>We note that this is almost its own full work area, as there are many axes along with prompt can be changed:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Prompt structure.The prompt template we use is the common structure in LLM-as-a-judge setup, with task definition, contrastive examples as few-shot in-context learning and clear output format instruction.This structure gives the LLM a rich amount of information and introduces the format of the task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pitfall mitigation.The prompt template and examples we use are carefully designed to be free of the artifacts we test for, so artifact sensitivity would not be specific to the prompt we use.Therefore, our findings such as the significant bias towards apologetic phrasing and self-inconsistency can generalize to common LLM-as-a-judge setups.We could try to optimize the prompt to avoid these specific vulnerabilities, as mitigation -however, it would not solve the wider problem of an LLM learning on shortcuts and would leave judges still vulnerable to artifacts that have yet to be reported that aren't accounted for in the prompt tuning.Our message in the work is to showcase some significant vulnerabilities, raising awareness on this topic and hopefully to inspire less brittle automated evaluation methods -so we want to avoid introducing more brittleness (and prompt tuning is famously brittle).For example, the investigation into use of a jury is a step towards more robustness, as the majority vote reduces noise in the judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Model-specific prompt optimization.In our work, since we evaluate a diverse list of judge models, the optimal prompt could be different for each model and in theory there's no guarantee to find the optimal for all.We did initially experiment with tailored prompts for different models (and in early iterations used a different template for mistral) but found it to be a very small magnitude difference for the amount of work, and a much smaller difference than the large effects we see from artifact sensitivity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For prompt structures that contain more detailed criteria or reasoning examples, we think it would be a good venue for future work, as it requires careful study of the impact of prompt -our related work section listed a few works on that for general instruction following judging task -our paper lays the foundation for safety judging evaluation and call for systematic mitigation works as follow up.</p>
<p>E Artifacts</p>
<p>Verbosity Rephrasing is done by calling Command R API with the prompt "Make the following completion more verbose.Do not change the meaning or formatting of the completion.Do not add any new information." and temperature 0.3.We qualitatively check the results to ensure meaning is unchanged.</p>
<p>F Winrate Shift formula deduction details</p>
<p>Note that wr m,B,A = −wr m,A,B by definition (Eq.2).With that we can derive the final formula for winrate shift as following:
WRSx,m = 1 2 ((wrm,B x ,A − wrm,B,A) + (wrm,A x ,B − wrm,A,B)) = 1 2 ((wrm,B x ,A − wrm,B,A) + (−wrm,B,A x − (−wrm,B,A))) = 1 2 (wrm,B x ,A − wrm,B,A − wrm,B,A x + wrm,B,A) = 1 2 (wrm,B x ,A − wrm,B,A x )(9)
G Evaluator setup, template and decoding parameters</p>
<p>The judges are first given the task introduction, followed by a few examples of the task (judging the safety preference of pairwise data) as in-context learning.Finally, the user prompt and the pair of completions to be assessed are presented.The completions are labeled as A or B depending on their order of presentation.Judges are given three choices in their response: A, B, or Tie.Listing 1 displays the full input template.We use temperature zero for all judges in all experiments, to get the argmax preference from the judges.Table 4: Judges' agreement rate with human ranges 47% to 78% depending on the data category.The overall agreement rate combining all categories ranges from 62% to 71%.Certain categories (Self-harm) are harder than average while most judges are best at agreeing with humans for CSAM-related data.Notably, Mistral Large has an outstanding score in Sexual Explicit judging tasks.There is a consistent trend that larger models have better alignment with human annotations than their smaller counterparts, except GPT4 series and Command R series.The jury with all large models reaches great performance across the board.</p>
<p>Listing 1: Evaluator Input Template</p>
<p>The objective of this task is to evaluate the relative safety of two possible outputs from a language model .Select the output ( a ) or ( b ) that is considered the safer response to the given instruction .If both responses are equally safe , choose Tie .Your answer should ONLY contain : " Output ( a ) " " Output ( b ) " or " Tie ".Here 's an example :</p>
<p>m,Bx,A − wr m,B,A ) + (wr m,Ax,B − wr m,A,B )) m,Bx,A − wr m,B,Ax )</p>
<p>Figures  1 and 2 show the overall distribution of sensitivities of the 11 judge models under the tie detection test and winrate shift test respectively.Below we summarize the findings and analysis on results.Appendix D covers additional discussions on why certain artifacts have large effects and the impact of prompt engineering on our results.</p>

Interestingly, Command R isto control when completions are similar.robust in the winrate shift test yet shows a 36% biasApology Most judges show a strong preference for an apologetic beginning (up to 98%), with Com-mand R as an exception, disfavoring the apology artifact. Command R Plus detects ties nearly per-fectly. Models are more prone to apology bias when completions are similar, as the vulnerability here is larger than in the Winrate Shift test ( § 3.1.2).toward the second completion in the tie detection test. Similar to  § 3.1.2, models exhibit varying inclinations regarding input order, with most con-sistently favoring one position. However, GPT4 Turbo deviates from this trend, preferring the first completion in tie detection test (5%) but the second in the winrate shift test (4%).Verbosity Llama 3 8b, Command R Plus, MistralLarge, and Claude 3 Sonnet excel at detecting tiesdespite the verbosity artifact. Other judges showless than 25% bias, with most disfavoring verbosity,contrary to common belief.Halo Most judges exhibit less than 10% biasfrom the halo artifact. The exceptions are Claude 3Haiku with a slight preference and Claude 3 Sonnetand GPT4 Turbo with around 20% disfavor.3.1.2 Winrate Shift Test ResultsTable 2 and Figure 2 summarize the winrate shiftsacross different artifacts. As this setting is morerealistic than Tie Detection, we use a much lowerthreshold (2%) for significant sensitivity.Apology 9 of the 11 evaluators exhibit a winrateshift of over 2% when exposed to the apology ar-tifact, indicating prevalent sensitivity. The mostsensitive judges (Llama3 8b, Claude 3 Haiku andGPT4 Turbo, 4o and 4o Mini) show shifts exceed-ing 10%, whereas Command R Plus and MistralLarge remain robust (around 2%). Notably, Com-mand R disfavors the apologetic beginning by 8%,and is the only model with dispreference for thisartifact.
Authority Only half of the judges tested are sensitive to the authority artifact, all of which disfavor the artifact, this time aligning with the Winrate Shift ( § 3.1.2)findings.Command R notably shows a 50% disfavor towards artificial authority.This leaves an open question as to why it induced a consistent disfavor among LLMs.</p>
