                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Recent progress in o1-like models has significantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), empowering them to tackle increasingly complex tasks through reflection capabilities, such as making assumptions, backtracking, and self-refinement. However, effectively evaluating such reflection capabilities remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce LR 2 Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the L ong-chain R eflective R easoning capabilities of LLMs. LR 2 Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints. Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluation on both conventional models and o1-like models. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced reasoning-specific models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with tasks in LR 2 Bench, achieving an average Exact Match score of only 20.0% and 23.6%, respectively. These findings under-score the significant room for improvement in the reflective reasoning capabilities of current LLMs. The leaderboard of our benchmark</p>

<p>LR 2 Bench: Evaluating Long-chain Reflective Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models via Constraint Satisfaction Problems

Recent progress in o1-like models has significantly enhanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), empowering them to tackle increasingly complex tasks through reflection capabilities, such as making assumptions, backtracking, and self-refinement.However, effectively evaluating such reflection capabilities remains challenging due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks.To bridge this gap, we introduce LR 2 Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the Long-chain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs.LR 2 Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints.Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios.We conduct extensive evaluation on both conventional models and o1-like models.Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced reasoning-specific models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with tasks in LR 2 Bench, achieving an average Exact Match score of only 20.0% and 23.6%, respectively.These findings underscore the significant room for improvement in the reflective reasoning capabilities of current LLMs.The leaderboard of our benchmark is available at https://huggingface. co/spaces/UltraRonin/LR2Bench.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by o1-like models (OpenAI, 2024a;Qwen, 2024;Guo et al., 2025), have demonstrated substantial progress in their reasoning capabilities.These models exhibit more human-like behaviors, such as making assumptions, verification, backtracking, and self-correction, enabling *</p>

<p>Please solve the Sudoku: [ [0,3,0,1], [0,0,4,0], [0,2,0,0], [3,0,1,0]] Let's tackle this 4 × 4 Sudoku step by step.... ...</p>
<p>Step 7: Assume a value for cell (0, 0) and proceed.</p>
<p>Cell (0,0): possible 2 or 4 Let's assume cell(0, 0)=2.... ... But we have cell (0,2)=4 and cell(1, 2)=4, which is invalid because columns must have unique numbers.</p>
<p>Therefore, my assumption that cell(0, 0)=2 is incorrect.</p>
<p>Step 8: Set cell(0, 0)=4.... ...</p>
<p>• Make Assumptions • Trial and Error • Backtracking and Reflection</p>
<p>Figure 1: The response demonstrates the model's reflective reasoning process while solving a Sudoku problem.them to address increasingly complex challenges across various domains (Zhong et al., 2024;Wu et al., 2024;Gao et al., 2024;Wang et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Despite this progress, the reflection capabilities of LLMs remain largely unexplored.Reflection can be defined as the process of engaging in attentive, critical, exploratory, and iterative self-interactions with one's thoughts, actions, and underlying conceptual frameworks (Nguyen et al., 2014).Existing research predominantly focuses on evaluating LLMs' abilities to utilize explicit feedback for selfcriticism or self-refinement (Li et al., 2024b;Lan et al., 2024;Gou et al., 2024;Sun et al., 2024;Lin et al., 2024).However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: Can LLMs spontaneously engage in the whole reflection process to solve more complex tasks?Reflection is not simply about reacting to feedback.It also encompasses exploring possible solutions, assessing and adjusting strategies, and adapting when confronted with contradiction.To better understand how LLMs might engage in these capabilities, we consider Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs).CSPs are defined as a set of variables whose state must satisfy specific constraints, which inherently require iterative exploration in a large search space without predefined solution paths (Dechter, 2003).As shown in Figure 1, the response of QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024) to Sudoku, a classic CSP, exemplifies a typical reflection process.This task presents a scenario with row, column, and grid constraints, requiring iterative trial-and-error to determine valid values for each cell.The model initially makes an assumption, then identifies a conflict, and finally backtracks to correct its initial guess.This demonstrates an effective reflective reasoning process often absent from standard NLP tasks, such as summarization, translation, and question-answering.Therefore, to systematically investigate reflective reasoning in LLMs, we propose LR2 Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the Longchain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs.LR 2 Bench consists of six CSPs: Crossword, Acrostic, Logic Puzzle, Cryptogram, Sudoku, and Drop Quote.Each task necessitates reflection processes and emphasizes specific constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based constraints, logical constraints, and spatial constraints, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of LLMs' reflective reasoning capabilities across diverse problem-solving scenarios.We manually collect and annotate a total of 850 examples spanning multiple difficulty levels across all task types.Through extensive experiments on both convention and o1-like models, we observe that even current top-performed reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1 and o1-preview) struggle to complete tasks in LR 2 Bench, underscoring substantial room for improvement in this critical area.Further-more, most conventional models exhibit inferior performance than o1-like models and achieve nearzero sample-level accuracy in LR 2 Bench, highlighting the essential role of reflective reasoning skills in tackling the challenges posed by our benchmark.</p>
<p>Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1) We introduce LR 2 Bench, a novel benchmark with six tasks and diverse difficulty levels, designed to evaluate the long-chain reflective reasoning capabilities of LLMs.2) We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of reflective reasoning capabilities in both conventional and reasoning-specific LLMs.3) We present a detailed analysis of the limitations exhibited by current LLMs on LR 2 Bench, establishing a foundation for future research on the development of advanced reasoning models.</p>

<p>We first introduce the task descriptions and collection methods for all tasks in LR 2 Bench.For detailed information, please refer to Appendix A.</p>
<p>Crossword The Crossword task requires inferring correct words from given clues and filling them into a grid.A key challenge lies in satisfying the constraint of shared letter intersections between horizontal and vertical words.We collected 150 Crossword samples published in 2024 from Los Angeles Times1 and Vulture 2 in three sizes: 5 × 5, 10 × 10, and 15 × 15, with 50 ones for each size.Acrostic The Acrostic task involves word clues like Crossword, but its objective is to form a hidden quotation or sentence from the answers to the clues.This requires that the answer words not only satisfy the corresponding clues but also effectively integrate to construct the ultimate hidden message.We collected 50 easy and 50 hard Acrostic samples from Printable Puzzles3 with timestamps ranging from September 2024 to December 2024.</p>
<p>Logic Puzzle</p>
<p>The Logic Puzzle task constitutes a problem that necessitates logical reasoning to deduce relationships between a set of entities based on the given constraints and clues.The objective is to systematically analyze the given information, employing techniques such as hypothesis formation, elimination, and deductive inference, to determine a unique solution that satisfies all given constraints.We collected 50 puzzles for each of the four sizes (4 × 4, 4 × 5, 4 × 6, and 4 × 7) from Printable Puzzles4 , with timestamps ranging from September 2024 to December 2024.</p>
<p>Cryptogram</p>
<p>The Cryptogram task involves the decryption of an encrypted quotation or sentence, where each letter of an original text is substituted with another, resulting in an apparently nonsense text.Decryption requires identifying patterns, com-mon letter frequencies, and word structures to deduce the letter-to-letter correspondences, ultimately reconstructing the original content.We collected 50 easy and 50 hard samples from Printable Puzzles 5 with timestamps ranging from September 2024 to December 2024.</p>
<p>Sudoku</p>
<p>The Sudoku task consists of filling a n 2 × n 2 grid with digits from 1 to n 2 , subject to the constraint that each row, column, and n×n subgrid contains all digits from 1 to n 2 without repetition.Success in Sudoku relies on logical deduction and careful consideration of the existing digits to determine valid placements for the remaining numbers.From 1sudoku6 , we collected 200 Sudoku samples in total: 50 easy and 50 hard samples for both 4 × 4 and 9 × 9 sizes.</p>
<p>Drop Quote</p>
<p>The Drop Quote task comprises a grid of multiple rows and columns, with each column providing a set of candidate letters.The task requires determining the correct row for letters in each column, effectively "dropping" it into target place to reveal the hidden quotation.We created 50 easy samples by manually compiling common quotations, and collected 50 hard samples from Printable Puzzles 7 , with timestamps ranging from September 2024 to December 2024.</p>
<p>Diverse Scenarios</p>
<p>Each type of task within LR 2 Bench focuses on different constraint patterns, providing a comprehensive framework to evaluate models' reflective reasoning capabilities across diverse scenarios.We further explore the varying capabilities required for completing the tasks in LR 2 Bench.</p>
<p>Reflection Reflection is the most fundamental capability for tackling the complex tasks in LR 2 Bench.Unlike simple problems with shortcut solutions, these tasks are inherently iterative, demanding the exploration of multiple possibilities, identification of dead ends, and adaptive revision of initial hypotheses.Such reflective reasoning capabilities enable a thorough analysis and refinement of strategies, ultimately leading to more robust and effective solutions.</p>
<p>Long-chain Generation LR 2 Bench incorporates tasks that necessitate long-chain generation, a crucial capability for LLMs to tackle complex reasoning problems.Unlike tasks with simple and isolated answers, these tasks require LLMs to generate a long chain of steps or decisions that build upon each other toward a final solution.</p>
<p>Knowledge-based Reasoning Both Crossword and Acrostic tasks demand broad world knowledge and commonsense reasoning abilities since the clue answers often hinge on cultural references, idiomatic expressions, and diverse factual domains.Additionally, the Cryptogram and Drop Quote tasks require knowledge of typical phrase structures and common linguistic patterns to decode messages or reconstruct quotations effectively.</p>
<p>Logical Reasoning</p>
<p>The logical reasoning ability is essential across various tasks, especially evident in the Logic Puzzles and Sudoku.These tasks involve information integration and systematic application of deductive reasoning to solve problems constrained by specific rules.</p>
<p>Spatial Reasoning</p>
<p>While not the primary focus for all tasks, spatial reasoning also emerges as a critical capability within LR 2 Bench, particularly in tasks with grids.For Crossword, considering letter intersections across horizontal and vertical placements is crucial.Similarly, in Sudoku, effective digit placement requires reasoning about row, column, and subgrid constraints, all of which involve spatial relationships within the grid.</p>
<p>Data Annotation and Statistics</p>
<p>For PDF data collected from websites, we manually convert key elements in task samples into a structured text format suitable for LLMs' inputs.Then, we manually craft task-specific instructions, including problem definitions and rules, to provide LLMs with the necessary guidance to process each task effectively.To further control the output format of LLMs, we manually construct two simple shots for each type of task to facilitate subsequent answer extraction and evaluation.Table 1 presents all tasks in LR 2 Bench along with their attributes.Appendix A shows the text-format task examples.Appendix B shows the detailed instructions and few-shot examples for each type of task.</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics</p>
<p>Since all the tasks in LR 2 Bench consist of multiple subtasks (e.g., words inference in Crossword, cells completion in Sudoku), we employ fine-grained, subtask-level evaluation metrics.Given a problem with N subtasks, let G = {g 1 , . . ., g N } and P = {p 1 , . . ., p N } denote the ground truth and LLMgenerated answers for each subtask, respectively.We define the following evaluation metrics:</p>
<p>Completion Ratio The Completion Ratio (CR) metric measures the proportion of subtasks within a given problem that LLMs successfully complete, regardless of the correctness of the answers.CR is calculated as follows:
CR = 1 N N i=1 I(p i ̸ = ∅)(1)
where I(p i ̸ = ∅) equals 1 if subtask i is completed (i.e., p i is not empty) and 0 otherwise.In our experiments, we observe that some models struggle to produce a complete reasoning chain and fail to reach the final answer for each subtask.Therefore, we propose CR to measure the long reasoning chain generation capability of LLMs.</p>
<p>Exact Match The Exact Match (EM) metric employs a strict correctness criterion: for each subtask, the generated answer by LLMs must exactly match the ground truth.EM is calculated as follows:
EM = I 1 N N i=1 I(p i = g i ) = 1.0(2)
This metric is crucial for evaluating the absolute accuracy on individual samples.For example, in a Sudoku task, EM would require that the completed grid be identical to the ground truth, with no errors in any row, column, or subgrid.</p>
<p>Partial Match To mitigate the strictness of EM, we employ a Partial Match metric (PM-0.5).This metric relaxes the requirement for a perfect match: one LLM-generated answer is considered correct under PM-0.5 if at least 50% of its subtasks are correct.PM-0.5 is calculated as follows:
PM-0.5 = I 1 N N i=1 I(p i = g i ) ≥ 0.5(3)
Subtask Accuracy For more fine-grained evaluation, we propose Subtask Accuracy (S-Acc), which calculates the proportion of correctly solved subtasks compared to the ground truth:
S-Acc = 1 N N i=1 I(p i = g i )(4)
By considering both S-Acc and EM, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of model performance across complex reasoning tasks.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Experimental Setup Evaluated Models</p>
<p>We evaluate 11 open-source models and 5 closed-source models.Specifically, we include leading o1-like models: QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024), DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking(Deep-Mind, 2024b), OpenAI o1-mini and o1-preview (OpenAI, 2024a).Please refer to Appendix C for detailed information of all selected models.</p>
<p>Implementation Details We utilize the default prompt templates for all LLMs.Appendix A and B show detailed problem formats, instructions, and few-shot examples for each type of task.To facilitate evaluation, we wrap answers within specific tags (e.g., <Answer> and </Answer>) in the few-shot examples.This enables precise answer extraction from the model responses.We use the vLLM inference framework (Kwon et al., 2023) and employ greedy sampling with temperature = 0 to minimize randomness, except for o1-mini and o1-preview which have an inherent temperature of 1.The maximum sequence length is set to the default maximum value for each model.</p>
<p>Main Results</p>
<p>Table 2 presents the average performance across six tasks on LR 2 Bench, with individual task results detailed in Table 3.As shown in Table 2, a significant gap persists between EM and other evaluation metrics across all models.This observation indicates that while LLMs can address specific aspects of a given task, achieving a complete and accurate solution remains a significant challenge.Moreover, closedsource models generally exhibit superior performance across key metrics (S-Acc, EM, and PM-0.5) to open-source models, with o1-preview achieving the best EM score of 23.6%.DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the most advanced reasoning capabilities among open-source models and even achieves a comparable EM score of 20.0% to o1-preview.Notably, there also exists a great performance gap between conventional models and o1-like models.Although GPT-4o shows the second-highest S-Acc, it lags significantly behind the top-performing model o1-preview in EM.This highlights the effectiveness of the "slow thinking" approaches which trade better performance with more inference tokens.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>Task Difficulty</p>
<p>We present the detailed model performance across varying difficulty for all six tasks in Appendix D. Here, we focus on the Logic Puzzle, illustrating the impact of increasing problem complexity.Figure 3 Table 3: Performance (%) of LLMs on six tasks.The best and second-best results are highlighted in bold and underlined, respectively."Tokens" denotes the average number of generated tokens.shows the performance of GPT-4o and o1-preview under different difficulty levels.The substantial performance gap between the two models demonstrates o1-preview's superior logical deduction and reflective reasoning abilities.As the solution space expands from 4 × 4 to 4 × 7, while models can still solve part of the problem, they fail to find the complete solution.This highlights the challenge of exploring exponentially increasing solution spaces for complex reasoning tasks.</p>
<p>Long Reasoning Chain Generation</p>
<p>Tasks in LR 2 Bench often involve multiple subtasks (e.g., solving all clues for Crossword, inferring the digits for each cell for Sudoku).Such inherent complexity requires LLMs to continuously explore quite large solution spaces through reflective reasoning processes thus presenting a significant challenge for LLMs in generating long reasoning chains.As shown in Table 2, many models failed to completely generate the entire reasoning process, resulting in low CR scores.Through analysis of incomplete model responses, we find that a key obstacle to this phenomenon is the tendency of LLMs to generate repetitive content, ultimately reaching the maximum sequence length.This redundancy primarily occurs when LLMs encounter contradictions (see Section 4.4 for a detailed analysis).Such redundancy wastes valuable context window size, preventing the model from exploring the full solution space and completing further reasoning processes.To quantify this, we calculate the average 10-gram redundancy ratio of the models' responses across all tasks in LR 2 Bench, excluding Sudoku due to its inherently repetitive cell-by-cell reasoning strategy.Figure 4 reveals a strong negative correlation between redundancy and CR, suggesting that redundant generation is a key factor limiting the long-chain reasoning capability of LLMs.Notably, QwQ-32B-Preview shows lower redundancy but still fails in completion due to its endless trial-and-error without reaching a meaningful conclusion.</p>
<p>Conventional Models vs. o1-like Models</p>
<p>As shown in Table 3, for Crossword and Acrostic tasks, we observe that conventional models can achieve high S-Acc and PM-0.5, but nearly zero EM.This suggests that LLMs with strong commonsense reasoning abilities can correctly infer parts of words from the provided clues.However, some clues may have multiple valid answers, requiring LLMs to determine the final answers based on the constraint of shared letters with other words.Therefore, the lack of reflective reasoning prevents these models from achieving perfect solutions.Besides, GPT-4o performs better than o1-mini on these tasks, suggesting that only models possessing both capabilities can achieve high EM scores.</p>
<p>For tasks that heavily rely on reflection capabilities, such as Logic Puzzle and Sudoku, the performance gap between o1-like models and conventional models is the most obvious.Notably, o1-preview outperforms GPT-4o by 37.5% and 35.5% and QwQ-32B-Preview outperforms Qwen-2.5-70B-Instructby 19.5% and 26.0% on EM for
GPT-4o o1-preview Mistral-Large Qwen-2.5-72B Gemini-2.0-thinking Mistral-7B Qwen-2.5-7B QwQ-32B Gemini-2.0 Llama-3.1-70B Llama-3.1-7B</p>
<p>Redundancy-CR</p>
<p>Figure 4: The relationship between redundancy and CR across different models.</p>
<p>these two tasks, respectively.These substantial gains highlight the significant advantage of o1-like models in tasks that require verifying multiple constraints and employing backtracking mechanisms.</p>
<p>In contrast, conventional models often exhibit limitations with their single-pass reasoning paradigm.This approach proves inadequate for scenarios requiring exploration of alternative solution paths or correction of initial assumptions.</p>
<p>Cryptogram and Drop Quote pose the most significant challenges for all evaluated models.We attribute this difficulty to the expansive search space and limited helpful clues inherent in these problems.In the Cryptogram, each letter has theoretically 26 possible substitutions.Similarly, in Drop Quote, each letter within a given column can be dropped to any row.This contrasts with Logic Puzzles and Sudoku, which offer strong constraints that effectively reduce the search space.Even the most advanced model o1-preview struggles to complete these tasks with only a 13% EM score.</p>
<p>Qualitative Analysis</p>
<p>We analyze several typical behaviors of LLMs leading to the failure in completing our benchmark and provide detailed cases in Appendix E.</p>
<p>Lack of Reflection Mechanism</p>
<p>This deficiency mainly occurs in conventional models.Taking the Logic Puzzle for example, our analysis of GPT-4o's responses in Appendix E.1 reveals that although the model can effectively break down individual clues and generate initial deductions, it fails to perform the iterative cross-checking to ensure consistency with all established constraints.These shortages indicate that conventional models lack the reflective reasoning capabilities necessary to solve complex constraint satisfaction problems.</p>
<p>Stuck in Contradictions</p>
<p>We observe that LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks when confronted with contradictions.As shown in Appendix E.2, this phenomenon mainly manifests as looping within similar sentences, repeatedly stating conflicting information without making progress toward a coherent resolution.Instead of backtracking and revising previous assumptions upon encountering a contradiction, they tend to focus only on the conflicting points.This narrow focus prevents them from exploring alternative solution paths.</p>
<p>Give-up Moment As illustrated in Appendix E.3, the occurrence of a "Give-up Moment" is observed when reasoning-specific LLMs struggle with complex problems due to the time (inference tokens) constraint.We focus on one of the worstperforming tasks Cryptogram to quantify this giveup ratio in QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1 responses, respectively.We manually review 50 responses from each model on Cryptogram.For QwQ-32B, 15 out of 50 responses are incomplete due to the maximum context window size of 32k.26 out of 50 responses show model's give-up and only provide part of the answers.Similarly, for DeepSeek-R1, 39 out of 50 responses compromise to give the most possible answers given the time constraints.This highlights the challenges posed by problems requiring extensive reflective reasoning and suggests a potential bottleneck in the current capabilities of even the leading reasoning LLMs.</p>
<p>Future Directions for o1-like LLMs</p>
<p>Addressing the limitations highlighted in our qualitative analysis suggests several key directions for future o1-like LLM development:</p>
<p>Reasoning Paradigm Transformation Conventional LLMs fail in solving complex CSPs in LR 2 Bench due to the lack of reflection mechanisms.This suggests the importance of enabling LLMs to perform iterative, multi-step reflective reasoning processes.Future research would shift the focus from linear reasoning chains to dynamic, reflective thinking paradigms.</p>
<p>Reasoning Adaptation Current LLMs often employ a uniform reasoning strategy regardless of problem complexity or type.Future research should prioritize developing adaptive mechanisms that allow LLMs to dynamically adjust their reasoning processes based on specific problems.Simpler problems may only require a straightforward approach, while complex problems necessitate a more deliberate, multi-step, and reflective process.Furthermore, different tasks may demand distinct reasoning approaches.LLMs should be able to determine the type of reasoning required (e.g., logical, mathematical, commonsense) and adjust their strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>Enhancing Reflection Mechanisms Although leading o1-like LLMs have possessed reflective reasoning capabilities, they struggle to effectively utilize them when confronted with contradictions.Future development should focus on enabling models to recognize inconsistencies and pivot towards alternative hypotheses, emphasizing flexibility and exploration of different reasoning trajectories rather than fixation on conflicting information.</p>
<p>Improving Reasoning Efficiency Current o1like models tend to generate lengthy reasoning chains when tackling complex problems, leading to significant inference costs.Future work could prioritize optimizing these reasoning chains to achieve greater efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.</p>
<p>5 Related Work</p>
<p>Reflection Capabilities of LLMs</p>
<p>The impressive reasoning capabilities of LLMs have naturally led to increased interest in reflection, a more sophisticated and human-like form of reasoning.Previous studies primarily focus on evaluating LLMs' abilities to rectify their response based on explicit feedback, including self-improvement with critique prompts (Lan et al., 2024;Li et al., 2024a;Lin et al., 2024;Li et al., 2024b;Madaan et al., 2024), leveraging external tools such as code interpreters or search engines (Gou et al., 2024;Chen et al., 2024;Shinn et al., 2024), and engaging in multi-LLM interaction through debating (Liang et al., 2024;Huang et al., 2024).However, these works mainly evaluate LLMs' behaviors in response to feedback.They fail to assess LLMs' capabilities to spontaneously engage in the complete reflection process for complex reasoning tasks.Our proposed LR 2 Bench provides scenarios necessitating capabilities, such as making assumptions, verification, backtracking, and self-refinement, thus filling a critical gap in evaluating LLMs' intrinsic reflective reasoning abilities.</p>
<p>Puzzle-solving for LLMs</p>
<p>Puzzle-solving (Giadikiaroglou et al., 2024) offers valuable insight for evaluating the complex reasoning capabilities of LLMs across diverse scenarios.Ishay et al. (2023) (Kazemi et al., 2024), Chess (Feng et al., 2024) and social games (Light et al.;Wang et al., 2023;Xu et al., 2023).However, these studies primarily leverage external tools or specialized algorithms to develop task-specific solutions within limited puzzle domains.In contrast, LR 2 Bench provides diverse tasks and difficulty levels and focuses on evaluating the intrinsic reflective reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This paper introduces LR 2 Bench, a novel benchmark to comprehensively evaluate the reflection capabilities of LLMs in long-chain reasoning.LR 2 Bench comprises six tasks with varying difficulty levels, providing a thorough analysis across diverse scenarios.The experimental results show that o1-like models outperform conventional models, demonstrating their superior performance on reflective reasoning.Our findings also highlight the limitation of current reasoning LLMs and reveal that even the most advanced reasoning models fall short of achieving satisfactory performance, suggesting significant room for enhancement in reflective reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>The limitations of our work can be summarized as follows: Firstly, due to the scarcity of well-defined real-world constraint satisfaction problems, we relied on puzzle-like data for evaluating LLMs' reflective reasoning capabilities.Secondly, the inherent complexity and verbosity of LLM-generated responses to these complex reasoning tasks posed challenges for more fine-grained analysis.We only analyze several typical phenomena of current leading models rather than conducting a more detailed analysis of specific reflective reasoning processes.</p>

<p>B.1 Crossword</p>
<p>Prompt for Crossword [Task Description]</p>
<p>A Crossword puzzle is a word game that consists of a grid, with clues given for words that fit into the grid both across (horizontally) and down (vertically).Your goal is to fill in the grid with words based on the clues provided.Here's a detailed explanation of how the game works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the Grid Layout The grid is made up of numbers, hashtags ("#"), and question marks ("?").</li>
</ol>
<p>Hashtag ("#") acts as a separator between words.</p>
<p>The number represents the starting points of Across and Down words.Question mark ("?") represents part of words but don't start a new word.</p>
<p>Read the Clues</p>
<p>Clues are provided for each word to be filled into the grid, split into two categories: Across clues (these are for words that go horizontally in the grid) and Down clues (these are for words that go vertically in the grid).</p>
<p>The number in brackets after the clue indicates the length of the word.</p>
<p>Clues are often short definitions, synonyms, or phrases related to the word.Some clues may involve wordplay, anagrams, or puns, depending on the puzzle's difficulty and style.</p>
<p>Solve the Puzzle</p>
<p>Think of words that fit the clue and match the number of letters specified.</p>
<p>For example, if a clue says "Animal that barks (3)", you might guess "DOG" because it has 3 letters.</p>
<p>When getting the answer, double-check that it fits the clue, both in meaning and the number of letters.If you make a mistake, just try again!As you fill in answers, they will help you solve other clues, since words intersect and share letters in the grid.This cross-checking mechanism helps in verifying correct answers.</p>
<p>[Example 1]</p>
<p>Here is a Crossword puzzle: GRID: # 1 2 3 4 5 ????6 ????7 ????# 8 ??# CLUES: Across: 1 "More ___ you'll ever know" (4) 5 Divine favor, in Christianity (5) 6 Sisters who might be sitters (5) 7 Portly-sounding beer (5) 8 Cool and stylish (3) Down: 1 "The ___ will set you free.But not until it is finished with you": David Foster Wallace ( 5) 2 Capital of Vietnam (5) 3 Misbehave (5) 4 Prepare for a new baby, say (4) 5 Fuel for some stoves (3)

<p>B.2 Acrostic</p>
<p>Prompt for Acrostic [Task Description]</p>
<p>An Acrostic puzzle is a word game that consists of two main parts: a grid and a set of clues.The objective is to fill in the grid with letters from the answers to the clues, forming a hidden quotation or sentence.Here's a detailed explanation of how the game works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Understand the Grid Layout The grid is made up of numbers, hashtags ("#"), and punctuations.Hashtag ("#") acts as space separator between words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each number corresponds to a specific letter in a word.The hidden quotation or sentence is formed by filling in the grid with the correct letters.</p>
<p>Read the Clues</p>
<p>Each clue is made up of a string of numbers and a clue text.</p>
<p>The clue text is usually a short definition, synonym or phrase related to the answer word or phrase.</p>
<p>The number of words and letters of the answer are given in brackets after the clue text.</p>
<p>The string of numbers provided indicates the specific position of each letter of the answer in the grid.</p>
<p>Solve the Puzzle</p>
<p>Think of answers that fit the clue and match the number of words and letters specified.</p>
<p>For example, if a clue says "Animal that barks (1 word, 3 letters)", you might guess "DOG" because it has 3 letters.When getting the answer, double-check that it fits the clue, both in meaning and the number of letters.If you make a mistake, just try again!As you fill in the letters of answers, these letters can be part of the hidden word in the grid, thus providing hints for the left letters of this word.This mechanism can help both verify your answers and solve difficult clues.</p>
<p>For example, if the puzzle looks like this: "... # 5 6 7 # ..." and you have already got {5: 'A', 7: 'D'}, you can guess that the word is "AND" and get {6: 'N'} without its corresponding clue.Don't be afraid to skip a tough clue and come back to it later.</p>
<p>As you fill in the grid, you will reveal part of the hidden words.Use this information to help solve the remaining clues.</p>

<p>B.5 Sudoku</p>
<p>Prompt for Sudoku [Task Description]</p>
<p>Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial numberplacement puzzle.The puzzle consists of an n 2 × n 2 grid, partially filled with numbers from 1 to n 2 and 0 (empty cells).The objective is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each n × n subgrid must contain every number from 1 to n 2 exactly once.</p>
<p>[Example 1]</p>
<p>Here is a 4 x 4 sudoku puzzle:
[[2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]] [Solution 1]
Let's start solving the sudoku puzzle step by step.</p>
<p>Step1: Analyze Empty Cell in Row 1 Cell (1,2): Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in row), 4 (already in column) Possible Numbers: 1, 3 Cell (1,3): Eliminated Numbers: 2 (already in row), 3 (already in column)</p>

<p>1.For each empty cell, try to deduce which numbers are allowed based on the existing numbers in its row, column, and subgrid.A Drop Quote Puzzle consists of two parts: a grid and a set of given letters that "drop" into specific columns of the grid.The goal is to fill in the grid with a meaningful quote or statement.</p>
<p>Key Features: 1.The grid contains numbers, "#" symbols (representing spaces between words), and already placed punctuation.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Words may break across lines, starting at the end of one line and continuing to the beginning of the next.Words end only at "#" blocks or the end of the puzzle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The letters are organized by column number and are given in alphabetical order.These letters need to be placed into the grid.4. Each letter drops into a specific column, and your task is to identify the correct placement for each letter based on the grid structure.Do not simply fill the columns in the order they are listed.Instead, consider where each letter fits contextually within the puzzle to form words that make sense in the final quote or statement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Rules: 1.The "#" symbols indicate where spaces between words should be.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Column labels (e.g., Column 1: O T) indicate the letters that will drop into the grid for Column 1, listed in alphabetical order.For example, in Column 1, the letters "O" and "T" must be placed in the appropriate grid positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fill the grid with the letters in such a way that they form a meaningful statement or quotation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[Example 1]</p>
<p>Here is a drop quote puzzle: [['1', '2', '3', '4', '#', '6', '7'], ['#', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '.']We first focus on Columns with single letters: "T" for Row 1, Column 1 "E" for Row 2, Column 5 "S" for Row 1, Column 7</p>
<p>Then, we check the word ['6', '7'] in Row 1:</p>
<p>The candidates for Column 6 are "I" and "Y", and for Column 7, it is "S".The only word that fits is "IS".So, place "I" in Row Frequently, this means that you can immediately fill in some additional letters.</p>

<p>C Models</p>
<p>As shown in Table 5, we list the key details for eleven open-source models and five closed-source models in our evaluation.the number of elements to be filled (e.g., grid size for Crossword) by the number of possible answers for each element (e.g., 26 letters for Crossword).Detailed performance across varying difficulty levels for each task is presented in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.Our findings indicate that the CR score does not significantly decrease with increasing task difficulty.This suggests that the long-chain generation capability is likely an inherent property of these models, rather than being strongly task-dependent.However, as the solution space expands with increasing difficulty, we observe a consistent performance decline across all models.In the most challenging settings, even the top-performing model achieves an EM score of less than 10%, highlighting the difficulty of our benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reflective reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>D Task Difficulty</p>
<p>E Response Cases</p>
<p>E.1 Lack of Reflective Reasoning</p>
<p>The following example shows that GPT-4o fails to solve the logic problem due to the lack of reflective reasoning capabilities.The model only performs a single turn of deduction of all the clues and outputs the final answers with insufficient evidence.-The skateboard rider's anniversary is before Tom Cruise's cousin.</p>
<h3>Deductions:</h3>
<p>-From Clue 5 and Clue 6, Malia rides a mountain bike and is Liam Neeson's cousin.</p>
<p>-From Clue 7, Malia's anniversary is either January 28 or November 23.</p>
<p>-From Clue 8, Morgan Freeman's cousin has an anniversary on March 6 or November 2.</p>
<p>-From Clue 9, the skateboard rider's anniversary is before Tom Cruise's cousin.</p>
<h3>Assignments:</h3>
<p>-<strong>Malia</strong>: Since Malia rides a mountain bike and is Liam Neeson's cousin, she cannot be Morgan Freeman's cousin.Therefore, Malia's anniversary is not March 6 or November 2. Thus, Malia's anniversary is January 28 or November 23.</p>
<p>-<strong>Kayla</strong>: Kayla is not related to Robert Duvall and doesn't ride a segway.She could be Morgan Freeman's cousin with an anniversary on March 6 or November 2.</p>
<p>-<strong>Bradley</strong>: Bradley does not ride a 10-speed bike.He could be the skateboard rider.</p>
<p>-<strong>Asher</strong>: Asher is not Morgan Freeman's cousin, so he could be Tom Cruise's cousin.</p>
<h3>Final Solution:</h3>
<p>Based on the deductions and assignments, the final solution is: <Answer> [ { "anniversaries": "January 28", "first names": "Malia", "conveyances": "mountain bike", "actors": "Liam Neeson" }, { "anniversaries": "March 6", "first names": "Kayla", "conveyances": "10-speed bike", ✗ "actors": "Morgan Freeman" }, { "anniversaries": "November 2", "first names": "Bradley", "conveyances": "skateboard", ✗ "actors": "Robert Duvall ✗ }, { "anniversaries": "November 23", "first names": "Asher", "conveyances": "segway", ✗ "actors": "Tom Cruise" ✗ } ] </Answer> -Only single deduction -Insufficient evidence -Lack of iterative deduction to ensure consistency with all constraints</p>
<p>E.2 Stuck in Contradictions</p>
<p>The following example shows that Llama-3.1-70Bfalls into repetition of the same sentences when discovering contradictions.Instead of backtracking and revising its assumptions when a contradiction is found (e.g., Cassidy cannot finish at both 3 min 2 sec and 3 min 8 sec), the model appears to get stuck in a loop, repeatedly stating the conflicting information without making progress.</p>
<p>Example 2: Response of Llama-3.1-70B to Logic Puzzle Let's start solving the logic puzzle step by step.</p>
<p>Participants and Attributes Times: 2 min, 59 sec, 3 min, 2 sec, 3 min, 8 sec, 3 min, 14 sec First Names: Cassidy, Eva, Grace, Savannah Breads: challah, flatbread, focaccia, matzo Fruits: currants, kiwis, oranges, pineapples Applying Clue 1:</p>
<p>Either the person who bought the matzo or Cassidy finished at 2 min, 59 sec and the other grows pineapples.Clue 8 states that Savannah finished at 2 min, 59 sec.Therefore, Cassidy grows pineapples and did not buy the matzo.</p>
<p>Applying Clue 8: Savannah finished at 2 min, 59 sec.Clue 6 states that Savannah finished before the person who bought the focaccia.Therefore, the person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec, 3 min, 8 sec, or 3 min, 14 sec.</p>
<p>Applying Clue 4:</p>
<p>The person who grows currants bought the focaccia.</p>
<p>Clue 2 states that either the runner who finished at 3 min, 2 sec or 3 min, 8 sec grows currants.Therefore, the person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec or 3 min, 8 sec.</p>
<p>Applying Clue 9:</p>
<p>The person who grows currants finished before Grace.</p>
<p>Since the person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec or 3 min, 8 sec, Grace finished at 3 min, 14 sec.</p>
<p>Applying Clue 5:</p>
<p>The runner who finished at 3 min, 14 sec did not buy the challah.Therefore, Grace bought the matzo.</p>
<p>Applying Clue 3: Cassidy did not finish at 3 min, 2 sec and did not buy the flatbread.Since Cassidy did not buy the matzo (Clue 1) and did not buy the flatbread, Cassidy bought the challah.</p>
<p>Applying Clue 7:</p>
<p>The person who grows oranges is not Grace.Since Cassidy grows pineapples, the person who grows oranges is either Eva or Savannah.</p>
<p>Assigning Remaining Attributes: Eva or Savannah grows oranges.</p>
<p>Since Savannah finished at 2 min, 59 sec and the person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec or 3 min, 8 sec, Eva grows oranges and bought the flatbread.Savannah grows kiwis and bought the focaccia is incorrect because the person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec or 3 min, 8 sec.Therefore, Savannah bought the challah is incorrect, and Eva bought the flatbread and grows oranges.</p>
<p>The person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec or 3 min, 8 sec.Since the person who grows currants finished before Grace, the person who bought the focaccia finished at 3 min, 2 sec.Therefore, the person who finished at 3 min, 8 sec grows pineapples is incorrect, and Cassidy finished at 3 min, 8 sec is incorrect.Cassidy finished at 3 min, 14 sec is incorrect because Grace finished at 3 min, 14 sec.Therefore, Cassidy finished at 3 min, 2 sec is incorrect, and Cassidy finished at 3 min, 8 sec is incorrect.</p>
<p>Cassidy finished at 3 min, 14 sec is incorrect because Grace finished at 3 min, 14 sec.Therefore, Cassidy finished at 3 min, 2 sec is incorrect, and Cassidy finished at 3 min, 8 sec is incorrect.... ...</p>
<p>-Looping within the same sentence</p>
<p>The following example indicates that QwQ-32B struggles with contraction involving multiple interconnected variables.The primary issue with the reasoning is its disorganized and cyclical behavior.The model jumps between different deductions and assumptions without systematically eliminating possibilities or locking in firm conclusions.-Walter Gaston Shotwell First, I need to understand that this is a substitution cipher, where each letter in the original text is replaced by another letter.</p>
<p>My goal is to figure out which letter corresponds to which in the original text.... ... But that might not be accurate.</p>
<p>Alternatively, "KRXXRF" could be "SELVES", so X = L, R = V, F = E.</p>
<p>But again, just a guess.This is getting too speculative.</p>
<p>Given the time constraints, I think I'll stop here and try to provide the best possible mapping and decryption based on my attempts.<Mapping> {"H": "T", "N": "H", "G": "E", "U": "O", "J": "A", "L": "R", "R": "B", "E": "I", "T": "S", "O": "C", "K": "D", "C": "M", "X": "P", "F": "U", "Q": "W", "A": "F", "W": "G", "S": "Y", "Y": "K", "I": "Z"} </Mapping></p>

<p>Example 3: Response of QwQ-32B to Logic Puzzle Let's tackle this logic puzzle step by step.It's a bit complex with multiple variables, but I'll try to break it down systematically.First, let's list out all the variables we have: ... ... Now, let's look at the anniversaries.... ... So, if Bradley has Mar 6, Tom Cruise's cousin must have Nov 2. If Bradley has Nov 2, Tom Cruise's cousin must have a later date, but Nov 23 is after Nov 2, but Nov 23 is already assigned to either Malia or Kayla.Wait, anniversaries are Jan 28, Mar 6, Nov 2, Nov 23. ... ... So, if Bradley has Mar 6, Tom Cruise's cousin has Nov 2. If Bradley has Nov 2, Tom Cruise's cousin has Nov 23.But Nov 23 is assigned to either Malia or Kayla.... ... So, if Bradley has Nov 2, Tom Cruise's cousin must have Nov 23, but Nov 23 is assigned to either Malia or Kayla.Wait, that can't be, because Tom Cruise's cousin must be someone else.... ... If Bradley has Mar 6, then Tom Cruise's cousin has Nov 2. ... ... But if Bradley has Nov 2, Tom Cruise's cousin must have Nov 23, which is assigned to Malia or Kayla.
This seems conflicting.</p>
