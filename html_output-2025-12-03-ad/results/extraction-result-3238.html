                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> KG-A2C, an agent that builds a dynamic knowledge graph while exploring and generates actions using a template-based action space is presented, arguing that the dual uses of the knowledge graph to reason about game state and to constrain natural language generation are the keys to scalable exploration of combinatorially large natural language actions.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Interactive Fiction games are text-based simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language. They are ideal environments for studying how to extend reinforcement learning agents to meet the challenges of natural language understanding, partial observability, and action generation in combinatorially-large text-based action spaces. We present KG-A2C, an agent that builds a dynamic knowledge graph while exploring and generates actions using a template-based action space. We contend that the dual uses of the knowledge graph to reason about game state and to constrain natural language generation are the keys to scalable exploration of combinatorially large natural language actions. Results across a wide variety of IF games show that KG-A2C outperforms current IF agents despite the exponential increase in action space size.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Interactive Fiction games are text-based simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language. They are ideal environments for studying how to extend reinforcement learning agents to meet the challenges of natural language understanding, partial observability, and action generation in combinatorially-large text-based action spaces. We present KG-A2C ${ }^{1}$, an agent that builds a dynamic knowledge graph while exploring and generates actions using a template-based action space. We contend that the dual uses of the knowledge graph to reason about game state and to constrain natural language generation are the keys to scalable exploration of combinatorially large natural language actions. Results across a wide variety of IF games show that KG-A2C outperforms current IF agents despite the exponential increase in action space size.</p>
<h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Natural language communication has long been considered a defining characteristic of human intelligence. We are motivated by the question of how learning agents can understand and generate contextually relevant natural language in service of achieving a goal. In pursuit of this objective we study Interactive Fiction (IF) games, or text-adventures: simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language-"seeing" and "talking" to the world using textual descriptions and commands. To progress in these games, an agent must generate natural language actions that are coherent, contextually relevant, and able to effect the desired change in the world.</p>
<p>Complicating the problem of generating contextually relevant language in these games is the issue of partial observability: the fact that the agent never has access to the true underlying world state. IF games are structured as puzzles and often consist of an complex, interconnected web of distinct locations, objects, and characters. The agent needs to thus reason about the complexities of such a world solely through the textual descriptions that it receives, descriptions that are often incomplete. Further, an agent must be able to perform commonsense reasoning-IF games assume that human players possess prior commonsense and thematic knowledge-e.g. knowing that swords can kill trolls or that trolls live in dark places. Knowledge graphs provide us with an intuitive way of representing these partially observable worlds. Prior works have shown how using knowledge graphs aid in the twin issues of partial observability (Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl, 2019a) and commonsense reasoning (Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl, 2019b), but do not use them in the context of generating natural language.
To gain a sense for the challenges surrounding natural language generation, we need to first understand how large this space really is. In order to solve solve a popular IF game such as Zorkl it's necessary to generate actions consisting of up to five-words from a relatively modest vocabulary of 697 words recognized by Zork's parser. Even this modestly sized vocabulary leads to $\mathcal{O}\left(697^{5}\right)=1.64 \times 10^{14}$ possible actions at every step-a dauntingly-large combinatorially-sized action space for a learning agent to explore. In order to reduce the size of this space while maintaining expressiveness, Hausknecht et al. (2019a) propose the use of template-actions in which the agent first selects a template (e.g. $[p u t] \ldots$ [in] $\left.\ldots\right)$ then fills in the blanks using vocabulary words. There are 237 templates in Zorkl, each with up to two blanks, yielding a template-action space of size</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>$\mathcal{O}\left(237 \times 697^{2}\right)=1.15 \times 10^{8}$. This space is six orders of magnitude smaller than the word-based space, but still six orders of magnitude larger than the action spaces used by previous text-based agents (Narasimhan et al., 2015; Zahavy et al., 2018). We demonstrate how these templates provide the structure required to further constrain our action space via our knowledge graph-and make the argument that the combination of these approaches allows us to generate meaningful natural language commands.</p>
<p>Our contributions are as follows: We introduce an novel agent that utilizes both a knowledge graph based state space and template based action space and show how to train such an agent. We then conduct an empirical study evaluating our agent across a diverse set of IF games followed by an ablation analysis studying the effectiveness of various components of our algorithm as well as its overall generalizability. Remarkably we show that our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large proportion of the games despite the exponential increase in action space size.</p>
<h1>2 Related Work</h1>
<p>We examine prior work in three broad categories: text-based game playing agents and frameworks as well as knowledge graphs used for natural language generation and game playing agents.</p>
<p>LSTM-DQN (Narasimhan et al., 2015), considers verb-noun actions up to two-words in length. Separate Q-Value estimates are produced for each possible verb and object, and the action consists of pairing the maximally valued verb combined with the maximally valued object. The DRRN algorithm for choice-based games (He et al., 2016; Zelinka, 2018) estimates Q-Values for a particular action from a particular state. Fulda et al. (2017) use Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) to aid in extracting affordances for items in these games and use this information to produce relevant action verbs. Zahavy et al. (2018) reduce the combinatorially-sized action space into a discrete form using a walkthrough of the game and introduce the Action Elimination DQN, which learns to eliminate actions unlikely to cause a world change.</p>
<p>Côté et al. (2018) introduce TextWorld, a framework for procedurally generating parser-based games, allowing a user to control the difficulty of a generated game.Yuan et al. (2019) introduce the concept of interactive question-answering in the form of QAit-modeling QA tasks in TextWorld. Urbanek et al. (2019) introduce Light, a dataset of crowdsourced text-adventure game dialogs focusing on giving collaborative agents the ability to generate contextually relevant dialog and emotes. Hausknecht et al. (2019a) have open-sourced Jericho ${ }^{2}$, an optimized interface for playing human-made IF games-formalizing this task. They further provide a comparative study of various types of agents on their set of games, testing the performance of heuristic based agents such as NAIL (Hausknecht et al., 2019b) and various reinforcement learning agents are benchmarked. We use Jericho and the tools that it provides to develop our agents.</p>
<p>Knowledge graphs have been shown to be useful representations for a variety of tasks surrounding natural language generation and interactive fiction. Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) and Guan et al. (2018) effectively use knowledge graph representations to improve neural conversational and story ending prediction models respectively. Ammanabrolu et al. (2019) explore procedural content generation in text-adventure games-looking at constructing a quest for a given game world, and use knowledge graphs to ground generative systems trained to produce quest content. From the perspective of text-game playing agent and most in line with the spirit of our work, Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl (2019a) present the Knowledge Graph DQN or KG-DQN, an approach where a knowledge graph built during exploration is used as a state representation for a deep reinforcement learning based agent. Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl (2019b) further expand on this work, exploring methods of transferring control policies in text-games, using knowledge graphs to seed an agent with useful commonsense knowledge and to transfer knowledge between different games within a domain. Both of these works, however, identify a discrete set of actions required to play the game beforehand and so do not fully tackle the issue of the combinatorial action space.</p>

<h1>3 State and Action Spaces</h1>
<p>Formally, IF games are partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP), represented as a 7-tuple of $\langle S, T, A, \Omega, O, R, \gamma\rangle$ representing the set of environment states, mostly deterministic conditional transition probabilities between states, the vocabulary or words used to compose text commands, observations returned by the game, observation conditional probabilities, reward function, and the discount factor respectively (Côté et al., 2018; Hausknecht et al., 2019a). To deal with the resulting twin challenges of partial observability and combinatorial actions, we use a knowledge graph based state space and a template-based action space-each described in detail below.
Knowledge Graph State Space. Building on Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl (2019a), we use a knowledge graph as a state representation that is learnt during exploration. The knowledge graph is stored as a set of 3-tuples of 〈subject, relation, object $\rangle$. These triples are extracted from the observations using Stanford's Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) (Angeli et al., 2015). Human-made IF games often contain relatively complex semi-structured information that OpenIE is not designed to parse and so we add additional rules to ensure that we are parsing the relevant information.</p>
<p>Updated after every action, the knowledge graph helps the agent form a map of the world that it is exploring, in addition to retaining information that it has learned such as the affordances associated with an object, the properties of a character, current inventory, etc. Nodes relating to such information are shown on the basis of their relation to the agent which is presented on the graph using a "you" node (see example in Fig. 2a).
Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl (2019a) build a knowledge graph in a similar manner but restrict themselves to a single domain. In contrast, we test our methods on a much more diverse set of games defined in the Jericho framework (Hausknecht et al., 2019a). These games are each structured differentlycovering a wider variety of genres-and so to be able to extract the same information from all of them in a general manner, we relax many of the rules found in Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl (2019a). To aid in the generalizability of graph building, we introduce the concept of interactive objects-items that an agent is able to directly interact with in the surrounding environment. These items are directly linked to the "you" node, indicating that the agent can interact with them, and the node for the current room, showing their relative position. All other triples built from the graph are extracted by OpenIE. Further details regarding knowledge graph updates are found in Appendix B. 1 An example of a graph built using these rules is seen in Fig. 2a.</p>
<p>Template Action Space. Templates are subroutines used by the game's parser to interpret the player's action. They consist of interchangeable verbs phrases $(V P)$ optionally followed by prepositional phrases $(V P P P)$, e.g. ([carry/hold/take] $\qquad$ ) and ([drop/throw/discard/pnt] $\qquad$ [at/against/on/onto] $\qquad$ ), where the verbs and prepositions within [.] are aliases. As shown in Figure 2b, actions may be constructed from templates by filling in the template's blanks using words in the game's vocabulary. Templates and vocabulary words are programmatically accessible through the Jericho framework and are thus available for every IF game. Further details about how we prioritize interchangeable verbs and prepositions are available in Appendix B.2.</p>
<h2>4 Knowledge Graph Advantage Actor Critic</h2>
<p>Combining the knowledge-graph state space with the template action space, Knowledge Graph Advantage Actor Critic or KG-A2C, is an on-policy reinforcement learning agent that collects experience from many parallel environments. We first discuss the architecture of KG-A2C, then detail the training algorithm. As seen in Fig. 1, KG-A2C's architecture can broadly be described in terms of encoding a state representation and then using this encoded representation to decode an action. We describe each of these processes below.</p>
<p>Input Representation. The input representation network is broadly divided into three parts: an observation encoder, a score encoder, and the knowledge graph. At every step an observation consisting of several components is received: $o_{t}=\left(o_{t_{\text {desc }}}, o_{t_{\text {game }}}, o_{t_{\text {line }}}, a_{t-1}\right)$ corresponding to the room description, game feedback, inventory, and previous action, and total score $R_{t}$. The room description $o_{t_{\text {desec }}}$ is a textual description of the agent's location, obtained by executing the command "look." The game feedback $o_{t_{\text {game }}}$ is the simulators response to the agent's previous action and con-</p>

sists of narrative and flavor text. The inventory $o_{t_{\text {two }}}$ and previous action $a_{t-1}$ components inform the agent about the contents of its inventory and the last action taken respectively.</p>
<p>The observation encoder processes each component of $o_{t}$ using a separate GRU encoder. As we are not given the vocabulary that $o_{t}$ is comprised of, we use subword tokenization-specifically using the unigram subword tokenization method described in Kudo \&amp; Richardson (2018). This method predicts the most likely sequence of subword tokens for a given input using a unigram language model which, in our case, is trained on a dataset of human playthroughs of IF games ${ }^{3}$ and contains a total vocabulary of size 8000 . For each of the GRUs, we pass in the final hidden state of the GRU at step $t-1$ to initialize the hidden state at step $t$. We concatenate each of the encoded components and use a linear layer to combine them into the final encoded observation $\mathbf{o}<em t="t">{t}$.
At each step, we update our knowledge graph $G</em>}$ using $o_{t}$ as described in Sec. 3 and it is then embedded into a single vector $\mathbf{g<em _mathbf_1="\mathbf{1">{\mathbf{t}}$. Following Ammanabrolu \&amp; Riedl (2019a) we use Graph Attention networks or GATs (Veličković et al., 2018) with an attention mechanism similar to that described in Bahdanau et al. (2014). Node features are computed as $H=\left{\mathbf{h}</em>}}, \mathbf{h<em _mathbf_N="\mathbf{N">{\mathbf{2}}, \ldots, \mathbf{h}</em>}}\right}, \mathbf{h<em i="i" j="j">{\mathbf{i}} \in \mathbb{R}^{F}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes and $F$ the number of features in each node, consist of the average subword embeddings of the entity and of the relations for all incoming edges using our unigram language model. Self-attention is then used after a learnable linear transformation $W \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \mathrm{~F} \times \mathrm{F}}$ applied to all the node features. Attention coefficients $\alpha</em>$.}$ are then computed by softmaxing $k \in \mathcal{N}$ with $\mathcal{N}$ being the neighborhood in which we compute the attention coefficients and consists of all edges in $G_{t</p>

<p>where $k$ refers to the parameters of the $k^{t h}$ independent attention mechanism, $W_{g}$ and $b_{g}$ the weights and biases of the output linear layer, and $\bigoplus$ represents concatenation. The final component of state embedding vector is a binary encoding $\mathbf{c}<em _mathbf_t="\mathbf{t">{t}$ of the total score obtained so far in the game-giving the agent a sense for how far it has progressed in the game even when it is not collecting reward. The state embedding vector is then calculated as $\mathbf{s}</em>}}=\mathbf{g<em _mathbf_t="\mathbf{t">{\mathbf{t}} \oplus \mathbf{o}</em>}} \oplus \mathbf{c<em _mathbf_t="\mathbf{t">{\mathbf{t}}$.
Action Decoder. The state embedding vector $\mathbf{s}</em>}}$ is then used to sequentially construct an action by first predicting a template and then picking the objects to fill into the template using a series of Decoder GRUs. This gives rise to a template policy $\pi_{\mathrm{T}}$ and a policy for each object $\pi_{\mathrm{O<em t="t">{t}}$. Architecture wise, at every decoding step all previously predicted parts of the action are encoded and passed along with $\mathbf{s}</em>$ remains separate.}$ through an attention layer which learns to attend over these representations-conditioning every predicted object on all the previously predicted objects and template. All the object decoder GRUs share parameters while the template decoder $\mathrm{GRU}_{T</p>
<p>To effectively constrain the space of template-actions, we introduce the concept of a graph mask, leveraging our knowledge graph at that timestep $G_{t}$ to streamline the object decoding process. Formally, the graph mask $m_{t}=\left{o: o \in G_{t} \wedge o \in V\right}$, consists of all the entities found within the knowledge graph $G_{t}$ and vocabulary $V$ and is applied to the outputs of the object decoder GRUsrestricting them to predict objects in the mask. Generally, in an IF game, it is impossible to interact with an object that you never seen or that are not in your inventory and so the mask lets us explore the action space more efficiently. To account for cases where this assumption does not hold, i.e. when an object that the agent has never interacted with before must be referenced in order to progress in the game, we randomly add objects $o \in V$ to $m_{t}$ with a probability $p_{m}$. An example of the graph-constrained action decoding process is illustrated in Fig. 2b.</p>
<h1>4.1 TRAINING</h1>
<p>We adapt the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method (Mnih et al., 2016) to train our network, using multiple workers to gather experiences from the simulator, making several significant changes along the way-as described below.</p>
<p>Valid Actions. Using a template-action space there are millions of possible actions at each step. Most of these actions do not make sense, are ungrammatical, etc. and an even fewer number of them actually cause the agent effect change in the world. Without any sense for which actions present valid interactions with the world, the combinatorial action space becomes prohibitively large for effective exploration.</p>
<p>We thus use the concept of valid actions, actions that can change the world in a particular state. These actions can usually be recognized through the game feedback, with responses like "Nothing happens" or "That phrase is not recognized." In practice, we follow Hausknecht et al. (2019a) and use the valid action detection algorithm provided by Jericho. Formally, $\operatorname{Valid}\left(s_{t}\right)=\left{a_{0}, a_{1} \ldots a_{N}\right}$ and from this we can construct the corresponding set of valid templates $\mathcal{T}<em t="t">{\text {valid }}\left(s</em>}\right)=\left{\tau_{0}, \tau_{1} \ldots \tau_{N}\right}$. We further define a set of valid objects $\mathcal{O<em t="t">{\text {valid }}\left(s</em>}\right)=\left{o_{0}, o_{1} \ldots o_{M}\right}$ which consists of all objects in the graph mask as defined in Sec. 4. This lets us introduce two cross-entropy loss terms to aid the action decoding process. The template loss given a particular state and current network parameters is applied to the decoder $\mathrm{GRU<em O="O">{T}$. Similarly, the object loss is applied across the decoder $\mathrm{GRU}</em>$ and is calculated by summing cross-entropy loss from all the object decoding steps.</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathcal{L}<em t="t">{\mathbb{T}}\left(s</em>\right)\right)\right. \
\mathcal{L}}, a_{t} ; \theta_{t}\right)=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_{\tau_{i}} \log \pi_{\mathbb{T}}\left(\tau_{i} \mid s_{t}\right)+\left(1-y_{\tau_{i}}\right)\left(1-\log \pi_{\mathbb{T}}\left(\tau_{i} \mid s_{t<em t="t">{\mathbb{O}}\left(s</em>}, a_{t} ; \theta_{t}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{n} \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(y_{o_{i}} \log \pi_{\mathbb{O<em i="i">{j}}\left(o</em>} \mid s_{t}\right)+\left(1-y_{o_{i}}\right)\left(1-\log \pi_{\mathbb{O<em i="i">{j}}\left(o</em>\right)\right)\right) \
y_{\tau_{i}}=\left{\begin{array}{ll}
1 &amp; \tau_{i} \in \mathcal{T}} \mid s_{t<em t="t">{\text {valid }}\left(s</em>\right) \
0 &amp; \text { else }
\end{array} y_{o_{i}}=\left{\begin{array}{ll}
1 &amp; o_{i} \in \mathcal{O}<em t="t">{\text {valid }}\left(s</em>\right) \
0 &amp; \text { else }
\end{array}\right.\right.
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>Updates. A2C training starts with calculating the advantage of taking an action in a state $A\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)$, defined as the value of taking an action $Q\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)$ compared to the average value of taking all possible valid actions in that state $V\left(s_{t}\right)$ :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; A\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)=Q\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)-V\left(s_{t}\right) \
&amp; Q\left(s_{t}, a_{t}\right)=\mathbb{E}\left[r_{t}+\gamma V\left(s_{t+1}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>$V\left(s_{t}\right)$ is predicted by the critic as shown in Fig. 1 and $r_{t}$ is the reward received at step $t$.
The action decoder or actor is then updated according to the gradient:</p>
<p>$$
-\nabla_{\theta}\left(\log \pi_{\mathbb{T}}\left(\tau \mid s_{t} ; \theta_{t}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{n} \log \pi_{\mathbb{O}<em i="i">{i}}\left(o</em>\right)
$$} \mid s_{t}, \tau, \ldots, o_{i-1} ; \theta_{t}\right)\right) A\left(s_{t}, a_{t</p>
<p>updating the template policy $\pi_{\mathbb{T}}$ and object policies $\pi_{\mathbb{O}_{i}}$ based on the fact that each step in the action decoding process is conditioned on all the previously decoded portions. The critic is updated with respect to the gradient:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{\theta}\left(Q\left(s_{t}, a_{t} ; \theta_{t}\right)-V\left(s_{t} ; \theta_{t}\right)\right)^{2}
$$</p>
<p>bringing the critic's prediction of the value of being in a state closer to its true underlying value. We further add an entropy loss over the valid actions, designed to prevent the agent from prematurely converging on a trajectory.</p>
<p>$$
\mathcal{L}<em t="t">{\mathbb{E}}\left(s</em>\right)
$$}, a_{t} ; \theta_{t}\right)=\sum_{a \in V\left(s_{t}\right)} P\left(a \mid s_{t}\right) \log P\left(a \mid s_{t</p>
<h1>5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS</h1>
<p>The KG-A2C is tested on a suite of Jericho supported games and is compared to strong, established baselines. Additionally, as encouraged by Hausknecht et al. (2019a), we present the set of handicaps used by our agents: (1) Jericho's ability to identify valid actions and (2) the Load, Save handicap in order to acquire $o_{t_{A u s c}}$ and $o_{t_{s a c c}}$ using the look and inventory commands without changing the game state. Hyperparameters are provided in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Template DQN Baseline. We compare KG-A2C against Template-DQN, a strong baseline also utilizing the template based action space. TDQN (Hausknecht et al., 2019a) is an extension of LSTM-DQN (Narasimhan et al., 2015) to template-based action spaces. This is accomplished using three output heads: one for estimating the Q-Values over templates $Q\left(s_{t}, u\right) \forall u \in \mathcal{T}$ and two for estimating Q-Values $Q\left(s_{t}, o_{1}\right), Q\left(s_{t}, o_{2}\right) \forall o_{i} \in \mathcal{O}$ over vocabulary to fill in the blanks of the template. The final executed action is constructed by greedily sampling from the predicted Q-values. Importantly, TDQN uses the same set of handicaps as KG-A2C allowing a fair comparison between these two algorithms.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows how KG-A2C fares across a diverse set of games supported by Jericho-testing the agent's ability to generalize to different genres, game structures, reward functions, and state-action spaces. KG-A2C matches or outperforms TDQN on 23 out of the 28 games that we test on. Our agent is thus shown to be capable of extracting a knowledge graph that can sufficiently constrain the template based action space to enable effective exploration in a broad range of games.</p>
<h2>6 Ablation Study</h2>
<p>In order to understand the contributions of different components of KG-A2C's architecture, we ablate KG-A2C's knowledge graph, template-action space, and valid-action loss. These ablations are performed on Zork1 ${ }^{4}$ and result in the following agents:
A2C removes all components of KG-A2C's knowledge graph. In particular, the state embedding vector is now computed as $\mathbf{s}<em _mathbf_t="\mathbf{t">{\mathbf{t}}=\mathbf{o}</em>$ and the graph mask is not used to constrain action decoding.}} \odot \mathbf{c}_{\mathbf{t}</p>
<p>KG-A2C-no-gat remove's the Graph Attention network, but retains the graph masking components. The knowledge graph is still constructed as usual but the agent uses the same state embedding vector as A2C.
KG-A2C-no-mask ablates the graph mask for purposes of action decoding. The knowledge graph is constructed as usual and the agent retains graph attention.</p>
<p>On Zork1 as shown in Figure 3, we observe similar asymptotic performance between the all of the ablations - all reach approximately 34 points. This level of performance corresponds to a local optima where the agent collects the majority of available rewards without fighting the troll. Several other authors also report scores at this threshold (Jain et al., 2019; Zahavy et al., 2018). In terms of learning speed, the methods which have access to either the graph attention or the graph mask converge slightly faster than pure A2C which has neither.</p>

<p>Figure 3: Ablation results on Zork1, averaged across 5 independent runs.</p>
<p>To further understand these differences we performed a larger study across the full set of games comparing KG-A2C-full with KG-A2C-no-mask. The results in Table 2 show KG-A2C-full outperforms KG-A2C-no-mask on 10 games and is outperformed by KG-A2C-no-mask on 6. From this larger study we thus conclude the graph mask and knowledge graph are broadly useful components.</p>
<p>We perform two final ablations to study the importance of the supervised valid-action loss and the template action space:</p>
<p>KG-A2C-unsupervised In order to understand the importance of training with valid-actions, KG-A2C-unsupervised is not allowed to access the list of valid actions-the valid-action-losses $\mathcal{L}<em _mathrm_O="\mathrm{O">{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\mathcal{L}</em>$ now based on the full action set. Thus, the agent must explore the template action space manually. KG-A2C-unsupervised, when trained for the same number of steps as all the other agents, fails to achieve any score. We can infer that the valid action auxiliary loss remains an important part of the overall algorithm, and access to the knowledge graph alone is not yet sufficient for removing this auxiliary loss.}}$ are disabled and $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbb{E}</p>
<p>KG-A2C-seq discards the template action space and instead decodes actions word by word up to a maximum of four words. A supervised cross-entropy-based valid action loss $\mathcal{L}<em _valid="{valid" t__text="t_{\text">{\text {Valid }}$ is now calculated by selecting a random valid action $a</em>=0.5$ and the decoded action otherwise. All other components remain the same as in the full KG-A2C.}}} \in \operatorname{Valid}\left(s_{t}\right)$ and using each token in it as a target label. As this action space is orders of magnitude larger than template actions, we use teacher-forcing to enable more effective exploration while training the agent-executing $a_{t_{\text {valid }}}$ with a probability $p_{\text {valid }</p>
<p>KG-A2C-seq reaches a relatively low asymptotic performance of 8 points. This agent, using a action space consisting of the full vocabulary, performs significantly worse than the rest of the agents even when given the handicaps of teacher forcing and being allowed to train for significantly longerindicating that the template based action space is also necessary for effective exploration.</p>
<h1>7 CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Tabula rasa reinforcement learning offers an intuitive paradigm for exploring goal driven, contextually aware natural language generation. The sheer size of the natural language action space, however, has proven to be out of the reach of existing algorithms. In this paper we introduced KG-A2C, a novel learning agent that demonstrates the feasibility of scaling reinforcement learning towards natural language actions spaces with hundreds of millions of actions. The key insight to being able to efficiently explore such large spaces is the combination of a knowledge-graph-based state space and a template-based action space. The knowledge graph serves as a means for the agent to understand its surroundings, accumulate information about the game, and disambiguate similar textual observations while the template-based action space lends a measure of structure that enables us to exploit that same knowledge graph for language generation. Together they constrain the vast space of possible actions into the compact space of sensible ones. A suite of experiments across a diverse set of 28 human-made IF games shows wide improvement over TDQN, the current state-of-the-art templatebased agent. Finally, an ablation study replicates state-of-the-art performance on Zork1 even though KG-A2C is using an action space six orders of magnitude larger than previous agents-indicating the overall efficacy of our combined state-action space.</p>

<h2>B IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS</h2>
<h2>B. 1 KNOWLEDGE GRAPH UpDATE RULES</h2>
<p>Candidate interactive objects are identified by performing part-of-speech tagging on the current observation, identifying singular and proper nouns as well as adjectives, and are then filtered by checking if they can be examined using the command examine $O B J$. Only the interactive objects not found in the inventory are linked to the node corresponding to the current room and the inventory items are linked to the "you" node. The only other rule applied uses the navigational actions performed by the agent to infer the relative positions of rooms, e.g. $\langle$ kitchen, down, cellar $\rangle$ when the agent performs go down when in the kitchen to move to the cellar.</p>
<h2>B. 2 TEMPLATE PREPROCESSING</h2>
<p>Templates are processed by selecting a single verb and preposition from the aliases. For the sake of agent explainability, we pick the verb and preposition that are most likely to be used by humans when playing IF games. This is done by assessing token frequencies from a dataset of human playthroughs such as those given in ClubFloyd ${ }^{5}$. This dataset consists of 425 unique play sessions and 273,469 state-action pairs. The examples given earlier, ([carry/hold/take] $\qquad$ ) and ([drop/throw/discard/put] $\qquad$ [at/against/on/onto] $\qquad$ ), would then be converted to take $\qquad$ and put $\qquad$ on $\qquad$ .</p>

<h1>D ZORK1</h1>
<p>Zork1 was identified by Hausknecht et al. (2019a) to be one of the most difficult games in their suite and the subject of much prior work (Zahavy et al., 2018; Yin \&amp; May, 2019). Zork1 is one of the earliest IF games and is a dungeon-crawler-a player must explore a vast labyrinth while fighting off enemies and complete puzzles in order to collect treasures. It features a relatively sparse reward for collecting a treasure or moving along the right path to one, and stochasticity in terms of random enemy movements.</p>
<p>To understand how humans progress in Zork1, a group of 10 human players-familiar with IF games-were asked to play Zork1 for the first time (with no access to walkthroughs). Half of the players reached a game score of around 40 before dying to the first beatable NPC, a troll, mostly due to neglecting to collect a weapon to fight it with beforehand. Three of the remaining players died to hidden traps even before reaching this point, achieving scores between 5 and 15 . The final two players made it significantly past the troll gaining scores of around 70 .
The following transcript of KG-A2C playing Zork1, shows top predicted probabilities for templates and objects.</p>

Obs: A beautiful day in Bostwin! You are weakened by a ray of sunlight peeking through a window shade and rise refreshed after a restful night's sleep. You've given your Company a weekend pass to get some R\&amp;R after your last grueling mission. Wasting precious little time your entire company took off for the city proper to pack in as much drinking, carousing, brawling, wenching and other relaxing pursuits as possible in 48 hours. In the fields of battle your men are an elite unit of trained professionals. Off duty they're pretty much like every other bunch of soldiers you've ever served with. A weekend off and what to do? After the challenges of the past year when you were first promoted and assumed command of Charlie Company you've nearly forgotten what free time is and what you're supposed to do with it.

When you were a lowly lieutenant you had to share cramped quarters with a fellow lieutenant at your previous assignment. Commanding a company of your own affords you the luxury of private, spacious quarters just outside the barracks themselves. As a further abuse of your power your chest and bunk are not standard issue items from the Pentari millitary supply center. You can see a postcard here.

The floors are polished to an almost blinding shine while each of the bunks lining both sides of this building are perfectly made. Every locker next to each bunk is closed and locked. Not a single scrap of paper, not one article of clothing, nay not even a dust particle looks out of place. The powerful smell of high quantities of pine cleaner nearly burns your nostrils. Damn, you run a good company. You can see a Pentarian Transporter here.
