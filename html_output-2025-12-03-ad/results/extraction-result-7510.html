                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> This work applies an uncertainty-principle-type bound on negative energy densities in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime to the stress-energy of static traversable wormhole spacetimes and implies that either the wormhole must be only a little larger than Planck size or that there is a large discrepancy in the length scales which characterize the wormholes.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Recently a bound on negative energy densities in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime was derived for a minimally coupled, quantized, massless, scalar field in an arbitrary quantum state. The bound has the form of an uncertainty-principle-type constraint on the magnitude and duration of the negative energy density seen by a timelike geodesic observer. When spacetime is curved and/or has boundaries, we argue that the bound should hold in regions small compared to the minimum local characteristic radius of curvature or the distance to any boundaries, since spacetime can be considered approximately Minkowski on these scales. We apply the bound to the stress-energy of static traversable wormhole spacetimes. Our analysis implies that either the wormhole must be only a little larger than Planck size or that there is a large discrepancy in the length scales which characterize the wormhole. In the latter case, the negative energy must typically be concentrated in a thin band many orders of magnitude smaller than the throat size. These results would seem to make the existence of macroscopic traversable wormholes very improbable. {copyright} {ital 1996 The American Physical Society.}</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Recently a bound on negative energy densities in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime was derived for a minimally coupled, quantized, massless, scalar field in an arbitrary quantum state. The bound has the form of an uncertainty principle-type constraint on the magnitude and duration of the negative energy density seen by a timelike geodesic observer. When spacetime is curved and/or has boundaries, we argue that the bound should hold in regions small compared to the minimum local characteristic radius of curvature or the distance to any boundaries, since spacetime can be considered approximately Minkowski on these scales. We apply the bound to the stress-energy of static traversable wormhole spacetimes. Our analysis implies that either the wormhole must be only a little larger than Planck size or that there is a large discrepancy in the length scales which characterize the wormhole. In the latter case, the negative energy must typically be concentrated in a thin band many orders of magnitude smaller than the throat size. These results would seem to make the existence of macroscopic traversable wormholes very improbable.</p>
<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>In recent years there has been considerable interest in the topic of traversable wormholes, solutions of Einstein's equations which act as tunnels from one region of spacetime to another, through which an observer might freely pass [1, 2, 3]. Traversable wormhole spacetimes have the property that they must involve "exotic matter", that is, a stress tensor which violates the weak energy condition. Thus the energy density must be negative in the frame of reference of at least some observers. Although classical forms of matter obey the weak energy condition, it is well-known that quantum fields can generate locally negative energy densities, which may be arbitrarily large at a given point. A key issue in the study of wormholes is the nature and magnitude of the violations of the weak energy condition which are allowed by quantum field theory. One possible constraint upon such violations is given by averaged energy conditions [4]. In particular, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) states that $\int T_{\mu \nu} k^{\mu} k^{\nu} \mathrm{d} \lambda \geq 0$, where the integral is taken along a complete null geodesic with tangent vector $k^{\mu}$ and affine parameter $\lambda$. This condition must be violated in wormhole spacetimes [2]. Although ANEC can be proven to hold in Minkowski spacetime, it is generally violated in curved spacetime [5, 6]. The extent to which it can be violated is not yet well understood, but limits on the extent of ANEC violation will place constraints upon allowable wormhole geometries $[7,8]$.</p>
<p>A second type of constraint upon violations of the weak energy condition are "quantum inequalities" (QI's), which limit the magnitude and spatial or temporal extent of negative energy [9]-[13]. These constraints are intermediate between pointwise conditions and the averaged energy conditions in that they give information about the distribution of negative energy in a finite neighborhood. For the most part, inequalities of this type have only been proven flat spacetime. The main purpose of this paper will be to argue that restricted versions of the flat spacetime inequalities can be employed in curved spacetime, and that these inequalities place severe constraints upon wormhole geometries. We assume that the stress-energy of the wormhole spacetime is a renormalized expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor operator in some quantum state, and ignore fluctuations in this expectation value $[14,15]$.</p>
<p>In this paper, we restrict our attention to static, spherically symmetric wormholes. We will also assume that the spacetime contains no closed timelike curves. This latter assumption may not be necessary, but we make it in order to insure that quantum field theory on the wormhole spacetime is well-defined. In Sec. 2, a flat spacetime quantum inequality is reviewed, and an argument is presented for the application of this inequality in small regions of a curved spacetime. In Sec. 3, we briefly review some of the essential features of traversable (Morris-Thorne) wormholes. We next consider a number of particular wormhole models in Sec. 4, and argue that the quantum inequality places strong restrictions upon the dimensions of these wormholes. In Sec. 5 we formulate a more general bound upon the relative dimensions of an arbitrary Morris-Thorne wormhole. Finally, in Sec. 6 we summarize and interpret our results.</p>
<p>Our units are taken to be those in which $\hbar=G=c=1$, and our sign conventions are those of Ref. [1].</p>
<h1>2 Quantum Inequalities in Flat and Curved Spacetime</h1>
<p>In Ref. [13], an inequality was proven which limits the magnitude and duration of the negative energy density seen by an inertial observer in Minkowski spacetime (without boundaries). Let $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$ be the renormalized expectation value of the stress tensor for a free, massless, minimally coupled scalar field in an arbitrary quantum state. Let $u^{\mu}$ be the observer's four-velocity, so that $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle$ is the expectation value of the local energy density in this observer's frame of reference. The inequality states that</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\tau_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle d \tau}{\tau^{2}+\tau_{0}{ }^{2}} \geq-\frac{3}{32 \pi^{2} \tau_{0}{ }^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>for all $\tau_{0}$, where $\tau$ is the observer's proper time. The Lorentzian function which appears in the integrand is a convenient choice for a sampling function, which samples the energy density in an interval of characteristic duration $\tau_{0}$ centered around an arbitrary point on the observer's worldline. The proper time coordinate has been chosen so that this point is at $\tau=0$. The physical content of Eq. (1) is that the more negative the energy density is in an interval, the shorter must be the duration of the interval. Consider, for example, a pocket of negative energy which our observer traverses in a proper time $\Delta \tau$. A natural choice of the sampling time is $\tau_{0}=\Delta \tau$, in which case we infer that the average value of the negative energy in this pocket is bounded below by $-3 /\left[32 \pi^{2}(\Delta \tau)^{4}\right]$. Because Eq. (1) holds for all $\tau_{0}$, we must obtain a true statement with other choices. If we let $\tau_{0}&lt;\Delta \tau$, then we obtain a weaker bound. If we let $\tau_{0}&gt;\Delta \tau$, then we appear to obtain a stronger bound. However, now the range over which we are sampling extends beyond the boundaries of the pocket and may include positive energy contributions. Hence it is to be expected that the lower bound on the average energy density should be less negative.</p>
<p>The basic premise of this paper is that one may obtain a constraint upon the renormalized stress tensor in a curved spacetime using Eq. (1), provided that $\tau_{0}$ is taken to be sufficiently small. The main purpose of this section is to explore the rationale for this premise. The basic idea is that a curved spacetime appears flat if restricted to a sufficiently small region. However, this idea is sufficiently subtle to require an extended discussion.</p>
<p>First, let us recall the situation in classical general relativity. The principle of equivalence has its mathematical expression in the fact that the geodesic equations involve the spacetime metric and the connection coefficients, but not the curvature tensor. Thus, if we go to a local inertial frame, the equations of motion for a point test particle take the flat space form. However, it is possible for equations of motion to contain curvature terms explicitly. An example is the equation of motion for a</p>
<p>classical spinning test particle [16]. In this case, the principle of equivalence does not hold in its simplest form, and one can treat the system as being in locally flat spacetime only to the extent that the curvature terms are negligible.</p>
<p>In quantum field theory, we will be more interested in the extent to which solutions of wave equations can be approximated by the flat space forms. Consider, for example, the generalized Klein-Gordon equation</p>
<p>$$
\square \phi+m^{2} \phi+\xi R \phi=0
$$</p>
<p>where $\xi$ is an arbitrary constant and $R$ is the scalar curvature. The solutions of this equation will generally not be similar to the flat space solutions unless the curvature term is small compared to the other terms in the equation. However, this is still not sufficient to guarantee that a flat space mode is a solution of Eq. (2). It is also necessary to require that the modes have a wavelength that is small compared to the local radii of curvature of the spacetime. In this limit, it is possible to obtain WKB-type solutions to Eq. (2), which are approximately plane wave modes. For an illustration of this, see the work of Parker and Fulling [17] on adiabatic regularization. These authors give generalized WKB solutions of wave equations in an expanding spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe. In the limit that the wavelength of a mode is short compared to the expansion time scale (which is the spacetime radius of curvature in this case), the leading term, which is of the plane wave form, becomes a good approximation.</p>
<p>Our primary concern is when we may expect the inequality Eq. (1), which was derived from Minkowski space quantum field theory, to hold in a curved spacetime and/or one with boundaries. For a given $\tau_{0}$, the dominant contribution to the righthand side of this inequality arises from modes for which $\lambda \sim \tau_{0}$. In particular, modes for which $\lambda \gg \tau_{0}$ yield a small contribution. To see this more explicitly, note that the right-hand side of Eq. (1) arises from the integral $\left(4 \pi^{2}\right)^{-1} \int_{0}^{\infty} \mathrm{d} \omega \omega^{3} \mathrm{e}^{-2 \omega \tau_{0}}$. (See Eq. (63) of Ref. [13]). Thus if the long wavelength modes $\left(\omega \ll \tau_{0}^{-1}\right)$ were to be omitted or to be distorted by the presence of spacetime curvature or boundaries, the result would not change significantly. This suggests that we can apply the inequality in a curved spacetime so long as $\tau_{0}$ is restricted to be small compared to the local proper radii of curvature and the proper distance to any boundaries in the spacetime. This is the criterion that the relevant modes be approximated by plane wave modes.</p>
<p>The specific example of the Casimir effect may be useful as an illustration. Here one has a constant negative energy density, which would not be possible if Eq. (1) holds for all $\tau_{0}$. However, if we impose some restrictions on the allowable values of $\tau_{0}$, then the inequality does in fact still apply. Let us consider a massless scalar field with periodicity of length $L$ in the $z$-direction. Let us also consider an observer moving with velocity $v$ in the $+z$-direction. In the rest frame of this observer, the expectation value of the energy density is</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle=-\frac{\pi^{2}}{45 L^{4}}\left(1+3 v^{2}\right) \gamma^{2}
$$</p>
<p>where $\gamma=\left(1-v^{2}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. Because this quantity is a constant, Eq. (1) becomes</p>
<p>$$
-\frac{\pi^{2}}{45 L^{4}}\left(1+3 v^{2}\right) \gamma^{2} \geq-\frac{3}{32 \pi^{2} \tau_{0}{ }^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>or equivalently,</p>
<p>$$
\tau_{0} \leq \frac{3 L}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\left[\left(1+3 v^{2}\right) \gamma^{2}\right]^{-\frac{1}{4}}
$$</p>
<p>Thus for the special case of a static observer $(v=0)$, we must have</p>
<p>$$
\tau_{0} \leq \frac{3 L}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \approx 0.46 L
$$</p>
<p>There are two relevant length scales in the observer's frame of reference. The first is the (Lorentz-contracted) periodicity length, $l_{1}=L / \gamma$, and the second is the proper time required to traverse this distance, $l_{2}=L /(v \gamma)$. Here $l_{1}$ is the smaller of the two, and plays a role analogous to the minimum radius of curvature in a curved spacetime. Thus we should let</p>
<p>$$
\tau_{0}=f l_{1}=\frac{f L}{\gamma}
$$</p>
<p>Equation (5) will be satisfied if</p>
<p>$$
f \leq g(v) \equiv \frac{3}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\left[\left(1+3 v^{2}\right)\left(1-v^{2}\right)\right]^{-\frac{1}{4}}
$$</p>
<p>The function $g(v)$ has its minimum value at $v=1 / \sqrt{3}$, at which point</p>
<p>$$
g\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)=\frac{3}{2 \pi}\left(\frac{5}{8}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \approx 0.42
$$</p>
<p>Thus if we restrict $\tau_{0}&lt;0.42 l_{1}$, then the Minkowski space quantum inequality also holds in the compactified spacetime. Note that the constraint obtained by considering arbitrary $v$ differs only slightly from that for static observers, Eq. (6).</p>
<p>The Casimir effect example contains some of the essential features that we encounter in a renormalized stress tensor on a curved background spacetime. However, on a curved spacetime $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$ is a sum of a state-dependent part and a stateindependent geometrical part. The latter consists of terms which are either quadratic in the Riemann tensor or else linear in second derivatives of the Riemann tensor. One source of curvature dependence in $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$ is the well-known trace anomaly. For the case of the conformal $(\xi=1 / 6)$ scalar field, it is</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle T_{\mu}^{\mu}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2880 \pi^{2}}\left(R_{\alpha \beta \rho \sigma} R^{\alpha \beta \rho \sigma}-R_{\alpha \beta} R^{\alpha \beta}+\nabla_{\rho} \nabla^{\rho} R\right)
$$</p>
<p>Other fields have trace anomalies with similar coefficients, i.e., with magnitudes of the order of $10^{-4}$. Thus these terms will give a very small contribution to a quantum inequality of the form of Eq. (1) when $\tau_{0} \ll l$, where $l$ is the characteristic radius of curvature.</p>
<p>A related source of curvature dependence in the renormalized stress tensor is the possible presence of finite terms of the form of the quadratic counter-terms required to remove the logarithmic divergences in a curved spacetime. These terms are the tensors</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{\mu \nu}^{(1)} &amp; \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta}{\delta g^{\mu \nu}}\left[\sqrt{-g} R^{2}\right] \
&amp; =2 \nabla_{\nu} \nabla_{\mu} R-2 g_{\mu \nu} \nabla_{\rho} \nabla^{\rho} R+\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R^{2}-2 R R_{\mu \nu}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{\mu \nu}^{(2)} \equiv &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta}{\delta g^{\mu \nu}}\left[\sqrt{-g} R_{\alpha \beta} R^{\alpha \beta}\right]=2 \nabla_{\alpha} \nabla_{\nu} R_{\mu}^{\alpha}+\nabla_{\rho} \nabla^{\rho} R_{\mu \nu} \
&amp; -\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} \nabla_{\rho} \nabla^{\rho} R+\frac{1}{2} g_{\mu \nu} R_{\alpha \beta} R^{\alpha \beta}-2 R_{\mu}^{\rho} R_{\rho \nu}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>There can be a term of the form $c_{1} H_{\mu \nu}^{(1)}+c_{2} H_{\mu \nu}^{(2)}$ in $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$. More generally, there might be a term of the form $\left(c_{1} H_{\mu \nu}^{(1)}+c_{2} H_{\mu \nu}^{(2)}\right) \log \left(R \mu^{-2}\right)$, where $\mu$ is an arbitrary renormalization mass scale [18]. A shift in the value of $\mu$ adds a term proportional to $c_{1} H_{\mu \nu}^{(1)}+c_{2} H_{\mu \nu}^{(2)}$ to $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$. Visser [6] has recently discussed how terms of this form are likely to lead to violations of ANEC in curved spacetime. The problem is that quantum field theory by itself is not able to predict the values of $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, or equivalently, of $\mu$. Thus very large values of these parameters are not, a priori, ruled out. The status of these terms in the semiclassical Einstein equations has been the subject of much discussion in the literature. They appear to give rise to unstable behavior [19], analogous to the runaway solutions of the Lorentz-Dirac equation of classical electron theory. More recently Simon [20] has suggested that it may be possible to reformulate the semiclassical theory to avoid unstable solutions.</p>
<p>If one ignores the possibility of runaway solutions, then if these terms are to produce a significant correction to the geometry of a spacetime whose curvature is far below Planck dimensions, then at least one of the dimensionless constants $c_{1}$ or $c_{2}$ must be extremely large. The Einstein tensor is of order $l^{-2}$ and the $H_{\mu \nu}^{(1)}$ and $H_{\mu \nu}^{(2)}$ tensors are of order $l^{-4}$, in Planck units. The latter are negligible unless their coefficients are at least of order $\left(l / l_{p}\right)^{2}$, where $l_{p}$ is the Planck length. Thus if the state-independent geometrical part of $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$ is to be the source of the exotic matter which generates the wormhole geometry, either the wormhole must be of Planck dimensions, or else one must accept large dimensionless coefficients. For example, unless one of these constants is at least of order $10^{70}$, the quadratic curvature terms will be negligible for the discussion of a wormhole whose throat radius is of the order of 1 m . A value of $c_{1}$ or $c_{2}$ of $10^{70}$ could arise from a single quantum field or from $10^{70}$</p>
<p>fields each giving a contribution of order unity [21]. Both possibilities seem equally unnatural.</p>
<p>An alternative is for the state-dependent part of $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$ to be the source of the exotic matter. A non-exotic stress tensor may be made arbitrarily large by increasing the particle content of the quantum state. One might naively expect that the same could be done for a stress tensor representing exotic matter. However, the essential content of the quantum inequality Eq. (1) is that arbitrarily extended distributions of arbitrarily negative energy are not possible in Minkowski spacetime. In this section we have argued that the bound should also be applicable in curved spacetimes for sampling times small compared to either the minimum local radius of curvature or the proper distance to any boundary.</p>
<p>Let us recall that Eq. (1) was proven for the specific case of a free massless, minimally coupled scalar field. It should be straightforward to generalize the arguments of Ref. [13] to the case of other massless fields, such as the electromagnetic field. Although this has not yet been done, it is unlikely that the result will be significantly different. Generalizations to massive fields may also be possible, although the results may be more complicated due to the presence of two length scales, $\tau_{0}$ and the particle's Compton wavelength. However, it seems unlikely that adding a mass will make it easier to have large negative energy densities, as one now has to overcome the positive rest mass energy. Thus, one suspects that massive fields will satisfy inequalities which are more restrictive than Eq. (1). The effect of including interactions is the most difficult to assess. If an interacting theory were to allow regions of negative energy much more extensive than allowed in free theories, there would seem to be a danger of an instability where the system spontaneously makes a transition to configuration with large negative energy density. However, this must be regarded as an open question.</p>
<h1>3 Morris-Thorne Wormholes</h1>
<p>The spacetime geometry for an MT traversable wormhole is described by the metric $[1]:$</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-e^{2 \Phi(r)} d t^{2}+\frac{d r^{2}}{(1-b(r) / r)}+r^{2}\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>where the two adjustable functions $b(r)$ and $\Phi(r)$ are the "shape function" and the "redshift function", respectively. The shape function $b(r)$ determines the shape of the wormhole as viewed, for example, in an embedding diagram. The metric Eq. (13) is spherically symmetric and static, with the proper circumference of a circle of fixed $r$ being given by $2 \pi r$. The coordinate $r$ is non-monotonic in that it decreases from $+\infty$ to a minimum value $r_{0}$, representing the location of the throat of the wormhole, where $b\left(r_{0}\right)=r_{0}$, and then it increases from $r_{0}$ to $+\infty$. Although there is a coordinate singularity at the throat, where the metric coefficient $g_{r r}$ becomes divergent, the radial</p>
<p>proper distance</p>
<p>$$
l(r)= \pm \int_{r_{0}}^{r} \frac{d r}{(1-b(r) / r)^{1 / 2}}
$$</p>
<p>is required to be finite everywhere. Note that because $0 \leq 1-b(r) / r \leq 1$, the proper distance is greater than or equal to the coordinate distance: $|l(r)| \geq r-r_{0}$. The metric Eq. (13) may be written in terms of the proper radial distance as:</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-e^{2 \Phi(r)} d t^{2}+d l^{2}+r^{2}(l)\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>The proper distance decreases from $l=+\infty$ to zero at the throat, and then from zero to $-\infty$ on the "other side" of the wormhole. For the wormhole to be traversable it must have no horizons, which implies that $g_{t t}=-e^{2 \Phi(r)}$ must never be allowed to vanish, and hence $\Phi(r)$ must be everywhere finite.</p>
<p>The four-velocity of a static observer is $u^{\mu}=d x^{\mu} / d \tau=\left(u^{t}, 0,0,0\right)=\left(e^{-\Phi(r)}, 0,0,0\right)$. The observer's four-acceleration is</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{\mu} &amp; =\frac{D u^{\mu}}{d \tau} \
&amp; =u_{; \nu}^{\mu} u^{\nu} \
&amp; =\left(u_{, \nu}^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\beta \nu}^{\mu} u^{\beta}\right) u^{\nu}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>For the metric Eq. (13) we have</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
a^{t} &amp; =0 \
a^{r} &amp; =\Gamma_{t t}^{r}\left(\frac{d t}{d \tau}\right)^{2}=\Phi^{\prime}(1-b / r)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where $\Phi^{\prime}=d \Phi / d r$. From the geodesic equation, a radially moving test particle which starts from rest initially has the equation of motion</p>
<p>$$
\frac{d^{2} r}{d \tau^{2}}=-\Gamma_{t t}^{r}\left(\frac{d t}{d \tau}\right)^{2}=-a^{r}
$$</p>
<p>Hence $a^{r}$ is the radial component of proper acceleration that an observer must maintain in order to remain at rest at constant $r, \theta, \phi$. Note for future reference that from Eq. (17), a static observer at the throat of any wormhole is a geodesic observer. For $\Phi^{\prime}(r) \neq 0$ wormholes, static observers are not geodesic (except at the throat), whereas for $\Phi^{\prime}(r)=0$ wormholes they are. A wormhole is "attractive" if $a^{r}&gt;0$ (observers must maintain an outward-directed radial acceleration to keep from being pulled into the wormhole), and "repulsive" if $a^{r}&lt;0$ (observers must maintain an inward-directed radial acceleration to avoid being pushed away from the wormhole). From Eq. (17), this distinction depends on the sign of $\Phi^{\prime}$. For $a^{r}=0$, the wormhole is neither attractive nor repulsive.</p>
<p>Substitution of Eq. (13) into the Einstein equations gives the stress-energy tensor required to generate the wormhole geometry. It is often convenient to work in the static orthonormal frame given by the basis:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
e_{\hat{t}} &amp; =e^{-\Phi} e_{t} \
e_{\hat{r}} &amp; =(1-b / r)^{1 / 2} e_{r} \
e_{\hat{\theta}} &amp; =r^{-1} e_{\theta} \
e_{\hat{\phi}} &amp; =(r \sin \theta)^{-1} e_{\phi}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>This basis represents the proper reference frame of an observer who is at rest relative to the wormhole. In this frame the stress tensor components are given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{\hat{t} \hat{t}} &amp; =\rho=\frac{b^{\prime}}{8 \pi r^{2}} \
T_{\hat{r} \hat{r}} &amp; =p_{r}=-\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left[\frac{b}{r^{3}}-\frac{2 \Phi^{\prime}}{r}\left(1-\frac{b}{r}\right)\right] \
T_{\hat{\theta} \hat{\theta}} &amp; =T_{\hat{\phi} \hat{\phi}}=P \
&amp; =\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{b}{r^{3}}-\frac{b^{\prime}}{r^{2}}\right)+\frac{\Phi^{\prime}}{r}\left(1-\frac{b}{2 r}-\frac{b^{\prime}}{2}\right)+\left(1-\frac{b}{r}\right)\left(\Phi^{\prime \prime}+\left(\Phi^{\prime}\right)^{2}\right)\right]
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>The quantities $\rho, p_{r}$, and $P$ are the mass-energy density, radial pressure, and transverse pressure, respectively, as measured by a static observer [22]. At the throat of the wormhole, $r=r_{0}$, these reduce to</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho_{0} &amp; =\frac{b_{0}^{\prime}}{8 \pi r_{0}^{2}} \

P_{0} &amp; =\frac{1-b_{0}^{\prime}}{16 \pi r_{0}}\left(\Phi_{0}^{\prime}+\frac{1}{r_{0}}\right)

$$</p>
<p>where $b_{0}^{\prime}=b^{\prime}\left(r_{0}\right)$ and $\Phi_{0}^{\prime}=\Phi^{\prime}\left(r_{0}\right)$.
The curvature tensor components are given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}

<p>$$
\begin{aligned}

$$</p>
<p>The choice of plus or minus signs in the various terms of the above equations will depend on the signs of the derivatives of $b$ and $\Phi$, which will in turn depend on the specific wormhole geometry.</p>
<p>Let the magnitude of the maximum curvature component be $R_{\max }$. Since the largest value of $(1-b / r)$ and of $b / r$ is 1 , an examination of Eqs. (37)- (40) shows that</p>
<p>$R_{\max } \lesssim 1 /\left(r_{m}{ }^{2}\right)$. Therefore the smallest proper radius of curvature (which is also the coordinate radius of curvature in an orthonormal frame) is:</p>

<p>We wish to work in a small spacetime volume around the throat of the wormhole such that all dimensions of this volume are much smaller than $r_{c}$, the smallest proper radius of curvature anywhere in the region. Thus, in the absence of boundaries, spacetime can be considered to be approximately Minkowskian in this region, and we should be able to apply our QI-bound.</p>
<h1>4 Specific Examples</h1>
<p>To develop physical intuition for the general case, as well as to get a feeling for the magnitudes of the numbers involved, in this section we apply our bound to a series of specific examples.</p>
<h2>$4.1 \Phi=0, b=r_{0}^{2} / r$ Wormholes</h2>
<p>This is a particularly simple wormhole which is discussed in Box 2 and the bottom left-hand column of p. 400 of Ref. [1]. In terms of the proper radial distance $l(r)$, the metric is:</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-d t^{2}+d l^{2}+\left(r_{0}^{2}+l^{2}\right)\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $l= \pm\left(r^{2}-r_{0}{ }^{2}\right)$. (Recall that $l=0$ at the throat.) The stress-tensor components are given by</p>
<p>$$
\rho=p_{r}=-P=-\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{8 \pi r^{4}}=-\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{8 \pi\left(r_{0}^{2}+l^{2}\right)^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>The curvature components are</p>
<p>$$
R_{\theta \dot{\phi} \dot{\theta} \dot{\phi}}=-R_{l \theta l \theta}=-R_{l \dot{\phi} l \dot{\phi}}=\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{\left(r_{0}^{2}+l^{2}\right)^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>Note that all the curvature components are equal in magnitude, and have their maximum magnitude $1 /\left(r_{0}{ }^{2}\right)$ at the throat. The same holds true for the stress-tensor components. At the throat, our length scales are $\bar{r}<em 0="0">{0}=r</em>$.}=r_{1}$, so $r_{c}=r_{0</p>
<p>Let us apply our QI-bound to a static observer at $r=r_{0}$. (Recall that such an observer is geodesic.) Since the energy density seen by this static observer is constant we have</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\tau_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle d \tau}{\tau^{2}+\tau_{0}^{2}}=\rho_{0} \gtrsim-\frac{c}{\tau_{0}^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>where $c \equiv 3 /\left(32 \pi^{2}\right), \tau$ is the observer's proper time, and $\tau_{0}$ is the sampling time. Choose our sampling time to be: $\tau_{0}=f r_{m}=f r_{0} \ll r_{c}$, with $f \ll 1$. Substitution into Eq. (50) yields</p>
<p>$$
r_{0} \lesssim \frac{l_{p}}{2 f^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>where $l_{p}$ is the Planck length. Here it is fairly obvious that any reasonable choice of $f$ gives a value of $r_{0}$ which is not much larger than $l_{p}$. For example, for $f \approx 0.01$, $r_{0} \lesssim 10^{4} l_{p}=10^{-31} \mathrm{~m}$. Note from Eqs. (48) and (49) that if we choose our spacetime region to be such that $l \ll r_{0}$, then the curvature and stress-tensor components do not change very much.</p>
<h1>4.2 $\Phi=0, b=r_{0}=$ const Wormholes</h1>
<p>For this wormhole $\Phi=0$ and $b=$ const, so $b^{\prime}=0$, and therefore $\rho=0$. This is a special case of the "zero density" wormholes [23]. Here $g_{t t}$ is the same as for Minkowski spacetime, while the spatial sections are the same as those of Schwarzschild. The energy density and radial pressure seen by a static observer are:</p>
<p>$$
\rho=0 ; p_{r}=-\frac{r_{0}}{8 \pi r^{3}}
$$</p>
<p>Since the energy density is zero in the static frame, to obtain a bound we boost to the frame of a radially moving geodesic observer. The energy density in the boosted frame is, by a Lorentz transformation,</p>
<p>$$
T_{\dot{0} \gamma \dot{r}}=\rho^{\prime}=\gamma^{2}\left(\rho+v^{2} p_{r}\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $v$ is the velocity of the boosted observer relative to the static frame, and $\gamma=\left(1-v^{2}\right)^{-1 / 2}$. In our case, we have</p>
<p>$$
\rho^{\prime}=-\frac{\gamma^{2} v^{2} r_{0}}{8 \pi r^{3}}
$$</p>
<p>Note that in this case any non-zero $v$ gives $\rho^{\prime}&lt;0$, in contrast to the discussion surrounding Eq. (57) of Ref. [1]. The non-zero curvature components in the static frame are</p>
<p>$$
R_{\dot{r} \dot{\theta} \dot{r} \dot{\theta}}=R_{\dot{r} \dot{\phi} \dot{r} \dot{\phi}}=-\frac{r_{0}}{2 r^{3}} ; R_{\dot{\theta} \dot{\phi} \dot{\theta} \dot{\phi}}=\frac{r_{0}}{r^{3}}
$$</p>
<p>Here the only relevant length scale is $r_{0}$, since $\Phi=0$ and $b=r_{0}$ everywhere. For a general wormhole, when we boost to the radially moving frame, we have</p>

$$</p>
<p>In the vicinity of the throat, the magnitude of the maximum curvature component in the boosted frame is $R_{\max }^{\prime} \lesssim \gamma^{2} /\left(r_{0}{ }^{2}\right)$, and therefore the smallest local proper radius of curvature in that frame is $r_{c}^{\prime} \gtrsim r_{0} / \gamma$. Apply our QI-bound to the boosted observer and take $\tau_{0}=f r_{0} / \gamma \ll r_{c}^{\prime}$, for $f \ll 1$. Since the energy density does not change much over this timescale, we may write</p>

<h1>4.3 "Absurdly Benign" Wormholes</h1>
<p>Classically, one can design a wormhole so that the exotic matter is confined to an arbitrarily small region around the throat. MT call this an "absurdly benign" wormhole. It is given by the choices $\Phi=0$ everywhere and</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
b(r) &amp; =r_{0}\left[1-\left(r-r_{0}\right) / a_{0}\right]^{2}, \quad \text { for } r_{0} \leq r \leq r_{0}+a_{0} \
&amp; =0, \quad \text { for } r \geq r_{0}+a_{0}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>For $r_{0} \leq r&lt;r_{0}+a_{0}$,</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho &amp; =-\frac{r_{0}}{4 \pi r^{2} a_{0}^{2}}\left(a_{0}+r_{0}-r\right)&lt;0 \
p_{r} &amp; =-\frac{r_{0}}{8 \pi r^{3} a_{0}^{2}}\left(a_{0}+r_{0}-r\right)^{2} \
P &amp; =-\frac{1}{2}\left(\rho+p_{r}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>For $r \geq r_{0}+a_{0}$, the spacetime is Minkowski, and $\rho=p_{r}=P=0$. The quantity $a_{0}$ represents the thickness in $r$ (on one side of the wormhole) of the negative energy region. Evaluation of the curvature components using Eq. (61) shows that they have maximum magnitude at the throat where</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; \left.R_{\hat{r} \hat{\theta} \hat{r} \hat{\theta}} \right|<em 0="0">{r</em>\right|}}=\left.R_{\hat{r} \hat{\phi} \hat{r} \hat{\phi}<em 0="0">{r</em> \
&amp; \left.R_{\hat{\theta} \hat{\phi} \hat{\theta} \hat{\phi}}\right|}}=-\frac{1}{a_{0} r_{0}}-\frac{1}{2 r_{0}{ }^{2}<em 0="0">{r</em>
\end{aligned}
$$}}=\frac{1}{r_{0}{ }^{2}</p>
<p>At the throat, our length scales become</p>
<p>$$
\bar{r}<em 0="0">{0}=r</em>
$$} ; r_{1}=\frac{a_{0}}{2</p>
<p>and $r_{m}=\min \left(r_{0}, r_{1}\right)$. Again we see that $R_{\max } \lesssim 1 /\left(r_{m}{ }^{2}\right)$, and so the smallest local radius of curvature is $r_{c} \gtrsim r_{m}$.</p>
<p>Application of our QI-bound to a static observer at the throat yields</p>
<p>$$
\rho_{0}=-\frac{1}{4 \pi a_{0} r_{0}} \gtrsim-\frac{c}{\tau_{0}^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>Although this wormhole was designed for maximum confinement of the negative energy near the throat, i.e., $a_{0} \ll r_{0}$, there is nothing in principle to keep us from choosing $a_{0} \gtrsim r_{0}$. In what follows, we shall consider both situations. First assume $a_{0}&lt;r_{0}$. We then choose our sampling time to be: $\tau_{0}=f a_{0}$, where $f \ll 1$. Equation (68) then yields</p>
<p>$$
a_{0} \lesssim\left(\frac{r_{0}}{8 f^{4} l_{p}}\right)^{1 / 3} l_{p}
$$</p>
<p>A reasonable choice of $f$ is $f \approx 0.01$. For a small "human sized" wormhole with $r_{0} \approx 1 m$, our bound gives $a_{0} \lesssim 10^{14} l_{p} \approx 10^{-21} m \approx 10^{-6}$ fermi, or approximately a millionth of the proton radius. The situation does not improve much for larger wormholes. For $r_{0} \approx 1$ light year, $a_{0} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{19} l_{p} \approx 0.2$ fermi. With $r_{0} \approx 10^{5}$ light years, $a_{0} \lesssim 10^{21} l_{p} \approx 10^{-14} \mathrm{~m}$. So even with a throat radius the size of a galaxy, the negative energy must be distributed in a band no thicker than about 10 proton radii. Now suppose that $r_{0}&lt;a_{0} / 2$, so that $r_{m}=r_{0}$. In that case, we choose $\tau_{0}=f r_{0}$, and our bound gives</p>
<p>$$
r_{0} \lesssim\left(\frac{a_{0}}{8 f^{4} l_{p}}\right)^{1 / 3} l_{p}
$$</p>
<p>i.e., $a_{0}$ and $r_{0}$ are simply interchanged. Therefore, the same numerical examples just discussed now apply to $r_{0}$, for given choices of $a_{0}$. For example, when $a_{0} \approx 1$ light year, now the throat size is less than about 0.2 fermi, so that even for very large $a_{0}$, $r_{0}$ must be extremely small. When $a_{0} \approx r_{0}$, the bound on $r_{0}$ is essentially Eq. (51). One might worry that since $a_{0}$ is the coordinate thickness in $r$ of the negative energy density, it might not be a good measure of the proper radial thickness of the negative energy density band seen by the static observer. In fact, a detailed calculation shows that $a_{0}$ is the proper thickness in this case, to within factors of order unity.</p>
<h1>4.4 "Proximal Schwarzschild" Wormholes</h1>
<p>Another special case of a zero density wormhole is the "proximal Schwarzschild" wormhole [24]. Here $b=r_{0}=$ const, and $g_{t t}$ is only slightly different from that of Schwarzschild. The metric in this case is:</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{r_{0}}{r}+\frac{\epsilon}{r^{2}}\right) d t^{2}+\frac{d r^{2}}{\left(1-r_{0} / r\right)}+r^{2}\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>We recover the Schwarzschild solution for $\epsilon=0$; however, any $\epsilon&gt;0$ gives us a wormhole. The energy density and radial pressure seen by a static observer are</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho &amp; =0 \
p_{r} &amp; =-\frac{\epsilon}{8 \pi r^{4}} \frac{\left(2-r_{0} / r\right)}{\left(1-r_{0} / r+\epsilon / r^{2}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>We will assume that $\sqrt{\epsilon} \ll r_{0}$, hence the radial pressure is highly peaked near the throat. Here the proper distance from $r=r_{0}$ to $r=r_{0}+\sqrt{\epsilon}$, corresponding to the</p>
<p>coordinate thickness $\sqrt{\epsilon}$, is</p>
<p>$$
\Delta l=\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{0}+\sqrt{\epsilon}} \frac{d r}{\sqrt{1-r_{0} / r}} \approx \int_{r_{0}}^{r_{0}+\sqrt{\epsilon}} \frac{\sqrt{r_{0}} d r}{\sqrt{r-r_{0}}}=2 \sqrt{r_{0} \sqrt{\epsilon}}
$$</p>
<p>A disadvantage of this wormhole is that it entails extremely large redshifts. The metric coefficient $g_{t t}$ is very close to that of Schwarzschild, and therefore this wormhole is very close to having a horizon at its throat.</p>
<p>In the region $r_{0} \leq r \leq r_{0}+\sqrt{\epsilon}$, the curvature components have their maximum magnitudes at the throat (except $R_{\hat{\imath} \hat{\theta} \hat{\imath} \hat{\theta}}=R_{\hat{\imath} \hat{\phi} \hat{\imath} \hat{\phi}}$, which vanish there). At $r=r_{0}$,</p>

R_{\left.\hat{\theta} \hat{\phi} \hat{\theta}\right| r_{0}} &amp; =\frac{1}{r_{0}^{2}}
\end{aligned}

<p>Our length scales at the throat become</p>

\bar{r}<em 0="0">{0}=r</em>
$$} ; r_{1}=\infty ; R_{2} \approx \frac{2 \epsilon}{r_{0}} ; r_{3} \approx \frac{\epsilon}{r_{0}</p>
<p>Note that $r_{1}=\infty$ is due to the fact that $b^{\prime}=0$. Although we can write the curvature components in terms of these length scales, in this case the smallest radius of curvature in the static frame is $r_{c} \approx 1 / \sqrt{R_{\max }} \approx 2 \sqrt{\epsilon}$, which is larger than our smallest length scale $r_{m}=r_{3}$. Thus we will get a stronger bound if we frame our argument in terms of $r_{c} \approx 2 \sqrt{\epsilon}$.</p>
<p>Since the energy density is zero in the static frame, we must apply our bound in the frame of a boosted observer passing through the throat. The curvature tensor components in this frame are</p>

\end{aligned}
$$}}}=\frac{1}{r_{0}^{2}</p>
<p>Which of these components has the maximum magnitude depends on whether $\sqrt{2 \epsilon}$ is greater than or less than $r_{0} / \gamma$.</p>
<p>First consider the case: $\sqrt{2 \epsilon}&lt;r_{0} / \gamma$. Then $R_{\max }^{\prime}=R_{\max } \approx 1 /(4 \epsilon)$, and $r_{c}^{\prime}=r_{c} \approx$ $2 \sqrt{\epsilon}$. Take $\tau_{0}=f r_{c}^{\prime} \approx 2 f \sqrt{\epsilon}$, with $f&lt;&lt;1$. The energy density in the boosted frame should be approximately constant over this sampling time. Therefore, our QI-bound gives</p>
<p>$$
\rho_{0}^{\prime}=-\frac{\gamma^{2} v^{2}}{8 \pi r_{0}^{2}} \gtrsim-\frac{c}{\tau_{0}^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>and hence</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\sqrt{\epsilon}}{r_{0}} \lesssim\left(\frac{1-v^{2}}{64 v^{2} f^{4}}\right)^{1 / 4}\left(\frac{l_{p}}{r_{0}}\right)^{1 / 2}
$$</p>
<p>By making $v$ arbitrarily close to 1 , we can make the right-hand side of the bound arbitrarily small.</p>
<p>It may be more appropriate to express the width of the band of exotic matter in the static frame in terms of proper length, rather than coordinate length. Using Eq. (74), our bound Eq. (81) can be rewritten as</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\Delta l}{r_{0}} \lesssim\left(\frac{1-v^{2}}{v^{2} f^{4}}\right)^{1 / 8}\left(\frac{l_{p}}{r_{0}}\right)^{1 / 4}
$$</p>
<p>In this form, the bound is quite a bit weaker, due to the smaller powers on the right-hand side of the inequality. We can still in principle make the right-hand side arbitrarily small, albeit only by choosing $v$ exceedingly close to 1 . However, our bound must hold for any boosted observer. Consequently, for the case $\sqrt{2 \epsilon}&lt;r_{0} / \gamma$, proximal Schwarzschild wormholes with any finite value of $\Delta l$ would seem to be physically excluded.</p>
<p>Next consider the case where $\sqrt{2 \epsilon}&gt;r_{0} / \gamma$. Then $R_{\max }^{\prime}=\gamma^{2} /\left(2 r_{0}{ }^{2}\right)$, and the smallest local radius of curvature in the boosted frame is $r_{c}^{\prime} \approx \sqrt{2} r_{0} / \gamma$. Take $\tau_{0}=f r_{c}^{\prime}$, with $f \ll 1$. Application of our bound in this case yields</p>
<p>$$
r_{0} \lesssim \frac{\sqrt{2 \pi c}}{f^{2}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{v}\right)
$$</p>
<p>We get the optimum bound by minimizing $\gamma / v$, i.e.,</p>
<p>$$
r_{0} \lesssim \frac{l_{p}}{2 f^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>which is the same as the bound we obtained in the $\Phi=0, b=r_{0}{ }^{2} / r$ case.</p>
<h1>4.5 The Morris-Thorne-Yurtsever Wormhole</h1>
<p>Morris, Thorne, and Yurtsever (MTY) [2] have discussed a wormhole consisting of an $r_{0}=Q=M$ Reissner-Nordström (RN) metric with a pair of spherical charged Casimir plates positioned on each side of the throat within a very small proper distance, $s$, of one another. That is, the spacetime is extreme RN from each plate out</p>
<p>to $r=\infty$, and approximately flat between the plates. The Casimir energy density between the plates is negative, while the stress-energy of the external classical electromagnetic field is "near exotic", i.e., $\left.\left(\rho_{c}+p_{c}\right)\right|<em 0="0">{E M}=0$. For $r \geq r</em>+\delta$, the metric has the extreme RN form</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-\left(1-\frac{M}{r}\right)^{2} d t^{2}+\frac{d r^{2}}{(1-M / r)^{2}}+r^{2}\left(d \theta^{2}+\sin ^{2} \theta d \phi^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>MTY show that for this wormhole</p>
<p>$$
p_{0}=-\frac{1}{8 \pi r_{0}^{2}}=p_{\text {Casimir }}
$$</p>
<p>Then because $\rho_{\text {Casimir }}=\frac{1}{3} p_{\text {Casimir }}$ and $\rho_{\text {Casimir }}=\rho_{0}$, it follows that $\rho_{0}=-\left(24 \pi r_{0}^{2}\right)^{-1}$. If we apply our bound to a (very tiny) static observer at the throat, we obtain</p>
<p>$$
-\frac{1}{24 \pi r_{0}^{2}} \gtrsim-\frac{c}{\tau_{0}^{4}}
$$</p>
<p>Because spacetime is approximately flat between the plates, the constraint on the choice of $\tau_{0}$ is that discussed in the Casimir effect example in Sec. 2. Take $\tau_{0}=f s$, whereupon we find:</p>
<p>$$
r_{0} \gtrsim f^{2} s^{2}
$$</p>
<p>A reasonable choice of $f$ in this case would seem to be $f \approx 0.1$. For $s \approx 10^{-10} \mathrm{~cm} \approx$ $10^{23} l_{p}$, one finds that: $r_{0} \gtrsim 10^{44} l_{p} \sim 0.01 A . U .$. Since MTY calculate $r_{0} \approx 1 A . U$. for a plate separation of $s \approx 10^{-10} \mathrm{~cm}$, this wormhole satisfies our bound.</p>
<p>However, this wormhole has a number of undesirable features. First, in order to traverse it, an observer must go through the plates. This implies that "holes" or "trapdoors" must be cut in the plates to allow passage. Second, because the plates are located at $r \approx r_{0}+\delta$, with $\delta \approx 10^{-10} \mathrm{~cm}$ (neglecting the thickness of the plates), this wormhole is extremely close to being a black hole, i.e., $\left|g_{t t}\right|<em 0="0">{r</em>$. A static observer just outside the plates would likely be incinerated by infalling radiation. Similarly, the plates would have to be constructed out of material capable of withstanding these large energies. In addition, the large local impacts of infalling radiation and particles on the plates will tend to push them together, thereby upsetting the force balance, and hence will probably destabilize the wormhole. One could imagine elaborate radiation shielding constructed around a large region far away from, but enclosing, the wormhole. However, if the wormhole is unstable to infalling radiation, then infalling spaceships would seem like an even more remote possibility.}+\delta}=(1-M / r)^{2} \approx$ $\delta^{2} / M^{2}$. Infalling photons with frequency-at-infinity $\omega_{\infty}$ will have local frequency $\omega_{\text {local }} \approx \omega_{\infty}(M / \delta)$, as measured by a static observer on the plate. For $\delta \approx 10^{-10} \mathrm{~cm}$ and $r_{0} \approx M \approx 1$ A.U. $\approx 10^{13} \mathrm{~cm}$, we have: $\omega_{\text {local }} \approx 10^{23} \omega_{\infty}$. A typical infalling $3 K$ photon in the cosmic microwave background radiation, upon arriving at one of the plates, would get blueshifted to a temperature $T_{\text {local }} \approx 10^{23} \mathrm{~K}$. A 0.1 MeV $\gamma$-ray photon would get blueshifted to $E_{\text {local }} \approx 10^{19} \mathrm{GeV} \approx E_{p}$, where $E_{p}$ is the Planck energy. Stray cosmic ray particles, with typical energies of $\sim 1 \mathrm{GeV}$, falling into the wormhole will have $E_{\text {local }} \approx E_{\infty}(M / \delta) \approx 10^{23} \mathrm{GeV} \approx 10^{4} E_{p</p>
<h1>5 General Bounds for Wormholes</h1>
<p>In this section QI-bounds will be formulated on the relative size scales of arbitrary static, spherically symmetric, MT wormholes, i.e., no assumptions will be made about the specific forms of $\Phi(r)$ and $b(r)$. We work in the vicinity of the throat and analyze two general subcases: 1) $b_{0}^{\prime}&lt;0$, and 2) $b_{0}^{\prime} \geq 0$. Let $r_{m}$ be the smallest of the length scales: $\bar{r}<em 1="1">{0}, r</em>$. Spacetime can be considered to be approximately flat in this region, and therefore our QI-bound should be applicable.}, R_{2}, r_{3}$, in this region. We saw from Eqs. (37)- (40) in Sec. 3 that the magnitude of the maximum curvature component in this region is $R_{\max } \lesssim 1 /\left(r_{m}{ }^{2}\right)$. It follows that the smallest proper radius of curvature (in the static orthonormal frame) is $r_{c} \approx 1 / \sqrt{R_{\max }} \gtrsim r_{m</p>
<h3>5.1 Case 1): $b_{0}^{\prime}&lt;0$</h3>
<p>Since $b_{0}^{\prime}&lt;0$, the energy density is negative at the throat, so we can apply our bound to a static observer at the throat. This observer is geodesic, and the energy density is constant, so we have</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\tau_{0}}{\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\left\langle T_{\mu \nu} u^{\mu} u^{\nu}\right\rangle d \tau}{\tau^{2}+\tau_{0}{ }^{2}} &amp; =\rho_{0} \
&amp; =\frac{b_{0}^{\prime}}{8 \pi r_{0}{ }^{2}} \gtrsim-\frac{c}{\tau_{0}{ }^{4}}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where again $c \equiv 3 /\left(32 \pi^{2}\right), \tau$ is the observer's proper time, and $\tau_{0}$ is the sampling time. Choose our sampling time to be: $\tau_{0}=f r_{m} \ll r_{c}$, with $f \ll 1$. Our QI then becomes</p>
<p>$$
r_{m} \lesssim\left(\frac{8 \pi c}{\left|b_{0}^{\prime}\right|}\right)^{1 / 4} \frac{\sqrt{r_{0}}}{f}
$$</p>
<p>Since our observer is static at the throat, we may write $\left|b_{0}^{\prime}\right|=r_{0} / r_{1}$, and use $8 \pi c \approx$ $1 / 4$, to get</p>
<p>$$
r_{m} \lesssim \frac{\left(r_{0} r_{1}\right)^{1 / 4}}{f}
$$</p>
<p>or alternatively,</p>
<p>$$
\frac{r_{m}}{r_{0}} \lesssim \frac{1}{f}\left(\frac{r_{1} l_{p}^{2}}{r_{0}^{3}}\right)^{1 / 4}
$$</p>
<p>Now examine specific cases. For $r_{m}=r_{0}$, we have: $r_{0} / r_{1} \lesssim f^{-4 / 3}\left(l_{p} / r_{1}\right)^{2 / 3}$. As an example, if $r_{1} \approx 1 \mathrm{~m}$ and for $f \approx 0.01$, then $r_{0} / r_{1} \lesssim 10^{-21}$. Even if we choose $f$ to be very small this large discrepancy in length scales will not change much, and only increases as $r_{1}$ increases. For $r_{m}=r_{1}, r_{1} / r_{0} \lesssim f^{-4 / 3}\left(l_{p} / r_{0}\right)^{2 / 3}$, so for $r_{0} \approx 1 \mathrm{~m}$ and $f \approx 0.01, r_{1} / r_{0} \lesssim 10^{-21}$. Again the problem only gets worse as the throat size, $r_{0}$, increases. When $r_{m}=r_{0}=r_{1}: r_{0} \lesssim l_{p} / f^{2}$; for $f \approx 0.01, r_{0} \lesssim 10^{4} l_{p} \sim 10^{-31} \mathrm{~m}$. For $\Phi=$ const wormholes, the only relevant length scales are $r_{0}$ and $r_{1}$. The above</p>
<p>results imply that when $b_{0}^{\prime}&lt;0$ these wormholes are extremely unlikely, unless one is willing to accept a huge discrepancy in length scales. For $r_{m}=R_{2}$ and $R_{2} \leq r_{0} \leq r_{1}$, from Eq. (91) we have that: $R_{2} / r_{1} \lesssim(1 / f)\left(r_{0} l_{p}{ }^{2} / r_{1}{ }^{3}\right)^{1 / 4} \lesssim(1 / f)\left(l_{p} / r_{1}\right)^{1 / 2}$. For $r_{m}=R_{2}$ and $R_{2} \leq r_{1} \leq r_{0}: R_{2} / r_{0} \lesssim(1 / f)\left(l_{p} / r_{0}\right)^{1 / 2}$. An identical argument yields similar inequalities for the case where $r_{m}=r_{3}$. Thus we find that if $r_{0}$ and/or $r_{1}$ are macroscopic, then the ratio of the minimum length scale to the macroscopic length scale must be very tiny.</p>
<p>If the minimum scale happens to be $R_{2}$, then our bounds imply that either $r_{2}$, the scale over which $\Phi$ changes, is very small or $|\Phi|$ is very large, or both. A situation in which $|\Phi|$ is very large near the throat, assuming $\Phi(\infty)=0$, would not seem to be a desirable characteristic of a traversable wormhole, as it implies very large redshifts or blueshifts for a static observer at the throat. A large negative $\Phi_{0}$ implies that the spacetime is close to having a horizon at the throat. A large positive $\Phi_{0}$ implies that photons of moderate frequency fired outward by an observer at the throat would be blueshifted to very high frequencies upon reaching distant observers. In the latter case, observers must be shot inward with initially large kinetic energies in order to reach the throat.</p>
<p>If some of the wormhole parameters change over very short length scales, then it would seem from the "tidal force constraints" (see Eqs. (49) and (50) of MT) that tidal accelerations might also change over very short length scales. As a result, an observer travelling through the wormhole could encounter potentially wrenching tidal forces rather abruptly. None of these scenarios seem terribly convenient for wormhole engineering.</p>
<h1>5.2 Case 2): $b_{0}^{\prime} \geq 0$</h1>
<p>When $b_{0}^{\prime} \geq 0$, the energy density at the throat is non-negative for static observers. To obtain a bound in this case, we Lorentz-transform to the frame of a radially moving boosted observer at the throat. Since the maximum magnitude curvature component in the static frame is $R_{\max } \lesssim 1 /\left(r_{m}{ }^{2}\right)$, in the boosted frame the curvature component with the largest magnitude, $R_{\max }^{\prime}$, can be no larger than about $\gamma^{2} / r_{m}{ }^{2}$. Therefore, the smallest proper radius of curvature in the boosted frame is $r_{c}^{\prime} \approx 1 / \sqrt{R_{\max }^{\prime}} \gtrsim r_{m} / \gamma$. Spacetime should be approximately flat in the boosted frame on scales much less than $r_{c}^{\prime}$. Hence let us take our sampling time to be: $\tau_{0}=f r_{m} / \gamma \ll r_{c}^{\prime}$, with $f \ll 1$. The energy density in this frame should not change much over the sampling time, so the application of our bound gives</p>
