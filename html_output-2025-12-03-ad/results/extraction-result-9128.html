                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> On The 5D Extra-Force according to Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon Formalism and ﬁve important features: Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light,Chung-Freese Superluminal Behaviour,Maartens-Clarkson Black Strings,Experimental measures of Extra Dimensions on board International Space Station(ISS) and the existence of the Particle Z due to a Higher Dimensional spacetime.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We use the Conformal Metric as described in Kar-Sinha work on Gravitational Bending of Light in a 5 D Spacetime to recompute the equations of the 5 D Force in Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon Formalism and we arrive at a result that possesses some advantages. The equations of the Extra Force as proposed by Ponce De Leon are now more elegant in Conformal Formalism and many algebraic terms can be simpliﬁed or even suppressed. Also we recompute the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light aﬀected by the presence of the Extra Dimension and analyze the Superluminal Chung-Freese Features of this Formalism describing the advantages of the Chung-Freese BraneWorld when compared to other Superluminal spacetime metrics(eg:Warp Drive) and we describe why the Extra Dimension is invisible and how the Extra Dimension could be made visible at least in theory.We also examine the Maartens-Clarkson Black Holes in 5 D (Black Strings) coupled to massive Kaluza-Klein graviton modes predicted by Extra Dimensions theories and we study experimental detection of Extra Dimensions on-board LIGO and LISA Space Telescopes.We also propose the use of International Space Station(ISS) to measure the additional terms(resulting from the presence of Extra Dimensions) in the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light in Outer Space to verify if we really lives in a Higher Dimensional Spacetime.Also we demonstrate that Particle Z can only exists if the 5 D spacetime exists.</p>

September 5, 2006On The 5D Extra-Force according to Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon Formalism and five important features: Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light,Chung-Freese Superluminal Behaviour,Maartens-Clarkson Black Strings,Experimental measures of Extra Dimensions on board International Space Station(ISS) and the existence of the Particle Z due to a Higher Dimensional spacetime.
We use the Conformal Metric as described in Kar-Sinha work on Gravitational Bending of Light in a 5D Spacetime to recompute the equations of the 5D Force in Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon Formalism and we arrive at a result that possesses some advantages. The equations of the Extra Force as proposed by Ponce De Leon are now more elegant in Conformal Formalism and many algebraic terms can be simplified or even suppressed. Also we recompute the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light affected by the presence of the Extra Dimension and analyze the Superluminal Chung-Freese Features of this Formalism describing the advantages of the Chung-Freese BraneWorld when compared to other Superluminal spacetime metrics(eg:Warp Drive) and we describe why the Extra Dimension is invisible and how the Extra Dimension could be made visible at least in theory.We also examine the Maartens-Clarkson Black Holes in 5D(Black Strings) coupled to massive Kaluza-Klein graviton modes predicted by Extra Dimensions theories and we study experimental detection of Extra Dimensions on-board LIGO and LISA Space Telescopes.We also propose the use of International Space Station(ISS) to measure the additional terms(resulting from the presence of Extra Dimensions) in the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light in Outer Space to verify if we really lives in a Higher Dimensional Spacetime.Also we demonstrate that Particle Z can only exists if the 5D spacetime exists. * spacetimeshortcut@yahoo.com † Av 5 de Outubro 289 3 a 4 andar 1600-035 http://universitas.pt.to</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The fact that we may possibly live in a Universe that possesses more than 3+1 dimensions is not new.It appeared for the first time in 1918 in the works of Theodore Kaluza and Oskar Klein. Recent attempts to unify Gravity with other interactions and explanations for the so-called "Hierarchy Problem of Energy Scales" also employed Extra Dimensions compactified or large in its mathematical models. We use in this work the Induced Mass of STM(Space-Time-Matter) 1 theory and Warp-Factorizable/Warp Fields Metrics 2 (Ponce De Leon-Kar-Sinha eq 14 pg 1340 in [2] and eq 12-15 pg 1780 in [3]) where all 3 + 1 particles have the same mass in 5D and the Warp Field is the responsible for the different masses we observe in the 3 + 1 spacetime. From a philosophical point of view this idea is wonderful because it explains all the multitudes of masses charges and spins of so many "apparent" different particles as functions of a small(?) group of particles(pg 117 in [1]) all with perhaps the same physical features moving in 5D and the 5D geodesics behavior coupled with the Warp Field projects in our 3 + 1 spacetime all these "different" measures(eq 20 and 22 pg 1341 and eq 26 and 27 in [2]). To better illustrate the idea of these Warp Field effects from 5D into 4D that can perhaps explain why we have so many elementar particles leading to the final "unification" of physics:look at the equation 20 in [2] in which it can be seen that rest masses of particles in 4D are function of the rest mass of the particles in 5D affected by the Warp Factor,Warp Field and geodesics paths in 5D.Two particles with the same rest mass in 5D but different geodesics motion and/or Warp Factors/Fields would be seen in 4D with different rest masses...perhaps all the huge number of elementary particles in 4D are really a small group of particles in 5D moving at different speeds or affected by different fields or factors generating the apparent different rest masses seen in 4D.This could of course short the way to the final "unification" of physics.The quest for Extra Dimensions addressed here is a little bit different than in other works on the same subject:Many other works argue that Extra Dimensions are compactified or large but with trapping mechanisms to keep matter in the 3 + 1 spacetime in an attempt to explain why we do not "see" more than 3 spatial dimensions( [4]). In this work we assume that we can "see" the ordinary 3D spatial dimensions but we are not able to "see" the 4D dimension associated to time although we can "feel" it. Hence we cannot "see" the 5D dimension associated to the masses of the particles(although we can use the 5D for Superluminal Travel fig 1 pg 135 in [1] and [4]) but we can also "feel" it. When we refer ourselves to "see" a dimension is the perception of the space-like nature of the ordinary dimensions of our everyday life.We cannot perceive 4D time-like dimension in the same way of the 3D space-like dimensions and the situation is analogue for the 5D mass-like dimension. (this is well explained in pg 123 in [1]). Our 5D is a large and non-compactified Extra Dimension and every particle in 3 + 1 spacetime from a 5D metric with Warp Factors and Warp Fields possesses the observable features we can measure resulting all from a projection of a 5D motion coupled with the Warp physical measures. We apply in this work the Conformal Metric Structure of Kar-Sinha to the equations of Ponce De Leon and Basini-Capozziello Formalism to arrive at some interesting results:</p>
<p>• -Many algebraic expressions in Ponce De Leon can be simplified or even suppressed making these new Conformal Expressions more easily mathematically handled</p>
<p>• -Applied to Ponce De Leon equations will leads us to results that matches exactly the results of Basini-Capozziello Also we recompute the Kar-Sinha Bending of Light and analyze the Chung-Freese Superluminal behaviour and the Maartens-Clarkson Schwarzchild Black Hole in 5D(Black String). This work have the following structure:in Section 2 we introduce a brief overview of Ponce De Leon 5D formalism,in Section 3 the Kar-Sinha Conformal Metric applied to Ponce De Leon equations and in Section 4 a brief review of the Basini-Capozziello ideas on how a Warp Field in 5D can generate all masses in 4D presenting the equations in both conventional and Conformal Formalism. Section 5 is a recomputation of the 5D additional terms in the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light due to the presence of the Extra Dimension using the Warp Fields, Section 6 is a description of the Superluminal Behaviour of our ideas applied to the Chung-Freese BraneWorld and we explain why Chung-Freese Braneworld have advantages over other Superluminal metrics(eg:Warp Drive) since it does not suffer from the physical pathologies that rules out other Superluminal ansatz.We also show why we cannot see the Extra Dimension and we also explain how theoretically we could make the Extra Dimension being visible. Section 7 is the application of the Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon formalism to the Maartens-Clarkson Black String coupled to massive Kaluza-Klein graviton modes predicted by some theories of Extra Dimensions and we propose experimental detection of Extra Dimensions on-board LIGO or LISA Space Telescopes.Section 8 describes the accuracy of the International Space Station(ISS) instruments to measure the additional terms from Extra Dimensions in the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending of Light to verify if the Extra Dimensions can really exists..or not.Also we outline the remarkable properties of the Particle Z presented in a table of Elementary Particles and we prove the fact that Particle Z can exists only if the 5D spacetime exists.</p>
<p>The Ponce De Leon 5D Extra Force Formalism</p>
<p>Ponce De Leon outlines the "vital issue of discovering new physical phenomena which could unambiguously be associated with the existence of Extra Dimensions"(pg 1336 in [2]).He points out the fact that a possible way to test the new physics coming from the Extra Dimensions is the study of the dynamics from test particles.A particle in a 5D free-fall projects a non-gravitational force in 4D that can affect the rest masses seen in 4D.(Again our point of view that "different" particles with different rest masses in 4D are actually the same particles in 5D with identical 5D rest masses).</p>
<p>Ponce De Leon employs a Warp-Factor/Warp Field Metric given by([2] eq 14) 3 :
dS 2 = Ω(y)g uv dx u dx v − Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2(1)
dS 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 − Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 (2) dS 2 &gt; 0 Ω(y)ds 2 −Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 &gt; 0 Ω(y)ds 2 &gt; Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 &gt; ( dy ds
) 2 T imelike5D(3)
dS 2 = 0 Ω(y)ds 2 −Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 = 0 Ω(y)ds 2 = Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 = (
dy ds ) 2 N ulllike5D(4)
dS 2 &lt; 0 Ω(y)ds 2 −Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 &lt; 0 Ω(y)ds 2 &lt; Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 &lt; ( dy ds ) 2 Spacelike5D</p>
<p>(5)
ds 2 = g uv dx u dx v(6)
3 Since we are interested in Metrics with Superluminal behaviour we assume the 5D Extra Dimension as a Spacelike</p>
<p>In the equations above the term Ω(y) is the so-called Warp Factor and the term Φ(x 3+1 , y) is the Warp Field 4 that is responsible for all the masses generated in the 4D spacetime as we will see later.The term dS 2 is the 5D line-element and the term ds 2 is the 3 + 1 line-element.The term y accounts for the Extra Dimension.Note that the Ponce De Leon formalism is a generic formalism that encompasses particular equations such as dS 2 = y 2 ds 2 − Φ 2 dy 2 (See eq 1 in [9]) where the Warp Factor Ω(y) = y or dS 2 = y 2 L 2 ds 2 − dy 2 (See eq 2.1 to 2.3 in [14] and eq 1.1 to 1.3 in [15] ) where the Warp Factor Ω(y) = y 2 L 2 . According to Ponce De Leon a particle with a 5D mass-component M 5 non-null moving in a 5D spacetime obeys the following relation( [2] eq 22):
dS 2 M 5
= Ω(y) ds 2 m 0</p>
<p>And the relation between M 5 and the 4D rest-mass component m 0 that can be easily derived from equations (7) and (2) is given by ([2] eq 20):
m 0 = Ω(y)M 5 [1 − Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ]] −1 2(8)
Working with these expressions: 
Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 &gt; ( dy ds ) 2 Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 = N ( dy ds ) 2 ( dy ds ) 2 = 1 N Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 (9) Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 = ( dy ds ) 2(10)Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 &lt; ( dy ds ) 2 Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 = 1 N ( dy ds ) 2 ( dy ds ) 2 = N Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2(11)
Now we can clearly see why we can have two identical particles with the same 5D rest-mass M 5 but different geodesic paths dy ds in the 5D spacetime or different Warp measures Φ 2 Ω(y) makes these particles appear "different" in the 4D spacetime.</p>
<p>Note that combining the equations 4 and 8 together or 10 we will arrive at the result of 13.Then we can see that for a Null-like Geodesics in 5D the final rest mass in 4D is always infinite regardless of a non-zero rest mass in 5D.</p>
<p>Note also that depending of the values of the parameter N a positive 5D mass can be projected in the 4D spacetime as a negative mass.We are considering of course m 2 0 since m 0 would be immaginary reflecting the tachyonic behavior of the Spacelike 5D 5 Ponce De Leon computes the Extra-Force( [2] eq 10) as a function of the derivative of the rest-mass in 4D spacetime with respect to the 4D line-element.</p>
<p>The Extra-Force seen in 4D for a M 5 not null in 5D is given by the following equation( [2] eq 25 and [9] eq 24) 6 :
1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂y dy ds − Φ(x 3+1 , y)u u Ω(y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u ( dy ds ) 2(15)
For massless particles in 5D M 5 is null although m 0 may be null or not and this requires a null-like 5D geodesics dS 2 = 0 concerning equation 7. 7 The rest mass in 4D is given by ([2] eq 27 and 28):
m 0 = + − Ω(y)Φ(x 3+1 , y) dy dλ (16) dλ = Ω(y) m 0 ds(17)
Combining eqs 16 and 17 we can clearly see that: 8
dy ds = Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y)(18)
The Extra Force seen in 4D according to Ponce De Leon for a massless 5D particle is given by( [2] eq 30) 910 :
1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + Ω(y) 2Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂g uv ∂y u u u v − u u Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u(19)
This equation although for massless 5D particles have many resemblance with its similar for massive 5D particles as pointed out by Ponce De Leon and can easily be obtained combining eqs 15 and 18(pg 1343 in [2]).</p>
<p>The term responsible for the 5D Extra Force appears in both equations 15 and 19 and can be derived from the line element in 3 + 1.Below we are only considering the Extra Term and not the rest of the Geodesics equation. 11 g uv u u u v = 1 dg uv u u u v ds = 0 ∂g uv ∂y u u u v dy ds + g uv du u u v ds (20) 5 interesting this point of view that Dark Matter or the Cosmological Constant associated with negative energy densities can be 5D matter with positive mass in the Extra Dimension 6 note that for a Warp Field function only of the Extra Coordinate the second term vanishes(examine eqs 50 and 52 in [1]) 7 note again that we are considering the nature of the Extra Dimension as Spacelike(see pg 1342 and 1343 in [2]) 8 see pg 1343 in [2] but the result is obvious from our eq 10 9 note that like for its analogous 5D massive counterpart the Warp Field function only of the Extra Coordinate makes the second term vanish(examine eqs 50 and 52 in [1]) 10 compare this equation with [9] eq 24 and look for the + signal in this equation while [9] eq 24 only have the -sign 11 (examine eqs 50 and 52 in [1]) 3 Kar-Sinha Conformal Metric Strucutre and Ponce De Leon 5D Formalism Kar 
dS 2 = e 2f (y) [g uv dx u dx v ] − r 2 c dy 2 (21) dS 2 = e 2f (y) ds 2 − r 2 c dy 2(22)
Examining closely the metrics of Kar-Sinha and Ponce De Leon together:
dS 2 = e 2f (y) ds 2 − r 2 c dy 2 dS 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 − Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 (23) e 2f (y) ds 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 e 2f (y) = Ω(y)(24)r 2 c dy 2 = Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 r 2 c = Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2(25)
The Kar-Sinha Exponential Factor is exactly the Ponce De Leon Warp Factor both written in function of the Extra Coordinate y.Interesting is the fact that when y = 0 the Exponential behavior makes the Warp Factor Ω(y) = 1 and we recover ordinary 3 + 1 line element.Also the Compactification Radius r c in Kar-Sinha is exactly the Warp Field in Ponce De Leon.We prefer to consider the Warp Field interpretation because this will appear later in the Basini-Capozziello equations and will be useful for the generation of particle masses from 5D to 4D. 1314 Kar-Sinha converts the 5D line element into a Conformal Metric in function of the Warp Factor using a Coordinates Transformation described below([3] eq 14):
e f (y) dβ = r c dy = Φ(x 3+1 , y)dy = Ω(y)dβ(26)
This structure allows the 5D line-element to be written as a complete Factorizable Metric all in function of the Warp Factor only.
dS 2 = e 2f (y) ds 2 − r 2 c dy 2 dS 2 = e 2f (y) ds 2 − e 2f (y) dβ 2 dS 2 = e 2f (y) <a href="27">ds 2 − dβ 2 </a>
12 again we assume a Spacelike Extra Dimension and we keep the compatibility with Ponce De Leon Formalism.ds 2 is the 3 + 1 line element as in eq 6 13 see for example pg 132 eq 83 in [1]. 14 the notion of a Compactification Radius and Warp Factors appeared for the first time in the Randall-Sundrum(RS) BraneWorld Model.Kar-Sinha mentions RS Model in pg 1780 in [3].
dS 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 − Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 dS 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 − Ω(y)dβ 2 dS 2 = Ω(y)<a href="28">ds 2 − dβ 2 </a>
Note that now the behavior in terms of Geodesics can be written as:
dS 2 = Ω(y)[ds 2 − dβ 2 ] &gt; 0 ds 2 &gt; dβ 2 dβ ds = 1 N T imelike5D (29) dS 2 = Ω(y)[ds 2 − dβ 2 ] = 0 ds 2 = dβ 2 N ulllike5D (30) dS 2 = Ω(y)[ds 2 − dβ 2 ] &lt; 0 ds 2 &lt; dβ 2 dβ ds = N Spacelike5D(31)
The relation between the coordinates y and β is given by the following expression: 15
Φ(x 3+1 , y)dy = Ω(y)dβ dy dβ = Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) (32) Φ(x 3+1 , y)dy = Ω(y)dβ dβ dy = Φ(x 3+1 , y) Ω(y)(33)
We will now rewrite the expressions of the 5D Extra Force from Ponce De Leon Formalism in the new Conformal Metric Structure:</p>
<p>The equation of the rest mass m 0 in 4D in function of the rest mass M 5 in 5D will now be given by:
m 0 = Ω(y)M 5 [1 − dβ 2 dy 2 ( dy ds ) 2 ]] −1 2 m 0 = Ω(y)M 5 [1 − ( dβ ds ) 2 ]] −1 2(34)
Combining eq 34 with eqs 29,30 and 31 we have the following results:
m 0 = Ω(y)M 5 [1 − ( 1 N ) 2 ]] −1 2 (35) m 0 = Ω(y)M 5 [1 − (1) 2 ]] −1 2 m 0 = ∞ (36) m 0 = Ω(y)M 5 [1 − (N ) 2 ]] −1 2(37)
Look that these results are exactly the same we obtained with equations 12 13 and 14.The Conformal Structure gives exactly the same results of the Ponce De Leon original line element.Note that according to eq 36 a Null-Like particle in 5D with a rest mass M 5 not null will be seen in the 4D spacetime with a infinite rest mass particle in agreement with previous statements.</p>
<p>In order to work with Ponce De Leon expressions for the 5D Extra Force in Conformal Metric we must write the Warp Field in function of the new Conformal Coordinate β.Also the derivatives dy ds must be replaced by its counterparts in function of the new coordinate.We can obtain easily these expressions from eqs 32 or 33.</p>
<p>Φ(x 3+1 , y) = Ω(y) dβ dy (38) 15 compare this result with eq 18 and look also to eq 30
dy ds = Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) dβ ds (39) dy = Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) dβ(40)
Applying the new Conformal Coordinates to the Ponce De Leon 5D Extra Force seen in 4D for a massive M 5 we will get an interesting result:the second term in the original equation can be entirely suppressed making the equation more mathematically easy to handle. 16 17 
1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂y dy ds − Φ(x 3+1 , y)u u Ω(y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u ( dy ds ) 2(41)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂y Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) dβ ds − Φ(x 3+1 , y)u u Ω(y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 ( dβ ds ) 2(42)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β Φ(x 3+1 , y) Ω(y) Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) dβ ds − Φ(x 3+1 , y)u u Ω(y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 ( dβ ds ) 2 (43) 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds − Φ(x 3+1 , y)u u Ω(y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u Ω(y) Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 ( dβ ds ) 2 (44) 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds − u u Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u ( dβ ds ) 2(45)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds − u u Φ(x 3+1 , y) Ω(y) ∂ 2 β ∂x u ∂y ( dβ ds ) 2(46)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds − u u Ω(y) dy dβ Ω(y) ∂ 2 β ∂x u ∂y ( dβ ds ) 2(47)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds − u u ∂ 2 β ∂x u ∂β ( dβ ds ) 2(48)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = −1 2 u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds(49)
Another interesting feature from the Conformal Coordinate structure is the fact that the 5D Extra Force for a massless 5D particle (although m 0 may be null or not) seen in 4D will give a result almost similar to the massive M 5 particle. 1819
1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + Ω(y) 2Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂g uv ∂y u u u v − u u Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y)
∂x u (50) 16 we will give the complete process 17 note that eq 49 resulting from this process will match [9] eq 24 and look also to [12] eq 3 18 we will give as in the previous case the complete process 19 compare eq 55 with [9] eq 24 and look for the + signal in this equation while [9] eq 24 only have the -sign
1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + Ω(y) 2 Ω(y) dy dβ ∂g uv ∂y u u u v − u u Ω(y) dy dβ ∂Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂x u (51) 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + 1 2 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v − u u Ω(y) dy dβ Ω(y) ∂ 2 β ∂x u dy (52) 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + 1 2 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v − u u dy dβ ∂ 2 β ∂x u ∂y(53)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + 1 2 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v − u u ∂ 2 β ∂x u ∂β(54)1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + 1 2 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v(55)
Now we can see clearly the advantages of the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate:eqs 49 and 55 are almost the same except for the term dβ ds .The Conformal Coordinate allowed us to suppress all the second terms in Ponce De Leon original equations and Warp Factors/Warp Fields are embedded in the Conformal Coordinates as shown in eq 40. Applying eq 30 to 49 we will get the same results of eq 55 for a Null-Like 5D Geodesics. 20 Also for a Null-Like 5D Geodesics according to eq 30 we can see that the Conformal Coordinate is equal to the line-element of the 3 + 1 spacetime 21 and we can rewrite eq 55 as:
1 m 0 dm 0 ds = − + 1 2 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v 1 m 0 dm 0 dβ = − + 1 2 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v(56)
Examining again the derivatives of the line element in 3 + 1 spacetime with respect to ds and dβ. 22
g uv u u u v = 1 dg uv u u u v ds = 0 ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ ds + g uv du u u v ds(57)
We can see that the first term of the derivative will resemble the final result of eq 49 23 and the difference between Null and Non-Null 5D Geodesics is given by the result of the term dβ ds .Also compare this with eq 20 and the resemblances with both equations will easily be seen:one with derivatives in function of y and other in function of the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate β.</p>
<p>Remember that a particle in a Null-Like Geodesics dS 2 = 0 in 5D with a massless mass in 5D M 5 = 0 can be seen in the 4D spacetime with a Time-Like Geodesics ds 2 &gt; 0 or a Space-Like Geodesics ds 2 &lt; 0 and a non-zero 4D rest mass m 0 = 0.(pg 1347 in [2])</p>
<p>We will finish the Ponce De Leon 5D Formalism with the equations of the Extrinsic Curvature.As Ponce De Leon pointed out(pg 1348 in [2]) the Extra Force due to 5D is given in function of the derivatives of the spacetime metric tensor with respect to the Extra Coordinate(y or β).</p>
<p>The Extrinsic Curvature for a 5D spacetime according to Ponce De Leon is given by:([2] eq 53) 
K uv = 1 2 L Φ(x 3+1 ,y) g uv = 1 2Φ(x 3+1 ,K uv = 1 2 L Ω(y) g uv = 1 2 Ω(y) ∂g uv ∂β (59)
Combining eqs 58 and 38 we will get easily eq 59. The Lagrangian Densities(useful in the next section for Basini-Capozziello 5D Formalism) can be obtained from the Extrinsic Curvature expressions and are given by:
L Φ(x 3+1 ,y) = 1 Φ(x 3+1 , y) ∂g uv ∂y g uv(60)
L Ω(y) = 1
Ω(y) ∂g uv ∂β g uv(61)
A remarkable feature that can be noted here is the fact that the Lagrangian Density and Extrinsic Curvature written in function of the coordinate y uses the Warp Field while both expressions in function of the Conformal Coordinate β uses the Warp Factor.</p>
<p>The Basini-Capozziello 5D Formalism</p>
<p>Basini-Capozziello argue that the 5D dimension cannot be perceived as a spacelike dimension like the 3 dimensions of space and have a behavior that resembles time the 4D dimension. We also cannot perceive time as a spacelike dimension although we can "feel" it. Hence the 5D dimension is connected to the generation of masses,charges and spins of particles as time is connected to the 4D.(pg 123,124 in [1]).Basini-Capozziello starts from a Scalar-Tensor theory of Gravity in a 5D spacetime(pg 125 in [1]) and using a Geometric Procedure of reduction from 5D to 4D all our known physics in 4D will appear obtaining the masses,charges and spins of elementary particles.(pg 124,125 in [1])</p>
<p>The 5D line-element is given by:([1] eq 32 and [5] eq 18) 
dS 2 = g AB dx A dx B U A = dx A dS U B = dx B dS(62)A = (dS(g AB dx A dS dx B dS ) 1 2 ) A = (dS(g AB U A U B ) 1 2 ) A = (dS) (63) A = − 1 16π 5 G (d 5 x √ −g[ 5 R])(64)
5 G is the 5D Newton Gravitational Constant and −g is the determinant of the 5D spacetime metric tensor, 5 R is the 5D Ricci Scalar( [5] eq 128) .</p>
<p>The Einstein Field Equations are given by:([1] eq 37 and 38 and [5] eq 30 and 31 )
G AB = R AB − 1 2 g AB R = T AB(65)T AB = ∇ A Φ∇ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∇ C Φ∇ C Φ ∇ C Φ = ∇ C Φg CC (66) 24 remember that gABU A U B = 1 T AB = ∇ A Φ∇ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∇ C Φ∇ C Φg CC(67)
Note that the Φ in the equations above is the Warp Field that is the responsible for all masses generated in 4D from massless 5D particles.Here Φ can be function of both 3+1 coordinates and the 5D coordinate.We will see this later in this section. 25 The 5D Riemann Curvature Tensor is given by:([1] eq 33 and [5] eq 26)
R D ABC = ∂ B Γ D AC − ∂ C Γ D AB + Γ D EB Γ E AC − Γ D EC Γ E AB(68)
According to Basini-Capoziello there are 50 independent components for this tensor.(see pg 125 in [1]). The Ricci Tensor and Scalar are given by the following expressions:([1] eq 34 and [5] eq 27)
R AB = R C ACB == ∂ C Γ C AB − ∂ B Γ C AC + Γ C EC Γ E AB − Γ C EB Γ E AC (69) 5 R = R A A = R AB g AB R AB g AB = R B B(70)
In order to outline the importance of the Warp Field Φ as the generator of the spacetime geometry we must perhaps write the Einstein Field Equations in function of the Tensor T AB .The Corresponding equations are given by:([1] eq 40 and [5] eq 33) 2627
R AB = 8π 5 G(T AB − 1 2 g AB T ) T = T AB g AB(71)
Since our Warp Field is the Scalar Field from Basini-Capozziello 5D Scalar Theory of Gravity we can rewrite the Tensor T AB replacing Covariant Derivatives by Partial ones.The resulting expressions corresponding to eq 66 and 67 would then be: 28
T AB = ∂ A Φ∂ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∂ C Φ∂ C Φ ∂ C Φ = ∂ C Φg CC (72) T AB = ∂ A Φ∂ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∂ C Φ∂ C Φg CC(73)
Introducing now the Tensor T A B ([1] eq 43).
T A B = T AB g AA = ∂ B Φ∂ A Φ − 1 2 δ A B ∂ C Φ∂ C Φ(74)
The Tensor T AB is symmetric and the following relation holds true.([1] eq 41 and [5] eq 34). 29
T [A,B] = T AB − T BA = 0 T AB = T BA(75)
This can be easily seen in the following relations 25 see eqs 76 and 83 in [1] 26 see also the comments on pg 125 about the symmetry of TAB and Φ being a cyclic variable to make Noether theorem hold in [1] 27 see the comment of non-flat 5D spacetimes in the top of pg 126 in [1] 28 see the comment above eq 6 in [1] 29 see eq 5 in [1] 
T AB = ∂ A Φ∂ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∂ C Φ∂ C Φ (76) T BA = ∂ B Φ∂ A Φ − 1 2 g BA ∂ C Φ∂ C Φ (77) T AB = ∇ A Φ∇ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∇ C Φ∇ C Φ (78) T BA = ∇ B Φ∇ A Φ − 1 2 g BA ∇ C Φ∇ C Φ(79)
Note that when g AB = g BA in the case of a diagonalized metric g 00 , g 11 , g 22 , g 33 , g 44 are the non null components of the Spacetime Metric Tensor and all the others are null. 30 Then in the above expressions changing the scripts in the Stress Energy Momentum Tensor will not affect the result since partial derivatives operators or Covariant ones commute.Note that in the case of the Tensor T A B the final expression is then 31 : 
T A B = T AB g AA = ∂ B Φ∂ A Φ − 1 2 ∂ C Φ∂ C Φ(80)∇ A T A B = 5 Φ B = 0 (81)
In a Riemannian manifold the following relation holds true:([1] eq 44 and [5] eq 37)
∇ A Φ B = ∇ B Φ A Φ B = ∇ B Φ ∂ B Φ (82) ∇ A Φ B = ∇ B Φ A ∇ A ∇ B Φ = ∇ B ∇ A Φ(83)
Of course if the Covariant or partial derivatives can commute then the above expression is obvious.The Operator is the 5D D'Alembert Operator defined as:(see pg 126 in [1] and pg 2229 in [5])
5 Φ = ∇ A Φ A = g AB (Φ A ) ;B = g AB <a href="84">(Φ A ) B − Γ K BA Φ K </a>
Remember that for our Warp Field Φ a Scalar Field the Covariant Derivative operator is equivalent to the Partial one.We assume our Warp Field a real physical field and Φ B = 0.Equation 81 is a real Field Equation for our Warp Field. 33 Note that we used a Stress Energy Momentum Tensor with absence of Potential Terms,only the Kinetic Terms are present. 34 A Stress Energy Momentum Tensor written in function of a Warp Field(Scalar Field) Φ describing Quantum Matter in a Curved Spacetime Geometry with both Kinetic and Self-Interacting Potential Terms would be given by:
T AB = ∇ A Φ∇ B Φ − 1 2 g AB ∇ C Φ∇ C Φ + g AB V (Φ)(85)
30 we assume a diagonalized metric as described by eq 57 in [1] 31 δ B B = 1 32 see eq 7 in [1] 33 see the comment below eq 47 in [1] 34 see the comment below eq 38 in [1] 
T BA = ∇ B Φ∇ A Φ − 1 2 g BA ∇ C Φ∇ C Φ + g BA V (Φ) (86) T AB = Φ ;A Φ ;B − 1 2 g AB Φ ;C Φ ;C + g AB V (Φ) (87) T BA = Φ ;B Φ ;A − 1 2 g BA Φ ;C Φ ;C + g BA V (Φ)(88)T AB = Φ A Φ B − 1 2 g AB Φ C Φ C + g AB V (Φ)(89)T BA = Φ B Φ A − 1 2 g BA Φ C Φ C + g BA V (Φ)(90)
Considering the case of a Self-Interactive Massive Particle of mass m in a Warp Field Φ the corresponding expressions for the Potential in the Stress-Energy-Momentum Tensor would then be:([1] eq 10 and [5] eq 79)
V (Φ) = 1 2 m 2 Φ 2 dV dΦ = m 2 Φ(91)
The Warp Field(eq 81) is the responsible for the physical meaning of the 5D.Now we will see how the Warp Field generates all the particle masses in 4D.</p>
<p>Reducing the Geodesics from 5D to 4D we will get the following expression for the Extra-Force in 5D according to Basini-Capozziello </p>
<p>These are the expressions for the Extra Force seen in 4D generated by the 5D manifold and mean that the motion of the 4D frame with respect to the Extra Coordinate y or β generates this Force.This shows that the 5D have real physical meaning(see pg 127 in [1]) and according to Basini-Capozziello all the particles are massless in 5D acquiring all the rest masses m 0 in the Dynamical Reduction from the 5D to 4D spacetime due to equation 92.Note that is slightly different than the Ponce De Leon Formalism in which a particle in 5D can be massive or massless.</p>
<p>To better illustrate the Basini-Capozziello idea about how the Extra Force in 5D can generate the masses in 4D we will rewrite equations 49 and 55 adapted to equation 93.These equations are remarkably similar although eq 94 was taken from the equation 49 for a massive 5D particle.
F = 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = u u u v ∂g uv ∂β dβ ds 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = d ln(m 0 ) ds (94) F = 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = ∂g uv ∂β u u u v 1 m 0 dm 0 ds = d ln(m 0 ) ds(95)
35 compare the equations 92 and 93 with 20,49,55 and 57 for the Extra Term of the 5D Force and derivatives with respect to the Extra Coordinate.We also employed the scripts y and β due to the different Extra Coordinates shown in eqs 26,32,33 and 38 to 40 36 compare eqs 92 and 93 with [9] eq 24 and look for the + signal in these equation while [9] eq 24 only have the -sign Remember also that eq 95 was taken from eq 55 for a Null-Like Geodesics(dβ = ds) for a massless 5D particle in Ponce De Leon Formalism but in Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinates both will produce the same results(We will address this later).
d ln(m 0 ) = ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ ds ds ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ (96) d ln(m 0 ) = ∂g uv ∂β u u u v ds ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ dβ = ds(97)
Remarkable the point that in Ponce De Leon Formalism the equations of the 5D Extra Force for massive or massless particles in 5D Null-Like Geodesics or Timelike/Spacelike will give exactly the term ∂guv ∂β u u u v dβ from Basini-Capozziello Formalism(eqs 96 and 97).</p>
<p>The rest mass m 0 induced in 4D from the 5D spacetime would then be:
d ln(m 0 ) = ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ (98) m 0 = e ( ∂guv ∂β u u u v dβ)(99)
Note that the term ( ∂guv ∂β u u u v dβ) will not produce a zero rest mass for the photon for example.But a ( ∂guv ∂β u u u v dβ) less than zero and with large absolute values will produce a m 0 close to zero.However from theoretical reasons we believe that 4D rest-mass m 0 = 0 particles are not influenced by 5D Extra Force and this Extra Force only affects 5D massive particles M 5 = 0.See ISS section.</p>
<p>From eqs 96 to 99 we can easily see that:
F = d ln(m 0 ) ds = d ln(m 0 ) dβ = ∂g uv ∂β u u u v(100)
The Extra Force induced by the 5D in 4D is equal to the derivative of the natural logarithm of the rest mass of a particle with respect to the 3 + 1 line element or the derivative of the natural logarithm of the rest mass with respect to the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate
d ln(m 0 ) = F dβ d ln(m 0 ) = ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ (101) ln(m 0 ) = (F dβ) = ( ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ) (102) m 0 = e ( ∂guv ∂β u u u v dβ) = e (F dβ)(103)
Now we have a clear picture of how a 5D Spacetime Geometry can induce all rest masses seen in 4D due to the term
( ∂g uv ∂β u u u v dβ) = (F dβ)(104)
We can understand why Basini-Capozziello says that the 5D is the entity that will assign the masses and the dynamics seen in 4D.(see pg 127 in [1])</p>
<p>Writing now the Variational Principle and the Contravariant version of the Stress-Energy-Momentum-Tensor according to Basini-Capozziello we should expect for:([1] eq 36 and 39 and [5] eq 29 and 32) 3738
δ (d 5 x −g 5 [ 5 R]) = 0 (105) T AB = 2 −g 5 δ( −g 5 L Φ ) δg AB = T A B g BB = T AB g AA g BB(106)
The term L Φ is a Lagrangian Density connected to the Warp Field Φ(see pg 125 in [1]).This will be useful later in the Einstein-Hilbert Action reduced from 5D to 4D in which we can see that even in a pure 4D Action the Warp Field is still present.</p>
<p>The Variational Principle in eq 105 is for the Action depicted in eq 64. Replacing according to Basini- 
δ (d 5 x −g 5 [ 5 R + λ(g yy + Φ 2 )]) = 0(107)
and the Einstein-Hilbert Action by this new one:
A = − 1 16π 5 G (d 5 x −g 5 [ 5 R + λ(g yy + Φ 2 )])(108)
In the Action above 5 G is the 5D Newton Gravitational Constant −g 5 is the determinant of the Spacetime Metric Tensor 5 R is the 5D Ricci Scalar g yy is the Spacetime Metric Tensor component for the Extra Dimension, λ is a Lagrange multiplier and Φ is the Warp Field.</p>
<p>The Reduction from 5D to 4D according to Basini-Capozziello uses the Campbell Theorem in which is possible to define a 5D Riemannian manifold dS 2 = g AB dx A dx B containing embedded on itself a 4D Riemannian manifold ds 2 = g αβ dx α dx β in a way that g AB depends on the 3 + 1 and Extra Coordinates but g αβ may be function of the 3 + 1 and Extra Coordinate or function only of the 3 + 1 coordinates.(see eq 1 pg 2035 in [4] and pg 1776 for the dependance of the 3 + 1 slice with respect to the 5D coordinate in [3])</p>
<p>Writing according to Basini-Capozziello the Spacetime Metric we should expect for:([1] eq 56, [5] eq 42, [12] pg 308 and [13] pg 1346) 40 41
dS 2 = g AB dx A dx B = g αβ dx α dx β − Φ 2 dy 2(109)
With α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3 and Metric Signature for the 4D component being (+,-,-,-). The Metric of Basini-Capozziello here will be exactly equal to the Metric of Ponce De Leon;both with a particle-like nature for the Extra Dimension:a Spacelike Dimension.</p>
<p>A particular case of the 5D metric with no Warp Field at all(empty space) would be given by the Chung-Freese metric as( [4] 
dS 2 = g AB dx A dx B = g αβ dx α dx β − dy 2(110)
The particular case of Chung-Freese can illustrate why we cannot see more than 3 + 1 dimensions in empty space due to the Reduction of the Einstein-Hilbert Action from 5D to 4D in which the effects of the 5D will be diluted in the 3 + 1 spacetime.Also Chung-Freese considers our Universe in the Bulk y=0.</p>
<p>Writing the 5 R αβ Ricci Tensor and the 5 R Ricci Scalar according to Basini-Capozziello using these equations:(α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3)([1] eq 58 and [5] eq 44) 43
5 R αβ = R αβ − Φ ,a;b Φ − 1 2Φ 2 ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4
Φ − g αβ,44 + g λµ g αλ,4 g βµ,4 − g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (111)
5 R = R − Φ ,a;b Φ g αβ − 1 2Φ 2 g αβ ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g λµ g αλ,4 g βµ,4 − g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 )(112)
Simplifying for diagonalized metrics we should expect for:
5 R αβ = R αβ − Φ ,a;b Φ − 1 2Φ 2 ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 ) (113) 5 R = R − Φ ,a;b Φ g αβ − 1 2Φ 2 g αβ ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 ) (114) Note that the term 4 Φ = ∇ α Φ α = g αβ (Φ α ) ;β = g αβ [(Φ α ) β −Γ K βα Φ K ]
corresponds to the D'Alembertian in 4D 4445 so we can write for the Ricci Scalar the following expression:
5 R = R − 4 Φ Φ − 1 2Φ 2 g αβ ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 )(115)
If according to Basini-Capozziello the terms g αβ have no dependance with respect to to the Extra Coordinate y after the Reduction from 5D to 4D then all the derivatives with respect to y vanish and we are left out with the following expression for the Ricci Scalar:([1] eq 59 and [5] eq 45) 46
5 R = R − 4 Φ Φ(116)
Note that for a Chung-Freese like metric with no Warp Field at all Φ = 1 we can easily see that 5 R = R.</p>
<p>Reducing Chung-Freese from 5D to 4D according to eq 64 we can see the Extra Coordinate being diluted in the 3 + 1 spacetime. Remember that in Chung-Freese g 44 = −1, 5 G = 4 GV y where V y = dy is the volume of the Extra Coordinate and
√ −g = −detg αβ |g 44 |. 47 A = − 1 16π 5 G d 5 x √ −g[ 5 R] − 1 16π 4 GV y d 5 x −detg αβ |g 44 |[R] − V y 16π 4 GV y d 4 x −detg αβ |g 44 |[R] (117) − V y 16π 4 GV y d 4 x −detg αβ |g 44 |[R] − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ <a href="118">R</a>
43 Working with diagonalized metrics the terms α,λ,µ,β and ν are all equal 44 see pg 129 in [1] and pg 2230 in [5] 45 see also pg 311 in [12] 46 Chung-Freese depends on the Extra Coordinate y but our Universe is in the Bulk y = 0 [4] eq 1 47 see pg 2038 in [4] Now we have a clear picture of why we cannot perceive the 5D dimension in empty space:The Einstein-Hilbert Action reduces itself to a ordinary Action of a 3 + 1 spacetime ds 2 = g αβ dx α dx β .Of course if our Universe lies in the Bulk y = 0 a 5D motion will imply in a y = 0.</p>
<p>Note also that the Einstein-Hilbert Action depicted in eq 108 will be reduced to eq 64 for the metric shown in eq 109 due to the term
g 44 = g yy = −Φ 2 .
Similar examples of Dimensional reduction from 5D to 4D can be seen in eq 3 in [9] where a Stress Energy Momentum Tensor in 4D flat spacetime T αβ = 0 for an ansatz of this form dS 2 = ds 2 − Φ 2 dy 2 or a dS 2 = ds 2 − dy 2 with a ds 2 a flat Minkowsky spacetime.Look at eq 3 and consider the Warp Field Φ constant or Φ = 1.Also the derivatives of the 3 + 1 metric tensor will all be zero due to the fact that g αβ = (+1, −1, −1, −1) and this illustrates the validity of our point that in a flat spacetime the 5D spacetime reduces to a similar one in 4D.</p>
<p>Also see eqs 2.2a to 2.3 in [15] and we will have a similar result .A constant Warp Field for the ansatz pointed above will have null derivatives of the Warp Field and null derivatives of the spacetime metric components in the 3 + 1 spacetime and also the Ricci Tensors in 5D or 4D will be both equal to each other and both null.Again this reinforces the point of view that in flat spacetime a 5D spacetime reduces to a 4D one and this is again the reason why we cannot see the Extra Dimension.No compactation factors are needed.This will be better explored in the Chung-Freese Superluminal Section.</p>
<p>Basini-Capozziello introduced also a Brans-Dicke Action given by the following expression:([1] eq 60 and [5] eq 46)
A = − 1 16π 4 G (dx 4 − 4 g[ΦR + L Φ ])(119)
This Action is very interesting because it depicts the Warp Field Φ of the 5D Extra Dimension in a 3 + 1 Spacetime.This means to say that if a Action like this one exists in Nature then the Warp Field can be detected in our 3 + 1 Dimensions affecting perhaps the Gravitational Bending of Light as Kar-Sinha proposed.(pg 1775 and 1776 in [3])We will address this point later.Recall also eqs 60 and 61 for a Lagrangian Density connected to our Warp Field.</p>
<p>Reduction of the Einstein-Hilbert Action of Basini-Capozziello formalism considering the Warp Field Φ leads us to the following result: 48
A = − 1 16π 5 G (d 5 x √ −g[ 5 R]) − 1 16π 5 G (d 5 x √ −g[R − 4 Φ Φ ]) (120) − 1 16π 4 GV y d 5 x −detg αβ |g 44 |[R − 4 Φ Φ ] − V y 16π 4 GV y d 4 x −detg αβ Φ[R − 4 Φ Φ ] (121) − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ Φ[R − 4 Φ Φ ] − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ <a href="122">ΦR − 4 Φ</a>
Note that the following equation the Einstein-Hilbert Action of Basini-Capozziello formalism is in many ways similar to the Brans-Dicke Action eq 119 because even in 4D the Warp Field Φ can affect our 3 + 1 physics perhaps possibility the detection of the 5D signatures in our spacetime as Ponce De Leon or Kar-Sinha proposed(pg 1775 and 1776 in [3],pg 1336 in [2]).
A = − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ [ΦR − 4 Φ] (123) 48 −detg αβ |g44| −detg αβ | − Φ 2 | −detg αβ Φ
Writing the D'Alembertian Operator for curved spacetimes in 5-Dimensions as follows:([1] eq 25 and [5] eq 94) 49
5 g Φ = 1 − 5 g ∂ µ ( − 5 gg µν ∂ ν Φ)(124)
Hence the Reduced Einstein-Hilbert Action in Basini-Capozziello formalism can be written as:
A = − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ <a href="125">ΦR − 1 − 4 g ∂ µ ( − 4 gg µν ∂ ν Φ)</a>
We have still components of the 5D Einstein-Hilbert Action that must be reduced to 3+ 1 spacetime.To do so we must reduce the D'Alembertian Operator from 5D to 3 + 1.
5 g Φ = 1 −detg αβ |g 44 | ∂ µ ( −detg αβ |g 44 |g µν ∂ ν Φ) 5 g Φ = 1 −detg αβ Φ ∂ µ ( −detg αβ Φg µν ∂ ν Φ)
(126) In the Equation above we have the scripts α and β of the 3 + 1 spacetime coupled with the scripts µ and ν of the 5D spacetime.The Warp Field is function of the 3 + 1 and Extra Coordinates.We will address this later. 50 Writing again the Einstein-Hilbert Action for Basini-Capozziello formalism using the D'Alembertian already reduced we would have: 51
A = − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ <a href="127">R − 1 −detg αβ ∂ α ( −detg αβ g αβ ∂ β Φ)</a>
And using the Lagrangian Density for our Warp Field Φ eq 60 we could write the Brans-Dicke Action for Basini-Capozziello as follows:
A = − 1 16π 4 G (dx 4 − 4 g[ΦR + 1 Φ(y) ∂g uv ∂y g uv ])(128)
And comparing both Brans-Dicke and Einstein-Hilbert Actions in Basini-Capozziello formalism:
A = − 1 16π 4 G d 4 x −detg αβ <a href="129">R − 1 −detg αβ ∂ α ( −detg αβ g αβ ∂ β Φ)</a>
These equations although different have a very similar feature:Even in 3 + 1 spacetime these Actions depicts the signature of the 5D spacetime.We can detect the signatures of our Warp Field Φ in the generation of the particles masses and or by other effects from 5D as the Kar-Sinha Bending of Light.(pg 1775 and 1776 in [3])</p>
<p>Note that both have many common features:for example the term
A = − 1 16π 4 G (dx 4 − 4 g[R]
appears in both Actions(as obvious) and also the term Φ.</p>
<p>We could equalize both expressions making:
[ΦR + 1 Φ(y) ∂g uv ∂y g uv ] = <a href="130">R − 1 −detg αβ ∂ α ( −detg αβ g αβ ∂ β Φ)</a>
49 the original eq was written for a 3 + 1 space.we chooses a 5D space due to eq 123 50 see eq 76 in [1] 51 remember that the reduced Einstein-Hilbert Action uses 4 g Φ and not 5 g Φ We stated before that the Warp Field Φ is function of the 3 + 1 and 5D coordinates.We will now examine this in detail:</p>
<p>Basini-Capozziello considers a flat 5D spacetime and for particle-like solutions(spacelike solutions for the Extra Coordinate) they splits the D'Alembertian operator in two parts as follows:([1] eq 73 and [5] eq 67) 52
5 = − ∂ 2 4 (131)
In the above equation corresponds to our 3+1 spacetime and ∂ 4 corresponds to the Extra Dimension. According to Basini-Capozziello the Warp Field Φ have a 3 + 1 component and a 5D component presented as follows below:([1] eq 76 and [5] eq 70)
Φ = φ(t, x)χ(y)(132)
This is very important:The Warp Field Φ have a scalar field component in the 3 + 1 spacetime:the φ(t, x) plus a Extra Dimensional component:the χ component in function of the Extra coordinate y.The 3 + 1 component of the Warp Field φ(t, x) will affect our 3 + 1 physics producing a Kar-Sinha Bending of Light for example.(pg 1775 and 1776 in [3]) We will address this later.</p>
<p>Inserting the Warp Field Φ into the D'Alembertian eq 131 we should expect for:([1] eq 74 and 75 and [5] eq 68 and 69)
5 Φ = ( − ∂ 2 4 )Φ = 0 (133) Φ = ∂ 2 4 Φ(134)
In curvilinear coordinates the separation of the 3 + 1 and 5D components of the D'Alembertian would be given by eqs 135 and 136 both equal. 53 Below the 3 + 1 component of the D'Alembertian Operator in curvilinear coordinates:
1 −detg αβ Φ ∂ 0 ( −detg αβ Φg 00 ∂ 0 Φ) + ..... + 1 −detg αβ Φ ∂ 3 ( −detg αβ Φg 33 ∂ 3 Φ)(135)
and below the 5D component of the D'Alembertian Operator in curvilinear coordinates:
1 −detg αβ Φ ∂ 4 ( −detg αβ Φg 44 ∂ 4 Φ) = − 1 −detg αβ Φ ∂ 4 ( −detg αβ 1 Φ ∂ 4 Φ)(136)
Note that eq 135 is the Curvilinear correspondent of the 3 + 1 spacetime component of the Basini-Capozziello splitting of the D'Alembertian Operator given by eqs 133 and 134 which is Φ while eq 136 is the 5D component of the same splitting which is ∂ 2 4 Φ. Note also that the flat space 5D component of the D'Alembertian Operator coupled to the Warp Field
Φ is ∂ 2 4 Φ while the same component in curvilinear coordinates is − 1 √ −detg αβ Φ ∂ 4 ( −detg αβ 1 Φ ∂ 4 Φ).
The flat space approximation for the 5D component derived from the curvilinear D'Alembertian Operator would imply in a 3 + 1 flat spacetime in order to make −detg αβ = 1 and the 5D component of the curvilinear D'Alembertian Operator could be written as: 52 for curved spacetimes we must use the operator described in eq 124 53 we consider only diagonalized spacetime metrics
− 1 Φ ∂ 4 ( 1 Φ ∂ 4 Φ) = − 1 Φ <a href="137"> 1 Φ ∂ 2 4 Φ + (∂ 4 1 Φ )(∂ 4 Φ)</a>
From above we can see that the flat space that produces ∂ 2 4 Φ is a approximation and for curved spacetimes we must really use the D'Alembertian Operator of eq 126.</p>
<p>But Basini-Capoziello also splits not only the D'Alembertian Operator but also the Warp Field into two components according to eq 132 :one related related also to 3+1 spacetime which is φ(t, x) and another related to the 5D spacetime which is χ(y) .(see pg 131 in [1] and pg 2234 in [5])</p>
<p>Inserting eq 132 inside eq 133 and eq 134 to split the components of the Warp Field Φ in 3 + 1 and 5D spacetimes inside its respective D'Alembertian Operators for flat spacetime according to Basini-Capozziello we should expect for:([1] eq 77 and [5] eq 71)
φ(t, x)χ(y) = ∂ 2 4 φ(t, x)χ(y)(138)χ(y) φ(t, x) = φ(t, x)∂ 2 4 χ(y) (139) φ(t, x) φ(t, x) = ∂ 2 4 χ(y) χ(y) = 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 χ(y) ∂y 2 = −k 2 n(140)
The term −k 2 n must be a constant for consistency. According to Basini-Capozziello from eq 140 we can obtain two equations of motion:one related to 3 + 1 spacetime:([1] eq 78 and [5] eq 72)
( + k 2 n )φ(t, x) = 0 (141)
And another related to the 5D spacetime:([1] eq 79 and [5] eq 73)
∂ 2 χ(y) ∂y 2 + k 2 n χ(y) = 0(142)
Eq 142 according to Basini-Capozziello describes a Harmonic Oscillator as follows:([1] eq 80 and [5] eq 74)
χ(y) = c 1 e −ıkny + c 2 e ıkny(143)
We know from eq 137 that the D'Alembertian Operator in flat space is a approximation and for curved spacetimes we must use the D'Alembertian Operator of eq 126 with the 3 + 1 spacetime component given by eq 135 and the 5D component given by eq 136. Inserting in these equations the Warp Field split components according to eq 132 we should expect for: 54 3 + 1 spacetime components:
• 1 1 −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 0 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y)g 00 ∂ 0 φ(t, x)χ(y)) (144) • 2 1 −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 1 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y)g 11 ∂ 1 φ(t, x)χ(y))(145)
54 we consider only diagonalized spacetime metrics
• 3 1 −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 2 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y)g 22 ∂ 2 φ(t, x)χ(y)) (146) • 4 1 −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 3 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y)g 33 ∂ 3 φ(t, x)χ(y)) (147) • 1 χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, x) ∂ 0 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)g 00 ∂ 0 φ(t, x)) (148) • 2 χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, x) ∂ 1 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)g 11 ∂ 1 φ(t, x)) (149) • 3 χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, x) ∂ 2 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)g 22 ∂ 2 φ(t, x)) (150) • 4 χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, x) ∂ 3 ( −detg αβ φ(t, x)g 33 ∂ 3 φ(t, x))(151)
and the 5D spacetime component:
− 1 −detg αβ φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 4 ( −detg αβ 1 φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 4 φ(t, x)χ(y)) (152) − 1 φ(t, x)χ(y) ∂ 4 ( 1 χ(y) ∂ 4 χ(y)) (153) − 1 φ(t, x)χ(y) <a href="154"> 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)</a>
Note that eq 154 is exactly eq 137 with the 3 + 1 components of the Warp Field Φ separated from the partial derivatives ∂ 4</p>
<p>The Harmonic Oscillator is a good approximation for flat spacetimes. Back to the Harmonic Oscillator χ(y) = c 1 e −ıkny + c 2 e ıkny According to Basini-Capozziello the constant k n have the physical dimensions of the inverse of a length (similar to the wavenumber 2π λ inverse of a wavelength)(see pg 131 in [1]) and is defined by:([1] eq 81 and [5] eq 75)
k n = 2π l n (155)
With n a integer value and l defined as the Planck lenght:([1] eq 61 and [5] eq 47)
G N = 5 G 2πl (156)
k n is the inverse of a Compton wavelength defined as:([1] eq 82 and [5] eq 76)
λ n = m n c = 1 k n = l 2πn (157)
According to eq 156 k n and the Compton wavelength can both be defined in function of the ratio between the 5D Gravitational Constant and the 3 + 1 Newton Gravitational Constant as follows:
k n = 5 G G N 1 l 2 n (158) λ n = m n c = G N l 2 5 Gn = 1 k n(159)
Note that for flat spacetimes(all equations from 155 to 159 are approximations for flat spacetimes) the Compton mass can also be defined in function of the ratio between the 5D Gravitational Constant and the 3 + 1 Newton Gravitational Constant as shown below:
m n = c 5 G G N 1 l 2 n(160)
According to Basini-Capozziello eq 157 assigns the mass of the particle(Compton mass better pictured by eq 160) defined by the Eigenvalues of eq 142 generated by the reduction from 5D to 4D eqs 133 and 134 and the Harmonic Oscillator eq 143 as the superposition of two mass Eigenstates and the evolution of the 3 + 1 spacetime component φ(t, x) of the Warp Field Φ is given by eq 141 (see pg 131 in [1] and pg 2234 in [5]) .</p>
<p>Note that Basini-Capozziello defines the equation of the evolution of the 3 + 1 spacetime component of the Warp Field not only by eq 141 but also as follows:([1] eq 69 and [5] eq 65)
( + m 2 ef f )φ(t, x) = 0(161)
In the equation above appears the term "effective mass" m ef f defined as:
m ef f = k n = m n c(162)
Hence the equations that leads us to the Harmonic Oscillator can be written as:
∂ 2 χ(y) ∂y 2 + m 2 ef f χ(y) = 0 (163) χ(y) = c 1 e −ım ef f y + c 2 e ım ef f y(164)
Now using the effective mass which means to say the product of the Compton mass by the light speed c divided by the Planck Constant we can really see how the reduction from 5D to 4D can generate all the particle masses seen in 4D.
φ(t, x) φ(t, x) = ∂ 2 4 χ(y) χ(y) = 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 χ(y) ∂y 2 = −m 2 ef f = −( m n c ) 2(165)
Eq 164 gives also a better picture of the superposition of the two mass Eigenstates of eq 143. The Compton mass depicted here is the rest-mass seen in 4D for a particle at the rest in 4D with a rest wavelenght of λ 0 = m 0 c and n could perhaps be associated with the motion mass m or perhaps associated with a certain family of particles(see pg 132 in [1] and pg 2236 in [5]) . The effective mass is the inverse of the Compton wavelength of a particle.</p>
<p>Back to eq 91 in the case of a self-interacting massive particle according to Klein-Gordon equation for a Potential given in function of the 3 + 1 spacetime component φ(t, x) of the Warp Field Φ as shown below:([1] eq 10 and 11 and [5] eq 79)
V (φ(t, x)) = 1 2 m 2 φ(t, x) 2 dV dφ(t, x) = m 2 φ(t, x) ( + m 2 )φ(t, x) = 0(166)
According to Basini-Capozziello the 3 + 1 component of the Warp Field can be interpreted as the product of two conjugate complex numbers:([1] eq 12 and [5] eq 80) 
φ(t, x) = Ψ * (t, x)Ψ(t, x)(167)( + m 2 ) = (∂ a ∂ a + m 2 ) = (∂ − ım)(∂ + ım) (168) ( + m 2 )φ(t, x) = (∂ a ∂ a + m 2 )Ψ * (t, x)Ψ(t, x) = (∂ − ım)(∂ + ım)Ψ * (t, x)Ψ(t, x) = 0 (169)
The equation above can be split for massive particles according to the following cases:([1] eq 15 and 16 and [5] eq 83 and 84)
(∂ − ım)Ψ(t, x) = 0 (∂ + ım)Ψ * (t, x) = 0 (170) (∂ − ım)Ψ * (t, x) = 0 (∂ + ım)Ψ(t, x) = 0(171)
And for massless particles m 0 = 0 as follows:([1] eq 17 and [5] eq 85)
∂Ψ * (t, x) = ∂Ψ(t, x) = 0(172)
Note that Basini-Capozziello omitted the indexes in eq 168(see pg 120 in [1] and pg 2235 in [5]).If we retain the indexes we would have twice the number of Eigenstates described above.
( + m 2 ) = (∂ a ∂ a + m 2 ) = (∂ a − ım)(∂ a + ım) = (∂ a − ım)(∂ a + ım)(173)
For massive particles:
• 1 (∂ a − ım)Ψ * (t, x) = 0 (∂ a + ım)Ψ(t, x) = 0 (174) • 2 (∂ a − ım)Ψ(t, x) = 0 (∂ a + ım)Ψ * (t, x) = 0 (175) • 3 (∂ a − ım)Ψ * (t, x) = 0 (∂ a + ım)Ψ(t, x) = 0 (176) • 4 (∂ a − ım)Ψ(t, x) = 0 (∂ a + ım)Ψ * (t, x) = 0(177)
For massless particles:
• 1 ∂ a Ψ * (t, x) = ∂ a Ψ(t, x) = 0 (178) • 2 ∂ a Ψ * (t, x) = ∂ a Ψ(t, x) = 0(179)
According to Basini-Capozziello eqs 170 and 171 (or better: eqs 174 to 177) can be interpreted as "backward" and "forward" propagators and vice versa for each other.</p>
<p>In terms of wavefunctions we have:([1] eq 20 and 21 and [5] eq 90 and 91)
(∂ − ım) (k − ım)(180)(∂ + ım) (k + ım)(181)
And the wavefunctions have the form:([1] eq 22 and [5] eq 92)
Ψ(x) = e −ıkx u(k) Ψ * (x) = e ıkx u * (k)(182)
And according to Basini-Capozziello are the progressive and regressive solutions of the Eigenstates of the momentum of a particle or two complementary entangled Eigenstates in a superposition described by:([1] eq 23 and [5] eq 93)
ϕ = α 1 Ψ(x) + α 2 Ψ * (183) ϕ = α 1 e −ıkx u(k) + α 2 e ıkx u * (k)(184)
Compare eq 184 with eq 164 and 143. According to eq 167 φ(x) the 3 component of the Warp Field Φ is the product of the wavefunctions depicted by eq 182
φ(x) = Ψ * (x)Ψ(x)(185)
But in 3 + 1 spacetime and also according to eq 167 the wavefunctions must be described as follows:
Ψ(x, t) = e −ı(κx−ωt) u(κ, ω) (186) Ψ * (x, t) = e ı(κx−ωt) u * (κ, ω)(187)
According to eq 173 the wavefunctions of eq 180 and 181 considering indexes would then be:
(∂ a − ım) (k a − ım) (188) (∂ a + ım) (k a + ım) (189) (∂ a − ım) (k a − ım)(190)(∂ a + ım) (k a + ım)(191)
Remember that eq 154 is for curved spacetimes and eqs 140,142 and 163 are meant for flat spacetimes. We must analyze now how the reduction from 5D to 4D will generate the effective mass in a curved spacetime.</p>
<p>The D'Alembertian Operator for curved spacetimes according to eqs 148 to 154 is: 5556
i=0to3 χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, ε) ∂ i ( −detg αβ φ(t, ε)g ii ∂ i φ(t, ε)) (192) χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, ε) i=0to3 ∂ i ( −detg αβ φ(t, ε)g ii ∂ i φ(t, ε)) (193) ε = f (x, y, z) (194) χ(y) −detg αβ φ(t, ε) i=0to3 ∂ i ( −detg αβ φ(t, ε)g ii ∂ i φ(t, ε)) = − 1 φ(t, x)χ(y) [ 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)] (195) χ(y) 2 −detg αβ i=0to3 ∂ i ( −detg αβ φ(t, ε)g ii ∂ i φ(t, ε)) = −<a href="196"> 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)</a>1 −detg αβ i=0to3 ∂ i ( −detg αβ φ(t, ε)g ii ∂ i φ(t, ε)) = − 1 χ(y) 2 <a href="197"> 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)</a>
In a similar way following eqs 77 to 79 in [1] and eqs 71 to 73 in [5] we can write:
− 1 χ(y) 2 [ 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)] = −k 2 n = −m 2 ef f (198) 1 χ(y) 2 [ 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)] = k 2 n = m 2 ef f(199)
The effective mass even in a curved spacetime is obtained geometrically from the partial derivatives of the 5D component χ(y) of the Warp Field Φ.Note that the curved spacetime leads us to the following differential equations and these to be solved implied in the knowledge of the "shape" of the function χ(y).
[ 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)] − χ(y) 2 k 2 n = 0 (200) [ 1 χ(y) ∂ 2 4 χ(y) + (∂ 4 1 χ(y) )∂ 4 χ(y)] − χ(y) 2 m 2 ef f = 0(201)
Also according to Basini-Capozziello the effective mass can be geometrically derived in a way that is valid for both flat and curved spacetime as follows:([1] eq 83, [5] eq 77 and [12] eq 19) 57 55 signature (+,-,-,-,-) and diagonalized metric 56 g 44 = − 1 Φ 2 .sign is -57 note that in this case we must also know the "shape" of the function χ(y)
m ef f = Φ dy = φ(t, x)χ(y) dy = φ(t, x) χ(y) dy = φ(t, x) Θ(y) (202) Θ(y) = χ(y) dy(203)
According to Basini-Capozziello in all the eqs from 166 to 191 m 0 (Compton rest-mass) can be replaced by m ef f (see pg 132 in [1] and pg 2234 to 2237 in [5]).</p>
<p>A generic procedure for the "shape" of the Warp Field Φ can be given by the following expression:([1] eq 86 and [5] eq 100) 58
Φ(x a , y) = +∞ n=−∞ <a href="204">Ψ n (x a )e −ıkny + Ψ * n (x a )e ıkny </a>
From eq 182 we can write:([1] eqs 84 and 86 and [5] eq 92 and 100)
Φ(x a , y) = +∞ n=−∞ <a href="205">e −ıknx a u(k n )e −ıkny + e ıknx a u * (k n )e ıkny </a>
We defined the wavefunctions for the Eigenstates of the 3 + 1 spacetime momentum in eq 182.The corresponding wavefunctions for the Eigenstates of the 5D spacetime momentum could be defined as follows:
Ξ n (y) = e −ıkny Ξ * n = e ıkny(206)
From eq 206 we can write:
Φ(x a , y) = +∞ n=−∞ <a href="207">Ψ n (x a )Ξ n (y) + Ψ * n (x a )Ξ * n </a>
From eq 207 we can see that the Warp Field Φ is a superposition of Eigenstates from 3+1(Ψ n (x a ),Ψ * n (x a )) and 5D(Ξ n (y),Ξ * n ) momentum wavefunctions. According to Basini-Capozziello eqs 143 and 164 are the responsible for the generation of rest Compton/effective masses from the 5D to 4D reduction and in eq 207 the masses are assigned by eq 206.The charges and spins of the particles are assigned by eqs 182,183 and 184.(see pg 132 in [1] and pg 2236 to 2237 in [5])</p>
<p>Rewriting all the Basini-Capozziello 5D formalism using Kar-Sinha conformal coordinates we should expect for 59 :
Φ(x 3+1 , y) = dβ dy (208) dy ds = 1 Φ(x 3+1 , y) dβ ds (209) dy = 1 Φ(x 3+1 , y) dβ (210)
58 see also [12] eq 20 59 in Basini-Capozziello work the Warp Factor Ω(y) = 1 or simplifying the notation:
Φ = dβ dy (211) dy ds = 1 Φ dβ ds (212) dy = 1 Φ dβ(213)
Nota that dβ = Φdy,Compare this with eq 202. We can see that the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate is geometrically related to the effective mass of a particle m ef f = dβ.</p>
<p>The Stress-Energy Momentum Tensor(Kinetic Terms) in Kar-Sinha Coordinates would then be:

(226) The Stress-Energy Momentum Tensor(Kinetic+Self Interacting Potential terms) in Kar-Sinha Coordinates would then be:

Note the fact that this m(moving mass since we consider kinetic terms) can be function of m 0 the rest mass and according to Ponce De Leon or Basini-Capozziello this rest mass is a projection from 5D into 4D</p>

Eq 243 above is similar to eq 116 when the 3 + 1 spacetime metric tensor component derivatives with respect to the Extra Coordinate vanish.Note that when dβ = dy as in Chung-Freese metric we have the reduction of the Ricci scalar from 5D to 4D.</p>

<dt>Note that when β = y the Warp Field appears even in a 4D Action and we can notice its effects.

and since we are working with diagonalized metrics then we would have the following expression : 4 ( dβ dy ) = ( dβ dy ) = g αα [(( dβ dy ) α ) α − Γ K αα ( dβ dy ) K ] and in flat spacetime g αβ = (+1, −1, −1, −1) = g αα = (+1, −1, −1, −1) all the Christoffel symbols vanish leaving only the term
g αα (∂ 2 α ( dβ dy )) = (∂ 2 0 ( dβ dy )) − (∂ 2 1 ( dβ dy )) − (∂ 2 2 ( dβ dy )) − (∂ 2 3 ( dβ dy
)) The Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate is directly related to the effective mass of a particle as shown below(see eqs 202 and 203): 
dβ = φ(t, x)χ(y)dy β = φ(t, x)χ(y)dy β = φ(t, x) χ(y)dy β = φ(t, x)Θ(y)(261)1 χ(y) ( dβ dy ) = φ(t, x) (262) 1 χ(y) dβ = dβ χ(y) = φ(t, x)dy = φ(t, x)y (263) 1 y dβ χ(y) = φ(t, x)(264)
The Stress-Energy Momentum Tensor in 3 + 1 or 4D curved spacetime in function of a Scalar Field that describes quantum matter in function of a self-interacting Potential can be given as follows(eq 4 in [1] and [5] eq 53):
T αβ = ∇ α φ(t, x)∇ β φ(t, x) − 1 2 g αβ ∇ γ φ(t, x)∇ γ φ(t, x) + g αβ V (φ(t, x))(265)T αβ = ∇ α [ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )]∇ β [ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )] − 1 2 g αβ ∇ γ [ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )]∇ γ [ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )] + g αβ V ([ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )])(266)T αβ = 1 χ(y) 2 ∇ α [ dβ dy ]∇ β [ dβ dy ] − 1 2 1 χ(y) 2 g αβ ∇ γ [ dβ dy ]∇ γ [ dβ dy ] + g αβ V ([ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )])(267)T αβ = ∇ α [ 1 y dβ χ(y) ]∇ β [ 1 y dβ χ(y) ] − 1 2 g αβ ∇ γ [ 1 y dβ χ(y) ]∇ γ [ 1 y dβ χ(y) ] + g αβ V ([ 1 y dβ χ(y) ])(268)T αβ = 1 y 2 ∇ α [ dβ χ(y) ]∇ β [ dβ χ(y) ] − 1 2 1 y 2 g αβ ∇ γ [ dβ χ(y) ]∇ γ [ dβ χ(y) ] + g αβ V ([ 1 y dβ χ(y) ])(269)
62 for the following discussion see eq 4 in [1] Separating the Kinetic and Self-Interacting Potential terms we would have the following results:
T αβ = 1 χ(y) 2 (∇ α [ dβ dy ]∇ β [ dβ dy ] − 1 2 g αβ ∇ γ [ dβ dy ]∇ γ [ dβ dy ]) + g αβ V ([ 1 χ(y) ( dβ dy )]) (270) T αβ = 1 y 2 (∇ α [ dβ χ(y) ]∇ β [ dβ χ(y) ] − 1 2 g αβ ∇ γ [ dβ χ(y) ]∇ γ [ dβ χ(y) ]) + g αβ V ([ 1 y dβ χ(y) ])(271)
From the equations above we can see that the Stress-Energy Momentum Tensor even in 3 + 1 or 4D Spacetime can be written in function of the Extra Dimension.This supports the Basini-Capozziello argument that all masses in 4D and hence energies and momenta are generated by the reduction from 5D to 4D.</dd>

<p>The main advantage of the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinates is the fact that we embedded the Warp Field Φ = φ(t, x)χ(y) in a spacetime coordinate β.Not only this simplifies and brings together the Ponce De Leon and Basini-Capozziello formalism but also shows the geometrical nature of the relation between effective mass and the Conformal Coodinate.The study of the Ricci Tensors and Scalars is resumed to find the relation dβ dy . Recomputing(to illustrate the differences) the Ricci Tensors and Scalars using the original Extra Coordinate y and the Warp Field Φ = φ(t, x)χ(y) we should expect for: 4 [φ(t, x)χ(y)] − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (272) 4 [φ(t, x)χ(y)] − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (273) 4 [φ(t, x)χ(y)] − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (274) 4 [χ(y)] − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (279) 4 [χ(y)] − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (280)

Compare the Ricci Tensors and Scalars above with the ones depicted at eqs 240,241 and 242 with the expression for the D'Alembertian eq 254.In the above we must know the shape fo the functions φ(t, x) and χ(y) while for the analogous Ricci expressions using the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinates we need only to know the shape of dβ dy 5 The Kar-Sinha additional terms in the Gravitational Bending Of Light △ω generated by the presence of the 5D Extra Dimension</p>
<p>Kar and Sinha proposed the idea that the 5D Extra Dimension although invisible can leave a signature detected in our 4D World(pg 1775 and 1776 in [3]). They mention the Gravitational Bending Of Light △ω as a possible way to distinguish if we live in a 4D or a 5D Universe(pg 1776 in [3]). Although Kar-Sinha considered only gravitational signals propagating in the Extra Dimension 63 we will adopt the Ponce De Leon or Basini-Capozziello formalism that allows all particles inside Extra Dimension 64 and the Extra Dimension being responsible for the generation of the rest masses of the particles 65 .We will recompute again the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Bending Of Light △ω using the Ponce De Leon-Basini-Capozziello formalism.</p>
<p>Kar-Sinha considered a 5D Schwarzchild Black Hole (a Black String ) given by the following equations(see pg 1780 eqs 13 and 15 in [3]):
dS 2 = e 2f (y) [(1 − 2m 0 r 0 )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2m 0 r 0 ) − r 2 dη 2 ] − r 2 c dy 2 (281) dS 2 = e 2f (y) <a href="282">(1 − 2m 0 r 0 )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2m 0 r 0 ) − r 2 dη 2 − dβ 2 </a>dη 2 = dθ 2 + sin 2 θdφ 2(283)
From the equations above we can see that in the second case the original Extra Dimension y is replaced by the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate as shown in eqs 21,26,27 and 28.</p>
<p>These equations also obeys the Ponce De Leon structure of eqs 1 and 2 6667 .
dS 2 = Ω(y)[(1 − 2m 0 r 0 )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2m 0 r 0 ) − r 2 dη 2 ] − Φ(x 3+1 , y) 2 dy 2 (284) dS 2 = Ω(y)[(1 − 2m 0 r 0 )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2m 0 r 0 ) − r 2 dη 2 ] − Φ 2 dy 2 (285) dS 2 = Ω(y)[(1 − 2m 0 r 0 )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2m 0 r 0 ) − r 2 dη 2 ] − [φ(t, x)χ(y)] 2 dy 2(286)
63 They also consider the possibility of photons in the 5D see pg 1783 [3] for a shift of 2, 8 × 10 −4 .We will address this later. 64 see pg 127 between eqs 52 and 53 in [1] 65 see pg 1341 eq 20 and pg 1342 eq 27 in [2] 66 see also eqs 24 and 25 67 eq 286 have the Warp Field Φ separated in 3 + 1 and 5D component according to Basini-Capozziello 
dS 2 = Ω(y)<a href="287">(1 − 2m 0 r 0 )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2m 0 r 0 ) − r 2 dη 2 − dβ 2 </a>
Kar-Sinha proposed the following equation for the Gravitational Bending Of Light △ω(see pg 1781 eq 18 in [3]):
△ ω = 4m 0 r 0 + 2m 0 r 0 C 2 (288) △ ω = 2m 0 r 0 (2 + C 2 )(289)
Where
C = dβ dt = 1 √ Ω(y)
Φ dy dt (see pg 1781 in [3]) 68 is the term responsible for the Extra Shift in the Bending Of Light formula.The original General Relativity 4D formula for the Bending Of Light accounts only for the term △ω = 4m 0 r 0 while the Extra Dimension accounts for the term 2m 0 r 0 C 2 but considering a fixed Extra Coordinate(motion in 4D only) y or β constants then dy = 0 and dβ = 0 and although the Extra Dimension still exists the Gravitational Shift will be equal to a one in Conventional General Relativity.Also Kar-Sinha shows a graphical presentation of the Gravitational Shift differences between a 4D and a 5D spacetime at pg 1782 fig 1 in [3].Note that in the graph we have two curves:one for a propagation in ordinary 3 + 1 spacetime where C 2 = 0 and another in 5D where C 2 = 0 and C 2 accounts for the mentioned extra term in the Gravitational Shift deviation formula.Of course considering that the light ray suffers the bending near a gravitational field of a body of rest mass m 0 being m 0 defined as a projection or a reduction from 5D to 4D then we will always have the extra term as a consequence of the 5D Extra Dimension.This extra term could perhaps be discovered by experiments on-board International Space Station(ISS).See Section 8 in this work.</p>
<p>Writing explicitly the Gravitational Shift △ω formula in function of the Extra Coordinates we should expect for:
△ ω = 2m 0 r 0 (2 + [ 1 Ω(y) Φ dy dt ] 2 ) (290) △ ω = 2m 0 r 0 (2 + [ 1 Ω(y) φ(t, x)χ(y) dy dt ] 2 ) (291) △ ω = 2m 0 r 0 (2 + [ dβ dt ] 2 )(292)
The rest mass m 0 is function of the dynamical reduction from 5D to 4D according to Ponce De Leon-Basini-Capozziello formalism.We will rewrite the Kar-Sinha Gravitational Shift △ω formula accordingly using the original Extra Coordinate y and the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinate β for a massive M 5 = 0 body in 5D and for a massless one M 5 = 0 and for the Warp Field defined by Basini-Capozziello as Φ(t, x, y) = [φ(t, x)χ(y)].</p>

We have theoretical reasons(see ISS section) to believe that massive particles in 4D able to generate a Bending Of Light corresponds to the massive particles in 5D and we must concern ourselves in the cases 1 and 2 from above.</p>
<p>We must look for the extra terms generated by the presence of Extra Dimensions in eqs 296 and 301 and ISS is perfect accomplish such a task.</p>
<p>Note that Kar-Sinha wrote the 5D Black String considering G = c = 1 and the real Gravitational Bending of Light shift deviation formulas must include the factor G c 2 or at least the factor G multiplied by the 4D rest-mass m 0 of the Black Hole(or rest-mass m 0 of the body that generates the gravitational field and in consequence the Bending Of Light)lowering of course the shift effect by at least 10 −11 . In section 7 we will present the 5D Black String with the Gravitational Constant G included.</p>
<p>The Superluminal Chung-Freese BraneWorld.Hamilton-Jacobi equation and Ponce De Leon-Basini-Capozziello formalism:Everything is Geometry</p>
<p>Originally Chung-Freese Braneworld was proposed by the authors who gave their name to this metric designated to solve the Horizon Cosmological problem of Early Universe 73 . Later on 3 authors discovered that the Chung-Freese ansatz(see [4] and [10]) have Superluminal features that allows the bypass of the obstacles raised (correctly)against other Superluminal spacetime metrics(eg:Warp Drive) such as 72 see also eq 32 to 34,38 to 40 and 208 to 213 73 see Homepage of Katherine Freese at University of Michigan USA and her work on Cosmological Horizon Problem http://www.physics.lsa.umich.edu/department/directory/bio.asp?ID=105 negative energy(stress energy momentum tensor),Horizons(causally disconnected portions of spacetime) or Doppler Blueshifts.These obstacles appears naturally if we consider only a 3 + 1 Dimensional Spacetime "engineered" for Superluminal behaviour(see [19]).It is easy to see that a Warp Drive in our Universe even with the negative energy or Horizons problem solved by a still unknown spacetime metric would even face the Doppler Blueshifts of incoming photons from Cosmic Background Radiation with wavelengths shifted towards synchrotron radiation 74 impacting the Warp Bubble making the Warp Drive unstable.Plus impact with hazardous objects such as protons,electrons,clouds of space dust or debris,asteroids,meteors,comets,supernovas,neutron stars or black holes that would appear in front of a Warp Drive in a realistic travel across Outer Space in our Universe would disrupt and destroy any kind of Warp Drive. 7576 .Due to these reasons we conclude that Faster Than Light Space Travel is impossible in our 3 + 1 Einstein Universe not due to negative energies required to make Warp Drive work because some variations of the original Warp Drive ansatz are known that allows low levels of energy and perhaps using an advanced form of General Relativity it could be possible to find out an ansatz that would work with positive energy densities and also not due to Horizons because perhaps some advanced form of Quantum Gravity that encompasses non-local effects of Quantum Mechanics that would allow to signal the front of the Warp Bubble but Warp Drive is impossible due to impacts with hazardous objects that a Warp Drive would encounter in a realistic journey across a Galaxy.Outer Space is not empty and collisions at Superluminal speeds would be lethal destroying the Warp Drive and there is nothing we can do about this neither with our present science and nor with a Future science.Faster Than Light in Einstein Universe is doomed.Fortunately it seems that Nature left an open door for Faster Than Light Space Travel:The 5D Extra DImensions.Chung-Freese proposes that a particle leaves our Universe enters in the Extra Dimension and when back again to our Universe the particle would emerge in a distant place far away from its departure original point effectively doing a faster than light trip when "seen" from our 3 + 1 spacetime although in the 5D Extra Dimension the particle remains subluminal and free of lethal pathologies.(see pg 1850 in [10] and pg 2036 in [4]). We will adopt a point of view different than ( [4] and [10]) and explore in this section the Superluminal properties of Chung-Freese BraneWorld coupled to Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon formalism.Note that Basini-Capozziello also proposes the 5D for Superluminal travel.(see pg 127 in [1] and pg 2227 in [5].Also see fig 1 pg 135 in [1].Two distant points A and B in ordinary 3 + 1 spacetime connected by a spacetime "shortcut" in the 5D Extra Dimension:the "shaded" portion of the figure.According to Basini-Capozziello a trip that would demand lots of time in our Universe would be made in a small amount of time using this "shortcut".Then a particle travelling subluminally in the "shaded" area would be "seen" as a Superluminal in our 3 + 1 spacetime arriving from point A to point B 77 in a shorter period of time than a conventional 74 one of the most lethal forms or radiation with even more penetrating capability than gamma radiation.Think about how many photons of COBE we have per cubit centimeter of space and think in how many cubic centimeters of space exists between Earth and Proxima Centauri at 4 light-years away to better understand how synchrotron radiation is hazardous for Warp Drives.</p>
<p>75 "Travelling in Hyperspace is not dusting crops boy.Without precise calculations we will impact a Neutron Star or a Supernova or even a Meteor Shower".Harrison Ford as Captain Han Solo talking to Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker in the George Lucas movie Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope 76 Alcubierre Warp Drive considers a Warp Bubble with an observer at the rest inside the Bubble free from g-forces and spacetime being expanded behind and contracted in front generating a Superluminal speed.Natario Warp Drive considers also a Warp Bubble but being carried away by a spacetime "stream" without expansion or contraction.Just try to imagine a fish being carried by the stream of a river.The fish is free from g-forces also but an observer in the margins would see the fish moving with Superluminal speeds.Natario Warp Drive could be better pictured out if we replace the fish by a boat with an observer at the rest inside the boat free also from g-forces with respect to a local reference frame placed inside the boat.Both Warp Drives suffers from the pathologies mentioned here.See [19] for more details on Warp Drives 77 the point B in the Brane on the "other side" can be regarded as a "Shadow Brane".See 5D Black Strings section for Gregory-Laflamme equilibrim conditions. particle travelling only in our Universe.This picture from Basini-Capozziello really outlines the essence of the original Chung-Freese BraneWorld Model. )</p>
<p>The ansatz of Chung-Freese is given by(see eq 1 pg 2035 in [4] and eq 1 pg 1850 in [10]) :
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2ky a 2 dX 2 − dy 2 (320)
In the equation above and according to ([4] and [10]) X corresponds to our 3D spacetime while y is the 5D Extra Dimension.Solving the Null-Like Geodesics in 5D dS 2 = 0 we get(see eq 2 pg 2036 in [4] and eq 4 pg 1850 in [10]):
dX dt = e ky a 1 − ( dy dt ) 2(321)
According to original Chung-Freese point of view 78 a particle subluminal in the Extra Dimension(Bulk) being not affected by Horizons or Doppler Blueshifts dy dt &lt; 1 would be seen in our Universe(Brane) as Superluminal dX dt &gt; 1 due to the factor e ky a .(see pg 2036 in [4] and pg 1850 in [10]).The k here is the Chung-Freese Brane Lensing coefficient(see pg 2035 in [4] and pg 1850 in [10])</p>
<p>The energy density is positive and low and is given by:(see eq 3 pg 2036 in [4] and eq 5 pg 1850 in [10])
T 00 = −6k 2 + 3[( 1 a )( da dt )] 2 (322)
This is a remarkable feature of the Chung-Freese Superluminal Braneworld:energy density in a Superluminal environment without violating the energy conditions.(see comments on positive energies at pg 2036 in [4] and pg 1851 in [10].See also comments on negative energies at pg 482 in [19])</p>
<p>We adopt a point of view different than the one of the authors of ( [4] and [10]).While these works used trapping mechanisms(eg:Israel Conditions and pressures see pg 2042 to 2044 in [4] and pg 1851 to 1854 in [10]) to explain why matter do not propagate in the Extra Dimension and therefore we cannot "see" the 5D spacetime and many or these mechanisms are somewhat unphysical we use the Ponce De Leon-Basini-Capozziello formalism to demonstrate that 5D spacetime is already between us and what we see is a projective reduction from 5D to 4D spacetime being this reduction the responsible for the nature of the 5D Extra Dimension apparently invisible(see also a dimensional reduction from 5D to 4D at pg 2037 to 2040 in [4] although Basini-Capozziello have a more rigorous and concise mathematical formalism).We will also demonstrate that under the proper conditions we can make the 5D Extra Dimension appears visible. 79 We already know from Basini-Capozziello section in this work that the 5D Spacetime Ricci Tensor 5 R ab reduces to a Ricci Tensor in a 4D Spacetime 4 R ab if the Warp Field is Φ = 1. 80 Rewriting the Chung-Freese ansatz using the Warp Field we have:
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2ky a 2 dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(323)
Chung-Freese original ansatz is a special case of the above when the Warp Field Φ = 1.According to original Chung-Freese proposal(see pg 1850 in [10]) our Universe lies in the Brane y = 0. 81 Considering the Chung-Freese ansatz for our Universe we have the following:</p>
<p>78 also Basini-Capozziello in fig 1 pg 135 in [1] 79 although we admit that the Spacetime Metric Engineering for Faster Than Light Space Travel using the Superluminal Chung-Freese BraneWorld is still far away beyond our current capability 80 see footnote at pg 1347 of [2] where Ponce De Leon have an interesting comment of the Warp Field being Φ = 1 81 although y = 0 dy can be different than 0.Consider for example y = sin(0) = 0 being dy = cos(0) = 1
dS 2 = dt 2 − a 2 dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(324)
and we recover the ordinary FRW metric plus a Warp Field and a Extra Dimension.If we make a = 1 then
dS 2 = dt 2 − dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(325)
and we recover the ordinary ansatz of Special Relativity plus a Warp Field and a Extra Dimension. We know that Spacetime can be considered as flat in vacuum and masses only accounts for a small curvature except in the vicinity of large Black Holes.Then in the neighbourhoods of Earth Special Relativity holds and the 5D Special Relativity when the Warp Field Φ = 1 is given by:
dS 2 = dt 2 − dX 2 − dy 2(326)
In the spacetime above the signature is (+,-,-,-,-) and the metric tensor components are g 00 = +1,g 11 = g 22 = g 33 = −1 and the metric tensor component of the Extra Dimension is g 44 = −1.This is a diagonalized metric.</p>
<p>In this case the Ricci Tensor and Ricci Scalar of the 5D Spacetime are both equal to the same ones in 4D Spacetime. We know from Basini-Capozziello section that Ricci Tensors and Scalars are given by(α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3)([1] eq 58 and [5] eq 44) 82 :
5 R αβ = R αβ − Φ ,a;b Φ − 1 2Φ 2 ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 ) (327) 5 R = R − Φ ,a;b Φ g αβ − 1 2Φ 2 g αβ ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 ) (328) 5 R = R − 4 Φ Φ − 1 2Φ 2 g αβ ( Φ ,4 g αβ,4 Φ − g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ,4 2 ) (329)
We have a Warp Field Φ = 1 and then all the derivatives of the Warp Field vanish leaving us with:
5 R αβ = R αβ − 1 2
(−g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (330) 5 R = R − 1 2 g αβ (−g αβ,44 + g µν g µν,4 g αβ, 4 2 ) (331) but we also know that g ab = (+1, −1, −1, −1, −1) and all the derivatives of the spacetime metric tensor with respect to the Extra Dimension vanishes too.Therefore we are left with:
5 R αβ = R αβ (332) 5 R = R(333)
Then if the Ricci Tensor and Scalar in 5D and 4D Spacetimes are exactly the same ones and if the spacelike metric tensor components have the same value(−1) it is easy to see that the Einstein Tensor will have also the same value both in 5D and 4D.If the geometry of a flat spacetime in 5D is equal to the one in 4D we cannot tell if we live in a 5D or in a 4D spacetime.This one of the most important conclusions from the Basini-Capozziello reduction from 5D to 4D that makes the Extra Dimension invisible to our eyes without the need of exotic and unphysical trapping mechanisms and is also the reason why we cannot see the Extra Dimension in the vicinity of Earth because we lives in a region of the Universe where in flat spacetime the Warp Field Φ = 1.</p>
<p>Just suppose we can discover a process to make the value of the Warp Field Φ = 1. 83 The ansatz of Chung-Freese for our Universe in this case would be:
dS 2 = dt 2 − dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(334)
and in this case although the derivatives of the spacetime metric tensor g ab = (+1, −1, −1, −1, −Φ 2 ) still vanish(α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3) the derivatives of the Warp Field will not and this will make the Ricci Tensor and Scalar in 5D different than the ones in 4D.Then we will have:
5 R αβ = R αβ − Φ ,a;b Φ (335) 5 R = R − Φ ,a;b Φ g αβ (336) 5 R = R − 4 Φ Φ (337)
From above we can easily figure out that a Warp Field Φ = 1 will make the geometry of a 5D spacetime looks different than the one in 4D.This can be used to make the 5D Extra Dimension visible to tell if we live in a 5D or in a 4D spacetime.</p>
<p>Splitting the Warp Field Φ into 3 + 1 and 5D component([1] eq 76 and [5] eq 70):
Φ = φ(t, x)χ(y)(338)
We can see that the scripts α, β affects only the 3 + 1 component of the Warp Field Φ namely the component φ(t, x) and Φ ,a;
b = (Φ α ) β − Γ K βα Φ K giving Φ ,a;b = χ(y)[φ ,a;b ] = χ(y)[(φ α ) β ] − Γ K βα φ K ] Φ ,a;b Φ = χ(y)[φ ,a;b ] φ(t, x)χ(y) = [φ ,a;b ] φ(t, x) = [(φ α ) β − Γ K βα φ K ] φ(t, x)(339)
Rewrinting the Ricci Tensor with the expressions for the 3 + 1 component of the Warp Field Φ and the covariant derivative expression algebraically solved we have:
5 R αβ = R αβ − φ ,a;b φ (340) 5 R αβ = R αβ − [(φ α ) β − Γ K βα φ K ] φ(t, x)(341)
The above result is very important because it is the 3 + 1 component of the Warp Field Φ and its derivatives that will make the 5D Ricci Tensor be different than the one in 4D and this component can 83 perhaps studying gravitational bending of light or other physical effects on-board ISS or studying particle Z theoretically be affected by 3 + 1 phenomena.So it is the physics of the 3 + 1 spacetime that will make the 5D Extra Dimension be visible. Now applying the Basini-Capozziello 5D to 4D reduction to the original Chung-Freese ansatz (eq 1 pg 2035 in [4] and eq 1 pg 1850 in [10]) :
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2ky a 2 dX 2 − dy 2 (342)
We have a Warp Field Φ = 1 and the spacetime metric components are given by (g ab = +1, −e −2ky a 2 , −1) and the Ricci Tensors are given by R 00 and R 11 .Since the derivatives of the Warp Field will vanish we are left with the following expressions:
5 R 00 = R 00 − 1 2
(−g 00,44 + g 00 g 00,4 g 00, 4 2 ) (343)
5 R 11 = R 11 − 1 2 (−g 11,44 + g 11 g 11,4 g 11,4 2 ) (344)
But the derivatives of g 00 = +1 with respect to the Extra Coordinate vanishes leaving us with a reduction from 5D to 4D 5 R 00 = R 00 and the 5D Extra Dimension only affects the 5 R 11 .Note that if e 2ky &gt;&gt; a then the derivatives of g 11 with respect to the Extra Coordinate will vanish too and we will have the approximate result 5 R 11 ≃ R 11 .We will provide an example:</p>
<p>Consider a = e −y (pg 2036 in [4] and pg 1852 to 1853 in [10]).The ansatz of Chung-Freese would then be:
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2y(k+1) dX 2 − dy 2 (345)
The Null-Like geodesics and energy density would be respectively:
dX dt = e y(k+1) 1 − ( dy dt ) 2 (346) T 00 = −6k 2 + 3[( dy dt )] 2(347)
Note that this ansatz retains the Superluminal behaviour dy dt &lt; 1 dX dt &gt;&gt; 1 e y(k+1) &gt;&gt; 1 and the positive (and low) energy density features if y &gt; √ 2kt y ≃ √ 2kt T 00 &gt; 0 T 00 ≃ 0.The derivatives of the g 11 spacetime metric component with respect to the Extra Coordinate are given by:
g 11,4 = 2[a( da dy ) − ka 2 ] e 2ky = − 2(k + 1) e 2y(k+1) (348) g 2 11,4 = 4[a( da dy ) − ka 2 ] 2 e 4ky = 4(k + 1) 2 e 4y(k+1)(349)g 11,44 = 2[( da dy ) 2 + a( d 2 a dy 2 ) − 2ka( da dy )] − 2k[a( da dy ) − ka 2 ] e 2ky = − 4k(y + 1) e 2y(k+1)(350)
Note the if we have a value for the Chung-Freese Brane Lensing coefficient k = 100 for example then e k = e 100 = 2, 6 × 10 43 and k 2 e k ≃ 10 4 e 100 ≃ 3, 7 × 10 −40 a value practically negligible making valid the relation 5 R 11 ≃ R 11 effectively and approximately a reduction from 5D to 4D as Basini-Capozziello stated.Then even consider a Extra Dimension y = 0 the Ricci Tensor in 5D is approximately equal to a one in 4D and we cannot "see" the 5D Extra Dimension due to the reasons presented here although a particle in the 5D Extra Dimension would be "seen" as Superluminal in 4D.A bold line of reason of course would be considering the apparent non-local effects of Quantum Mechanics as the "Superluminality" of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen(EPR) Paradox as matter moving inside the 5D but apparently invisible to us.Note that in our Universe y = 0 and a = 1 and the derivatives of g 11,4 and g 11,44 are exactly zero and the reduction from 5D to 4D is an exact value.</p>
<p>In order to "see" the 5D Extra Dimension we must make the Warp Field Φ = 1.Then the complete ansatz of Chung-Freese with Warp Field in a Basini-Capozziello reduction from 5D to 4D would be given by:
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2ky a 2 dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(351)
For our special case:
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2y(k+1) dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2 (352) 5 R 00 = R 00 − Φ ,0;0 Φ − 1 2Φ 2 ( Φ ,4 g 00,4
Φ − g 00,44 + g 00 g 00,4 g 00, 4 2 ) (353)
5 R 11 = R 11 − Φ ,1;1 Φ − 1 2Φ 2 ( Φ ,4 g 11,4 Φ − g 11,44 + g 11 g 11,4 g 11,4 2 )(354)
Note again that the derivatives of g 00 = +1 vanishes leaving us with the following result:
5 R 00 = R 00 − Φ ,0;0 Φ(355)
And from our previous calculations we know that the derivatives of g 11 = −e −2ky a 2 or g 11 = −e −2y(k+1) can be neglected leaving us with the expression:
5 R 11 ≃ R 11 − Φ ,1;1 Φ(356)
Note that we obtained for the expressions
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2ky a 2 dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(357)
and
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2y(k+1) dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(358)
the same result in terms of Ricci Tensors of the previous expression
dS 2 = dt 2 − dX 2 − Φ 2 dy 2(359)
And the results in terms of Ricci Tensor for the expressions:
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2ky a 2 dX 2 − dy 2(360)
and
dS 2 = dt 2 − e −2y(k+1) dX 2 − dy 2(361)
are the same of the previous expression
dS 2 = dt 2 − dX 2 − dy 2(362)
This is of extreme importance:while we can have a point in our Universe y = 0 or moving along the 5D Extra Dimension g 11 = −e −2ky a 2 or g 11 = −e −2y(k+1) if we have a Warp Field Φ = 1 the geometry of the 5D spacetime is approximately equal to a one in 4D and we cannot "see" the Extra Dimension.So the derivatives of y do not account for changes in the spacetime geometry and wether we are in our Universe or in 5D spacetime we cannot "see" the Extra Dimension.Perhaps some non-local effects of Quantum Mechanics that seems to have an apparent "Superluminality" are actually matter moving in the 5D Extra Dimension of the Chung-Freese BraneWorld and the invisibility of the 5D spacetime is the responsible for making this motion apparently non-local. On the other hand if we have a Warp Field Φ = 1 then the Warp Field will make the 5D spacetime geometry be different than the 4D counterpart and the Warp Field will make the 5D Extra Dimension visible wether we are in our Universe or moving Superluminally along the Chung-Freese BraneWorld.</p>
<p>The Null-Like geodesics in the complete Chung-Freese BraneWorld(with Warp Field Φ) is given by:
dX dt = e ky a 1 − (Φ dy dt ) 2(363)
or for our special case a = e −y
dX dt = e y(k+1) 1 − (Φ dy dt ) 2(364)
This ansatz have the Superluminal capability due to the factor e ky a or e y(k+1) if Φ dy dt &lt; 1 Ponce De Leon considers the rest mass m 0 seen in 4D as function of the 5D mass M 5 .So wether we are moving Superluminally in the Chung-Freese BraneWorld or subluminally in our Universe there exists always a mass M 5 associated to the factor Φ 2 dy 2 .According to Chung-Freese a body must "enter" in the Extra Dimension to achieve Superluminal motion.So if we suppose a body of "mass" "entering" in the 5D Extra Dimension then this "mass" in the Chung-Freese Extra Dimension is the M 5 from Ponce De Leon.Then all the bodies we can see with rest mass m 0 in 4D are already in the Chung-Freese spacetime with the "mass" M 5 moving subluminally (or Superluminally in the case of non-locality in Quantum Mechanics) 84 but we cannot see the M 5 .On the other hand Ponce De Leon considers both null and non-null M 5 .A "rigid" body in the Extra Dimension(eg:a spaceship) must possess a non-null M 5 while photons can have a null M 5 .</p>
<p>The M 5 can be defined by the geometry of the spacetime ansatz using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation(see eqs 55 to 57 at pg 1348 to 1349 in [2] and eq 1 pg 1368 and eqs 10 to 13 pg 1369 in [11]) .

Adapting for Chung-Freese(0 is time,1 is our 3 + 1 spacetime and 2 is the Extra Dimension)
y 00 ( ∂S ∂x 0 ) 2 + y 11 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 + y 22 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 = M 2 5 (368) y 00 ( ∂S ∂x 0 ) 2 + y 11 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 + y 22 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 = M 5(369)
Rewriting Ponce De Leon equation for m 0 in function of M 5 using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in the Chung-Freese spacetime with a Warp Field Φ we get the following result:
m 0 = y 00 ( ∂S ∂x 0 ) 2 + y 11 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 + y 22 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 1 − Φ 2 ( dy ds ) 2(370)
For the original Chung-Freese ansatz we would have:
m 0 = y 00 ( ∂S ∂x 0 ) 2 + y 11 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 + y 22 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 1 − ( dy ds ) 2(371)
Writing the equations using the spacetime metric tensor components:
m 0 = ( ∂S ∂t ) 2 − e 2ky a 2 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 − 1 Φ 2 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 1 − Φ 2 ( dy ds ) 2 (372) m 0 = ( ∂S ∂t ) 2 − e 2ky a 2 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 − ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 1 − ( dy ds ) 2(373)
From the Hamilton-Jacobi equation the possible values for M 5
( ∂S ∂t ) 2 − e 2ky a 2 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 − 1 Φ 2 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2 = M 2 5(374)
are the following:
• 1) -Timelike 5D geodesics M 2 5 &gt; 0 ( ∂S ∂t ) 2 − e 2ky a 2 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 &gt; 1 Φ 2 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2(375)
• 2) -Nulllike 5D geodesics
M 2 5 = 0 ( ∂S ∂t ) 2 − e 2ky a 2 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 = 1 Φ 2 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2(376)
• 3) -Spacelike 5D geodesics
M 2 5 &lt; 0 ( ∂S ∂t ) 2 − e 2ky a 2 ( ∂S ∂x 1 ) 2 &lt; 1 Φ 2 ( ∂S ∂x 2 ) 2(377)
Since M 5 the 5D rest mass of a body defines the m 0 the rest mass "seen" in 4D and M 5 is defined in function of the geometry of the spacetime ansatz by the Hamilton-Jacobi equation then we can see that all masses are functions of the properties of the spacetime ansatz or in other words:Everything is Geometry.</p>
<p>A future spacetime "metric engineering" must discover a way to make the Warp Field be different than 1 to enable the visibility of the 5D Extra Dimension in the Chung-Freese spacetime.If in the future we can accomplish this then we have perhaps the perfect ansatz for Faster Than Light Space Travel without the hazardous pathologies of the Warp Drive spacetime.See ISS section for some possible experiments. Maartens-Clarkson argued that gravity wave detectors can also be used to probe the existence of the Extra Dimensions .They postulate that gravity propagating in a Higher Dimensional Spacetime may have extra polarization modes (see abstract and pg 1681 in [7]) for the gravity waves that can be detected by spectroscopic signature by LIGO or LISA.(see pg 1683 in [7]). Although the graviton in 4D is a particle of zero rest-mass 85 Maartens-Clarkson uses the massive Kaluza-Klein modes(see eqs 3 and 4 and pg 1683 in [7]) to compute a non-zero rest-mass for the 5D graviton.This non-zero rest-mass graviton propagates below light-speed(see pg 1686 in [7]) leaving a "fingerprint" in the propagation modes of the gravitational wave that can in principle be detected(see fig 3 
dS 2 = e −2 |y| l [(1 − 2GM r )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2GM r ) − r 2 dη 2 ] − dy 2(379)
Note that this equation is almost the same of Kar-Sinha(see pg 1780 eq 13 in [3]) but without the Warp Field Φ.The M depicted here is the 4D rest-mass m 0 projection of a 5D rest-mass M 5 according to 85 see table of elementary particles at section 9 86 since we consider induced STM formalism our Einstein Equations would be given by eqs 3 in [9],9 in [12] and pg 1346(the appendix) of [13].We will consider the presented equation due to the Gregory-Laflamme stability conditions but future studies could be used to analyze in parallel both RS and STM formalisms 87 this is not new since both are describing the 5D Schwarzschild Black Hole</p>
<p>Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon and since m 0 is function of the Warp Factor Ω and Warp Field Φ we choose to rewrite the equation considering also the Warp Field associated to the Extra Coordinate:
dS 2 = e −2 |y| l [(1 − 2GM r )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2GM r ) − r 2 dη 2 ] − Φdy 2(380)
This equation have the Warp Factor Ω(y) = e −2 |y| l and the Warp Field Φ according to Ponce De Leon-Basini-Capozziello formalism.Using the Kar-Sinha conformal coordinates(see pg 1780 eq 14 in [3]) the same equation could be written as follows:
dS 2 = e −2 |y| l <a href="381">(1 − 2GM r )dt 2 − dr 2 (1 − 2GM r ) − r 2 dη 2 − dβ 2 </a>
Also note that when y = 0(the "Visible" Brane) we recover the 4D Schwarzschild Solution while when y = d the Brane located at a distance d separated from our "Visible" Brane in a Higher Dimensional Spacetime we have the so-called "Shadow" Brane. 88 (see pg 1682 after eq 1 in [7]) Now we will diverge a little from original Maartens-Clarkson point of view:if every body of rest mass M in 4D got its mass as a geometric projection of a 5D massive body M 5 due to a geometrical reduction from 5D to 4D as Basini-Capozziello proposed then our "Visible" Brane must have a "Invisible" component in the 5D Spacetime otherwise for a (M 5 = 0 and a y = 0 and a dy ds = 0) or (M 5 = 0 and a dy = ds a Ponce De Leon Null-Like 5D geodesics) we would be left with a flat spacetime with g ab = +1, −1, −1, −1, −1) and a Warp Field Φ = 1 and according to section 4 the Ricci Tensor of a 5D spacetime reduces to a one in 4D Spacetime and in a flat 4D spacetime where the Ricci tensor is zero we cannot see the "Invisible" component.(see [1] eq 58 and [5] eq 44)</p>
<p>Then is reasonable to assume that our 4D Schwarzschild Black Hole is automatically a 5D Black String however the Extra component is "hidden" from ourselves. 89 Maartens-Clarkson argue that if the Horizon radius of the Black String along the "Visible" Brane 2GM is much greater than the size of the Extra Dimension y = d then 2GM &gt;&gt; d the extension of the Horizon into the 5D Dimension is being cut-off by the "Shadow" Brane at y = d.(see pg 1682 and fig 1 pg 1683 in [7]).Note that every Black Hole is a Black String since M the mass in 4D is function of the M 5 in 5D so every Horizon extends into the Extra Dimension. Now the contrast between our interpretation and original Maartens-Clarkson however their conclusions can be applied to our point of view:</p>
<p>For a Black String of large Horizon radius we agree with Maartens-Clarkson about the intersection between the "Shadow" Brane and the Horizon.However for small Black Strings (small 5D Black Holes) they argue that these are not able to "see" the Shadow Brane at y = d due to the fact that 2Gm &lt;&lt; d and behaves like a 5D Black Hole located only on the "Visible" Brane.(look for the contrast between the bigger and smaller Black String at fig 1 pg 1683 in [7]) Our divergence with respect to original Maartens-Clarkson idea is due to the fact that m the rest-mass of the Black String even for a smaller that cannot "see" the "Shadow" Brane at y = d is function of the 5D Spacetime so we can define another "Shadow" Brane located at y = p and 2Gm &gt;&gt; p,Then although the smaller Black String cannot "see" the "Shadow" Brane d it is able to "see" the "Shadow" Brane p. 88 the "Shadow" Brane can either be a different Universe or a remote region of our own Universe "connected" to our local region by the Black String.Consider the concept of Parallel Universes or a Multiverse according to Hugh Everett III where every "Shadow" Brane is a alternative version of out own Universe 89 remember that according to Basini-Capozziello we cannot perceive the 5D Extra Dimension in the same way we cannot "see" the time as the 4D Dimension and we are left only with the ordinary three spatial Dimensions to perceive.See pg 123 in [1] Note that d is the distance between our "Visible" Brane and the "Shadow" Brane intercepted by the Horizon of the bigger Black String while p is the distance from our Brane to the "Shadow" Brane intercepted by the smaller Black String and we can easily see that d &gt;&gt; p.(try to draw another "Shadow" Brane near our "Visible" Brane that intercepts the Horizon 2Gm of the smaller Black String in fig 1 pg 1683 in [7].This second "Shadow" Brane is the Brane p near to our own "Visible" Brane while d is the farther "Shadow" Brane.)</p>
<p>A "Shadow" Brane at a large distance d from our own Brane will have a smaller Warp Factor compared to the one for a "Shadow" Brane at a short distance p due to the fact that the Warp Factor is inversely proportional to the separation between Branes and then Ω(d) &lt;&lt; Ω(p) because Ω(d) = e −2 |d| l = 1 e 2 |d| l will be less than Ω(p) = e −2 |p| l = 1
e 2 |p| l if d &gt;&gt; p.
If the "Shadow" Brane is located at a very long distance from our Brane then the Warp Factor will be close to zero and the line element of the original Maartens-Clarkson 5D Black String will tend to:
dS 2 = dy 2 dS 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 − dy 2 Ω(y) → 0 y &gt;&gt; 0(382)
We must concern ourselves now with the distance between our "Visible" Brane and the "Shadow" Branes which means to say the factors p l = 10 4 × p and d l = 10 4 × d. According to Maartens-Clarkson Solar System observations imposes the factor d l ≥ 5 or p l ≥ 5.Remember that still under Maartens-Clarkson any "Shadow" Brane must be far away enough to keep its gravitational influence on the "Visible" Brane within observational limits.(see pg 1683 in [7]). However we can see that the "Shadow" Branes actually are near to our "Visible" Brane due to the fact that p l = (10 4 × p) ≥ 5 or d l = (10 4 × d) ≥ 5. The distance between the "Visible" Brane and the "Shadow" Branes for the small and large Black Strings would then be given by d ≥ 5 10 4 and p ≥ 5 10 4 or better d ≥ 0, 00005 m and p ≥ 0, 00005 m (m = meters).</p>
<p>Rewriting the Gregory-Laflamme equilibrium condition taking in mind that d ≥ 5 × 10 −4 and p ≥ 5 × 10 −4 too we have the following results(d = 0, 00005 m and p = 0, 00005 m):
GM ≥ e 5 10 5(387)
Gm ≥ e 5 10 5</p>
<p>The Equilibrium Conditions are low values due to the fact that 10 5 &gt; e 5 then both Black Strings are stable.</p>
<p>Note that we can write the Equilibrium Conditions in function of the spacetime metric Warp Factor as follows.
GM ≥ 0.1 × le d l GM ≥ 0.1 × l 1 Ω(d) GM ≥ 0.1 × l Ω(d) GM ≥ 1 10 5 Ω(d)(389)Gm ≥ 0.1 × le p l Gm ≥ 0.1 × l 1 Ω(p) Gm ≥ 0.1 × l Ω(p) Gm ≥ 1 10 5 Ω(p)(390)
"Shadow" Branes at large distances from our "Visible" Brane will have smaller Warp Factors than Branes at short distances and will require greater values for the Gregory-Laflamme Equilibrium conditions. We will apply now the Equilibrium Conditions for some "Shadow" Branes at small distances from our "Visible" Brane with the distance values d given by the table of fig 2 pg 1684 in [7] and considering a massive Black String of 4D rest-mass M . </p>
<p>From above we can verify an interesting conclusion:a "Shadow" Brane at 1 millimeter of distance from our own "Visible" Brane will have a Gregory-Laflamme Equilibrium Condition value much lower than a "Shadow" Brane at 4 milimeters.Then a "Shadow" Brane at 1 millimeter away can stabilize a Black String of low rest-mass more easy than a Brane at 4 millimeters away.The Equilibrium Conditions raises exponentially with distance. From above we can see that Black Strings of low rest-mass can only be stabilized against infrared cut-off if the "Shadow" Brane is very near to our own "Visible" Brane as previously stated.</p>
<p>Analyzing the fig 1 pg 1683 in [7] we can see that the large Black String can be stabilized by a "Shadow" Brane far away from our "Visible" Brane due to a large 4D rest-mass M while a small Black String can only be stabilized by a "Shadow" Brane near to our own because it do not have a Horizon large enough to reach a distant Brane.The small Black String in this case (fig 1) will not be stabilized due to the absence of a near "Shadow" Brane.</p>
<p>The values for the distance between Branes depicted in fig 2 pg 1684 in [7] are the minimum Brane separation distances detectable by LIGO 90 or LISA 9192 instruments.(see pg 1683 in [7]).</p>
<p>The gravitational effects seen on the "Visible" Brane by these "Shadow" Branes are the additional propagation modes for the massive graviton which means to say that the "fingerprint" to verify if these "Shadow" Branes really exists are the detection in our "Visible" Brane of massive gravitons with non-zero rest-mass generated by the presence of the "Shadow" Branes in Extra Dimensional spacetime.(see pg 1683 in [7]).</p>
<p>These massive gravitons travel below light-speed(see pg 1686 in [7]) and can affect the gravity wave signal waveform according to fig 3 pg 1685 in [7] producing late-time oscillations in the gravity wave signal.(see pg 1683 in [7]).</p>
<p>The non-zero rest-mass m 0n seen in 4D in our "Visible" Brane for this massive graviton generated by a "Shadow" Brane at a distance d from our Brane is given by:(see eq 3 pg 1683 in [7] </p>
<p>The values of z n have a spacing of order 1. 93 Then z n = 0, 1, 2, 3, .., 10, .....n being z n = 0 the propagation mode for the 4D standard graviton.(see pg 1683 and 1684 in [7]). Note that for a distant Brane the restmass of the graviton decreases exponentially in function of the distance since the factor 10 4 ×z n is multiplied by exponentially decreasing small numbers .Then we can see that distant "Shadow" Branes have a weaker influence in our Brane than near "Shadow" Branes and requires a higher value in the Equilibrium conditions to stabilize the Black String.</p>
<p>We present a table of these lowering factors for the graviton mass 10 4 × z n × 1 e 10 4 ×d : d For a given z n = 1 a "Shadow" Brane at 1 millimeter away from our "Visible" Brane will generate a much more heavier graviton than a Brane at 4 millimeters away because at a short distance its influence on our "Visible" Brane will be stronger. </p>
<p>Note that for distant "Shadow" Branes the frequency of the graviton is lower than the frequency for near "Shadow" Branes and the frequencies decrease exponentially with the Brane distance d.Of course distant Branes have a weaker influence over our own "Visible" Brane as previously stated.A stronger frequency means a massive graviton and can be more easily detected.</p>
<p>The frequency decreasing factor e 27 e 10 4 ×d is given in the following table in function of the distance d d Note that for a "Shadow" Brane at 2 millimeters from our own "Visible" Brane and for a given z n = 1 the frequency of the massive graviton will be 1, 096633158 × 10 3 Hz or around 1 KHz well within LIGO detection capabilities(pg 1684 in [7]).</p>
<p>Maartens-Clarkson computes a upper-limit frequency for graviton massive modes for LIGO detection of being f n = 10 4 Hz for a "Shadow" Brane distance of d l = 20 being l = 0, 1 mm l = 10 −4 m.(see pg 1683 and 1684 in [7]).</p>
<p>In this case the distance between our "Visible" Brane and the "Shadow" Brane would be given by Since we have a given frequency we can compute the value of the z n and the expected value for the mass of the graviton. </p>
<p>Note that this value although very small is not zero and a detection of this massive graviton would be a very good proof of a Higher Dimensional Spacetime.</p>
<p>A Typical frequency for LIGO would be according to Maartens-Clarkson f n = 10 2 Hz.(see pg 1684 in [7]).</p>
<p>Computing the values of z n and massive graviton for a "Shadow" Brane at 2 millimeters from our own we should expect for: </p>
<p>The massive graviton for this typical optimal frequency is lighter than the one predicted for the upperlimit frequency but again the rest-mass is non-zero although this massive mode will be more difficult to detect.</p>
<p>We have two different rest-masses here:one is the rest-mass seen in 4D M of the 5D Black String rest-mass M 5 from a reduction from 5D to 4D and the another rest-mass is the rest-mass of the massive graviton mode resulting from the wave propagation in Higher Dimensional Spacetime.</p>
<p>Rewriting the Gregory-Laflamme Equilibrium Condition using the 5D Black String rest-mass M 5 and a generic "Shadow" Brane at a distance y from our own we should expect for:
G M 5 Ω(y) [1 − Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ] ≥ 0.1 × le</p>
<p>The Experimental Detection of Extra Dimensions in Outer Space on-board International Space Station(ISS)</p>
<p>International Space Station is intended to be a laboratory designated to test the forefront theories of Physics that leads towards the unification between General Relativity and Quantum Theory(see abstract and pg 601-602 in [8]) to achieve a better understanding of the relationships between different theories of Fundamental Physics (Universal Theories eg:Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity and Physical Theories eg:Eletromagnetic Interaction on the Standard Model of Particle Physics)(see pg 616-617 in [6]) 94 .Also ISS can provide a better environment for Physical experiences without the interference of Earth secondary effects that will disturb careful measures specially for gravity-related experiments.(see pg 602-603 for the advantage of the free-fall conditions for experiments in [8]) We argue that the Gravitational Bending Of Light first measured by Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington in a Sun Eclipse in 1919 is widely known as the episode that made Einstein famous but had more than 30 percent of error margin. In order to find out if the Extra Dimension exists(or not) we need to measure the factor C 2 of Kar-Sinha coupled to a Higher Dimensional definition of m 0 with a accurate precision of more than △ω &lt; 2.8 × 10 −4 .( see pg 1783 in [3]).ISS can use the orbit of the Moon to create a "artificial eclipse" 95 to get precise measurements of the Gravitational Bending Of Light and according to Kar-Sinha detect the existence of the 5D Extra Dimension.ISS will be used to probe the foundations of General Relativity and Gravitational Bending of Light certainly will figure out in the experiences(see pg 626 in [6]).ISS Gravitational shifts are capable to detect measures of △ω ω with Expected Uncertainly of 12 × 10 −6 (see pg 629 Table I in [6]) smaller than the one predicted by Kar-Sinha for the Extra Dimensions although the ISS shifts are red-shifts and not Bending of Light similar precision can be achieved.Also red-shifts are due to a time delay in signals and the 5D can also affect this measure as proposed by Kar-Sinha.(see pg 1782 in [3]).The goal of ISS is to achieve a Gravitational Shift Precision of 2.4 × 10 −7 (see pg 631 Table II in [6]) by far more than enough to detect the existence of the 5D Extra Dimension. As for Extra Dimensions on ISS see also abstract and pages 523 to 525 of [16] where this research is explicitly quoted bases on the Newton Constant G 96 .However we believe that Gravitational Bending Of Light can also clarify the question if we live in a Higher Dimensional Universe or not.A small deviation in a photon path can solve the quest for Higher Dimensional Spacetimes. A link between Extra Dimensions and Gravitational Bending Of Light could perhaps be exploited using the experiments of Universality Of Free Fall(UFF) and Universality of Gravitational Redshift(UGR) carried also on-board ISS as described in <a href="see pg 571 and 572 in [17] for UGR taking in mind that the Gravitational Red Shift or Time Delay can be affected by Extra Dimensions as proposed in pg 1782 in [3].See also pg 585 for experiments in Outer Space and pg 589 for ISS experiments both in [17]">17</a>. An example:considering that charge-induced violations of the UFF are bigger than the charge-to-mass ratio 97 (pg 573 in [17]) examine eqs 1 and 2 in [17] where electromagnetic violations of the UFF are described splitting the inertial and gravitational masses of a particle into bare parts and parts depending on the eletric charge: 94 see the comment on Strings Theory which leads undoubtedly to Extra Dimensions below fig 1 pg 617 in [6] 95 we agree that idea is weird but is better than to wait for a Sun Eclipse in the proper conditions 96 [16] 
m i = m 0 i (1 + k i e m 0 i ) (421) m g = m 0 g (1 + k g e m 0 g )(422)
Note that m 0 i is the inertial rest-mass and m 0 g is the gravitational rest-mass both seen in 4D and according to Ponce De Leon 98 the 4D rest-mass is function of the 5D spacetime geometry. Also the electric charge seen in 4D 99 is function of the 5D spacetime geometry too.Perhaps the UFF and Eotvos experiments on-board ISS can be used to detect the presence of the Extra Dimensions since mass and charges are affected by the Higher Dimensional nature of spacetime geometry.</p>
<p>Rewriting eqs 421 and 422 using 5D we should expect for: 100
m i = (M 5 Ω(y) 1 − Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ) i (1 + k i − M 5 √ Ω(y)Φ 2 dy ds 1− Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 (M 5 √ Ω(y) 1− Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ) i ) (423) m g = (M 5 Ω(y) 1 − Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ) g (1 + k g − M 5 √ Ω(y)Φ 2 dy ds 1− Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 (M 5 √ Ω(y) 1− Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ) g )(424)
We can clearly see from above that the inertial and gravitational mass in 4D is affected by the 5D rest-mass M 5 and Extra Dimensions can affect the UFF experiments on-board ISS.</p>
<p>Also look at the modified Eotvos coefficient([17] eq 6) also in function of rest-mass and charges than can also be determined by 5D geometry.
η = η 0 (1 + κ e 2 m 0 2 ) (425) η = η 0 (1 + κ (− M 5 √ Ω(y)Φ 2 dy ds 1− Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ) (M 5 √ Ω(y) 1− Φ 2 Ω(y) ( dy ds ) 2 ) )(426)
See the comment on the Witteborn-Fairbank experiment related to charge-to-mass ratio in pg 575 in [17] and consider that electrons and protons have the 4D rest-masses defined in function of the 5D geometry.Here is a clear example how 5D can affect experiments in 4D</p>
<p>The charge-to-mass ratio would then be defined as:
e m 0 = Φu 4 = −Φ 2 dy ds(427)
And the Eotvos coefficient would then be defined using Warp Fields and Extra Dimensions affecting the Witteborn-Fairbank experiment as follows: 98 see pg 1341 eq 20 in [2] 99 see eqs 19 to 22 in [11] with electromagnetic vector potentials Aµ = 0 to simplify in this case 100 equations written with Warp Factors
η = η 0 (1 − κΦ 2 dy ds )(428)
Applying this to the inertial and gravitational masses:
m i = m 0 i (1 − k i Φ 2 dy ds ) (429) m g = m 0 g (1 − k g Φ 2 dy ds )(430)
We can clearly see that in a 5D Timelike geodesics dy ds &lt;</p>
<p>√ Ω(y) Φ dy ds =</p>
<p>√ Ω(y)</p>
<p>N Φ being N a integer and the Eotvos coefficient or inertial/gravitational masses would be given by:
η = η 0 (1 − κΦ 2 Ω(y) N Φ ) η 0 (1 − κΦ Ω(y) N )(431)
Applying this to the inertial and gravitational masses:
m i = m 0 i (1 − k i Φ 2 Ω(y) N Φ ) m 0 i (1 − k i Φ Ω(y) N ) (432) m g = m 0 g (1 − k g Φ 2 Ω(y) N Φ ) m 0 g (1 − k g Φ Ω(y) N ) (433) If k i Φ √ Ω(y) N &gt; 1 or k g Φ √ Ω(y) N &gt; 1 or κΦ √ Ω(y) N</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 would mean a final inertial/gravitational mass negative also a final Eotvos coefficient negative which does not make sense.Then for a 5D Timelike geodesics being N a integer the same analysis for Eotvos and inertial/gravitational masses would be given by:
k i Φ √ Ω(y) N &lt; 1, k g Φ √η = η 0 (1 − κΦ 2 N Ω(y) Φ ) η 0 (1 − κN Φ Ω(y))(434)m i = m 0 i (1 − k i Φ 2 N Ω(y) Φ ) m 0 i (1 − k i N Φ Ω(y)) (435) m g = m 0 g (1 − k g Φ 2 N Ω(y) Φ ) m 0 g (1 − k g N Φ Ω(y))(436)
Note that if κN Φ Ω(y) &gt; 1,k i N Φ Ω(y) &gt; 1 or k g N Φ Ω(y) &gt; 1 we would have also negative Eotvos or inertial/gravitational masses.Then the reasonable values are the κN Φ Ω(y) &lt; 1,k i N Φ Ω(y) &lt; 1 or k g N Φ Ω(y) &lt; 1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back again to charge-to-mass ration considering 5D Timelike or Spacelike geodesics:</p>
<p>• Timelike Geodesics
e m 0 = Φu 4 = −Φ 2 dy ds = −Φ 2 Ω(y) N Φ = −Φ Ω(y) N(437)
• Spacelike Geodesics
e m 0 = Φu 4 = −Φ 2 dy ds = −Φ 2 N Ω(y) Φ = −ΦN Ω(y)(438)
From above we can see that while rest-masses have no sign,the electric charge have sign and the Warp Field is the responsible for the sign of the electric charge 101102 .Note that a negative sign Warp Field do not affect the metric signature since the spacetime metric tensor is written in function of Φ 2 .</p>
<p>Antimatter particles have the same rest-mass of its ordinary matter counterparts but charges of the same modulus and opposite signs and its the sign of the Warp Field that determines the sign of the charge.</p>
<p>For example if we have a Warp Field for a particle of ordinary matter defined as Φ(t, χ, y) = −ζ(t, χ, y) being t time,χ the spatial coordinates and y the Extra Dimension, then the charge-to-mass ratio for a Timelike 5D geodesics would be given by ζ √ Ω(y) N and the Spacelike one by ζN Ω(y). The Antimatter counterpart of this Warp Field would then be:Φ(t, χ, y) = ζ(t, χ, y) and the Timelike and Spacelike 5D geodesics would then be given by −ζ √ Ω(y) N and −ζN Ω(y). The charge-to-mass ratio for antimatter is the same for ordinary matter except for the sign of the charge.ISS also considers experiments with antimatter and this affects the results of the experiments(see pg 579 between eqs 17 and 18 in [17]). An interesting feature of the 5D formalism is the fact that every charged particle matter or antimatter have a rest-mass m 0 in 4D defined in function of a rest-mass M 5 in 5D possibly from a 5D Timelike or Spacelike geodesics and all the neutral particles(null electric charge) have a Null-like geodesics in 5D and a 5D rest mass M 5 = 0 103 to produce in 4D a rest mass m 0 = 0 104 from a dS 2 = 0 and a ds 2 = 0.We conclude then that these particles possesses a Null-like geodesics in 4D. 105106 A remarkable exception is the particle Z that possesses non-null rest mass m 0 but a null charge.The particle Z according to the 5D formalism possesses a ds = 0 and non-zero rest-mass m 0 but zero electric charge.Particle Z as we will see is a special case.Every particle of non-zero 4D rest-mass m 0 but zero electric charge could possess or a 4D Null-like ds = 0 geodesics or a null dy = 0 but a non-null 5D dS = 0 geodesics and this Null-like geodesics is the responsible for the neutral electric charge in the case of the absence of electromagnetic vector potentials to produce a zero electric charge and a non-null 4D rest-mass m 0 from a non-null 5D rest-mass M 5 as shown below and in 19 to 22 in [11]. 107108109 .  [11] 103 from [2] eq 22 otherwise dS = +∞ 104 we recall the reader that the neutron although having a non-zero rest mass have a zero electric charge due to the fact that the neutron is composed by 3 quarks udd and the sum of all quark charges +2 105 see pg 1342 and 1343 in [2] eq 26 to 28.From eq 28 we can clearly see that ds = 0 otherwise dλ = +∞.Then ds = 0 and dλ = 0 and dy dλ = 0 according to eq 27 produces a m0 = 0. 106 We can then conclude that the case M5 = 0 is applicable only for the case of particles with null 4D charge and null 4D rest-mass m0 as the case of photons or gravitons.</p>
<p>107 remember that eq 20 in [11] have electromagnetic vector potential and −Φ dy ds − Aµu µ = 0 or Φ dy ds = −Aµu µ giving a Φdy = −Aµdx µ giving the null result of eq 20.Note that Φdy = − Aµdx µ .Compare this with [1] eq 83, [5] eq 77 and [12] eq 19 108 Electromagnetic vector potentials will appear in a future work 109 read carefully pg 1370 and 1371 in [11] and look to eqs 21 to 24.we can clearly see that a null charge implies in a null mass for the case of photons or gravitons and we cannot have a null charge and a non-null rest mass unless dy ds = 0 or perhaps particle Z may be not a fundamental particle just like the neutron and this can lead to new discoveries
u 4 = dx 4 ds = −Φ dy ds − A µ dx µ(440)
Remember that we do not consider electromagnetic vector potentials in this case to simplify out study to have a non-null rest-mass m 0 and a null eletric charge e from a ds = 0 or a dy = 0 otherwise we could get a u 4 = 0 without having a ds = 0.Then in our simplified case the derivatives dy ds =0 and the rest-mass would be given by m 0 = M 5 Ω(y) and according to 19 to 22 in [11] this would explain the neutral charge.But considering or not electromagnetic vector potentials the particle Z under Ponce De Leon Formalism can give us the proof that we really live in a 5D spacetime because this implies in a non-null 5D rest-mass M 5 to produce a non-null 4D rest-mass m 0 .( [11] eq 17)
m 2 0 − Ω Φ 2 q = M 2 5 q = 0 m 2 0 = M 2 5(441)
Note that if the 5D Extra Dimension do not exists at all then M 5 would always be zero or perhaps a algebraic combination of values of m 2 0 − Ω Φ 2 q = 0 as in the case of the 4D photon with m 0 = 0 and q = 0 makes Ponce De Leon relation valid even without 5D or perhaps for a m 0 different than zero and a charge q different than zero but with a combination of factors Ω Φ 2 q that equals m 0 making Ponce De Leon equation null M 5 = 0.Note that for particle Z M 5 cannot be null or otherwise particle Z could not exist to be observed.</p>
<p>Particle Z can only exists if the 5D spacetime exists. Perhaps the Eotvos coefficient and the experiments of Witteborn-Fairbank carried on-board ISS using matter and antimatter or the particle Z can help us to find out if we live in a Extra Dimensional spacetime.See also [18] for experiments on-board ISS in Outer Space using antimatter. We can clearly see that we can have for example two particles moving in 5D spacetime with the same rest mass M 5 but if these particles moves with different Warp Factors/Fields or geodesic parameters these two particles would be seen in our 4D spacetime with different rest masses m 0 111 and when we try to "unify" different interactions and particles from our 4D perspective and we fail this is because we cannot unify what is already Unified in a Higher Dimensional Spacetime.This is perhaps the reason why among many theories like P-Branes,D-Branes,Strings,SuperSymmetry(SUSY),SuperGravity(SUGRA),Eletroweak Interaction,Theory Of Everything(TOE) and many others we still dont have a clear and definite framework of a Unified version of the Physics as depicted in fig 1 pg 617 in [6].Also we dont have the explanation why the particles possesses these values for the rest-mass m 0 seen in 4D and not different others.The Projection in 4D of 5D Warp Factors and Warp Fields can explain the apparent differences between all the known particles and in 5D all these particles can really be the same particle.Masses,Charges,Spins 112 and every other property of the elementary particles can be derived from the reduction from 5D to 4D as proposed by Ponce De Leon-Basini-Capozziello.The beauty of the Ponce De Leon equations can also illustrate the fact that "apparent" different electric charges in 4D can really be the same charge in 5D as shown in the equations below:(see eqs 19 to 22 in [11] adapted to our notation). </p>
<p>The sign of the charge for this case would be assigned in the following cases by the factor dy ds and the sign of Φ positive or negative and note that a negative sign Warp Field do not affect the spacelike nature of the Extra Dimension since Φ 2 will always be positive and g 44 = −Φ 2 . Note also that a negative sign Warp Field do not affect the geometrical nature of the effective mass.([1] eq 83 and [5] eq 77) 115</p>
<p>• timelike 5D Geodesics dy ds &lt; 1 Φ • spacelike 5D Geodesics dy ds &gt; 1 Φ A remarkable case is the Particle Z that might be useful to test if we really lives in a Higher-Dimensional Spacetime.As an Elementary Particle that possesses a non-null rest-mass in 4D but zero charge,Particle Z can exists only if the 5D spacetime exists.</p>
<p>Considering the following equations([11] eq 17 and pg 1371 between eqs 23 and 24.Written using Warp Factors to keep compatibility with [2] ):
m 2 0 − Ω Φ 2 q = M 2 5(449)m 2 0 − Ω Φ 2 q = 0 M 5 = 0 q = 0 m 0 = 0(450)
We can clearly see that a particle that have a non-zero 4D rest-mass but a zero 4D charge must exists only if the 5D rest-mass exists for spacetime ansatsz defined by dS 2 = Ω(y)g uv dx u dx v − Φ 2 dy 2 or 112 see pg 132 in [1] between eq 84 and 85 and pg 2236 in [5] between eq 92 and 93 113 Also we consider for this case the electromagnetic vector four-potential Aµ = 0.A future work will appear with vector potentials 114 equations of [11] written without Warp Factors.These will also appear in a future work 115 we are considering here massive particles in 5D.Massless ones will appear in a future work</p>

remarkable feature of the Basini-Capozziello approach is the fact that the Scalar Field in 4D (the 3 + 1 spacetime component of the Warp Field Φ or the 3 + 1 component in the Klein-Gordon equation ) can be written in function of the Extra Dimension y and the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinates. 62</p>

<p>pg 1685 in [7]) Although Maartens-Clarkson uses the Randall-Sundrum(RS) scenario their conclusions can be applied also to a 5D Black String in the Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon formalism or in the STM(Space-Time-Matter) Induced theory as we will shall see by now: According to Maartens-Clarkson and under the RS model the Bulk Metric satisfies the following Einstein Equation:(see pg 1682 in [7]) 86 G ab = 6 gab l 2 (378) Where l is the curvature scale possessing the values l ≤ 0, 1 mm or l ≤ 10 −4 m.(see pg 1683 in [7]) The equation presented by Maartens-Clarkson for the 5D Black String is remarkably similar to the one presented by Kar-Sinha and is given by: 87 (see eq 1 pg 1682 in [7])</p>

<p>-Sinha like Ponce De Leon advocates the important point of view that the Extra Dimension can affect our 3 + 1 spacetime making the 5D detectable.Both mentions the fact that Warp Factors can be responsible for certain phenomena observable in our 4D physics.(pg 1775 and 1776 in [3])Kar-Sinha also mentions careful experiments needed to test the real existence of the Extra Dimensions and Bending Of Light is one suitable for this task.(pg 1776 in [3]) 
Before going to compute the Bending Of Light we will examine carefully the Conformal Structure 
employed.

<p>quotes String theory where gravitons propagates in the Bulk as Closed Loops while other interactions as Open Strings are confined to the Brane.This poses a problem for the Unification of Physics(TOE-Theory Of Everything Theories) because we cannot unify Closed and Open Strings.We cannot Unify an Interaction that can propagates in the Bulk with Interactions confined to the Brane.In STM all matter can propagates in the Bulk and what we see in 4D is a geometrical projection coming from 5D.But what is important is the fact that people are planning Extra Dimensions research for ISS 97 for charge-to-mass ratio and Extra Dimensions see eqs 19 to 22 in[11] 
originally created by Paul Wesson and developed by Bahram Mashhoon,Paul Wesson,Hongya Liu,J. Ponce De Leon,Sanjeev S.Seahra,A. P. Billyard and W. N. Sajko-The General Relativity 5D group at University of Waterloo Ontario Canada 2 the term Warp Factor refers to the conformal factor in the spacetime metric as depicted in [2] eq 14 and term Warp Field refers to the Scalar Field in the same metric.Also this term appears in pg 1776 1780 and 1784 in [3])
The Warp Field is not only function of the Extra Dimension(see eqs 76 and 86 in[1]) but the effective mass is obtained by integration of the Warp Field with respect to the Extra Coordinate.See eq 83 in[1] 
Working with diagonalized metrics the terms α,λ,µ,β and ν are all equal
extracted from the Formulary Of Physics by J.C.A. Wevers available on Internet 111 electric charges are also function of the 5D geometry of Warp Factors/Fields see eqs 19 to 22 in[11] also from Ponce De Leon.A coupling between this work and Basini-Capozziello formalism will be developed further.
According to Maartens-Clarkson the "Shadow" Brane must be located far away from our Brane otherwise its gravitational influence would be stronger than the effects experimentally observed. However a faraway Brane will have a smaller Warp Factor affecting the 5D geometry.(see pg 1683 in[7])The "Shadow" Brane still with Maartens-Clarkson also provides an infrared-cut-off to shut down the so-called Gregory-Laflamme long wavelenght instability of the Black String.(see pg 1682 in[7]).The Gregory-Laflamme equilibrium condition for a large Black String of 4D rest-mass M intercepting the distant "Shadow" Brane at y = d is given by:(see eq 2 pg 1682 in[7])For small Black Strings of course this equilibrium condition is not applicable because Gm &lt; 0.1 × le d l since the Horizon cannot reach the distant "Shadow" Brane y = d. Maartens-Clarkson says these small Black Strings are unstable.(see pgs 1682 and 1683 in[7]) However since the small Black String can reach the near "Shadow" Brane p then these small Black Strings would have also a "Shadow" Brane for cut-off providing of course the existence of the "Shadow" Brane p.However Maartens-Clarkson are correct about the instability of the small Black String if the near "Shadow" Branes do not exist to provide the cutoff.Note however that a "Shadow" Brane near to our own would have more noticeable effects making easy the task of Extra Dimensions detection .This is another divergence between our point of view and original Maartens-Clarkson for small Black Strings.The Gregory-Laflamme equilibrium condition for a small Black String of 4D rest-mass m intercepting the near "Shadow" Brane at y = p is given by: Gm ≥ e 10 4 ×p 10 5 (386) l ( dy dsNote that the Equilibrium Condition is function of the geodesic paths dy ds . Note also that Maartens-Clarkson says that the frequency of this massive mode graviton is independent of the Black String 4D rest-mass M .(see pg 1683 in[7]).We will demonstrate that these frequencies and massive rest-mass modes for the extra gravitons can be written in function of the mass M due to the Gregory-Laflamme Equilibrium Conditions.Starting with the stable Black String with a "Shadow" Brane at a distance d from our own and a Horizon equal to the Equilibrium Conditions:The factor e d l appears in the frequency and rest-mass for the massive graviton as follows:Note that a large 4D rest-mass M will imply in lower frequencies.See the frequencies for LIGO/LISA of 100 Hz and 0, 01 Hz for rest-masses of 100 and 10 6 Solar Masses in the top of pg 1684 in[7].The rest-mass of the graviton is given by:
Look again to the table of Elementary Particles and think about the multitude of particles with different 4D masses m 0 and different electric charges e being all these "apparent" different particles in 4D Feynman Diagrams the same particles in 5D but under different geometrical conditions:Again as we stated before.Everything is Geometry. In this work we examined the Ponce De Leon 5D Extra Force formalism coupled to 5D to 4D Reduction proposed by Basini-Capozziello and we used the Kar-Sinha Conformal Coordinates to demonstrate that mathematically we can simplify expressions and suppress extra terms that otherwise would become algebraic complicated.We also recomputed the Kar-Sinha Bending of Light,examined the Superluminal features of the Chung-Freese BraneWorld and applied Basini-Capozziello-Ponce De Leon formalism to the 5D Maartens-Clarkson Schzwarzchild Black String.We explored the fact that International Space Station can be used to test the existence of the Extra Dimensions in the Gravitational Shift or Bending Of Light and we pointed the fact that Particle Z can exists only if the 5D spacetime is physically real. If this reduction from 5D to 4D as described by. dS 2 = Ω(y)ds 2 − Φ 2 dy 2 and we cannot have zero rest-mass particles with non-zero charges. Another example of the Beauty of Ponce De Leon formulas coupled to the Basini-Capozziello 5D to 4D reduction are the so-called Feynman Diagrams.
