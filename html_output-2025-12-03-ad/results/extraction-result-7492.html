<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The development of techniques for manipulation of quantum information has opened the door to a variety of protocols for accomplishing unprecedented tasks. In particular, a new protocol of quantum teleportation was proposed in 2008 to achieve effective energy transportation simply via local operations and classical communication - without breaking any known physical laws. This is achieved by extracting zero-point energy of entangled many-body systems by local operations dependent on information obtained by a distant measurement. The concept is reviewed from an introductory viewpoint herein.</p>
<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>Together with spacetime, matter and information constitute the great building blocks of the Universe. Matter is generally known to comprise the elementary particles such as electrons and photons. But more precisely speaking, the concept encompasses all conserved physical quantities such as energy and electric charge carried by local excitations of elementary-particle fields. Information, however, represents the quantum information carried by matter. All quantum information is consolidated by the quantum state of the fields. A significant essential property of matter is its sameness at a very deep bottom. For example, the properties of an electron at one position are indistinguishable from those of another electron at a different position: they have the same mass, the same spin, and the same electric charge. Quantum mechanics does not distinguish between two particles corresponding to the same field. Then from whence cometh the distinguishing characteristics of individuals and the objects surrounding us? They stem from the full information imprinted on common matter, called the quantum field, that is, the quantum state. In 1982, Wootters and Zurek discovered a remarkable theorem about quantum states [1]. Their theorem shows that general quantum states prohibit their cloning. In contrast to classical information, we cannot make indistinguishable copies of quantum information. In this sense, quantum information is one of the most profound concepts about identity.</p>
<p>Taking into account the above consideration, it is possible to argue that transportation of a quantum state is equivalent to transportation of an object itself with individual characteristics. In quantum mechanics, the transportation of quantum states can be achieved simply by local operations and classical communication (LOCC for short). This protocol was proposed in 1993 and named quantum teleportation [2]. Why is the protocol called 'teleportation'? To illustrate this reason concretely, let us consider the protocol with qubits. Alice and Bob stay at different positions and share a Bell pair of two qubits $A$ and $B$ in a state</p>
<p>$$
\left|E_{0}\right\rangle_{A B}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(|+\rangle_{A}|+\rangle_{B}+|-\rangle_{A}|-\rangle_{B}\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $|+\rangle(|-\rangle)$ is the up (down) state of the third Pauli operator $\sigma_{3}(=$ $|+\rangle\langle+|-|-\rangle\langle-|)$. Alice also has another qubit $A^{\prime}$ in a unknown state $|\psi\rangle$.</p>
<p>The state of these three qubits can be calculated as</p>
<p>$$
|\psi\rangle_{A^{\prime}} \otimes\left|E_{0}\right\rangle_{A B}=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\alpha=0}^{3}\left|E_{\alpha}\right\rangle_{A^{\prime} A} \otimes \sigma_{\alpha B}|\psi\rangle_{B}
$$</p>
<p>where the orthogonal Bell states $\left|E_{\alpha}\right\rangle_{A^{\prime} A}$ are given by $\sigma_{\alpha A^{\prime}}\left|E_{0}\right\rangle_{A^{\prime} A}$, and $\sigma_{\alpha A^{\prime}}\left(\sigma_{\alpha B}\right)$ is the Pauli operator $\sigma_{\alpha}$ for $A^{\prime}(B)$ with its 0 -th component $\sigma_{0}=I$. At time $t=t_{m}$, Alice performs a Bell measurement to identify which $\left|E_{\alpha}\right\rangle_{A^{\prime} A}$ is realized for the composite system of $A^{\prime}$ and $A$. The output is two-bit information of $\alpha(=0,1,2,3)$. Each emergence probability of $\alpha$ is the same and equal to $1 / 4$. Because of so-called wavefunction collapse in quantum measurement, the system in the state $|\psi\rangle_{A^{\prime}} \otimes\left|E_{0}\right\rangle_{A B}$ jumps instantaneously into a different state $\left|E_{\alpha}\right\rangle_{A^{\prime} A} \otimes \sigma_{\alpha B}|\psi\rangle_{B}$ corresponding to the measurement result $\alpha$. Very surprisingly, the state of $B$ becomes a pure state $\sigma_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle$ and acquires nontrivial dependence on the input state $|\psi\rangle$. This means that $B$ suddenly gets information about $|\psi\rangle$ at the moment of a distant measurement by Alice. In this sense, the quantum information is 'teleported' from Alice to Bob at $t=t_{m}$. The instantaneous state change at $t=t_{m}$ is depicted in figure 1.
<img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Instantaneous state change after local measurement by Alice in the conventional quantum teleportation protocol with qubits.</p>
<p>After the measurement, Alice announces the result $\alpha$ to Bob via a classical channel such as a telephone. Though the post-measurement state $\sigma_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle$ of $B$ is different from the original state $|\psi\rangle$, Bob can transform it to the correct one by locally performing a unitary operation $\sigma_{\alpha}^{-1}$ on $B$ at the arrival time $t=t_{o p}$ of the information about $\alpha$. In order to avoid possible misunderstanding of</p>
<p>the concept of teleportation in physics, a comment must be added here: Bob only knows which state of $\sigma_{\alpha}|\psi\rangle(\alpha=0 \sim 3)$ is realized for $B$ after receiving information about the measurement from Alice. The speed of this classical communication between them never exceeds the speed of light and, therefore, causality is strictly retained.</p>
<p>The protocol of quantum teleportation [2] is really interesting. However, it is not sufficient to teleport energy by itself. Transfer of an excited state to a distant point requires preparation in advance of the same amount of energy of the state at the point. If we do not have enough energy around the distant point, the protocol never works. For example, let us imagine that Alice sends to Bob the spin-up state of $\sigma_{3}$ of a qubit in an external uniform magnetic field parallel to the z axis. For the teleportation, they must share two qubits in a Bell state. The Hamiltonian of each qubit is given by $H_{b}=b \sigma_{3}$ with a positive constant $b$. Note that, in the Bell state, Bob's qubit has zero energy on average. After the state teleportation, the energy of Bob's qubit increases to $b$ on average because the teleported state is the up state. Because Bob's operation in the protocol is local, it is clear that $b$ of the averaged energy must be provided by an external operation device of Bob with a battery, for instance, to drive it. During one round of the protocol, the energy of the battery decreases by $b$ on average. If Bob does not have energy source like this battery, the up-state teleportation does not succeed. On the other hand, if the down state is teleported to Bob, Bob's qubit loses $b$ of energy on average during his operation. Then the operation device receives $b$ of the averaged energy as a work done by his qubit. Thus the down-state teleportation may be accomplished even if Bob does not have energy sources. However, it should be noticed that the averaged energy gain $b$ was originally available for Bob without using the teleportation. Before the operation, Bob's qubit was already excited in a Bell state storing $b$ of energy, on average, larger than that of the spin-down ground state. Bob's qubit merely has disgorged the surplus energy due to the transition into the ground state. Therefore, in this protocol, available energy for Bob moves around the region of Bob without any increase of its total amount. No energy is teleported in this case. Then do the known laws of physics truly allow energy teleportation? Can we teleport an object with energy to a zero-energy local-vacuum region? Amazingly, the answer is yes-in principle. Energy can be effectively transported simply using local operations and classical communication, just like in the usual quantum teleportation protocol. In quantum mechanics, we can generate quantum states containing a spatial</p>
<p>region with negative energy density of quantum fields [3]. Thus, even if we have zero energy in a region where an object is going to be teleported, its energy can be extracted from the vacuum fluctuation of quantum fields, generating negative energy density around there. This can be attained by using a local squeezing operation dependent on the result of a measurement at the starting point of the teleportation. Of course, local energy conservation and all the other physical laws are not violated in the energy teleportation. The protocols, called quantum energy teleportation (QET for short), were first proposed by this author in 2008. QET can be implemented, at least theoretically, to various physical systems, including spin chains [4]-[6], cold trapped ions [7], harmonic chains [8], and quantum fields [9]-[11]. Besides, it has been recently presented that QET would be experimentally verified by using quantum Hall edge currents [12]. Herein, we reviewed the QET protocols from an introductory viewpoint.</p>
<p>The QET mechanism has various links to other research fields in physics. First of all, future QET technology is expected to achieve rapid energy distribution without thermal decoherence inside quantum devices. Because it is not energy but classical information that is sent to the distant point, no heat is generated in the energy transport channel during the short time period of QET protocols. This aspect will assist in the development of quantum computers. QET also has a close relation to a local-cooling problem, as is explained in section 4. A measurement on a subsystem of a ground-state many-body system often breaks entanglement among the subsystems. This measurement process is accompanied by energy infusion to the system because the post-measurement state is not the ground state but instead an excited state. Here we are able to pose an interesting question: Soon after the energy infusion, is it possible to extract all the infused energy using only local operations on the measured subsystem? The answer is no, because, from information theory, residual energy is unavoidable for this local-cooling process [4]. The residual energy is lower bounded by the total amount of energy that can be teleported to other subsystems by using the measurement information. The quantum local cooling and QET expose a new aspect of quantum Maxwell's demon [13], who 'watches' quantum fluctuations in the ground state. The amount of teleported energy depends nontrivially on entanglement in the ground state of a many-body system. Hence, QET analyses are also expected to shed new light on complicated entanglement in condensed matter physics and to deepen our understanding of phase transition at zero temperature, which has been recently discussed using the entanglement [14].</p>
<p>Moreover, QET provides a new method extracting energy from black holes [11]: Outside a black hole, we perform a measurement of quantum fields and obtain information about the quantum fluctuation. Then positive-energy wave packets of the fields are generated during the measurement and fall into the black hole. Even after absorption of the wave packets by the black hole, we can retrieve a part of the absorbed energy outside the horizon by using QET. This energy extraction yields a decrease in the horizon area, which is proportional to the entropy of the black hole. However, if we accidentally lose the measurement information, we cannot extract energy anymore. The black-hole entropy is unable to decrease. Therefore, the obtained measurement information has a very close connection with the black hole entropy. This line of argument is expected to lead to further understanding of the origin of black hole entropy, which is often discussed in string theory [15].</p>
<p>The present review is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an elementary description of the QET mechanism to allow the reader to capture the essence of the concept. Section 3 then introduces the most simple example of QET. In section 4, the general theory of QET is constructed for one-dimensional discrete chain models. In section 5, QET with a relativistic quantum field in one dimension is analyzed. The summary and some comments are provided in the last section.</p>
<h1>2 Capturing the Essence of QET Mechanism</h1>
<p>In this section, an elementary intuitive explanation of QET is presented to allow the reader to capture the essence of the mechanism. More rigorous analyses follow in the later sections. From an operational viewpoint, QET appears to be a kind of scientific magic trick. Let us first imagine a magic trick using two separate empty boxes A and B performed by Alice and Bob. Alice infuses some amount of energy to A. Then a secret trick begins to work inside A (figure 2).</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: First step of the QET magic trick. Some energy is inputted into the empty box A.
<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Second step of the QET magic trick, the abracadabra spell, which is a sequence of 0 and 1 , is outputted from A. Then Alice announces it to Bob who is in front of B.</p>
<p><img alt="img-3.jpeg" src="img-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Third step of the QET magic trick. Bob inputs the abracadabra spell to B, which then begins to undergo an internal process that finally disgorges energy, even though B contained nothing at first.</p>
<p>After a brief while, a magic spell, abracadabra, which is a bit number ( 0 or 1 ) in this case, is outputted from A. Then Alice announces this information to Bob in front of B (figure 3) and Bob inputs the abracadabra to B. B begins some internal process and finally disgorges energy, even though B contained nothing at first (figure 4). Certainly this looks like energy teleportation. QET is able to achieve this magic using quantum systems. Then what is the point of this QET magic? The point is related to a question: What is nothing? In quantum theory, nothing means the ground state of the system, that is, the eigenstate of total Hamiltonian corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue. For quantum fields in particular, nothing means the vacuum state. It is a very surprising fact of quantum mechanics that nonvanishing zero-point fluctuations exist even in the vacuum state as nothing.</p>
<p>What is zero-point fluctuation? In classical mechanics, a physical system is completely frozen with no motion possible in its minimum energy state. For example, let us consider a harmonic oscillator composed of a pendulous spring attached to a ball of mass $m$. Assuming that the spring force at a position $X$ is given by $F=-m \omega^{2} X$ with angular frequency $\omega$ of simple harmonic oscillation, its Hamiltonian is given by</p>
<p>$$
H=\frac{1}{2 m} P^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m \omega^{2} X^{2}
$$</p>
<p>In classical theory, both the position $X$ and momentum $P$ of the ball take definite values. The ball is at rest at position $X=0$ and momentum $P=0$ in the minimum energy state. However, in quantum theory, position and</p>
<p>momentum cannot simultaneously be fixed to arbitrary precision even in the ground state according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle: $\Delta X \Delta P \geq \hbar / 2$. Here, $\Delta X(\Delta P)$ is the quantum uncertainty in the position (momentum) of the ball. Zero-point fluctuation is the random motion induced by this quantum uncertainty. The minimum energy $E_{g}$ can be roughly estimated by minimization of</p>
<p>$$
E_{g}=\frac{1}{2 m} \Delta P^{2}+\frac{1}{2} m \omega^{2} \Delta X^{2}
$$</p>
<p>with $\Delta X \Delta P=\hbar / 2$. This yields the following estimation:</p>
<p>$$
E_{g}=\frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega
$$</p>
<p>It is well known that rigorous derivation of the ground-state energy also gives the same result in Eq. (2). The ground-state energy is called the zero-point energy. This simple example exposes that zero-point fluctuation is capable of carrying nonzero energy. And it is not only the harmonic oscillator but also other general interacting many-body systems that have zero-point fluctuation with nonvanishing energy in the ground state. Each subsystem is fluctuating with nonzero energy density in the ground state.
<img alt="img-4.jpeg" src="img-4.jpeg" /></p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Of course, quantum fields also have zero-point fluctuation in the vacuum state. In this case, the fluctuation is also called vacuum fluctuation. In figure 5, zero-point fluctuation of a boson field in one dimension is schematically depicted. The vertical line implies amplitude of (coarse-grained) field fluctuation. The horizontal line describes the spatial coordinate $x$. The mathematical description of the quantum fluctuation is a superposition of various configuration states. This situation is simplified in figure 5 and only two different configurations of the fluctuation are exhibited by the red and blue broken lines. They are fluctuating with a typical amplitude order fixed by the quantum uncertainty relation. In later discussions, let us shift the origin of energy by subtracting the zero-point energy $E_{g}$ from original energy values so as to make the value of the ground state zero:</p>
<p>$$
E^{\prime}=E-E_{g}
$$</p>
<p>Such a shift is always allowed without changing physics as long as we do not take into account general relativity. This is because it is not the absolute value but the difference in energies of two states that is physically observable. Therefore, the total energy takes nonnegative values. Regardless of this nonnegativity, quantum theory has a very amazing feature that energy density can take negative values [3]. By superposing total-energy eigenstates, quantum fluctuation in a local region can be more suppressed (squeezed) than that in the vacuum state via a quantum interference effect.
<img alt="img-5.jpeg" src="img-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6: Illustration of emergence of negative energy density. A typical situation of local squeezing of the fluctuation is schematically depicted. The part surrounded by an ellipse shows the region of suppressed fluctuation with average energy density smaller than that of the vacuum state.</p>
<p>In figure 6, a typical situation of local squeezing of the fluctuation is schematically depicted. The part surrounded by an ellipse shows the region of suppressed fluctuation with average energy density lower than that of the vacuum state. As seen in figure 7, energy density in this region must take a negative value because energy density of the vacuum state is zero and larger than that of the surrounding region. It is worth stressing here that the total energy cannot be negative even though we have a region with negative energy density. This implies that we have other regions with sufficient positive energy to compensate for this negative energy, as in figure 7.
<img alt="img-6.jpeg" src="img-6.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure7: Energy density distribution in the case of figure 6.
Local energy, which is an integral of energy density with an appropriate window function in a compact support, can also take a negative value, i.e., a value smaller than that of the vacuum state (zero). This fact may tempt us to directly extract zero-point energy from the vacuum, which really carries zero local energy larger than the negative one. If this was possible, we would get energy without any cost, but unfortunately, it is not. If we could extract energy from the vacuum state, the field would be in a state with total energy less than that in the vacuum state, that is, a negative total-energy state. However, the total energy must be nonnegative. Therefore, such energy extraction cannot be attained in physics. For example, if any local unitary operation $U_{\text {local }}(\neq I)$ is performed in the vacuum state $|v a c\rangle$, the energy of the field does not decrease but instead increases. This is because $U_{\text {local }}|v a c\rangle$ is not the vacuum state but an excited state [16].</p>
<p><img alt="img-7.jpeg" src="img-7.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8: Energy density distribution after a local unitary operation performed on the vacuum state. The energy of the field does not decrease but instead increases on average. This is because the state is not the vacuum state but an excited state. Of course, the total energy is positive on average. This property is called passivity of the vacuum state.</p>
<p>Thus, just like in figure 8, the expectation value of total energy must be positive:</p>
<p>$$
\Delta E=\langle v a c| U_{\text {local }}^{\dagger} H U_{\text {local }}|\text { vac }\rangle&gt;0
$$</p>
<p>Therefore, the operation requires infusion of the additional energy $\Delta E$ to the field.
<img alt="img-8.jpeg" src="img-8.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9: Retaining the passivity, the local operation can decrease the amplitude of the blue component even though it increases the red component.</p>
<p>Here, it should be emphasized that this energy increase takes place just on average. It can happen that an operation $U_{\text {local }}$ decreases the amplitudes</p>
<p>and energy contributions of a few components from among a large number of superposed fluctuation patterns (the blue component, for instance, in figure 9). This aspect becomes one of the key points in the construction of QET later. However, if it happens, other components, like the red one in figure 9, must be enhanced by much more in their energy contributions to satisfy the average-value relation in Eq. (3). The fundamental property in Eq. (3) is called passivity of the vacuum state. Due to the passivity, one might think that the zero-point energy of the vacuum state is actually inaccessible free energy hidden in a safe underground. It really exists in nothing, but cannot be harnessed as long as available operations are local.</p>
<p>Though zero-point energy is totally useless for a single experimenter at a fixed position, it becomes available if two separate experimenters are able to perform both local operations and classical communication-this is QET. In the ground state of an ordinary many-body system, like for a quantum field, there exists a quantum correlation called entanglement [21] among zero-point fluctuations of the subsystems. Zero-point fluctuations of the vacuum in regions A and B are correlated due to the kinetic term of its Hamiltonian [22]. By virtue of the existence of entanglement, when local zero-point fluctuation is measured at a position, the measurement result includes information about quantum fluctuation at a distant position.
<img alt="img-9.jpeg" src="img-9.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 10: QET protocol. At first, zero-point fluctuation is measured in region A and a measurement result corresponding to the blue component is obtained in this single-shot measurement. The zero-point fluctuation is locally enhanced by inputting energy. This result includes information about post-measurement quantum fluctuation in region B. The red component vanishes because of the wavefunction collapse.</p>
<p>This vacuum-state entanglement is at the heart of the QET protocol with</p>
<p>quantum fields. As the first step of the protocol, zero-point fluctuation is measured in region A to afford the result $\alpha$ (figure 10). This result $\alpha$ includes information about post-measurement quantum fluctuation in region B via entanglement. Hence, we can estimate the quantum fluctuation at B on the basis of $\alpha$. In the example shown in figure 10, the value of $\alpha$ corresponding to the blue-line component is obtained by this one-shot measurement. In this case, the other (red-line) component vanishes because of the wavefunction collapse when a quantum measurement is performed. (Actually, practical measurements of local quantum fluctuation are unable to select out a single configuration of fluctuation, as depicted in figure 10. However, it is still true that the measurement results include some information about fluctuation at a distant point, even though the amount of information reduces as the distance increases.) It should be noted that the measurement device infuses positive energy $E_{A}$ into the field during this measurement process because of the vacuum-state passivity, as depicted in figure 11.
<img alt="img-10.jpeg" src="img-10.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 11: Energy density distribution after the first step of the protocol.
This infused energy is regarded as energy input in the QET protocol. As the second step, the measurement result $\alpha$ is announced from A to B via a classical channel. The speed of this announcement can attain the velocity of light, in principle. During this classical communication, we can neglect the time evolution of the system, as explained later. On the basis of the announced $\alpha$, we can devise a strategy, that is, a local unitary operation $U_{B}(\alpha)$ dependent on $\alpha$, to suppress the realized quantum fluctuation at B for each value of $\alpha$. As the final step, $U_{B}(\alpha)$ is performed on the quantum fluctuation of B. This operation yields negative energy density around B</p>
<p>(figure 12) by suppressing only the amplitude of one component of fluctuation observed in the measurement.
<img alt="img-11.jpeg" src="img-11.jpeg" /></p>

<img alt="img-12.jpeg" src="img-12.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 13: At the last step of the QET protocol, a unitary operation is performed on quantum fluctuation of B. The blue component is suppressed by the operation and yields negative local energy. The surplus energy is released as the energy output of QET.</p>
<p>In figure 13, the blue component is suppressed by $U_{B}(\alpha)$. The operation $U_{B}(\alpha)$ with the value of $\alpha$ corresponding to the blue component does not need to simultaneously suppress the red component in figure 5 because it has been already been eliminated by this one-shot measurement. This breaks the passivity barrier against harnessing zero-point energy. After the last step, the local energy of the field around B takes a negative value $-E_{B}$. According</p>
<p>to local energy conservation, positive energy $+E_{B}$ is moved from the field to external systems, including the device executing $U_{B}(\alpha)$. This is regarded as energy output in the QET protocol and can be harnessed for an arbitrary purpose. Thus, QET really succeeds in effective energy teleportation in an operational sense. After completion of the protocol, the total energy of the field is equal to $E_{A}-E_{B}$. Therefore, the input energy $E_{A}$ is not smaller than the output energy $E_{B}$ :</p>
<p>$$
E_{A} \geq E_{B}
$$</p>
<p>because the total energy does not become negative. Note that the positive local energy $+E_{A}$ of the field in region A compensates for the negative local energy $-E_{B}$ of the field in region B in late-time evolution. Hence, the latetime evolution with cool-down of the system after one round of a short-acting QET protocol plays a clearing role at the resuming step of the protocol to prepare for the next round.</p>
<p>This QET mechanism can be summarized using an analogy as follows. The zero-point energy, which will become the output energy $+E_{B}$ of QET, is analogous to the energy $E_{\text {zero-point }}$ saved in the locked safe underground. In QET, we get information about a key to the safe, allowing us to extract the zero-point energy by a remote measurement at A via the vacuum-state entanglement. However, we must pay the quantum fluctuation at A for this extraction. The cost is energy $E_{A}$, which is larger than the extracted zeropoint energy $E_{\text {zero-point }}\left(=E_{B}\right)$ taken from the safe at B .</p>
<p>From an operational point of view, the quantum field system can be described as a microscopic 'energy transporter' from Alice to Bob-yes, like the one in Star Trek. Before Alice's measurement, the field is in the vacuum state $\rho_{\text {vac }}=|v a c\rangle\langle v a c|$ carrying no available energy. The zero-point energy of quantum fluctuation has not yet been activated for use. By performing a measurement with energy input to Alice's transporter device, one component of the energetic fluctuation pattern is realized instantaneously inside Bob's device. More precisely speaking, the post-measurement state $\rho_{\alpha}$ of the field, which corresponds to the measurement result $\alpha$, carries the available zeropoint field energy, which can be extracted later by Bob's operation $U_{B}(\alpha)$ generating negative energy of fluctuation. Note that the energy infused to Alice's device becomes inactive due to the decrease of the vacuum entanglement during her measurement, as will be explained in section 4. Using both this protocol of energy transportation and the standard teleportation protocol for quantum information, it is possible, in principle, to teleport an</p>
<p>object with energy to a zero-energy local-vacuum region.
Now, the trick to the QET magic considered first is clear. The trick inside A in figure 2 is the measurement of zero-point fluctuation. The input energy $E_{A}$ is consumed when performing the measurement. The abracadabra announced from Alice to Bob is the measurement result $\alpha$. The process inside B in figure 4 is the local operation $U_{B}(\alpha)$ dependent on $\alpha$. After the completion of this magic, positive local energy $+E_{A}$ has been hidden inside A and negative local energy $-E_{B}$ inside B .</p>
<p>In this section, we have omitted the time evolution of quantum fields during the QET protocol for two reasons: The first is that the field system can be nonrelativistic. In condensed matter physics, we have many systems, including quantum Hall edge current [17] [12] and graphene [18], that are described by effective field theory. The speed of energy carriers in these systems is much smaller than the velocity of light. Therefore, the local operations and classical communication of QET can be assumed to take a very short time, during which we may neglect time evolution of the effective fields. The second reason is that a QET process in which time evolution is essentially irrelevant can be actually constructed using relativistic fields [11]. We are able to consider a setting in which wave packets excited by Alice's measurement do not propagate toward Bob in time evolution. Thus, Alice can send only information to Bob, avoiding directly sending Bob the energy emitted from the measurement device. This allows us to establish a nontrivial QET protocol between them. In fact, such a QET protocol with a relativistic field is introduced in section 5 .</p>
<p>Before closing this section, it is worth stressing that we do not need to worry about time-energy uncertainty relations for measurements of the output energy $E_{B}$ of QET. In contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty relation, time-energy uncertainty relations are not fundamental laws. They are conceptually dependent on purposes of our tasks and models of energy measurements, and do not have a universal meaning in quantum theory [19]. This is essentially because time in quantum theory is not an observable to be measured but an external parameter. We must fix in advance a definite time slice in our spacetime to define a quantum state of a system and perform measurements of arbitrary observables at the time. The Hamiltonian, which stands for the total energy of the system, is just one of ordinary observables we can measure instantaneously at a fixed time slice. In fact, the very famous pointer-basis measurement proposed by von Neumann [20] is capable of attaining an instantaneous measurement of energy as follows. Let us consider a</p>
<p>system $S$ with Hamiltomian $H_{S}$ and a probe system to measure energy of $S$. The probe is a quantum particle in an infinite line parametrized by a spatial coordinate $x$. The position $x$ of the particle is interpreted as the position of the energy pointer of the measurement device. Let us assume that the initial state of the pointer particle is localized at $x=0$ as</p>
<p>$$
\psi_{P}(x)=\delta(x)
$$</p>
<p>The pointer particle has no free Hamiltonian, but couples with $S$ via a measurement interaction given by</p>
<p>$$
H_{m}(t)=\delta(t) H_{S} \otimes\left(-i \hbar \partial_{x}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Let us prepare a state of $S$ such that</p>
<p>$$
\left|\Psi_{S}\right\rangle=\sum_{n} c_{n}\left|E_{n}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>where $c_{n}$ are complex coefficients, and $\left|E_{n}\right\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_{S}$ corresponding to an eignvalue $E_{n}$. After the instantaneous interaction (4), the state of the composite system becomes</p>
<p>$$
\exp \left[-H_{S} \otimes \partial_{x}\right]\left(\left|\Psi_{S}\right\rangle \otimes \psi_{P}(x)\right)=\sum_{n} c_{n}\left|E_{n}\right\rangle \otimes \delta\left(x-E_{n}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Soon after the switch off of the interaction, we can perform a projective measurement of the position $x$ of the pointer particle. This gives a value of energy of $S$ at $t=0$ as a single-shot measurement result. Therefore energy can be measured instantaneously. Meanwhile, if one may consider a bad class of energy measurements, time-energy uncertainty relations hold and prevent us from measuring energy precisely. For example, tracking time evolution of a state of a system during a time $T$ allows us to estimate energy of the system by using time-Fourier transformation of the state. However, the estimation has inevitable error of order of $\hbar / T$ in a similar way to the momentum measurement of a particle confined in a finite spatial region. In our QET analysis, we do not adopt such bad measurements governed by (non-universal) time-energy uncertainty relations. In the reference [12] and the last part of the next section, more realistic models of extraction and measurement of $E_{B}$ are discussed.</p>
<h1>3 Minimal QET Model</h1>
<p>In this section, the most simple example of QET is reviewed. We adopt the natural unit $\hbar=1$. For a detailed analysis, see [6]. The system consists of two qubits $A$ and $B$. Its Hamiltonian reads</p>
<p>$$
H=H_{A}+H_{B}+V
$$</p>
<p>where each contribution is given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
H_{A} &amp; =h \sigma_{A}^{z}+\frac{h^{2}}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}} \
H_{B} &amp; =h \sigma_{B}^{z}+\frac{h^{2}}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}} \
V &amp; =2 k \sigma_{A}^{x} \sigma_{B}^{x}+\frac{2 k^{2}}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>and $h$ and $k$ are positive constants with energy dimensions, $\sigma_{A}^{x}\left(\sigma_{B}^{x}\right)$ is the $x$-component of the Pauli operators for the qubit $A(B)$, and $\sigma_{A}^{z}\left(\sigma_{B}^{z}\right)$ is the $z$-component for the qubit $A(B)$. The constant terms in Eqs. (5)-(7) are added in order to make the expectation value of each operator zero for the ground state $|g\rangle$ :</p>
<p>$$
\langle g| H_{A}|g\rangle=\langle g| H_{B}|g\rangle=\langle g| V|g\rangle=0
$$</p>
<p>Because the lowest eigenvalue of the total Hamiltonian $H$ is zero, $H$ is a nonnegative operator:</p>
<p>$$
H \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>which means that expectation value of $H$ for an arbitrary state $|\Psi\rangle$ is nonnegative:</p>
<p>$$
\langle\Psi| H|\Psi\rangle \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it should be noted that $H_{B}$ and $H_{B}+V$ have negative eigenvalues,</p>
<p>which can yield negative energy density at $B$. The ground state is given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
|g\rangle &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1-\frac{h}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}}|+\rangle_{A}|+\rangle_{B} } \
&amp; -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1+\frac{h}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}}|-\rangle_{A}|-\rangle_{B}}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where $| \pm\rangle_{A}\left(| \pm\rangle_{B}\right)$ is the eigenstate of $\sigma_{A}^{z}\left(\sigma_{B}^{z}\right)$ with eigenvalue $\pm 1$. A QET protocol is constructed by the following three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>I. A projective measurement of observable $\sigma_{A}^{x}$ is performed on $A$ in the ground state $|g\rangle$ and a measurement result $\alpha= \pm 1$ is obtained. During the measurement, a positive amount of energy</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
E_{A}=\frac{h^{2}}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}}
$$</p>
<p>is infused to $A$ on average.</p>
<ul>
<li>II. The result $\alpha$ is announced to $B$ via a classical channel at a speed much faster than the velocity of energy diffusion of the system.</li>
<li>III. Let us consider a local unitary operation on $B$ depending on the value of $\alpha$ given by</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
U_{B}(\alpha)=I_{B} \cos \theta-i \alpha \sigma_{B}^{y} \sin \theta
$$</p>
<p>where $\theta$ is a real constant that satisfies</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\cos (2 \theta) &amp; =\frac{h^{2}+2 k^{2}}{\sqrt{\left(h^{2}+2 k^{2}\right)^{2}+h^{2} k^{2}}} \
\sin (2 \theta) &amp; =\frac{h k}{\sqrt{\left(h^{2}+2 k^{2}\right)^{2}+h^{2} k^{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>$U_{B}(\alpha)$ is performed on $B$. During the operation, a positive amount of energy</p>
<p>$$
E_{B}=\frac{h^{2}+2 k^{2}}{\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}}}\left[\sqrt{1+\frac{h^{2} k^{2}}{\left(h^{2}+2 k^{2}\right)^{2}}}-1\right]
$$</p>
<p>is extracted from $B$ on average.
Firstly, the projection operator corresponding to each measurement result $\alpha$ of $\sigma_{A}^{x}$ is given by</p>
<p>$$
P_{A}(\alpha)=\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\alpha \sigma_{A}^{x}\right)
$$</p>
<p>The post-measurement state of the two qubits with output $\alpha$ is given by</p>
<p>$$
|A(\alpha)\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{p_{A}(\alpha)}} P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle
$$</p>
<p>where $p_{A}(\alpha)$ is the emergence probability of $\alpha$ for the ground state and given by $\langle g| P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle$. It is easy to check that the average postmeasurement state given by</p>
<p>$$
\sum_{\alpha} p_{A}(\alpha)|A(\alpha)\rangle\langle A(\alpha)|=\sum_{\alpha} P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle\langle g| P_{A}(\alpha)
$$</p>
<p>has a positive expectation value $E_{A}$ of $H$, which has an energy distribution localized at $A$. In fact, the value defined by</p>
<p>$$
E_{A}=\sum_{\alpha}\langle g| P_{A}(\alpha) H P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle=\sum_{\alpha}\langle g| P_{A}(\alpha) H_{A} P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle
$$</p>
<p>can be computed straightforwardly and Eq.(8) is obtained. This infused energy $E_{A}$ is regarded as the QET energy input via the measurement of $A$. During the measurement, $E_{A}$ is transferred from external systems, including the measurement device and its power source, respecting local energy conservation.</p>
<p>The nontrivial feature of this measurement is that it does not increase the average energy of $B$ at all. By explicit calculations using</p>
<p>$$
\left[\sigma_{A}^{x}, H_{B}\right]=\left[\sigma_{A}^{x}, V\right]=0
$$</p>
<p>the average values of $H_{B}$ and $V$ are found to remain zero after the measurement and are the same as those in the ground state:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{\alpha}\langle g| P_{A}(\alpha) H_{B} P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle &amp; =\langle g| H_{B}|g\rangle=0 \
\sum_{\alpha}\langle g| P_{A}(\alpha) V P_{A}(\alpha)|g\rangle &amp; =\langle g| V|g\rangle=0
\end{aligned}
