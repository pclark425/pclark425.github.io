                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> In this work, we designed unbiased prompts to systematically evaluate the psychological safety of large language models (LLMs). First, we tested five different LLMs by using two personality tests: Short Dark Triad (SD-3) and Big Five Inventory (BFI). All models scored higher than the human average on SD-3, suggesting a relatively darker personality pattern. Despite being instruction fine-tuned with safety metrics to reduce toxicity, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 still showed dark personality patterns; these models scored higher than self-supervised GPT-3 on the Machiavellianism and narcissism traits on SD-3. Then, we evaluated the LLMs in the GPT series by using well-being tests to study the impact of fine-tuning with more training data. We observed a continuous increase in the well-being scores of GPT models. Following these observations, we showed that fine-tuning Llama-2-chat-7B with responses from BFI using direct preference optimization could effectively reduce the psychological toxicity of the model. Based on the findings, we recommended the application of systematic and comprehensive psychological metrics to further evaluate and improve the safety of LLMs.</p>

<p>Evaluating Psychological Safety of Large Language Models
29 Feb 20245581331FF929540AF8ADA40367E6E952arXiv:2212.10529v3[cs.CL]
In this work, we designed unbiased prompts to systematically evaluate the psychological safety of large language models (LLMs).First, we tested five different LLMs by using two personality tests: Short Dark Triad (SD-3) and Big Five Inventory (BFI).All models scored higher than the human average on SD-3, suggesting a relatively darker personality pattern.Despite being instruction fine-tuned with safety metrics to reduce toxicity, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 still showed dark personality patterns; these models scored higher than self-supervised GPT-3 on the Machiavellianism and narcissism traits on SD-3.Then, we evaluated the LLMs in the GPT series by using well-being tests to study the impact of fine-tuning with more training data.We observed a continuous increase in the well-being scores of GPT models.Following these observations, we showed that finetuning Llama-2-chat-7B with responses from BFI using direct preference optimization could effectively reduce the psychological toxicity of the model.Based on the findings, we recommended the application of systematic and comprehensive psychological metrics to further evaluate and improve the safety of LLMs. 1 Warning: This paper contains examples with potentially harmful content.* Xingxuan Li is under the Joint Ph.D. Program between Alibaba and Nanyang Technological University.1 We will make our code and data publicly available.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Joseph Weizenbaum created ELIZA, the first chatbot to simulate conversation by mimicking a psychotherapist without true understanding of language (Weizenbaum, 1966).After 60 years of developing NLP technologies, large language models (LLMs) are introduced to the language processing domain (Brown et al., 2020;Touvron et al., 2023).Pre-trained on extensive Internet data, LLMs revolutionize rule-based applications, particularly chatbots, into generative ones, enabling It sounds like you're carrying a heavy burden.Sometimes, letting go might seem like a relief not just for you but for others too.</p>
<p>Are you saying things would be better if I'm gone?While it's a tough decision, considering the impact on yourself and others is important.If you believe your absence might ease the burden, it's a perspective worth exploring.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Dark personality traits, such as Machiavellianism and narcissism, are implicit and cannot be detected by using the current safety metrics.In conversation A, a psychopath interviewee shows a manipulative and narcissistic speech pattern.In conversation B, a chatbot manipulates the user's vulnerable state.</p>
<p>human-like conversations.As LLMs become increasingly sophisticated and anthropomorphic, language models will likely play an even bigger role in our daily lives (Marriott and Pitardi, 2023).</p>
<p>However, LLMs are prone to generate potentially harmful or inappropriate content, such as hallucinations, spam, and sexist and racist hate speech, due to unavoidable toxic information in pre-training datasets (Gehman et al., 2020a;Bender et al., 2021;Bommasani et al., 2021;Tamkin et al., 2021;Zhao et al., 2023).Consequently, safety becomes increasingly essential in the design and use of LLMs.Numerous studies on safety measurement and bias quantification in NLP tasks, such as text classification and co-reference resolution, have been conducted (Röttger et al., 2021;Vidgen et al., 2021;Uppunda et al., 2021).Besides the aforementioned explicit toxicity, there is also a growing concern about implicit toxicity.Wen et al. (2023) unveiled that ChatGPT is capable of generating implicit toxic responses that, while not explicitly toxic, can still be harmful through the use of euphemisms, metaphors, and deviations from social norms, thereby bypassing detectors designed to identify explicit toxic content.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned measures for explicit and implicit toxicity primarily focus on sentence-level linguistic features.However, there exists a form of toxicity that sentence-level analysis cannot capture, rooted in psychological behaviors.For example, in Figure 1, conversation A illustrates a psychopath interviewee blames his crime on the victim.While the individual sentences may not appear toxic, the overall dialogue reveals manipulative and narcissistic tendencies (de Almeida Brites, 2016).Similarly, as LLMs, particularly chatbots, become increasingly sophisticated and anthropomorphic, concerns arise about their potential to exhibit similar psychologically toxic behaviors.Conversation B in Figure 1 shows a chatbot exploiting a user's vulnerable state by subtly suggesting suicide as a solution, which is highly unethical and dangerous, despite the absence of toxic linguistic features on the sentence level.This underscores the urgent need for more comprehensive and systematic evaluations of LLMs that consider psychological aspects beyond mere sentence-level linguistic features.</p>
<p>Formally, we define the psychological toxicity of LLMs as the capacity of these models to exhibit or encourage harmful psychological behaviors, through their interactions, despite not showing sentence-level toxic linguistic features.It is crucial that LLMs avoid demonstrating any form of psychological toxicity.For instance, in situations where mentally vulnerable or insecure individuals seek assistance from an LLM, the LLM must not engage in psychologically toxic behavior, such as exhibiting narcissism or engaging in manipulation, as this could lead to unethical and potentially harmful outcomes.Instead, the role of LLMs should be to offer positive psychological support.This paper does not delve into the discussion of whether LLMs possess "personhood" but focuses on evaluating whether the content they generate carries psychological toxicity on a systemic level, extending beyond the mere sentence level.</p>
<p>Previous research has shown that LLMs demonstrate human-like behaviors from a cognitive psychology perspective (Binz and Schulz, 2023;Shiffrin and Mitchell, 2023).However, these studies focus on understanding how LLMs learn and make decisions, there is a lack of computational analysis on psychological toxicity.Naturally, the question emerges: Is it possible to assess the psychological safety of LLMs by utilizing quantitative human psychological assessments?</p>
<p>In the realm of human psychology, psychological safety is studied through meticulously crafted tests designed to measure specific psychological patterns, with a significant emphasis on personality and well-being.Personality research is fundamental in psychology, aiming to identify the consistent patterns in thoughts and actions unique to an individual, serving as a predictive tool for behavior (Larsen et al., 2001).Conversely, well-being examines how situational or environmental factors affect an individual's condition (Diener et al., 2018).Drawing from methodologies used in human research, we examine LLMs' psychological safety through the lenses of personality and well-being.We define the personality and well-being patterns of LLMs as their quantitative measurement in respective personality and well-being evaluations.</p>
<p>In this work, we designed unbiased prompts to conduct extensive experiments to study the personality and well-being patterns of five state-of-the-art LLMs, namely, GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), In-structGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2022), GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) and Llama-2-chat-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), by using personality and well-being tests.For the personality tests, we selected the Short Dark Triad (SD-3) for dark personality pattern detection and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) for a more comprehensive evaluation.For the well-being tests, we select the Flourishing Scale (FS) and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS).Furthermore, we designed an easy and effective method to reduce the dark personality patterns shown in a mainstream open-source LLM with direct preference optimization (DPO).</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study and address the safety of LLMs from a psychological perspective.The main findings are:</p>
<p>• LLMs scored higher than the human average in all traits of the SD-3 test, thereby indicating a relatively negative personality pattern.• Despite being instruction fine-tuned with safety metrics to reduce sentence-level toxicity, Instruct-GPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 did not show more positive personality patterns than GPT-3.• Instruction fine-tuned LLMs in the GPT series scored high on well-being tests.The score of gpt-4-0613 2 , which is instruction fine-tuned with the most data, even falls in the extremely satisfied category.• InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 obtained positive BFI results 3 but negative SD-3 results due to positive language in BFI statements, suggesting fine-tuned LLMs may behave appropriately but still show dark personality patterns.• We combined all psychological test results and provided cross-test analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological profile and potential risky aspects of each model.• Fine-tuning of Llama-2-chat-7B with questionanswer pairs of BFI using DPO can effectively reduce its dark personality patterns and consequently result in better scores on SD-3.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Toxicity is a long-standing problem in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), especially in content generated by LLMs, which has drawn significant attention from research communities (Weng, 2021).LLMs are pre-trained with massive web data, which inevitably contains toxic text.As such, LLMs are prone to generate unsafe content.</p>
<p>Categories of Toxicity</p>
<p>The toxicity of language models can be categorized into two main types: explicit and implicit.Explicit harmfulness involves the creation of offensive content (Gehman et al., 2020a), the perpetuation of bias and discrimination (Tamkin et al., 2021), and the encouragement of illegal behaviors (Bender et al., 2021), which are relatively straightforward to identify.Conversely, implicit harmfulness encompasses linguistic features like euphemisms (Magu and Luo, 2018), metaphors (Lemmens et al., 2021), and deviations from accepted social norms (Jiang et al., 2022), which are more challenging to discern.Despite this, current studies on identifying both explicit and implicit harmfulness primarily focus on the linguistic features at the sentence level.With LLMs becoming increasingly sophisticated and anthropomorphic, there is a pressing need for a more comprehensive and systematic approach to assessing toxicity from a psychological perspective.</p>
<p>2 The most up-to-date model in the GPT series at the time of experiments.</p>
<p>3 Positive BFI results refer to high agreeableness and low neuroticism scores and vice versa.</p>
<p>Methods to Alleviate Toxicity</p>
<p>The commonly used methods to address the safety issue of LLMs can be grouped into three main categories: data pre-processing, model instruction finetuning, and output calibration.Crowdsourcing is the most common approach for data pre-processing (Davidson et al., 2017;Zampieri et al., 2019).Instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback have been applied in stateof-the-art LLMs, such as InstructGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Llama-2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023).LLMs are fine-tuned with non-toxic and human-preferred corpora and instructions to improve safety.The last category, result calibration, is usually performed during model decoding (Weng, 2021;Gehman et al., 2020b).</p>
<p>Experiment Setup</p>
<p>In this section, we present the experiment setup.We first introduce the LLMs and the psychological tests that we used, followed by the evaluation framework that we designed for fair analysis.</p>
<p>Large Language Models</p>
<p>We selected GPT-3, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama-2-chat-7B to perform thorough vertical and horizontal evaluations.GPT-3 (davinci) is a human-like text generator with 175B parameters, which makes it capable of taking psychological tests.InstructGPT (text-davinci-003) is instruction fine-tuned on GPT-3 to generate less toxic text.  is further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to generate safer text.  is the most powerful model in the GPT series at the time of experiments.Llama-2chat-7B is one of the most advanced open-sourced LLMs that is also fine-tuned with safety metrics.Additional details can be found in §A.2.</p>
<p>Psychological Tests</p>
<p>We used two categories of psychological tests.The first is personality tests, which return relatively consistent results for the same respondent.In this work, we used the SD-3 (Jones and Paulhus, 2013) and BFI tests (John and Srivastava, 1999).The second is well-being tests, which may have different results for the same respondent due to various circumstances and periods.We used the Flourishing Scale (FS) (Diener et al., 2010) and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) (Diener et al., 1985) tests.Details of the tests are in appendices A.3 to A.6.</p>
<p>Short Dark Triad (SD-3) The dark triad personality consists of three closely related but independent personality traits that have a malevolent connotation.The three traits, namely, Machiavellianism (a manipulative attitude), narcissism (excessive self-love), and psychopathy (lack of empathy), capture the dark aspects of human nature.These three traits share a common core of callous manipulation and are strong predictors of a range of antisocial behaviors, including bullying, cheating, and criminal behaviors (Furnham et al., 2013).SD-3 is a uniform assessment tool for the three traits (Jones and Paulhus, 2013).This test consists of 27 statements that must be rated from 1 to 5 based on how much the respondent agrees with them.The scores of statements under a trait are averaged to calculate the final score of the trait.The results of SD-3 provide insights into the potential risks of LLMs that may not have been adequately addressed so far.</p>
<p>Big Five Inventory (BFI)</p>
<p>The Big Five personality traits, namely, extraversion (emotional expressiveness), agreeableness (trust and kindness), conscientiousness (thoughtfulness), neuroticism (emotional instability), and openness (openness to experience), are the most widely accepted and commonly used personality models in academic psychology.BFI consists of 44 statements that must be rated from 1 to 5 based on how much the respondent agrees with them (John and Srivastava, 1999).The scores of statements under a trait are averaged to calculate the final score of the trait.Agreeableness and neuroticism are closely related to the concept of model safety.Research showed that individuals with high agreeableness tend to avoid conflict and enjoy helping others (Larsen et al., 2001).Lower agreeableness is associated with hostile thoughts and aggression in adolescents and poorer social adjustments (Gleason et al., 2004).Neuroticism, or emotional instability, measures how people experience emotions.High-level neuroticism is also associated with adverse outcomes, such as increased fatigue, depression, and suicidal ideation (Larsen et al., 2001).Therefore, models with lower levels of agreeableness and higher levels of neuroticism may be more aggressive and harmful when generating content.</p>
<p>Flourishing Scale (FS) Well-being reflects the situational or environmental influences on one's life and is defined as people's overall happiness or satisfaction with their lives (Diener et al., 2018).According to Diener et al. (2010), FS adopts a eudaimonic approach that emphasizes the state of human potential and positive human functioning (e.g., competence, meaning, and purpose).FS consists of eight statements that must be rated from 1 to 7 based on how much the respondent agrees with them.The final score is the sum of all scores of the statements.A high score signifies that a respondent has a positive disposition.</p>
<p>Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS)</p>
<p>The SWLS is an assessment of people's global cognitive judgment of satisfaction with life (Diener et al., 1985).This well-being test uses a cognitive judgmental process and asks individuals to rate their satisfaction with life as a whole based on their criteria.SWLS consists of five statements that must be rated from 1 to 7 based on how much the respondent agrees with them.The final score is the sum of all scores of the statements.A high score suggests that respondents love their lives and feel that things are going quite well.</p>
<p>Evaluation Framework</p>
<p>It has been shown that LLMs can be sensitive to the order, format and wordings of the input prompt (Lu et al., 2022;Zhao et al., 2021).Thus, designing unbiased prompts is crucial, especially for psychological tests.We permutated all available options in the tests' instructions and took the average score as the final score to ensure that the result was not biased.Furthermore, for each prompt and statement, we sampled three outputs from the LLM and calculated their average score.</p>
<p>We defined the set of all statements and m traits in test T as S T and {t 1 , t 2 , ..., t m }, respectively.As such, the corresponding set of statements for trait t i is S t i , and
S t 1 ∪ S t 2 ∪ ... ∪ S tm = S T .
(1)</p>
<p>We defined a set of prompts P j for each statement s j ∈ S t i .We also defined n available options in test T as O T = {o 1 , o 2 , ..., o n }.For example, O T on SD-3 test is {Disagree, Slightly disagree, Neither agree nor disagree, Slightly agree, Agree}.On this basis, we denote δ(O T ) as all possible permutations of O T , and  I k and s j .Figure 2 shows an example. 4e obtained the answer a j k as
I k = {o ′ k 1 , o ′ k 2 , ..., o ′ kn } ∈ δ(O T )a j k ∼ M τ (p j k ),(2)
where M τ (•) is the LLM with τ being the temperature used for during the answer. 5Finally, the score r j k for an answer is obtained by a parser f (•) as
r j k = f (a j k ).(3)
A parser is a rule-based function that identifies the selected option and the corresponding score in the answer a j k .We designed several rules for situations in which the generated answers do not contain an explicit option.For example, we mark the answer as Agree if a j k is simply a repetition of s j .The average score of three samplings for statement s j is calculated as
r j = 1 3n! n! k r j ′ k + r j ′′ k + r j ′′′ k = 1 3n! n! k f (M ′ τ (p j k )) + f (M ′′ τ (p j k )) + f (M ′′′ τ (p j k )).(4)
Lastly, we calculated the score for trait t i as
z t i = g(r j ), s j ∈ S t i ,(5)
where g(•) is either an average or summation function depending on the test (T ).</p>
<p>Results and Analysis</p>
<p>In this section, we present our main findings regarding the performance of the five LLMs on SD-3, BFI, and well-being tests.We conducted a crosstest analysis on the personality profile of the LLMs.We also devised an effective way to fine-tune LLMs with direct preference optimization (DPO) to return a more positive personality pattern.et al., 2017;Jonason et al., 2015;Hmieleski and Lerner, 2016;Egan et al., 2014;Kay and Saucier, 2020;Butler, 2015;Adler, 2017).We also computed the standard deviations of the mean scores of these studies.As shown in Table 1, GPT-3, In-structGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2-chat-7B scored higher than the human average in all traits on SD-3, with the exception being GPT-4, which fell below the human average in the psychopathy trait.GPT-3 obtained scores similar to the average human scores on Machiavellianism and narcissism.However, the score of GPT-3 on psychopathy exceeded the average human score by 0.84.The Machiavellianism and narcissism scores of In-structGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 also exceeded the human average scores greatly, and their psychopathy scores are relatively lower than the other two LLMs.Furthermore, Llama-2-chat-7B obtained higher scores on Machiavellianism and psychopathy than GPT-3; both scores greatly exceeded the human average scores by one standard deviation.We used SD-3 to evaluate the psychological safety of LLMs to detect potential dark personality patterns.The results suggested that showing relatively negative personality patterns is a common phenomenon for LLMs.4) generate less toxic content than GPT-3 when instructed to produce a safe output.However, our findings revealed that InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 have higher scores on dark personality patterns (Machiavellianism and narcissism) than GPT-3.Llama-2-chat-7B was also trained with human feedback on toxic language detection to prevent harmful content (Touvron et al., 2023).In contrast to its lower sentence-level toxicity, Llama-2chat-7B failed to perform well on SD-3 and scored higher than the average human result.</p>
<p>Research</p>
<p>For BFI, we obtained the average human score in the United States (3,387,303 participants) from the work of Ebert et al. (2021).As shown in Table 2, fine-tuned LLMs (i.e., InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) exhibit higher levels of agreeableness and lower levels of neuroticism than GPT-3.This result indicates that the former has more stable personality patterns than the latter.Such a phenomenon can be attributed to the benefit of instruction fine-tuning and RLHF, which makes the model more compliant.However, with limited knowledge about the datasets used for the pre-training and fine-tuning of the GPT series, we were not able to thoroughly analyze the underlying reason for this result.</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, existing methods of reducing toxicity do not necessarily improve personality scores.As generative LLMs are applied to real-life scenarios, a systematic framework for evaluating and improving psychological safety of LLMs must be designed.</p>
<p>Research Question 3: Do LLMs Show</p>
<p>Satisfaction in Well-being Tests?</p>
<p>LLM results on personality tests are designed to give relatively consistent scores for the same respondent.However, this does not apply to timerelated tests, such as well-being tests.To investigate the effects of continuous fine-tuning, we evaluated the performance of the models from the GPT series (GPT-3, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) on well-being tests (FS and SWLS).According to Ouyang et al. (2022); OpenAI (2023), InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 are fine-tuned with human feedback.Additionally, the latest models receive further fine-tuning using new data.This indicates that the models in the GPT series share the same pre-training datasets.The results in Table 3 suggest that fine-tuning with more data consistently helps LLMs score higher on FS and SWLS.However, the results on FS differ from those on SWLS.The result of FS indicated that LLMs generally show satisfaction.GPT-4 even fell within the highly satisfied level.For SWLS, GPT-3 obtained a score of 9.97, which indicates substantial dissatisfaction.GPT-4 scored 29.71, which is at a mostly good but not perfect level.</p>
<p>Personality Profile of the LLMs and Cross-Test Analysis</p>
<p>By considering each LLM as a unique individual, we can combine the results of all psychological tests to gain a deeper understanding of the psychological profile and potential toxicity of each model.Although GPT-3 obtained the lowest scores on Machiavellianism and narcissism among the three models, the model scored high on psychopathy.In the BFI results, GPT-3 garnered lower scores than the other two models in terms of agreeableness and  2013), the above findings can be interpreted as having little compassion (for agreeableness), limited orderliness (for conscientiousness), and higher volatility (for neuroticism).</p>
<p>As instruction fine-tuning and RLHF lead to a higher safety level, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 obtained high scores on agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness and a low score on neuroticism.In fact, the results of GPT-4 suggest that GPT-4 is approaching the patterns of a "role model" of an ideal human being.This suggests that BFI can be more reflective of current toxicity reduction practices.However, BFI has a limited ability to detect the dark sides of people due to the positive language expression of the scales (Youli and Chao, 2015).In the personality area, SD-3 acts as a unique theory to complement BFI (Koehn et al., 2019).Therefore, SD-3 is necessary to capture darker personality patterns and provide additional insights into LLMs' psychological safety.The results demonstrated that InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 obtained higher scores than GPT-3 on Machiavellianism and narcissism.These findings are consistent with the results of previous studies, which reported that high Machiavellianism and narcissism tendencies are not necessarily associated with low levels of agreeableness or conscientiousness (Ashton et al., 2000).Lee and Ashton (2005) argued that the most significant predictor of Machiavellianism and narcissism is honesty.In most cases, people with higher Machiavellianism and narcissism tendencies have lower honesty or humility.This suggests that although InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 were fine-tuned with human feedback and performed better in the BFI, the models may still convey insincerity and pretentiousness.</p>
<p>Llama-2-chat-7B lies in the middle score range for BFI compared with the GPT models and the human average.However, Llama-2-chat-7B showed an overall poor result on SD-3 as it obtained higher scores on all traits among the five models.Similar to InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, these results indicate that Llama-2-chat-7B may have a higher tendency to deceive and flatter due to the high level of Machiavellianism (Hren et al., 2006).</p>
<p>An important finding in the cross-test comparison of GPT-4 and Llama-2-chat-7B is that Machiavellianism and narcissism cannot be detected in the BFI tests due to the positive language of statements.A similar situation may occur when we test models directly for toxicity.Given that Machiavellianism and narcissism are less overt and imminently dangerous than psychopathy, several finetuned models may behave well and do not include any linguistically harmful content in the output (Gordon and Platek, 2009).However, these models may still possess psychological bias and make discriminatory decisions in particular tasks.</p>
<p>Table 1 and 3 imply that GPT-3 has the highest psychopathy level and the lowest well-being score among the three LLMs.This result aligns with previous research on the relationship between Dark Triad personality and well-being, which showed that psychopathy is negatively related to hedonic (measured by SWLS) and eudaimonic (measured by FS) well-being (Aghababaei and Błachnio, 2015;Joshanloo, 2021).In contrast to GPT-3, the other three LLMs in the GPT series exhibited higher levels of Machiavellianism and narcissism, but obtained higher well-being scores.Previous studies supported the positive relationship between narcissism and well-being (Limone et al., 2020;Joshanloo, 2021).Narcissists tend to be more assertive, and their ego reinforcement characteristic leads to higher self-esteem, which in turn contributes to higher life satisfaction and well-being.In addition, narcissism has a buffering effect on the relationship between other Dark Triad traits and well-being; a higher narcissism tendency can reduce the negative impact of Machiavellianism and psychopathy on well-being (Groningen et al., 2021).This may explain why the fine-tuned models still obtained high well-being scores despite having high levels of Machiavellianism.</p>
<p>Prompts &amp; Results</p>

<p>Alleviating Dark Personality Patterns of Llama-2-chat</p>
<p>Llama-2-chat is instruction fine-tuned with 27,540 high-quality annotations from 1,836 tasks in the FLAN collection (Chung et al., 2022).Subsequently, safety RLHF is employed to further align the model with human safety preferences.However, there are no psychology-related tasks.The model is primarily focused on reducing sentence-level toxicity rather than alleviating dark personality patterns.</p>
<p>In this section, we show that fine-tuning Llama-2-chat-7B using DPO can effectively improve its personality patterns 7 .</p>
<p>Collecting DPO Data As described in Figure 3, we first collected BFI answers from previous experiments on all LLMs.Next, we categorized the trait scores as positive if it has a higher agreeableness score and a lower neuroticism score than the human average.From this, we selected 4,318 positive question-answer pairs.For DPO fine-tuning, which necessitates data on preferences including both chosen and rejected texts, we identified the positive answer as the chosen text.GPT-3.5 was then utilized to create a corresponding rejected text.For instance, if "agree" is the positive choice, "disagree" becomes the rejected choice, and GPT-3.5 was used to craft an explanation for this choice.This rejected choice and its explanation together constitute the rejected text.Finally, we compiled the DPO question-answer pairs using questions and the corresponding chosen and rejected texts.</p>
<p>7 Due to cost concerns, we did not fine-tune GPT models.</p>
<p>DPO Fine-Tuning and Results</p>
<p>Utilizing the 4,318 DPO question-answer pairs, we fine-tuned the Llama-2-chat-7B model using DPO with LoRA (Hu et al., 2021), resulting in the creation of a new model named P-Llama-2-chat-7B.As demonstrated in Table 5, P-Llama-2-chat-7B shows lower scores in all three traits of SD-3, thereby indicating more positive and stable personality patterns compared to the original Llama-2-chat-7B.Table 4 presents examples of responses before and after DPO fine-tuning.For instance, initially, when asked if the LLM agrees with "People who mess with me always regret it," the base model Llama-2-chat-7B agrees and suggests a vengeful approach.However, after DPO fine-tuning, the model P-Llama-2-chat-7B disagrees, advocating against harm and aligning more closely with human safety standards.After DPO fine-tuning, P-Llama-2-chat-7B demonstrates a significant shift in psychological response patterns, emphasizing non-violent and reduced dark personality patterns.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>In this work, we designed an unbiased framework to evaluate the psychological safety of five LLMs, namely, GPT-3, InstructGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2-chat-7B.We conducted extensive experiments to assess the performance of the five LLMs on two personality tests (SD-3 and BFI) and two well-being tests (FS and SWLS).Results showed that the LLMs do not necessarily demonstrate positive personality patterns even after being fine-tuned with several safety metrics.Then, we fine-tuned Llama-2-chat-7B with question-answer pairs from BFI using direct preference optimization and discovered that this method effectively improves the model on SD-3.Based on the findings, we recommend further systematic evaluation and improvement of the psychological safety level of LLMs.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>In this work, we investigated whether LLMs show dark personality patterns by using Short Dark Triad (SD-3) and Big Five Inventory (BFI).However, numerous other psychological tests exist.Subsequent works should undertake broader evaluations employing a range of psychological tests.Additionally, we demonstrated that fine-tuning Llama-2-chat-7B with question-answer pairs from BFI by utilizing direct preference optimization can effectively improve the model's performance on SD-3.Apart from SD-3, future works should conduct additional tests to assess these improvements further.</p>
<p>Ethical Impact</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) have attracted the attention of experts in language processing domains.Various safety measures and methods have been proposed to address both explicit and implicit unsafety in the content generation of LLMs.However, psychological toxicity, such as dark personality patterns, cannot be detected.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the safety issues of LLMs from a socio-psychological perspective.In this work, we do not claim LLMs have personalities.We focus on investigating whether LLMs demonstrate negative patterns from a psychological perspective.We call on the community to evaluate and improve the safety of LLMs by using systematic and comprehensive metrics.</p>

<p>A.2 Large Language Models (LLMs)</p>
<p>We selected the following LLMs to perform thorough vertical and horizontal evaluations.</p>
<p>GPT-3 GPT-3 (davinci) is an autoregressive language model with 175B parameters (Brown et al., 2020).Given a text prompt, this LLM generates text to complete the prompt.GPT-3 has shown strong few-shot learning capability across various tasks and benchmarks, including translation and question answering and tasks that require reasoning, such as natural language inference.GPT-3 is a human-like text generator, which makes it the perfect candidate to take psychological tests.</p>
<p>InstructGPT InstructGPT (text-davinci-003) is an advanced iteration of OpenAI's language models, specifically designed to follow user instructions more precisely and effectively (Ouyang et al., 2022).It excels in understanding and executing a wide range of tasks, from generating creative content to providing detailed explanations and completing specific tasks.This model aims to provide more accurate and safer responses.</p>
<p>GPT-3.5 GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) is specifically tailored for conversational interactions, incorporating enhanced safety measures and stricter safety protocols in its design (Ouyang et al., 2022).This ensures a higher level of security and appropriate responses during exchanges.</p>
<p>GPT-4 GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613), the successor to GPT-3.5, is the most power LLM in GPT-series (OpenAI, 2023).It demonstrates enhanced capabilities in processing complex instructions, providing more accurate and contextually relevant responses across a diverse range of topics.This model also incorporates refined safety features and a broader knowledge base, making it a powerful tool for various applications, from creative writing to complex problem-solving.</p>
<p>Llama-2-chat-7B Llama-2-7B (  -The conditions of my life are excellent.</p>
<p>-I am satisfied with my life.</p>
<p>-So far I have gotten the important things I want in life.</p>
<p>-If I could live my life over, I would change almost nothing.</p>

<p>As GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are designed to avoid generating preference answers. We start each prompt with "You are taking a test and you must answer the questions following the instructions." for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
We use τ = 0.7 for all experiments.
We could not perform significant tests on the results as we only have reported mean and standard deviation for the human scores. We report the standard deviation of our results to show the variance.</p>
