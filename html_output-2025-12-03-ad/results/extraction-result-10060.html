                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Plasma P-tau181 in Alzheimer’s disease: relationship to other biomarkers, differential diagnosis, neuropathology and longitudinal progression to Alzheimer’s dementia</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Plasma phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) might be increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but its usefulness for differential diagnosis and prognosis is unclear. We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages. It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87–0.91 for different brain regions). Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94–0.98), and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort. High plasma P-tau181 was associated with subsequent development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired and MCI subjects. In conclusion, plasma P-tau181 is a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD, which may be useful in clinical practice and trials. Plasma P-tau18 level increased with progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and differentiated AD dementia from other neurodegenerative diseases, supporting its further development as a blood-based biomarker for AD.</p>

<p>Plasma P-tau181 in Alzheimer's disease: relationship to other biomarkers, differential diagnosis, neuropathology and longitudinal progression to Alzheimer's dementia

Plasma phosphorylated tau181 (P-tau181) might be increased in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its usefulness for differential diagnosis and prognosis is unclear. We studied plasma P-tau181 in three cohorts, with a total of 589 individuals, including cognitively unimpaired participants and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 was increased in preclinical AD and further increased at the MCI and dementia stages. It correlated with CSF P-tau181 and predicted positive Tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87-0.91 for different brain regions). Plasma P-tau181 differentiated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with an accuracy similar to that of Tau PET and CSF P-tau181 (AUC = 0.94-0.98), and detected AD neuropathology in an autopsy-confirmed cohort. High plasma P-tau181 was associated with subsequent development of AD dementia in cognitively unimpaired and MCI subjects. In conclusion, plasma P-tau181 is a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD, which may be useful in clinical practice and trials. NATURE MEDiCiNE | VOL 26 | MARCH 2020 | 379-386 | www.nature.com/naturemedicine 379ArticlesNature MediciNePET or CSF biomarkers, either to distinguish AD from other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases in cases with mild to moderate dementia or to predict future development of AD in cases with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).ResultsThe two prospective cohorts had similar study designs, but cohort 1 (n = 182) also included Tau PET imaging and cohort 2 (n = 344) also included longitudinal follow-up to track conversion to AD dementia over a period of up to 8 yr. Cohort 1 included 64 cognitively unimpaired participants (60% Aβ + ), 28 Aβ + MCI, 38 Aβ + AD dementia and 52 patients with non-AD neurodegenerative diseases(Table 1). Cohort 2 included 219 cognitively unimpaired participants (42% Aβ + ) and 125 patients with MCI (65% Aβ + ) (Table 1). The neuropathology cohort (cohort 3) included 16 autopsy-confirmed AD dementia and 47 autopsy-confirmed non-AD individuals (SupplementaryTable 1).Plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 are correlated. If changes in plasma P-tau181 stem from changes in the central nervous system, plasma P-tau181 should correlate with CSF P-tau181 (ref. 10 ). We found clear associations between plasma and CSF levels of P-tau181 in cohort 1 (β-coefficient (β) = 0.73, P &lt; 0.001, n = 172) and cohort 2 (β = 0.52, P &lt; 0.001, n = 343). The association was significant in Aβ + , including in the presymptomatic stage (Aβ + cognitively unimpaired), but not in Aβindividuals (Fig. 1aand Extended DataFig. 1cfor cohort 1, Extended DataFig. 1a,d for cohort 2).These correlations suggest that, to some extent, plasma P-tau181 reflects changes in hyperphosphorylated tau in the central nervous system that occur in Aβ + individuals.</p>
<p>A ccumulation of misfolded β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in extracellular plaques and phosphorylated tau protein as paired helical filaments (PHFs) in intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are defining neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The diagnostic workup of AD has been revolutionized by the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers 1 . Core CSF biomarkers include Aβ42, total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated tau (P-tau). Reduced Aβ42 and increased P-tau are believed to reflect Aβ and tau pathologies in AD, while increased T-tau is a more nonspecific marker of neuronal injury 2 . PET imaging can directly visualize Aβ and tau aggregates in the brain. However, both CSF measurements and PET imaging have notable hurdles. They are invasive, timeconsuming and expensive, and they may have side effects and have limited availability, especially in primary care. There is therefore a great need for less invasive, cost-effective and easily accessible biomarkers, preferably blood tests.</p>
<p>Assays have been developed for detection of blood tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181) [3][4][5] , which is higher in people with AD dementia compared to cognitively unimpaired individuals and correlates with Aβ PET and tau PET uptake [3][4][5] . These results are promising regarding plasma P-tau181 as an AD biomarker, but several issues remain unclear. It is not known whether plasma P-tau181 can (1) differentiate AD from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, (2) predict future progression to AD dementia in nondemented people, (3) identify individuals with pathological Tau PET uptake or (4) detect AD neuropathology. Furthermore, it is unclear how plasma P-tau181 correlates with CSF P-tau181 and how the diagnostic performance compares to that of other plasma biomarkers in AD (for example, T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and neurofilament light (NfL)) [6][7][8][9] . We addressed these issues in two prospective cohorts, including 526 individuals. Plasma P-tau181 correlated with CSF P-tau181 and PET measures of Aβ and tau pathologies, and predicted Tau PET and Aβ PET positivity. Plasma P-tau181 was increased early in AD, continued to increase with disease progression and distinguished AD dementia from other neurodegenerative diseases. Plasma P-tau181 predicted longitudinal progression to AD dementia (better than other candidate plasma biomarkers) and was increased in converters to AD dementia compared to those who converted to dementia due to non-AD diseases. In a separate cohort of 63 individuals with neuropathological data, antemortem plasma P-tau181 was associated with AD neuropathology at autopsy. These results suggest that plasma P-tau181 may be used as a first line of testing to identify patients likely to be tau positive when tested by Plasma P-tau181 is associated with Tau PET. Tau PET can quantify insoluble PHF-tau aggregates 11 , with potential to revolutionize clinical trials 12 . We tested associations between plasma P-tau181 and Tau PET in 174 participants (cohort 1). We first tested associations in a priori defined brain regions linked to tau pathology in AD, including the Braak I-IV region of interest (ROI) (temporal 'meta-ROI') as well as the Braak I-II, III-IV and V-VI ROIs and inferior temporal cortex 13 . Higher P-tau181 was associated with increased Tau PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in Braak I-IV ROI in the whole cohort (β = 0.71, P &lt; 0.001), and in Aβ + (β = 0.69, P &lt; 0.001) but not in Aβindividuals (β = 0.11, P = 0.48; Fig. 1b Table 2). In the cognitively unimpaired group, plasma P-tau181 was positively related to Tau PET in all regions except the late Braak V-VI ROI regions, whereas in cognitively impaired participants (Aβ + MCI and Aβ + AD dementia) the associations were significant in all regions except the early Braak I-II ROI (Supplementary Table 2). In voxel-wise analyses, plasma P-tau181 was mainly associated with Tau PET in temporo-parietal regions (Fig. 1d).</p>
<p>Next, the cohort was divided into those without significantly elevated Tau PET measurements in any Braak ROI ('Tau PET -'), and those with significantly elevated measurements in one or more of these ROIs, including (1) Braak I-II (but not III-VI), (2) Braak III-IV (but not V-VI) and (3) Braak V-VI. We observed that P-tau181 differed between the Braak I-II + , III-IV + and V-VI + groups compared to the group with normal Tau PET (F = 43.5, P &lt; 0.001). Plasma P-tau181 was increased in Braak III-IV + and V-VI + compared with Tau PET -, and was also higher in Braak V-VI + compared with Braak I-II + and Braak III-IV + (all P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 3a). These results are similar to those for CSF P-tau181 ( Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 3b), except that there was also a difference (P &lt; 0.001) between Tau PETand Braak I-II + (P = 0.056 for plasma P-tau181).</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 predicted abnormal Tau PET status in both the earlier Braak I-IV ROI (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.87, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 78%) and the later Braak V-VI ROI (AUC = 0.91, sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 81%). Regarding AUC, sensitivities and specificities for detection of abnormal Tau PET were slightly lower for plasma P-tau181 than for CSF P-tau181, and similar or higher than for CSF T-tau and Aβ42/ Aβ40 ( Fig. 2c and Table 2).</p>
<p>These results show that plasma P-tau181 correlates with increased Tau PET measurements similarly or better than CSF AD biomarkers. Since Tau PET has been validated against neuropathology with very high correlations to the quantities of PHF-tau deposits in the brain 11,14 , this suggests that plasma P-tau181 may increase in relation to tau accumulation in the brain. We also verified that plasma P-tau181 collected antemortem was increased in neuropathologically confirmed cases with AD compared to non-AD cases (P &lt; 0.001) and could accurately differentiate neuropathologically confirmed AD from non-AD, with AUC = 0.85 (Extended Data Fig. 4).</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 is associated with Aβ accumulation as quantified by Aβ PET. The second key hallmark of AD besides tau accumulation is Aβ pathology. A key question in AD research is to understand links between altered Aβ and tau metabolism. We performed [ 18 F]flutemetamol PET for Aβ in 129 participants in cohort 1 and 324 participants in cohort 2. Increased P-tau181 was associated with increased Aβ PET (using a global cortical composite measure) in cohort 1 (β = 0.54, P &lt; 0.001) and in cohort 2 (β = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001). These associations were significant in Aβ + but not in Aβindividuals ( Fig. 1c for cohort 1, Extended Data Fig. 1b for cohort 2). Voxel-wise analyses showed weaker associations of plasma P-tau181 with Aβ PET than Tau PET (Fig. 1e). We compared P-tau181 to plasma Elecsys Aβ biomarkers that predict Aβ PET status 15 . The associations with [ 18 F]flutemetamol were significantly higher for plasma P-tau181 than for plasma Aβ42 and Aβ42/ Aβ40 (Supplementary Table 3). P-tau181 differentiated normal versus pathological Aβ PET in cohort 1 (AUC = 0.80, sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 67%) and in cohort 2 (AUC = 0.81, sensitivity = 79%, specificity = 75%). The performance of P-tau181 was slightly better than Aβ42/Aβ40 (AUC = 0.77) (Supplementary Table 4). Furthermore, AUCs were higher when combining P-tau181 with Aβ42/Aβ40 (AUC = 0.84) compared with Aβ42/Aβ40 alone (AUC = 0.77, P &lt; 0.001 for AUC comparison). These results indicate that plasma P-tau181 might be combined with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 to identify cerebral Aβ pathology with high accuracy. The performance of CSF AD biomarkers was somewhat better than plasma biomarkers (Supplementary Table 4).</p>
<p>Since plasma P-tau181 may start to increase at a certain level of Aβ pathology, we tested a nonlinear spline model with continuous Aβ PET SUVR as predictor of plasma P-tau181 and determined an Aβ PET threshold for when P-tau181 levels were elevated. In cohort 1, plasma P-tau181 was significantly increased at Aβ PET SUVR = 0.72 (Extended Data Fig. 5a). This was slightly higher than for CSF P-tau181 (SUVR = 0.66) and close to the threshold for Aβ PET positivity (SUVR = 0.74, using the target ROI and reference region described in Methods) 16 . The results were replicated in cohort 2 (SUVR = 0.70; Extended Data Fig. 5b). These findings show that plasma P-tau181 increases early in AD, around the timepoint of Aβ positivity, and support plasma P-tau181 as a possible early marker of AD.</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 differentiates between different stages of AD, and between AD and non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical diagnosis of AD is often difficult, and CSF and PET biomarkers improve the diagnostic workup 1 . We tested whether plasma P-tau181 could differentiate between (1) healthy controls without signs of preclinical AD and individuals in the AD continuum (the preclinical, prodromal or dementia stages of the disease), as well as between (2) patients with AD dementia and those with non-AD neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 varied between groups, in both cohort 1 (F = 36.0, P &lt; 0.001) and cohort 2 (F = 39.5, P &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 2d,e and Extended Data Fig. 3c,d). In cohort 1, we found higher P-tau181 in Aβ + cognitively unimpaired, Aβ + MCI and Aβ + AD dementia than in Aβcognitively unimpaired (P = 0.044, P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively) and non-AD disease groups (all P = 0.001). P-tau181 was also increased in Aβ + MCI and Aβ + AD dementia compared with Aβ + cognitively unimpaired groups (both P &lt; 0.001). In cohort 2, the early changes in P-tau181 were replicated with higher levels in Aβ + cognitively unimpaired and Aβ + MCI compared with Aβcognitively unimpaired and Aβ -MCI, and also in Aβ + MCI compared with Aβ + cognitively unimpaired groups (all P &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 accurately discriminated AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases with AUC = 0.93, sensitivity = 92% and specificity = 87%. Plasma P-tau181 had similar or better performance than CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 and T-tau (Supplementary Table 5). The performance of plasma P-tau181 was slightly worse compared with that of CSF P-tau181 and Tau PET ( Fig. 2f and Supplementary Table 5), but with small differences (AUC = 0.03-0.04, sensitivity = 6%, specificity = 7-9%).</p>
<p>These results show that plasma P-tau181 may be increased early in AD, potentially even in some Aβ + cognitively unimpaired individuals (preclinical AD 17 ). Plasma P-tau181 then increased further during the symptomatic (prodromal and dementia) stages of AD. In contrast, plasma P-tau181 was not increased in non-AD. These characteristics mark out plasma P-tau181 as a promising biomarker to track disease progression in AD and to differentiate AD from non-AD conditions, with utility for patient management in clinical practice, research and trials.</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 predicts progression to AD dementia.</p>
<p>The results showing that plasma P-tau181 is related to CSF P-tau181, Tau PET, different stages of AD and that it starts to increase early in the disease in terms of Aβ PET load suggested that it might be used to predict future progression to AD dementia in people who are cognitively unimpaired or have MCI. This is an essential question in the clinical management of patients wih MCI, and in clinical trials at the preclinical and early clinical stages. We therefore performed survival analyses for progression to AD dementia in 332 participants (cohort 2) who were all nondemented at baseline, and followed with repeated clinical examinations up to 8 yr. Over a mean follow-up of 4.9 yr (s.d. = 1.3 yr), 62 (18.7%) developed AD dementia and 33 (9.9%) dementia due to other diseases (vascular dementia, n = 15), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 6), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD, n = 4), frontotemporal dementia (FTD, n = 2), dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2), cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL; n = 1) or dementia due to unspecified cause (n = 3). Baseline plasma P-tau181 was increased in those who subsequently developed AD dementia compared to those that did not develop any dementia (both Aβ + and Aβindividuals) or developed dementia due to other causes (F = 45.7, P &lt; 0.001; post hoc tests: P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3e). Furthermore, plasma P-tau181 levels were increased in Aβ + cognitively unimpaired individuals and those with Aβ + MCI who progressed to AD dementia compared with Aβcognitively unimpaired and Aβ -MCI individuals who did not convert All β = 0.73, P = 5.2 × 10 -29 Aββ = 0.12, P = 0.42 Aβ + β = 0.73, P = 6.2 × 10 -22</p>

We also observed higher plasma P-tau181 levels in Aβ + MCI who converted to AD dementia than in Aβ + cognitively unimpaired and Aβ + MCI non-converters (Extended Data Fig. 6). When adjusting for age, sex and education, each 1 s.d. increment in the log of baseline plasma P-tau181 was associated with greater risk of future AD dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 3.8, P &lt; 0.001; Table 3). For comparison, the HR of CSF P-tau181 was 3.9 (95% CI = 3.0-4.9, P &lt; 0.001). We found similar associations between plasma P-tau181 (continuous) and increased risk after additional adjustment for plasma T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and NfL (HR = 3.6, P &lt; 0.001; Table 3). None of the latter biomarkers were independently related to risk of AD dementia in a multivariable analysis that included all plasma biomarkers.</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 was associated with increased risk of AD dementia in both cognitively unimpaired participants (HR = 2.5, P = 0.01) and MCI (HR = 3.1, P &lt; 0.001), and after additional adjustment for plasma T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and NfL (cognitively unimpaired, HR = 2.4, P = 0.04; MCI, HR = 3.0, P &lt; 0.001; Table 3).</p>
<p>We binarized baseline plasma P-tau181 data using the Youdenbased cutoff of 1.81 pg ml -1 for differentiation of Aβcognitively unimpaired who did not convert to AD dementia from those who progressed to AD dementia. Compared to normal plasma levels of P-tau181 (≤1.81 pg ml -1 ), abnormal levels (&gt;1.81 pg ml -1 ) were associated with increased risk of future AD dementia (HR = 10.9, 95% CI = 5.0-24.0, P &lt; 0.001; Fig. 3b).</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 may be used to predict subsequent progression to AD dementia in both cognitively unimpaired (for example, in clinical trials aimed at the preclinical stage of AD) and MCI (relevant for clinical practice and drug trials aimed at symptomatic stages). Plasma P-tau181 may be a more powerful indicator of AD risk than other candidate blood-based biomarkers, including plasma T-tau 8,9 and plasma NfL 7 .</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 (1) correlated to CSF P-tau181, (2) identified increased Tau PET and Amyloid PET uptake, (3) increased along the AD continuum-from preclinical to prodromal and dementia stages, (4) distinguished AD from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, including neuropathologically verified AD from non-AD, and (5) predicted longitudinal conversion to AD dementia with greater precision than previously established plasma AD biomarkers, including Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, NfL and T-tau [6][7][8][9] .</p>
<p>The correlations found with CSF P-tau181 are in line with results from a much smaller study (n = 11) 4 and suggest that, to a large degree, plasma P-tau181 is derived from the central nervous  Table 2 for sensitivity and specificity measures). d, Cohort 2; plasma P-tau181 concentrations in Aβ + and Aβcognitively unimpaired (CU) and patients with MCI. e, Cohort 1; plasma P-tau181 concentrations in Aβ + and Aβ -CU and in the Aβ + MCI, Aβ + AD dementia and non-AD neurodegenerative (ND) disease groups. f, Cohort 1; ROC curve analyses of plasma P-tau181, CSF P-tau181 and Tau PET in Braak I-IV ROI for distinguishing AD dementia from non-AD ND in a subcohort of 77 patients (35 AD dementia and 42 non-AD ND (8 PD, 13 PDD, 4 PSP, 5 DLB, 6 CBS, 2 SD and 4 bvFTD) where all these measures were available (see Supplementary Table 5 for sensitivity and specificity measures). CSF P-tau181 and Tau PET data in f have previously been published in an overlapping subcohort and are shown for reference 23  system in AD. One finding was that plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 correlated only in Aβ + individuals, indicating that CSF and blood P-tau181 may be differently regulated depending on Aβ status. Supporting this, plasma P-tau181 had greater variability than CSF P-tau181 in the Aβgroup, and some individuals had increased plasma P-tau181 but not increased CSF P-tau181 ( Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Furthermore, plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 correlated even in preclinical AD (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d) when passive secretion of P-tau181 due to neuronal cell death would be unlikely to affect P-tau181 in either blood or CSF. Other studies have shown much weaker correlations between plasma T-tau and CSF T-tau levels than we found for P-tau181 8,9,18,19 , indicating that plasma P-tau181 is superior in the detection of pathological brain changes 3,8 . Plasma P-tau181, but not T-tau, was independently associated with increased risk of progression to AD dementia. One possible explanation for these differences between plasma P-tau181 and plasma T-tau is that currently available assays for T-tau may measure a form of tau that is susceptible to proteolytic degradation in blood resulting in a very short apparent half-life of the molecule (hours in plasma compared with weeks in CSF) 20 . The antibody combination used to measure plasma P-tau181 most probably measures a tau fragment that is resistant to this degradation. Another possibility is that plasma P-tau181 is more brain-specific, while T-tau can potentially also be produced outside the central nervous system 21 .</p>
<p>The associations between P-tau181 and Tau PET (which is associated with tau neuropathology 11,14 ), together with increased plasma P-tau181 in neuropathologically confirmed AD dementia, indicate that plasma P-tau181 is related to insoluble tau deposits in AD. Plasma P-tau181 correlated to Tau PET in all tested regions when including both cognitively unimpaired and cognitively impaired cases, and to all regions except Braak I-II (entorhinal cortex) in Aβ + cognitively impaired individuals. Entorhinal cortex is one of the earliest sites engaged by tau pathology in AD and one of the first sites with increased Tau PET 12 , and thus it is possible that Tau PET may be saturated there in most symptomatic individuals. When using a Tau PET staging system where individuals were grouped into Tau PET -, Braak I-II + , III-IV + and V-VI + , plasma P-tau181 increased numerically stepwise between the stages. However, while there was a strong trend for higher plasma P-tau levels (P = 0.056), CSF P-tau181 was significantly increased in the Braak I-II + group. Given the small sample size of this group, future studies in larger cohorts are warranted to determine whether plasma P-tau181 is a sufficiently sensitive biomarker to detect abnormal Tau PET at the early Braak I-II ROI. At the same time, plasma P-tau181 identified individuals with positive Tau PET in the Braak I-IV and V-VI composites (AUC = 0.86-0.90; Fig. 2c), supporting its usefulness as a noninvasive biomarker to predict Tau PET positivity-for example, in clinical trials aimed at tau + participants. Given the correlations between plasma P-tau181 and Tau PET, the findings of stepwise increases in plasma P-tau181 from Aβcognitively unimpaired to Aβ + cognitively unimpaired, and further to Aβ + MCI, were expected and in line with previous data 22,23 . Our findings suggest that plasma P-tau181 can be used as a blood-based biomarker of cerebral PHFtau pathology. This may be used in epidemiological or interventional studies with longitudinally banked plasma samples to study the effects on tau pathology of risk factors, protective factors and different interventions. The potential mechanisms underlying increased fluid P-tau181 in AD have been elucidated by recent stable isotope-labeling kinetics experiments 24 , which showed that neurons affected by AD or exposed to Aβ have increased synthesis and secretion of tau. These neurons may eventually degenerate and develop tangle pathology. This is a likely explanation for the positive correlation of plasma P-tau181 concentration with Tau PET signal (rather than tangle pathology directly driving the increase in P-tau181).</p>
<p>Differential diagnosis of AD dementia from other diseases is difficult using clinical testing 25 . Tau PET has excellent performance in differentiating AD dementia from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases, since abnormal Tau PET is very rare in most other dementias 26 . Plasma P-tau181 had very similar performance (AUC = 0.94) to Tau PET (AUC = 0.98) for AD versus other neurodegenerative diseases (Fig. 2f). Plasma P-tau181 may therefore be an alternative to Tau PET for differential diagnosis. If the results are replicated, plasma P-tau181 may be used to improve differential diagnosis of patients with cognitive impairment which, in turn, might improve symptomatic treatment (with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) and patient management. One additional implication is that plasma P-tau181 may be used as a screening tool to identify patients who are in need of confirmatory tau diagnostics (PET or CSF).</p>
<p>Prediction of longitudinal impairment to dementia is a key question for management of individuals with mild cognitive deficits, and for the design of clinical trials in early AD. We show that, similarly to CSF AD biomarkers 27 , plasma P-tau181 accurately predicts development of AD dementia in people without dementia (Fig. 3b). When compared directly in the same subjects, plasma P-tau181 had very similar performance to CSF P-tau181 in predicting conversion to AD dementia. This suggests that plasma P-tau181 may have a similarly high utility to that of CSF P-tau181 in predicting future AD dementia, including when risk-stratifying individuals in trials. When combining plasma P-tau181 with other plasma biomarkers, including T-tau 9 , Aβ42/Aβ40 (ref. 6 ) and NfL 7 , only P-tau181 was associated with increased risk of AD dementia. However, it is possible that different assays for plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 may have different precision and, in particular, mass spectrometrybased assays might be more accurate than the assays used here 28,29 . Therefore, further studies are required to test whether a combination of plasma P-tau181 and mass spectrometry-based Aβ42/Aβ40 might yield an even better performance in predicting future development of AD.</p>
<p>The finding that plasma P-tau181 correlated to Aβ PET points to a link between metabolism of plasma P-tau181 and Aβ aggregation. The AUC to differentiate Aβand Aβ + individuals was 0.81, which increased to 0.84 when combined with plasma Aβ42/Aβ40. Our analyses suggest that plasma P-tau181 may start to increase around the time of Aβ positivity, and also continue to increase as Aβ accumulates, as shown by the correlations with Aβ PET even within the Aβ + subgroup.</p>
<p>One study limitation was that some subgroups were relatively small, especially the non-AD neurodegenerative disease groups (cross-sectionally tested in cohort 1 and longitudinally in cohort 2) and the neuropathologically confirmed group. Future studies are needed to validate P-tau181 as a biomarker for differential diagnosis of AD (for example, distinguishing AD from FTD). Our findings should also be replicated in a primary care setting. This is important, since the practical utility of all diagnostic tests may vary depending on the prevalence of the target condition in the tested population. Plasma P-tau181 was measured using a researchgrade assay. A fully validated clinical-grade assay, together with a certified reference material 30 , is needed for implementation in clinical practice and establishment of universal cutoffs. The results currently available suggest that one cutoff may be used to identify AD at both the MCI and dementia stages. Twenty samples (3.8%) were below the limit of detection (see Methods). This may be improved by assay development, including implementation on more sensitive platforms such as, for example, Simoa technology or mass spectrometry-based assays 31,32 . Regarding the longitudinal analyses, at present we unfortunately cannot test whether plasma P-tau181 can predict conversion from negative to positive status on Tau PET or Amyloid PET, which will be important to study in the future.</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 is promising regarding the diagnosis and prognostication of AD, especially in facilities with limited access to CSF or PET testing. The most likely clinical applications are to distinguish AD from other non-AD neurodegenerative diseases in cases with mild to moderate dementia (to ensure optimal patient management, including access to available treatments), and to predict future development of AD in cases with MCI. Plasma P-tau181 is also promising regarding trials to enrich participants and potentially also to monitor the effects of treatments. For trials of preclinical AD, plasma P-tau181 may be used together with a measure of plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 (see Supplementary Table 4). A recent framework on AD research 1 suggests that CSF P-tau181 can be used to indicate tau status. Given the obvious benefit of a blood test, together with close correlations to CSF P-tau181, Tau PET, AD diagnosis and neuropathology, we suggest that plasma P-tau181 can also be used to indicate tau status. The capability of plasma P-tau181 to predict future development of AD dementia independently of, and superior to, other plasma AD biomarkers might be valuable in clinical practice and trials.

<p>Methods</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee in Lund, Sweden. All participants gave written informed consent to participate. The study was conducted in accordance with Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines.</p>
<p>Participants. This project included three separate cohorts. (2) current significant alcohol or substance misuse; and (3) significant neurological or psychiatric illness. The inclusion criteria for patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or MCI (defined using criteria by Petersen 33 ) were (1) referred to a participating memory clinic because of cognitive complaints; (2) age 60-80 yr; (3) did not fulfill the criteria for any dementia disorder; and (4) fluency in Swedish. The exclusion criteria were (1) significant unstable systemic illness or organ failure, such as terminal cancer, that made it difficult to participate in the study; (2) current significant alcohol or substance misuse; and (3) cognitive impairment that, without doubt, could be explained by other specific non-neurodegenerative disorders such as brain tumor or subdural hematoma. Following neuropsychological assessment including a test battery evaluating verbal ability, episodic memory function, visuospatial construction ability and attention and executive functions, patients were classified as SCD or MCI as previously described 34 . In accordance with the research framework of the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association 1 , study participants with SCD were analyzed together with cognitively healthy participants (and combined in the cognitively unimpaired group).</p>
<p>In cohort 2, the study participants (that is, participants who were cognitively unimpaired or had MCI at baseline) were followed over time with repeated cognitive, neurologic and psychiatric assessments by a physician, and also underwent repeated cognitive testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and collection of CSF and blood. The follow-up visits were performed every 2 yr in the cognitively healthy group and every year for patients with SCD and MCI (mean follow-up = 4.9 yr, s.d. = 1.3 yr). During the follow-up, 62 (18.7%; 11 Aβ + cognitively unimpaired, 50 Aβ + MCI and one Aβ -MCI) developed AD dementia and 33 (9.9%; four Aβcognitively unimpaired, three Aβ + cognitively unimpaired, 10 Aβ + MCI and 16 Aβ -MCI) dementia due to other neurodegenerative diseases (that is, vascular dementia (n = 15), DLB (n = 6), PDD (n = 4) and FTD (n = 2), or dementia due to normal-pressure hydrocephalus (n = 2), CADASIL (n = 1) or unspecified cause (n = 3)).</p>
<p>In cohort 1, the study protocol was a priori designed to enroll cognitively unimpaired participants with a high prevalence (&gt;50%) of Aβ positivity, and only Aβ + patients with MCI, because the focus was to study tau pathology in the predementia stages of AD. In cohort 1, we also included patients with AD dementia who fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) criteria for major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) due to AD and were Aβ + (ref. 1 ). The non-AD neurodegenerative disease group included patients with PDD, DLB, FTD (all fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria for the respective disease), Parkinson's disease (PD; fulfilling the criteria defined by Gelb et al. 35 ), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; fulfilling the criteria defined by Litvan et al. 36 and Höglinger et al. 37 ) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS) (fulfilling the criteria defined by Armstrong et al. 38 ).</p>
<p>Cohort 3 included 16 AD dementia and 47 non-AD neuropathologically confirmed cases who provided plasma samples 0.02-2.9 yr before death. The demographics of cohort 3 are described in Supplementary Table 1. The AD dementia group included cases with a high likelihood that dementia was due to AD histopathology according to National Institute on Aging (NIA)-Reagan criteria 39 . The non-AD group (n = 47) had none or sparse neuritic plaques according to the score of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, and cases with clinical diagnoses included in the non-AD group were amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 1), controls without a major neuropathological diagnosis (n = 14), corticobasal degeneration (n = 1), dementia with unspecified etiology (n = 2), FTD with TDP-43 (n = 1), MCI (n = 3), multiple sclerosis (n = 1), PD (n = 15), parkinsonism (n = 2), primary lateral sclerosis (n = 1), PSP (n = 2), vascular cognitive impairment (n = 2), vascular dementia (n = 1) and vascular parkinsonism (n = 1). All subjects or their legal representatives signed an Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent form before taking part in the study.</p>
<p>All eligible subjects in all cohorts (which were convenience cohorts) were included, to maximize sample sizes.</p>
<p>Plasma and CSF sampling and analysis. Blood and CSF samples were collected in the morning during the same visit, with participants non-fasting. For each cohort 1 and 2 study participant, blood was collected in six EDTA-plasma tubes (Vacutainer K 2 EDTA tube, BD Diagnostics) and centrifuged (2,000g, +4 °C) for 10 min. Following centrifugation, plasma from all six tubes was transferred into one 50-ml polypropylene tube, mixed and 1 ml was aliquoted into 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes and stored at −80 °C within 30-60 min of collection. For cohort 3, blood processing was similar except for centrifugation at 1,500 r.p.m. for 15 min followed by transfer to 1.7-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes and a second centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 14,000 r.p.m. Lumbar puncture and CSF handling followed a structured protocol 40 .</p>
<p>Plasma P-tau181 was analyzed in the three cohorts as previously described 3 . In short, the assay was performed on a streptavidin plate on the Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) platform. Biotinylated-AT270 was used as capture antibody (anti-pT181 Tau antibody; Thermo Fisher, no. MN1050) and SULFO-TAG-LRL (anti-tau monoclonal antibodies developed by Lilly Research Laboratory) as detector. Antibodies were conjugated with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Thermo Scientific, no. 21327) or MSD GOLD SULFO-TAG NHS-ester (MSD, no. R91AO) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The assay was calibrated using a recombinant tau (4R2N) protein that was phosphorylated in vitro. The assay uses 80 µl of plasma diluted with an equal volume of sample diluent, to allow for duplicate measurements. Data for quality control and control samples are shown in Supplementary Table 6. In cohort 1, five (2.7%) samples from non-AD neurodegenerative diseases were below the level of detection (LOD, 0.54 pg ml -1 ). In cohort 2, 15 (4.4%) samples were &gt;LOD including nine (2.6%) Aβ cognitively unimpaired, four (1.2%) Aβ -MCI and two Aβ + cognitively unimpaired (0.6%). All plasma samples with P-tau181 concentrations &lt;LOD were included in statistical analysis using values extrapolated from the standard curve.</p>
<p>In cohort 2, plasma Aβ42, Aβ40 and T-tau were measured using Elecsys fully-automated immunoassays on a cobas e 601 analyzer, and plasma NfL concentrations were measured using monoclonal antibodies as in the NF-light assay (UmanDiagnostics), together with an in-house calibrator (purified bovine NfL) transferred onto the Simoa platform using a homebrew kit (Quanterix), as described previously 15,41 .</p>
<p>CSF from cohorts 1 and 2 was analyzed for Aβ42, Aβ40 and T-tau using ELISA (Euroimmun) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. CSF P-tau181 was quantified using ELISA. Anti-P-tau181 antibody was used as a capture antibody in the P-tau181 assay. Antibodies were conjugated with biotin (Thermo Scientific, no. 21329) or SULFO-TAG (MSD, no. R91AO-1). The assay was calibrated using a recombinant tau (4R2N) protein that was phosphorylated in vitro using a reaction with glycogen synthase kinase-3 and characterized by mass spectrometry. The samples were thawed on wet ice, briefly vortexed and diluted 1/8 in Diluent 35 (MSD, no. R50AE) with the addition of a heterophilic blocking reagent to a concentration of 200 µg ml -1 (Scantibodies, no. 3KC533). To perform the assays, MSD small-spot streptavidin-coated plates (MSD, no. L45SA) were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 200 µl of 3% bovine serum albumin in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline, with 650 r.p.m. shaking on a plate shaker. The plates were then washed three times with 200 µl of wash buffer (PBS + 0.05% Tween 20), and 25 µl of biotinylated capture antibody at 1 µg ml -1 was added to the wells followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature with 650 r.p.m. shaking on a plate shaker. The plates were again washed three times with 200 µl of wash buffer and 50 µl of diluted calibrator, or sample was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 650 r.p.m. shaking on a plate shaker. The plates were then washed three times with 200 µl of wash buffer, and 25 µl of SULFO-tagged LRL detection antibody was added at 3 µg ml -1 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 650 r.p.m. shaking on a plate shaker. The plates were washed a final time with 200 µl of wash buffer, and 150 µl of 2× MSD Read Buffer T with Surfactant (MSD, no. R92TC) was added to each plate and read on the MSD SQ120 within 10 min of read buffer addition. Samples were analyzed in duplicates, and the mean of duplicates was used in statistical analysis.</p>
<p>All plasma and CSF analyses were performed by technicians who were blinded to the clinical and imaging data. All assessments of clinical and imaging data were done blinded to the plasma P-tau181 data.  13,42 .</p>
<p>[ 18 F]flortaucipir PET was performed in cohort 1. The mean injected dose of [ 18 F]flortaucipir was ≈370 megabecquerel (MBq), and participants underwent a PET scan 80-100 min after injection. Images were motion corrected with the AFNI 3dvolreg, time averaged and rigidly coregistered to the skull-stripped MRI scan. SUVR images were created using inferior cerebellar gray matter as reference Articles Nature MediciNe region 43 . FreeSurfer (v.5.3) parcellation of the T1-weighted MRI scan was applied to the PET data transformed to participants' native T1 space to extract mean regional SUVR values for each participant in four predefined ROIs, including inferior temporal cortex and three regions corresponding to different image-based stages of tau as described in Cho et al. 44 26 ).</p>
<p>Aβ ([ 18 F]flutemetamol) PET was perfomed in cohorts 1 and 2, the mean injected dose being ≈185 MBq. PET images were acquired 90-110 min after injection. The scanning and processing procedures have been described previously 40,46 . The weighted mean SUVR from a global neocortical region of interest was calculated relative to a composite reference region (white matter, cerebellum and brainstem) 15,46 .</p>
<p>Aβ positivity. Cutoffs for CSF Aβ42 (&lt;510 pg ml -1 ) and Aβ PET (SUVR &gt; 0.743) were computed using Gaussian mixture modeling. Study participants who underwent both lumbar puncture and Aβ PET imaging were considered Aβ + if either CSF Aβ42 or Aβ PET measures were abnormal.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis.</p>
<p>Associations between plasma P-tau181 and CSF P-tau181 or PET measures were examined using linear regression, adjusted for age and sex. Group differences were assessed in univariate general linear models, adjusted for age and sex and least significant difference tests (post hoc) for pairwise group comparisons.</p>
<p>Diagnostic accuracies were assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression models. We used a bootstrap procedure (n = 2,000 iterations) to compare ROC curves and compute 95% CI of sensitivities and specificities (at Youden index thresholds).</p>
<p>To assess associations between plasma P-tau181 (as a continuous variable) and risk of incident AD dementia, we used Cox proportional hazard regression models adjusted for age, sex and education (yr). In a secondary analysis, we covaried for other plasma biomarkers (T-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40 and NfL). All participants were censored at their last follow-up visit or diagnosis of AD dementia. Results were expressed as HR. The proportionality of hazards assumption was assessed using the Schoenfeld residuals.</p>
<p>Associations between log-transformed plasma P-tau181 and continuous Aβ PET uptake were tested with nonlinear polynomial spline models (using the I-spline basis), to detect Aβ PET thresholds for increased P-tau181 (the Aβ level where the spline increased by at least two standard errors from baseline).</p>
<p>Log-transformed biomarker and PET measures were used in regression analyses. When comparing plasma P-tau181 to other blood biomarkers in Cox proportional hazard regression models, biomarker data were standardized within the sample. Outliers with plasma P-tau181 levels &gt;3 s.d. above the mean (n = 7) were excluded from the main analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis including the outliers, with very similar results (Supplementary Results).</p>
<p>Unadjusted two-sided P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The results were similar after adjustment for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate adjustment (Supplementary Results). All analyses were performed using SPSS v.24 (IBM), R studio and R v.3.5.3 (packages pROC and splines2). Data were visualized using either Prism 8 (Graphpad) or R studio.</p>

<p>The first two cohorts were part of the prospective Swedish BioFINDER study, with participants recruited at Skåne University Hospital and the Hospital of Ängelholm, Sweden.The third cohort was from the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative 
Disorders/Brain and Body Donation Program at Banner Sun Health Institute, 
USA. Cohort 1 included 182 participants (n = 182) enrolled between November 
2014 and January 2018 who underwent Tau ([ 18 F]flortaucipir) PET imaging, and 
cohort 2 included nondemented participants (n = 344) enrolled between January 
2010 and December 2014 who were followed longitudinally for up to 8 yr. The 
demographics of each cohort are described in Table 1. The inclusion criteria for 
cognitively healthy elderly individuals were (1) absence of cognitive symptoms as 
assessed by a physician with special interest in cognitive disorders; (2) age ≥60 yr; 
(3) Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 28-30 points at screening visit; (4) 
did not fulfill the criteria for MCI or any dementia disorder; and (5) fluency in 
Swedish. The exclusion criteria were (1) significant unstable systemic illness, such 
as terminal cancer, or organ failure that made it difficult to participate in the study; </p>

For voxel-wise analysis between [ 18 F]flortaucipir and CSF and plasma P-tau181, magnetic resonance and PET images were transformed into Montreal Neurological Institute space (2-mm MNI152 MRI template), and voxel-wise correlations were made using multiple regressions adjusting for age in SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). Images were thresholded using family-wise error (FWE) correction at P &lt; 0.05. The thresholded images were overlaid on a population-average, landmark-and surfacebased image45 using CARET v.5.65 (Van Essen Lab; http://brainvis.wustl.edu).

AcknowledgementsThe work in the present study was supported by the European Research Council The solid lines are fits from spline models of P-tau181 on [ 18 F]flutemetamol. Associations between plasma P-tau181 (log-transformed) and continuous Aβ PET uptake were tested with non-linear polynomial spline models (using I-spline basis), to detect Aβ PET thresholds for increased P-tau181 (the Aβ level where the spline increased at least two standard errors from baseline). The shaded area represents 95% CI. The thick dotted line shows an a priori Aβ PET threshold for Aβ PET positivity (0.743 SUVR). The thin dotted lines indicate the [ 18 F]flutemetamol level where plasma P-tau181 is significantly increased from baseline. PET = positron emission tomography; SUVR = standardized uptake value ratio.ArticlesNature MediciNeExtended DataFig. 6| Plasma P-tau181 and progression to AD dementia.

No participants from the Aβ-CU group progressed to AD dementia. Data from one Aβ-MCI who converted to AD dementia was excluded from the figure. P-values are from univariate general linear models adjusted for age and sex as described in the methods.
