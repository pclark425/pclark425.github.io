                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them "curriculum learning". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).</p>

ECARDA A Curriculum for Learning
November 20181
A staircase to deeper learning This paper brings up to date some work undertaken by teachers who were keen to develop progression pathways that could sit alongside a content curriculum. Instead of learning more content, teachers developed materials that would allow for a deeper exploration of that content leading to more profound understanding and confidence in application.</p>
<p>It is relaunched in 2018 in response to requests for materials to support autonomous, deeper and more secure learning.</p>
<p>Though the school consistently achieved high outcomes, it was not convinced that its pupils left the school as confident and independent learners.</p>
<p>The project broadened the focus of teacher planning and pupil learning onto those skills which are to do with awareness of learning and on to those attitudes that motivate and sustain independent learning.</p>
<p>This did not mean the school neglected the acquisition and application of knowledge, skills and understanding. It did mean that it made explicit the ways in which knowledge, skills and understanding are acquired. By doing this, the school drew attention to and made learners aware of their learning.</p>
<p>Learners who have learnt how to learn have no limits on the possibilities of their future achievement and they leave their school as empowered learners.</p>
<p>As a well-known Chinese proverb says:</p>
<p>Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.</p>
<p>Teach him how to fish and he will eat for a lifetime.</p>
<p>This project is invitational and inclusive. Schools and colleges from all phases may join this project to see how it might benefit teaching and learning in their own institutions. We do ask that the materials are recognised as at 'trial stage' and therefore not for publication or wider circulation. We do ask that you send progress and feedback reports to ECARDA™, who is managing this research project, so that your advice and recommendations can be built in to the development.</p>
<p>These materials were formulated by teachers for teachers.</p>
<p>Feedback from schools involved in this research project may be published on the ECARDA website.</p>
<p>A PowerPoint presentation accompanies this set of working papers.</p>

<p>Description of a 'curriculum for learning'</p>
<p>The curriculum may be seen in three-dimensions:</p>
<p>▪ The affect domain that relates to emotional-social factors. ▪ The process domain that refers to thinking, working or learning skills. ▪ The cognitive or content domain that refers to knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>There is almost a sequence here. Given that only the learner can learn, there needs to be a climate in which that learning is safe, motivated, nurtured, sustained, extended, supported, recognised and valued. (Features of the affects)</p>
<p>Once engaged, learners need to develop the skills and habits that allow them to become independent learners through enquiring, reasoning, exploring, analysing, generalising, specifying examples and evaluating. (Features of the processes)</p>
<p>These processes lead towards the acquisition of knowledge, skills and understanding. (Features of the cognitive or content domain)</p>
<p>Typically, the affects and processes overarch, or are embedded across the curriculum, whilst the knowledge and understanding are more usually expressed within "subjects" and often described as the subject content.</p>
<p>Broad sequences of progression for subject-related knowledge, skills and understanding (the concept or content domain) are already presented in the form of National Curriculum end-of-year, or end-of-key stage, age-related expectations, examination grade descriptions and level-related specifications.</p>
<p>This paper starts to sketch out ideas of progression across the process and affect domains. For each of the four steps of each of the seven aspects of the process domain, descriptors are presented that suggest behaviours or activities typical of a learner at that step. Similarly, descriptors are presented for four steps within each of three aspects of the affect domain.</p>
<p>These steps offer a staircase from a planned piece of subject content into greater depth and/or mastery. They begin to volunteer to answer questions directed at the whole group ▪ They begin to engage with tasks independently ▪ They begin to initiate their own lines of enquiry ▪ They begin to identify and secure the resources they may need to sustain a task or line of enquiry step 3 ▪ Learners participate in discussions, occasionally taking the lead ▪ They regularly volunteer to answer questions directed at the whole group ▪ They regularly engage with tasks independently ▪ They initiate their own lines of enquiry and begin to sustain them over extended periods ▪ They see tasks and lines of enquiry through to their conclusion step 4 ▪ Learners stimulate, lead and actively participate in discussions ▪</p>
<p>They are eager to volunteer answers to questions directed at the whole group ▪ They challenge assertions and extend questions asked of them ▪ They tackle tasks with enthusiasm, planning their execution and identifying and securing the resources they will need ▪ They initiate their own lines of enquiry and sustain them over long periods of time ▪ They critically evaluate the outcomes of their work as well as their approaches to it ▪ They seek and relish challenge and go out of their way to extend tasks to find it ▪ They demonstrate an infectious interest in their work A2 Collaborating step 1 ▪ When prompted learners discuss with others how they may work together to undertake tasks ▪ With help and encouragement, they work with others to complete straightforward tasks ▪ They listen and respond to the views of others step 2 ▪ When in groups learners assume roles determined by the teacher or adult leader ▪ They help the group work towards achieving the task objectives ▪ They choose to work with others when they themselves need to solve problems and complete tasks step 3 ▪ Learners begin to decide how roles and sub-tasks might be allocated across a group in order to tackle a problem or undertake a multi-stage task ▪ They contribute by offering ideas and listen to the ideas of others as appropriate ▪ They choose to work with others in order to help others to solve problems and complete tasks ▪ When asked about the effectiveness of their collaboration they explain what worked well and what could be improved step 4 ▪ When in groups learners determine and agree roles that are fit for purpose, allocating sub-tasks where appropriate ▪ Their contributions are focused on helping the group to achieve task objectives or outcomes ▪ They take care to include all members of the group ▪ They assume and share leadership roles as appropriate ▪ They review roles and the allocation of sub-tasks ▪</p>
<p>In evaluating the task outcomes, they also evaluate the effectiveness of their collaboration ▪</p>
<p>In whole-class discussions they contribute to teacher-learner and learner-learner discussions A3 Persisting (independence) step 1 ▪ With encouragement learners sustain a task or line of enquiry beyond its initiation ▪ They ask questions that clarify the task objectives and help them progress through the task ▪ When encountering difficulties, they seek help from others in order to continue the task or line of enquiry step 2 ▪ Learners independently sustain a task beyond its initiation ▪ When encountering difficulties, they identify with help the intermediate questions and tasks that need to be addressed in order to overcome these difficulties ▪</p>
<p>Having dealt with the intermediate questions and tasks they return to the substantive task or line of enquiry step 3 ▪ Learners independently sustain a task or line of enquiry beyond its initiation and with encouragement they see it through to its conclusion ▪ When encountering difficulties, they identify intermediate questions and tasks that need to be addressed in order to overcome these difficulties ▪ They begin to set aside problems when they encounter difficulties and return to them later step 4 ▪ Learners independently sustain a task or line of enquiry through to its conclusion ▪ When encountering difficulties, they tackle these independently and/or with other learners calling on adult help only after exhausting their own resources ▪ They routinely set aside problems when they encounter difficulties and return to them later ▪</p>
<p>In reflecting on and evaluating the task outcomes they also evaluate their own persistence and tenacity Arguing and deducing step 1 ▪ Learners give simple, yet sensible reasons related to whether or not a given assertion may be true or false; ▪ Given a number of characteristics, learners deduce the 'object' being described.</p>
<p>step 2 ▪ Learners construct "if….then…." lines of argument with up to three steps; ▪ They begin to generalise when presented with specific examples step 3 ▪ Learners discern whether or not a given assertion or outcome is always, sometimes or never true; ▪ They construct more complex lines of "if … then…." argument.</p>
<p>step 4 ▪ With help they begin to use valid categorical syllogisms; ▪ They identify and describe flaws in arguments made by others.</p>
<p>Inferring step 1 ▪ With help, learners describe why a particular experiment, investigation or line of enquiry produces a particular outcome; ▪ They begin to consider both "why?" and "why not?" type questions.</p>
<p>step 2 ▪ Learners relate the outcomes of an experiment, investigation or line of enquiry to the initial given hypothesis; ▪ They design questions with 'yes/no' answers in order to identify an 'object' in the mind of someone else. step 3 ▪ Learners use charts and diagrams to describe more than one possible path through a task; ▪ They use 'outline' and 'detailed' planning appropriately.</p>
<p>step 4 ▪ Learners use charts and diagrams to describe possible paths they will be taking through a complex task; ▪ They use rehearsed sub-routines when describing a path through a project; ▪ They begin to use 'parallel' and 'series' paths when formulating a plan.</p>
<p>Manifesting ( step 3 ▪ When presented with a task, problem or investigation, learners identify a series of questions they need to answer that may enable them to complete them; ▪</p>
<p>Having completed a task, learners begin to ask the sorts of questions that enable to check their outcomes for reasonableness, validity and accuracy.</p>
<p>step 4 ▪ When presented with a task, problem or investigation, learners identify possible series of questions they need to answer in order to complete them; ▪</p>
<p>When asked a substantial question, learners break this into a series of manageable questions; ▪ Through a habit of questioning, learners pose their own problems and initiate their own lines of enquiry. step 2 ▪ When referring to information found, learners attribute the source of that information; ▪ They begin to express the information they find in their own words or images; ▪ With help, they check that the information they find is relevant to their line of enquiry.</p>
<p>step 3 ▪ Learners begin to interpret the information they find in the context of their question or line of enquiry; ▪ With help, they assemble and synthesise the bits of information found into a coherent response to their question or line of enquiry. ▪ They check their response for relevance to their line of research.</p>
<p>step 4 ▪ Learners compare information from different sources and identify similarities and differences; ▪ Where information from different sources appears contradictory, learners express this in their reports and begin to propose explanations; ▪ They make the distinction between facts and the interpretation of facts. ▪ Learners habitually and independently identify the information and resources they need to solve a particular problem; ▪ With help they break a complex problem into simpler parts; ▪ They logically sequence steps of the solution plan.</p>
<p>step 4 ▪ Learners break a complex problem into simpler parts; ▪ They identify the information, resources and methods they may need to use to solve each part of the problem; ▪ They describe ranges of possible sensible solutions to the problem and ranges which are either impossible or nonsensical. ▪ They identify problems they need to work on to extend their own knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>Gathering, sifting and analysing step 1 ▪ With some direction learners gather the information and resources needed; ▪ They check they have all the information and resources they need; ▪ With help they use methods, resources and aids to progress through the problem.</p>
<p>step 2 ▪ Learners independently gather the necessary information and resources; ▪ They discard or combine information in preparation for solving the problem; ▪ When working in groups they may divide gathering and sorting tasks amongst members.</p>
<p>step 3 ▪ Learners re-assemble the information gathered into a form that is appropriate to solving the problem; ▪ Where appropriate they re-present the information in ways that facilitate analysis; ▪ They process/analyse the information in line with their problem solution plan; ▪ They begin to use resources and aids independently to work through a problem.</p>
<p>step 4 ▪ Learners process the information gathered so that it supports the solutions of the parts of the problem; ▪ They use methods, resources and aids creatively and confidently to work efficiently through the parts of the problem. Explaining step 1 ▪ With help, when considering the outcomes of a task or investigation, learners begin to answer the question "Why … ?"; ▪ They use words and images appropriately in their explanations.</p>
<p>step 2 ▪ Learners relate the outcomes of an experiment, investigation or line of enquiry to the initial task brief; ▪ They explain how they tackled the task giving reasons for some of their choices.</p>
<p>step 3 ▪ Learners present their argument or explanation to others and answer questions related to it; ▪ In explaining the outcomes to a task, learners explain the sequence of steps they undertook and the reason they selected them in order to arrive at those outcomes; ▪ They explain the methods used to arrive at the outcomes of a task step 4 ▪ Learners routinely explain the outcomes of tasks and investigations; ▪ They re-trace steps undertaken to show how outcomes of a particular step may be explained in terms of the previous step; ▪ They begin to explain how the outcomes to an experiment, investigation or enquiry might alter when some of the initial conditions or variables are changed.</p>
<p>Proving step 1 ▪ Learners begin to consider "why not?" type questions. ▪</p>
<p>They check outcomes of a task or investigation in terms of common sense. </p>
<p>Reflecting step 1</p>
<p>▪ When reflecting on a completed task, learners identify the new things they may have learnt; ▪ They describe how they may approach a similar task in the future.</p>
<p>step 2 ▪ When reflecting on a completed task, learners with help re-trace the steps they took; ▪ With help they begin to evaluate the information, resources and approaches used.</p>
<p>step 3 ▪ When reflecting on a completed task, learners evaluate the way they interpreted and planned it; ▪ They evaluate the appropriateness of the information and resources used; ▪ They appraise the approaches they used and the outcomes achieved; ▪ They begin to discuss how they acquired any new learning. step 4 ▪ When reflecting on a problem solved or an investigation or task completed learners identify how the problem or investigation could be altered or extended; ▪ They compare different approaches and methods used by other and identify ways in which their own work may be improved; ▪ With help they begin to see behind results or outcomes and gain a feel for 'elegance', beauty', 'power' and 'efficiency' in methods of working and in forms of presentation. Human geography: Describe and understand: types of settlement and land use, economic activity including trade links, and the distribution of natural resources including energy, food, minerals and water.</p>
<p>Geographical skills and fieldwork: Use the eight points of a compass, four and six-figure grid references, symbols and key (including the use of Ordnance Survey maps) to build their knowledge of the United Kingdom and the wider world.</p>
<p>End of Year 5 (step 3)</p>
<p>Location: ▪ Locate the world's countries, using maps to focus on Europe (including the location of Russia) and North and South America, concentrating on their environmental regions, key physical and human characteristics, countries and major cities. ▪ Identify the position and significance of latitude, longitude, Equator, Northern Hemisphere, Southern Hemisphere, the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, Arctic and Antarctic Circle.</p>
<p>Place knowledge: Understand geographical similarities and differences through the study of human and physical geography of a region of the United Kingdom, a region in a European country, and a region within North or South America.</p>
<p>Geographical skills and fieldwork: Use maps, atlases, globes and digital/computer mapping to locate countries and describe features studied.</p>
<p>End of Year 6 (step 4) Physical geography: Describe and understand the key aspects of the water cycle.</p>
<p>Geographical skills and fieldwork: Use the eight points of a compass, four and six-figure grid references, symbols and key (including the use of Ordnance Survey maps) to build their knowledge of the United Kingdom and the wider world. Use fieldwork to observe, measure and record the human and physical features in the local area using a range of methods, including sketch maps, plans and graphs, and digital technologies.</p>
<p>Possible implications for planning and assessment</p>
<p>We understand how this may lead to some adjustment to planning sheets where learning objectives could now be expressed in each of the three domains.</p>
<p>What is shown below is no more than an example, where we have selected a geography topic (content) from the Key Stage 2 national curriculum, planned to be taught in Year 5. The full content picture for geography is presented on the previous page of this document. Clearly, the published National Curriculum includes the content pictures for all subjects.</p>
<p>For the purpose of illustration, we have included some selected third step features from the affect and process domains:</p>

<p>Similarly, we understand how this may mean changes to the ways in which we think about, measure and record achievement, which, in this model, could be expressed in 'three-dimensions'. There is a brief illustration about assessment at the end of this booklet.</p>

Similarly, it separates low attainers who are underachieving from those who may be struggling.This allows more refined teacher responses to the assessment of learners' work.</p>            </div>
