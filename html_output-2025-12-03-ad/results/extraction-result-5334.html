                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in robotics, especially for high-level action planning. Meanwhile, many robotics applications involve human supervisors or collaborators. Hence, it is crucial for LLMs to generate socially acceptable actions that align with people’s preferences and values. In this work, we test whether LLMs capture people’s intuitions about behavior judgments and communication preferences in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios. For evaluation, we reproduce three HRI user studies, comparing the output of LLMs with that of real participants. We find that GPT-4 strongly outperforms other models, generating answers that correlate strongly with users’ answers in two studies — the first study dealing with selecting the most appropriate communicative act for a robot in various situations (rs = 0.82), and the second with judging the desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness of behavior (rs = 0.83). However, for the last study, testing whether people judge the behavior of robots and humans differently, no model achieves strong correlations. Moreover, we show that vision models fail to capture the essence of video stimuli and that LLMs tend to rate different communicative acts and behavior desirability higher than people.</p>

Are Large Language Models Aligned with People's Social Intuitions for Human-Robot Interactions?
9 Jul 2024A56A62AF29F2B30A275A342953293317arXiv:2403.05701v2[cs.RO]
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in robotics, especially for high-level action planning.Meanwhile, many robotics applications involve human supervisors or collaborators.Hence, it is crucial for LLMs to generate socially acceptable actions that align with people's preferences and values.In this work, we test whether LLMs capture people's intuitions about behavior judgments and communication preferences in human-robot interaction (HRI) scenarios.For evaluation, we reproduce three HRI user studies, comparing the output of LLMs with that of real participants.We find that GPT-4 strongly outperforms other models, generating answers that correlate strongly with users' answers in two studiesthe first study dealing with selecting the most appropriate communicative act for a robot in various situations (rs = 0.82), and the second with judging the desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness of behavior (rs = 0.83).However, for the last study, testing whether people judge the behavior of robots and humans differently, no model achieves strong correlations.Moreover, we show that vision models fail to capture the essence of video stimuli and that LLMs tend to rate different communicative acts and behavior desirability higher than people.</p>
<p>I. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Problems like error mitigation, judging the desirability of robot behaviors, and identifying how best to respond in social interactions have been extensively explored by the human-robot interaction (HRI) community [1], [2].User studies in this field aim to identify people's preferences and guide roboticists toward creating robots that act in socially desirable ways.Another burgeoning topic in robotics is using large language models (LLMs) to control robotic behavior [3], [4].The action plans derived by LLMs are usually restricted to purely physical tasks, for instance, fetching or cleaning -tasks without collaboration or social interaction.However, such social interactions will become more commonplace once robots are deployed in the real world, and the question arises whether LLMs can also help robots act in a socially desirable manner, as characterized by the participants of various HRI user studies.</p>
<p>Contributing to this area of research, we look at recent HRI studies, exemplified in Figure 1, that present social situations for which users either indicate how a robot should act or evaluate a behavior.We rerun those studies by prompting LLMs with the respective study stimuli and compare how closely the models' answers align with the answers of human participants.Studies were chosen to cover a range of social competencies and tackle the following themes: lennart.wachowiak@kcl.ac.uk, lwachowiak.github.io• How should a robot communicate when it [makes an error/is uncertain/is unable to achieve its goal/...]? [5] • How desirable/intentional/surprising is a behavior?[6] • Do desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness ratings change depending on whether a human or a robot carries out the behavior?[7] Investigating whether LLMs judge those social situations similar to human participants sheds light on the social competencies and values encoded in LLMs and subsequently of agents controlled by these models.Importantly, in this work, we analyze whether these encoded values are aligned with human values or if noticeable differences arise.Thus, we contribute to two research fields: (1) social robotics and (2) value alignment research [8], [9], an area that gained attention with the recent advancements in AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Comparing the LLM responses with those of the original participants, we find the following:</p>
<p>• The most powerful language model tested (  shows strong correlations in two experiments, while less powerful models tested fall far behind.• All models have difficulties distinguishing between scenarios in which the actors are robots compared to humans, thus not aligning with people's judgment.• We observe a bias towards higher ratings on the scale; especially, LLMs overvalue simple communications in the form of stating what is happening or going to happen next as well as the desirability of depicted behavior.• Chain-of-thought reasoning decreases performance, potentially because the answers do not have to follow strict logic but are often based on human intuitions.• GPT-4 vision fails to capture human judgments as well as its text-only counterpart, partly because it cannot even describe half of the video scenarios correctly.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>In recent years, LLMs have started to become the focus of large parts of AI research.LLMs are pre-trained on massive text corpora scraped from the internet, using the causal language modeling objective in which the model predicts the next token given a left-sided context.Chat-variants like ChatGPT [10] or LLaMA-2 Chat [11] are further fine-tuned to follow instructions by being trained on specific instructionfollowing datasets in a supervised manner, followed by being trained to better align with human preferences given multiple possible text completions, using the reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) paradigm.LLMs also started playing a role in robotics as their encoded world knowledge allows them to suggest action plans without having to be finetuned on specific tasks, thus skipping much of the manual labor and domain expertise required in approaches like planning.Recent research uses LLMs not only to construct high-level plans that are then used to guide the robot's behavior [3], but even to generate low-level motor commands given that control datasets were used for further training [4].Given the current trend of integrating LLMs into robotics, these models are bound to play a role in coordinating a robot's social behavior and interactions with humans [12], [13], [14].This might happen through directly controlling the robot's actions or by modeling users and their mental states to facilitate cooperation.Williams et al. [12] highlight the potential use of LLMs as placeholders in HRI-related robot architectures before more robust solutions can be developed.At the same time, they highlight the perils of using LLMs in HRI, referring to well-known problems, especially generating wrong statements (hallucinating/confabulating), toxic text, or answers that reflect biases or stereotypes.</p>
<p>Based on this recent trend, in our study, we investigate whether LLMs judge a variety of social and communicative HRI situations similar to human study participants.We compare where communication preferences and behavior judgments align and where differences arise.</p>
<p>III. RELATED WORK</p>
<p>Using LLMs as human stand-in participants for psychology experiments has recently gained attention [15], [16], [17].Such use can be motivated by wanting to generate initial hypotheses, pilot a new design, and gain insight into human cognition based on the assumption that LLMs trained on a large amount of human-generated text will produce similar output to that of human participants [15].For instance, Dillion et al. [15], who propose such a use, report a strong correlation of 0.95 between people's answers and GPT-3.5'sanswers on moral judgment tasks.At the same time, they acknowledge that current LLMs are bad at capturing variation and diversity present in human responses and are biased towards responses of people from certain countries, economic backgrounds, and genders.Harding et al. [16] critique the use of LLMs to replace human participants and question the informativeness of the LLM's output.Among others, they highlight the missing validity of insights generated with LLMs without further human participant tests.</p>
<p>Another motivation to simulate psychological experiments with LLMs is to gain insights not into human cognition but into the capabilities of language models themselves -as is the case with our study.By reproducing various experiments with LLMs, one can compare the LLM output with how humans behaved in the real experiment, thereby establishing the "human-likeness" of the model's text generations.The usefulness of such experiments has also been suggested with respect to psycholinguistics, where experiments can show what properties of language can be successfully processed, reproduced, or generated by LLMs [18], [19], [20].Further studies find that on many psychology tasks, the LLM output is comparable to human answers, even showing similar cognitive biases [21], [22].Hagendorff et al. [21] show that these cognitive biases tend to vanish when experimenting with the most recent models, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.Aher et al. [17] extend the idea of repeating prominent experiments with LLMs.Specifically, they not only look at a single output of an LLM given some experiment prompt but try to simulate different demographics by prompting the model multiple times with different personas attached to each prompt.Different authors highlight that with such experiments, one needs to be aware that the used tests might have been part of the training data, a problem plaguing many current natural language processing benchmarks.We tackle this problem by using recent studies with data not yet publicly available or newly rewritten stimuli, which we discuss in more detail in Section IV-C.</p>
<p>Areas most relevant to social robotics in which LLM outputs have been analyzed are theory of mind [23], pragmatics [24], and commonsense reasoning for social situations [25].If an agent possesses theory of mind abilities, it means the agents can infer the beliefs and intentions of other agents -thus, an ability that is crucial to successfully navigate a social situation, adapt to a collaborative partner, or provide explanations taking a user's mental model of the world into account.Van Duijn et al. [26] test LLMs on a battery of theory of mind tests, like the Sally-Anne false belief test that checks if a participant manages to attribute beliefs that are not true to another person.While the most potent LLMs like GPT-4 outperform children aged 7-10 on the original tests, they show performance drops when second-order theory of mind is involved and when some of the original tests are rewritten in a novel way.Not only smaller models but also large base models that are not yet instruction-tuned perform worse than children, highlighting the importance of RLHF for theory of mind abilities, also attested in other papers [27].Ma et al. [23] introduce preliminary situated benchmarks, in which LLMs are agents interacting with humans from whom they have to infer the mental states.Verma et al. [28] analyze LLMs' theory of mind capabilities specifically in the context of HRI, having the models judge the interpretability of robot behavior.Similar to the theory of mind tasks, Zhang and Soh [14] use LLMs to model human trust and appropriateness in HRI scenarios, finding shortcomings in scenarios requiring spatial and numerical reasoning.</p>
<p>IV. METHOD</p>
<p>We take three existing HRI studies and recreate them with LLMs processing the original study stimuli.Thereby, we are able to compare the generated LLM responses to those of the original participants.Experiment 1 covers the topic of communication preferences (Section IV-A) [5].Experiment 2 covers the topic of perception of behavior (Section IV-B), specifically testing for the perception of desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness [6], [7].Experiment 2 includes two different studies using the same data format, which is why they are grouped together in one section.The studies we chose to recreate with LLMs are peer-reviewed, and the human preferences captured are substantiated by large sample sizes, with 186, 126, and 239 participants.</p>
<p>A. EXP. 1: COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES [5]</p>
<p>The first experiment we recreate with LLMs investigates how people want a robot to communicate in a variety of critical HRI situations.The original experiment [5] confronts participants with 16 HRI videos, for instance, videos of the robot making an error, being unable to fulfill a request, or violating a social norm.After watching a video, participants are asked how they would like the robot to continue the interaction.Possible answers are: to apologize, to explain why it did that, to say what is happening, to narrate what it will do next, to ask for help, or to continue without comment.</p>
<p>1) TEXT-ONLY INPUT: For the purpose of our experiment, we use texts from the original paper describing each video as input to the LLM.The rest of the prompt is modeled to be as similar as possible to the phrasing in the original questionnaire used.Thereby, we prevent overfitting the model's answers to our prompt.An example of a prompt for this experiment is:</p>
<p>The robot tries to grasp a box but fails to do so and throws it off the table.Given the described scenario, what should the robot do next?Provide a rating on a scale from 1 (Completely Disagree) to 5 (Completely Agree) for the following statement: "The robot should say what it is going to do next."Further examples of scenario descriptions can be found in Appendix A In the original experiment and our recreation, the action preferences are recorded using a Likert scale from 1 (completely disagree) to 5 (completely agree).For evaluation, the scores given by the original participants can be compared with those generated by the LLMs.</p>
<p>2) VIDEO INPUT: We include an extension using the original video stimuli instead of textual descriptions, results being presented in Section V-D.These video stimuli mirror more closely what human participants see as well as the type of input a robot would encounter during collaborations.For these VLM experiments, we leverage the original videos shown to participants and feed them to the GPT-4 vision variant.Each input consists of a set of video frames, extracted with a framerate of 0.33 frames per second, and audio transcriptions containing all phrases uttered by each party.Frames were downsampled from an original framerate of 30 frames per second.On average, each downsampled video processed by the VLM consisted of 8 (SD=3) frames.We manually verified that the portrayed situation was still understandable in each downsampled video.[6], [7] In this experiment by de Graaf and Malle [6], [7], participants are provided a list of behaviors that are acted out either by a human or a robot.People are then asked to judge how desirable, intentional, and surprising the behaviors are.The original results are presented in two papers.The first paper gives detailed ratings of behaviors that are judged similarly independent of whether humans or robots acted them out [6].The second paper provides detailed results of a set of behaviors judged differently by people depending on whether humans or robots acted them out [7].</p>
<p>B. EXP. 2: BEHAVIOR JUDGEMENT</p>
<p>For the prompts, we reuse the original behavior descriptions that were judged by the participants.Given that the concrete questions asking for desirability, intentionality, and surprisingness are not provided in the paper, we had to devise our own phrasing.We appended the phrasing "Only provide the score" as some models would, in rare cases, otherwise state that they could not answer the question.An example of a prompt for this experiment is:</p>
<p>A robot nurse is taking care of an ill young boy in a local hospital.It brings him a big present.How desirable do you rate the described behavior on an integer scale from -5 to 5? Only provide the score.Further examples of scenario descriptions can be found in Appendix B. For all behaviors, desirability and intentionality were judged on a scale from -5 to 5 and surprisingness on a scale from 0 to 7. As in our previous experiment, we can thus directly correlate the answers of the original participants with the answers generated by the LLMs.</p>
<p>The second paper [7] provides another set of behaviors and highlights how participants perceive the behavior differently depending on whether it is acted out by a human or a robot.The authors, therefore, provide the output scores as differences between those two conditions.For this second part of the experiment, we thus correlate the score differences.Given the original studies made use of a between-subject design, asking participants to judge behaviors only for one agent type (robot or human), we make the LLMs provide scores for robot and human behavior separately, item by item.</p>
<p>C. DATA SOURCE</p>
<p>The data for Experiment 1 was collected by us.Thus, we could ensure that the original paper and data of Experiment 1 were not yet available to the public while the LLM experiment was conducted.This ensures that no LLM has seen any parts of this data during training.For Experiment 2, one of the two original papers [7] presents the collected ratings in a table separate from the stimuli, making it unlikely to be memorizable even if the paper was included in the training corpus.Moreover, the numbers in that table are not the direct output of the participants (or, in our case, models) but are further transformed.The other paper for Experiment 2 [6] presents stimuli and ratings in a shared table.While still hard to parse, we include a set of rewritten stimuli in our experiments, testing whether the LLMs still achieve the same correlations.The rewritten stimuli keep the essence of the behavior descriptions while using different words.</p>
<p>D. PROMPTING</p>
<p>We always prompt an LLM with a single item from the original experiment and ask for a single output score.Generating the output for all items at once was shown to be impractical as the models then often get stuck repeating a single score for each item.The prompt formulations are kept as close as possible to those in the original experiments, with examples given in the following subsections.For GPT-3 base , we needed to append the phrase "I choose the score" to each prompt as it is not trained to follow instructions.Instead, if you just prompt the base model by saying "How would you rate...?", the model does not provide a score but generates further questions.When using LLaMA-2 Chat , we use the official prompt template that adds special tokens around the system prompt and instructions1 .The system prompt, which is available to all chat-type models, is set to "You are a participant in a research experiment.".</p>
<p>In general, the phrasing was kept as minimal as possible and was never engineered in a way to make the model give answers closer to those of human participants.In other words, the only goal of prompting was to elicit completions of the correct form (an integer on the respective scale) and not the correct content (same answer as human participants), which would have been a form of overfitting through manual prompt selection.Lastly, Section V-C showcases the effect of the advanced chain-of-thought prompting technique.</p>
<p>E. EVALUATION</p>
<p>For evaluating the similarity between human and model ratings, we use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r s [29].The coefficient can take values between -1 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect positive monotonous relationship between the two rating sets.Values inbetween can be interpreted as weak (&lt; |0.4|), moderate (≥ |0.4|) and strong (≥ |0.7|), based on values common in psychology literature [30].Statistical significance is indicated for p &lt; 0.05.Per experiment, we correct the false discovery rate (FDR) using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [31].</p>
<p>F. MODELS</p>
<p>We use some of the most recent open-and closed-source models available.Firstly, we choose the RLHF (chat) variants of LLaMA-2 with 13 billion and 70 billion parameters [10].Not only is it easier to make RLHF models follow input instructions, but they outperform their base variants on various tasks.Moreover, we choose GPT-4 (API identifier gpt-4-0613), GPT-3.5 (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613),and the GPT-3 base model (davinci-002) [11], [32].The GPT-3 base model is not trained with RLHF, contrasting the rest, all having undergone instruction-finetuning</p>

<p>G. TECHNICAL DETAILS</p>
<p>To make the results reproducible, we use a greedy sampling approach, always choosing the most likely next token.This is achieved by setting the temperature to 0 in the OpenAI API and the top k parameter to 1 with Hugging-Face.While the OpenAI API still suffers from some nondeterminism, we verified that the variance in answers is minimal and does not affect the overall results.</p>
<p>When using models through HuggingFace, we batch the input, thus reducing the overall inference time.To make batching possible, input prompts were padded to be the same size by adding padding tokens, [PAD], on the left side.</p>
<p>For our experiments, we used two A100s 40GB GPUs or ∼100 CPU cores, depending on availability on the CREATE cluster [33].We used ∼15$ via the OpenAI API.Code, data, and all LLM-generated outputs are available online2 .</p>
<p>V. RESULTS</p>
<p>A. RESULTS EXP. 1: COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES</p>
<p>In this experiment, models and participants were asked to judge how relevant possible follow-up actions are for a robot given a textual scenario description.As shown in Table I, answers most similar to those of humans are generated by GPT-4 (avg.correlation of 0.82), followed by GPT-3.5 (0.54), LLaMA-2-70b Chat (0.42), LLaMA-2-13b Chat (0.09), and GPT-3 (N/A).The base GPT-3 model always generates the same score independent of the scenario, so no correlation could be computed.GPT-4 is the only model for which all six correlations are statistically significant after correction, with the second-best model, GPT-3.5,only showing significance for three correlations.With GPT-4, correlations are strong for all action types (&gt; 0.7), besides for the option of the robot simply continuing without communicating (0.66).</p>
<p>Despite the strong correlations, certain patterns in the model's responses deviate from those observed in human responses.Across models, a bias exists towards giving more positive answers than people.This bias holds especially true regarding communication that provides simple facts or descriptions.When asked whether a robot should state what is going on or narrate its next actions, GPT-4 generates high ratings, usually a 4 or 5. Similarly to people, it thereby picks out situations where such information is very relevant (giving them a 5).However, the many situations rated similarly high (4) by the model are often only rated between 1 and 3 by people.On average, this leads to GPT-4 rating these two communicative acts 1.8 points higher on the scale.One of the core findings of the original paper was identifying which communicative acts, specifically explanations, are relevant in which type of situations.In Figure 2, we compare the distribution of participant answers with the average GPT-4 answer for each scenario type.We analyze the relationship for the two of the possible communicative acts whyexplanation and asking for help.Figure 2 makes three things visible: (1) The relative importance of a communicative act to each situation can be approximated.When ordered by appropriateness, each ranking of actions only contains one outlier.Namely, why-explanations are ranked too highly as a response to norm violations, and asking for help is ranked too highly as a response to suboptimal behavior.(2) The positivity bias mentioned beforehand is clearly visible.(3) The graph reminds us that LLMs only produce a single answer per stimulus, while a group of human participants produces a rich distribution of answers, with the potential for individual preference differences to arise -an issue we pick up again in Section VI.</p>
<p>B. RESULTS EXP. 2: BEHAVIOR JUDGMENT</p>
<p>In this experiment, models and participants judged how desirable, surprising, and intentional a given behavior was.Correlation results are presented in Table II.As before, GPT-4's answers achieve the highest correlations on average (0.83), followed by GPT-3.5 (0.66), LLaMA-2-70b Chat (0.65), LLaMA-2-13b Chat (0.42), and GPT-3 (-0.08).Furthermore, judgments of desirability are more aligned with human judgments than judgments of intentionality and surprisingness.Notably, LLaMA-2-13b Chat provides no answer to eight questions, and LLaMA-70b to one question, simply stating that judging the posed behavior is against ethical principles Fig. 3: Scatterplots comparing human with model ratings (e.g., with inputs such as "A security officer discovers a man breaking into the building.He grabs a gun and shoots the perpetrator.").For such instances, we imputed the models' median answer when computing correlations.Results with the rewritten stimuli, created to verify the models did not memorize the results, are in the same range, e.g., an average correlation of 0.81 with GPT-4.</p>
<p>Manually inspecting the resulting scatterplots in Figure 3 of human and model answers, it becomes clear that GPT-4 is much less affected by strong outliers in judgment compared to its predecessor GPT-3.5.While GPT-3.5's ratings are more than five scale points apart for people's answers in seven cases, discrepancies higher than five are not present in GPT-4's answers.For GPT-4, some of the remaining differences stem from tending to use the extreme ends of the scale.The model rates behavior as a 7 (very surprising) in instances where people, on average, only showed some surprise.Moreover, it is more prone to see robot behavior as desirable, which was seen ambiguously by human participants, giving 1.3 scale points more on average.For GPT-4, this positivity bias is strongest for desirability ratings.For all other, weaker models, the bias is strongest for surprisingness ratings.Such inflated LLM desirability ratings can be, for instance, observed with the items "A robot is opening the door to enter the apartment building.It knocks out a fleeing burglar who was arrested shortly thereafter."or "A robot tutor is grading final exams.It gives a student an A, which makes her pass the semester."</p>
<p>In the second part of the experiment, de Graaf and Malle [7] provided evidence that human participants judged behavior differently depending on whether a person or a robot performs them.Interestingly, we can see that even the largest LLMs do not capture these intuitions well.GPT-4 achieves a moderate correlation (0.64) for intentionality but very low correlations for desirability (0.20) and surprisingness (0.03).This is because LLMs tend to give the same score to behavior independent of who performed it, while people seem to differentiate between robot and human actors.
Experiment Construct LLaMA-2 GPT Avg.
13b-chat 70b-chat GPT-3 base GPT-3.Chain-of-thought prompting is a technique in which models are steered toward generating reasons before presenting the final answer.Originally demonstrated in a few-shot setting [34], it has been adopted to zero-shot settings with base models [35] and instruction-tuned models [36].While it leads to better answers in many settings, this is not always the case, especially with instruction-tuned models.</p>
<p>We conducted additional tests with the best-performing model from each experiment (GPT-4) to see if correlations would improve given a chain-of-thought prompt.Based on the literature, we appended the phrase "Let's think stepby-step."to each input prompt and recomputed the answers.Across the three experiments, the average correlations slightly decrease: -0.15 for Experiment 1, -0.12 for the first part of Experiment 2, and -0.24 for the second part.For Experiment 1, we find that GPT-4 only sometimes generates a step-by-step plan; other times, it generates no reasoning chain at all or presents the reasoning after presenting the score.Given this issue, we additionally adapted the system message to steer the model towards generating an explanation before giving the answer.With the system prompt, "You are a participant in a research experiment.You have to provide reasons before arriving at a final integer score.", the model outputs reasons before providing an answer; however, the final performance is still worse than without using chain-ofthought prompting (-0.15).</p>
<p>Our findings align with previous comparisons of chain-ofthought prompting on instruction-tuned models, which show that it does not necessarily lead to improvement in all types of use cases, sometimes even to degradation in performance, e.g., in two commonsense reasoning benchmarks [36].</p>
<p>D. RESULTS: VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS</p>
<p>So far, all experiments used textual scenario descriptions as model input.In this section, we rerun Experiment 1; however, with multimodal vision and text input, as exemplified in Figure 4.Not only is the multimodal input closer to that experienced by human participants, but it is also more similar to what a robot will perceive in an actual interaction.</p>
<p>As an initial experiment, we test whether GPT-4 with vision correctly parses the videos and understands their content by generating descriptions of each situation.Simply understanding what happens in each video is a prerequisite for correctly assessing the value of different communicative acts.Manually analyzing the generated descriptions, we find that GPT-4 with vision correctly parses 50% of the videos.Among the correctly parsed situations are multiple ones primarily relying on dialogue as well videos relying on physical actions, for example, the robot knocking something over while trying to grasp it or the robot encountering an outof-order sign.Moreover, the VLM also notes certain social cues, such as the user smiling in response to a successfully told joke.On the other hand, the VLM misinterprets multiple videos.Among others, when processing videos of suboptimal joint movements or pathfinding, the model simply notes the success at the end but does not mention the inefficiency of the solution.Furthermore, it fails to connect the dialogue to more static videos, claiming they are unrelated.Moreover, it misses the social norm violation of the robot forcing people to step out of its way when driving too closely to them; and it interprets the image of an empty box as a successful grasp instead of encountering a missing item.</p>
<p>In a second step, we prompt the VLM to judge the appropriateness of various communicative acts to each situation portrayed by video and dialogue, i.e., the same prompts as in Experiment 1 but replacing the textual descriptions with video frames and dialogue transcripts.Results show that it is much harder for language models to judge what communication is appropriate when given the actual videos instead of textual summaries.In the video condition, the model's and participants' answers are only correlated with an average Spearman coefficient of 0.57, similar to GPT-3.5 but far from GPT-4 in the text-only condition.</p>
<p>VI. DISCUSSION</p>
<p>We repeated three social HRI studies [5], [6], [7] with LLMs, probing their encoded "intuitions" about communication norms and behavior judgment.We find that GPT-4 does well at judging the appropriateness of different communicative acts (e.g., when to explain or apologize) given an HRI scenario and at judging the intentionality, surprisingness, and desirability of behavior from textual descriptions.In line with previous research on related topics, we find GPT-4 to strongly outperform other tested LLMs [19], [24], [26].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even GPT-4 still fails concerning many elements of social perception.Firstly, its performance starkly decreases when presented with more realistic, video-based input.For a robot to correctly assess a real social situation, it is presupposed that it can correctly infer what the situation is from its environment input.However, as seen with the VLM results in Section V-D, GPT-4 vision fails to describe what happens in half of the videos and subsequently has issues judging what constitutes appropriate communication.Secondly, all LLMs, including GPT-4, have issues evaluating a behavior depending on who carried it out, a robot or a human -thus failing to align with human judgments.Thirdly, all LLMs tend to rate questionnaire items more positively than people, especially overvaluing some forms of communication and behavior desirability ratings.Lastly, chain-of-thought reasoning did not lead to more aligned answers.This failure of chain-of-thought reasoning might be explained by the fact that the questions addressed by our studies do not have a clear-cut right or wrong answer that can be reached with purely logical reasoning.Whether or not a scenario should be judged with a 3 or a 5 on a Likert scale can depend on personal preferences and intuition, unlike the answer to a mathematical puzzle, in which a technique like chain-of-thought prompting can prove beneficial.</p>
<p>These issues, alongside known problems such as biased, hard-to-verify, or hallucinated answers and shortcomings regarding spatial and mathematical reasoning, pose fundamental challenges to deploying LLMs and VLMs in HRI.</p>
<p>A. LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>In our experiments, we only consider the most likely answer given by each model.This further reinforces the tendency in statistics to consider only averages.Alternatively, one could investigate the LLMs' probability distribution across valid answers.Retrieving such a distribution of answers from an LLM is possible by inspecting the logprobabilities for each valid answer, i.e., each token that corresponds to a number available on the Likert scale.However, such an approach ignores answers in which the model forms a whole sentence as a response, arbitrary in length and structure.In addition, the GPT API only gives limited access to log-probabilities when using chat-type models.Another alternative is to sample multiple outputs by increasing the temperature.Overall, best practices around retrieving model answers are still emerging.In our previous research, we found that averaging based on log-probabilities only affected the final results in a minor way [19].Alternatively, Aher et al. [17] suggest simulating a population sample by creating multiple personas, varied in gender or race, which are then supplemented as part of the LLM input.</p>
<p>Another limitation is that the LLMs were presented with only one scenario and one construct at a time.Thus, models cannot rate scenarios or constructs relative to each othera strategy a human participant is likely to adopt.However, when querying current models to answer a large amount questions at once, we observed worse answers, with the model often getting stuck in a loop of repeating the same answer.Future research should further analyze how different prompts influence model answers, e.g., through rephrasings or varying numbers of situations and constructs presented.</p>
<p>VII. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>LLMs are increasingly used to control robot behavior.To understand whether LLMs align with people's judgment about communication and behavior in HRI, we reproduced three user studies.In two cases, GPT-4's answers highly correlate with people's answers, with other models performing decisively worse.However, for a study focused on assigning different ratings towards a behavior depending on whether it was executed by a human or a robot, nearly all correlations between model and participant answers are low and not statistically significant.Analyzing further differences, we show that LLMs overvalue certain types of communication and rate some actions as more desirable than people.For robots to make such judgments in the real world, they would need to rely on their audio-visual perception of what happened.However, VLMs given dialogue transcriptions and video input underperform compared to their text-only counterpart, not even correctly describing half of the videos.</p>
<p>In future work, we plan to deploy LLM-controlled agents in simulated collaborative environments, where they can encounter social situations as presented by the studies here but also receive feedback for their selected actions -thus contributing to the effort of creating benchmarks that evaluate LLMs' social capabilities in real human-agent interactions.</p>
