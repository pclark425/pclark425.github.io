                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Self-Refine is introduced, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement that demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test time using this simple, standalone approach.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Like humans, large language models (LLMs) do not always generate the best output on their first try. Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider. We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on average in task performance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test time using our simple, standalone approach.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Like humans, large language models (LLMs) do not always generate the best output on their first try. Motivated by how humans refine their written text, we introduce SELF-REFINE, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an initial output using an LLM; then, the same LLM provides feedback for its output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. SELF-REFINE does not require any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning, and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner and the feedback provider. We evaluate SELF-REFINE across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with SELF-REFINE are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by $\sim 20 \%$ absolute on average in task performance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test-time using our simple, standalone approach. ${ }^{1}$.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Although large language models (LLMs) can generate coherent outputs, they often fall short in addressing intricate requirements. This mostly includes tasks with multifaceted objectives, such as dialogue response generation, or tasks with hard-to-define goals, such as enhancing program readability. In these scenarios, modern LLMs may produce an intelligible initial output, yet may benefit from further iterative refinement-i.e., iteratively mapping a candidate output to an improved one-to ensure that the desired quality is achieved. Iterative refinement typically involves training a refinement model that relies on domain-specific data (e.g., Reid and Neubig (2022); Schick et al. (2022a); Welleck et al. (2022)). Other approaches that rely on external supervision or reward models require large training sets or expensive human annotations (Madaan et al., 2021; Ouyang et al., 2022), which may not always be feasible to obtain. These limitations underscore the need for an effective refinement approach that can be applied to various tasks without requiring extensive supervision.</p>
<p>Iterative self-refinement is a fundamental characteristic of human problem-solving (Simon, 1962; Flower and Hayes, 1981; Amabile, 1983). Iterative self-refinement is a process that involves creating an initial draft and subsequently refining it based on self-provided feedback. For example, when</p>

<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Given an input (⓪), SELF-REFINE starts by generating an output and passing it back to the same model $\mathcal{M}$ to get feedback (⓫). The feedback is passed back to $\mathcal{M}$, which refines the previously generated output (⓵). Steps (⓶) and (⓷) iterate until a stopping condition is met. SELF-REFINE is instantiated with a language model such as GPT-3.5 and does not involve human assistance.
drafting an email to request a document from a colleague, an individual may initially write a direct request such as "Send me the data ASAP". Upon reflection, however, the writer recognizes the potential impoliteness of the phrasing and revises it to "Hi Ashley, could you please send me the data at your earliest convenience?". When writing code, a programmer may implement an initial "quick and dirty" implementation, and then, upon reflection, refactor their code to a solution that is more efficient and readable. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can provide iterative self-refinement without additional training, leading to higher-quality outputs on a wide range of tasks.
We present SELF-REFINE: an iterative self-refinement algorithm that alternates between two generative steps-FEEDBACK and REFINE. These steps work in tandem to generate high-quality outputs. Given an initial output generated by a model $\mathcal{M}$, we pass it back to the same model $\mathcal{M}$ to get feedback. Then, the feedback is passed back to the same model to refine the previously-generated draft. This process is repeated either for a specified number of iterations or until $\mathcal{M}$ determines that no further refinement is necessary. We use few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) to guide $\mathcal{M}$ to both generate feedback and incorporate the feedback into an improved draft. Figure 1 illustrates the high-level idea, that SELF-REFINE uses the same underlying language model to generate feedback and refine its outputs.
We evaluate SELF-REFINE on 7 generation tasks that span diverse domains, including natural language and source-code generation. We show that SELF-REFINE outperforms direct generation from strong LLMs like GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo; OpenAI; Ouyang et al., 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) by 5-40\% absolute improvement. In code-generation tasks, SELF-REFINE improves the initial generation by up to absolute $13 \%$ when applied to strong code models such as Codex (code-davinci-002; Chen et al., 2021). We release all of our code, which is easily extensible to other LLMs. In essence, our results show that even when an LLM cannot generate an optimal output on its first try, the LLM can often provide useful feedback and improve its own output accordingly. In turn, SELF-REFINE provides an effective way to obtain better outputs from a single model without any additional training, via iterative (self-)feedback and refinement.</p>
<h1>2 Iterative Refinement with SELF-REFINE</h1>
<p>Given an input sequence, SELF-REFINE generates an initial output, provides feedback on the output, and refines the output according to the feedback. SELF-REFINE iterates between feedback and refinement until a desired condition is met. SELF-REFINE relies on a suitable language model and three prompts (for initial generation, feedback, and refinement), and does not require training. SELF-REFINE is shown in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1. Next, we describe SELF-REFINE in more detail.</p>
<p>Initial generation Given an input $x$, prompt $p_{\text {gen }}$, and model $\mathcal{M}$, SELF-REFINE generates an initial output $y_{0}$ :</p>
<p>$$
y_{0}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\text {gen }} | x\right)
$$</p>
<p>(a) Dialogue: $x, \mathbf{y}<em _mathbf_t="\mathbf{t">{\mathbf{t}}$
(b) FEEDBACK fb
(c) REFINE $\mathbf{y}</em>$
}+1<img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Examples of SELF-REFINE: an initial output $\square$ generated by the base LLM and then passed back to the same LLM to receive feedback $\square$ to the same LLM to refine the output $\square$. The top row illustrates this for dialog generation where an initial dialogue response can be transformed into a more engaging one that also understands the user by applying feedback. The bottom row illustrates this for code optimization where the code is made more efficient by applying feedback.</p>
<p>Algorithm 1 SELF-REFINE algorithm
Require: input $x$, model $\mathcal{M}$, prompts $\left{p_{\text {gen }}, p_{\text {fb }}, p_{\text {refine }}\right}$, stop condition stop $(-)$
$1: y_{0}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\text {gen }} | x\right) \quad \triangleright$ Initial generation (Eqn. 1)
2: for iteration $\mathrm{t} \in 0,1, \ldots$ do
3: $\quad f b_{t}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\mathrm{fb}} | x | y_{t}\right) \quad \triangleright$ Feedback (Eqn. 2)
4: if $\operatorname{stop}\left(f b_{t}, t\right)$ then $\triangleright$ Stop condition
5: break
6: else
7: $\quad y_{t+1}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\text {refine }} | x | y_{0} | f b_{0} | \ldots | y_{t} | f b_{t}\right) \quad \triangleright$ Refine (Eqn. 4)
8: end if
9: end for
10: return $y_{t}$</p>
<p>Figure 3: The SELF-REFINE algorithm. See (§2) for a discussion of each component.</p>
<p>For example, in Figure 2(d), the model generates functionally correct code for the given input. Here, $p_{\text {gen }}$ is a task-specific few-shot prompt (or instruction) for an initial generation, and $|$ denotes concatenation. The few-shot prompt contains input-output pairs $\left\langle x^{(k)}, y^{(k)}\right\rangle$ for the task. ${ }^{2}$</p>
<p>FEEDBACK Next, SELF-REFINE uses the same model $\mathcal{M}$ to provide feedback $f b_{t}$ on its own output, given a task-specific prompt $p_{\mathrm{fb}}$ for generating feedback:</p>
<p>$$
f b_{t}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\mathrm{fb}} | x | y_{t}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Intuitively, the feedback may address multiple aspects of the output. For example, in code optimization, the feedback might address the efficiency, readability, and overall quality of the code.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Here, the prompt $p_{\mathrm{fh}}$ provides examples of feedback in the form of input-output-feedback triples $\left\langle x^{(k)}, y^{(k)}, f b^{(k)}\right\rangle$. We prompt the model to write feedback that is actionable and specific via $f b^{(k)}$. By 'actionable', we mean the feedback should contain a concrete action that would likely improve the output. By 'specific', we mean the feedback should identify concrete phrases in the output to change. For example, the feedback in Figure 2(e) is "This code is slow as it uses a for loop which is brute force. A better approach is to use the formula ... $(\boldsymbol{n}(\boldsymbol{n}+\mathbf{1})) / 2$ ". This feedback is actionable, since it suggests the action 'use the formula...'. The feedback is specific since it mentions the 'for loop'.</p>
<p>REFINE Next, SElf-REFINE uses $\mathcal{M}$ to refine its most recent output, given its own feedback:</p>
<p>$$
y_{t+1}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\text {refine }} | x | y_{t} | f b_{t}\right)
$$</p>
<p>For example, in Figure 2(f), given the initial output and the generated feedback, the model generates a re-implementation that is shorter and runs much faster than the initial implementation. The prompt $p_{\text {refine }}$ provides examples of improving the output based on the feedback, in the form of input-output-feedback-refined quadruples $\left\langle x^{(k)}, y_{t}^{(k)}, f b_{t}^{(k)}, y_{t+1}^{(k)}\right\rangle$.
Iterating Self-Refine Self-Refine alternates between FEEDBACK and REFINE steps until a stopping condition is met. The stopping condition $\operatorname{stop}\left(f b_{t}, t\right)$ either stops at a specified timestep $t$, or extracts a stopping indicator (e.g. a scalar stop score) from the feedback. In practice, the model can be prompted to generate a stopping indicator in $p_{\mathrm{fh}}$, and the condition is determined per-task.</p>
<p>To inform the model about the previous iterations, we retain the history of previous feedback and outputs by appending them to the prompt. Intuitively, this allows the model to learn from past mistakes and avoid repeating them. More precisely, Equation (3) is in fact instantiated as:</p>
<p>$$
y_{t+1}=\mathcal{M}\left(p_{\text {refine }} | x | y_{0} | f b_{0} | \ldots | y_{t} | f b_{t}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Finally, we use the last refinement $y_{t}$ as the output of SElf-REFINE.
Algorithm 1 summarizes SElf-REFINE, and Figure 2 shows an example of SElf-REFINE in the Dialogue Response Generation (Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020) and Code Optimization (Madaan et al., 2023) tasks. Appendix S provides examples of the $p_{\text {gen }}, p_{\mathrm{fh}}, p_{\text {refine }}$ prompts for various tasks. The key idea is that SELF-REFINE uses the same underlying LLM to generate, get feedback, and refine its outputs given its own feedback. It relies only on supervision present in the few-shot examples.</p>
<h1>3 Evaluation</h1>
<p>We evaluate SELF-REFINE on 7 diverse tasks: Dialogue Response Generation (Appendix M; Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020), Code Optimization (Appendix N; Madaan et al., 2023), Code Readability Improvement (Appendix L; Puri et al., 2021), Math Reasoning (Appendix O; Cobbe et al., 2021), Sentiment Reversal (Appendix P; Zhang et al., 2015), and we introduce two new tasks: Acronym Generation (Appendix Q) and Constrained Generation (a harder version of Lin et al. (2020) with 20-30 keyword constraints instead of 3-5; Appendix R)
Examples for all tasks and dataset statistics are provided in Table 4 (Appendix A).</p>
<h3>3.1 Instantiating SELF-REFINE</h3>
<p>We instantiate SELF-REFINE following the high-level description in Section 2. The FEEDBACKREFINE iterations continue until the desired output quality or task-specific criterion is reached, up to a maximum of 4 iterations. To make our evaluation consistent across different models, we implemented both FEEDBACK and REFINE as few-shot prompts even with models that respond well to instructions, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4.</p>
<p>Base LLMs Our main goal is to evaluate whether we can improve the performance of any strong base LLMs using SELF-REFINE. Therefore, we compare SELF-REFINE to the same base LLMs but without feedback-refine iterations. We used three main strong base LLM across all tasks: GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003), ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). For code-based tasks, we also experimented with CODEX (code-davinci-002). In all tasks, either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 is the previous state-of-the-art. ${ }^{3}$ We used the same prompts from previous work when</p>

available (such as for Code Optimization and Math Reasoning); otherwise, we created prompts as detailed in Appendix S. We use greedy decoding with a temperature of 0.7 for all setups.</p>
<h1>3.2 Metrics</h1>
<p>We report three types of metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task specific metric: When available, we use automated metrics from prior work (Math Reasoning: $\%$ solve rate; Code Optimization: \% programs optimized; Constrained Gen: coverage \%)</li>
<li>Human-pref: In Dialogue Response Generation, Code Readability Improvement, Sentiment Reversal, and Acronym Generation, since no automated metrics are available, we perform a blind human A/B evaluation on a subset of the outputs to select the preferred output. Additional details are provided in Appendix C.</li>
<li>GPT-4-pref: In addition to human-pref, we use GPT-4 as a proxy for human preference following prior work (Fu et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023; Geng et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023), and found high correlation ( $82 \%$ for Sentiment Reversal, $68 \%$ for Acronym Generation, and $71 \%$ for Dialogue Response Generation) with human-pref. For Code Readability Improvement, we prompt GPT4 to calculate fraction of the variables that are appropriately named given the context (e.g., $\mathrm{x}=[] \rightarrow$ input_buffer $=[]$ ). Additional details are provided in Appendix D.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3 Results</h3>

For example, GPT-4+SELF-REFINE improves over the base GPT-4 by $8.7 \%$ (absolute) in Code Optimization, increasing optimization percentage from $27.3 \%$ to $36.0 \%$. Confidence intervals are provided in Appendix J. For code-based tasks, we found similar trends when using CODEX; those results are included in Appendix F.</p>
<p>One of the tasks in which we observe the highest gains compared to the base models is Constrained Generation, where the model is asked to generate a sentence containing up to 30 given concepts. We believe that this task benefits significantly from SELF-REFINE because there are more opportunities to miss some of the concepts on the first attempt, and thus SELF-REFINE allows the model to fix these mistakes subsequently. Further, this task has an extremely large number of reasonable outputs, and thus SELF-REFINE allows to better explore the space of possible outputs.</p>
<p>In preference-based tasks such as Dialogue Response Generation, Sentiment Reversal, and Acronym Generation, SELF-REFINE leads to especially high gains. For example in Dialogue Response Generation, GPT-4 preference score improve by $49.2 \%$ - from $25.4 \%$ to $74.6 \%$. Similarly, we see remarkable improvements in the other preference-based tasks across all models.</p>
<p>The modest performance gains in Math Reasoning can be traced back to the inability to accurately identify whether there is any error. In math, errors can be nuanced and sometimes limited to a single line or incorrect operation. Besides, a consistent-looking reasoning chain can deceive LLMs to</p>
<p>think that "everything looks good" (e.g., ChatGPT feedback for 94\% instances is 'everything looks good'). In Appendix H.1, we show that the gains with SELF-REFINE on Math Reasoning are much bigger (5\%+) if an external source can identify if the current math answer is incorrect.</p>
<p>Improvement is consistent across base LLMs sizes Generally, GPT-4+SELF-REFINE performs better than GPT-3.5+SELF-REFINE and ChatGPT+SELF-REFINE across all tasks, even in tasks where the initial base results of GPT-4 were lower than GPT-3.5 or ChatGPT. We thus believe that SELF-REFINE allows stronger models (such as GPT-4) to unlock their full potential, even in cases where this potential is not expressed in the standard, single-pass, output generation. Comparison to additional strong baselines is provided in Appendix F.</p>
<h1>4 Analysis</h1>
<p>The three main steps of SELF-REFINE are FEEDBACK, REFINE, and repeating them iteratively. In this section, we perform additional experiments to analyze the importance of each of these steps.</p>

<p>Table 2: Prompting to generate generic feedback (or having the model generate no feedback at all) leads to reduced scores, indicating the importance of the FEEDBACK step of SELF-REFINE. These experiments were performed with ChatGPT (Code Optimization and Sentiment Reversal) and GPT-3.5 (Acronym Generation), and metrics used are defined in Section 3.2.</p>
<p>The impact of the feedback quality Feedback quality plays a crucial role in SELF-REFINE. To quantify its impact, we compare SELF-REFINE, which utilizes specific, actionable feedback, with two ablations: one using generic feedback and another without feedback (the model may still iteratively refine its generations, but is not explicitly provided feedback to do so). For example, in the Code Optimization task: actionable feedback, such as Avoid repeated calculations in the for loop, pinpoints an issue and suggests a clear improvement. Generic feedback, like Improve the efficiency of the code, lacks this precision and direction. Table 2 shows feedback's clear influence.</p>
<p>In Code Optimization, performance slightly dips from 27.5 (SELF-REFINE feedback) to 26.0 (generic feedback), and further to 24.8 (no feedback). This suggests that while generic feedback offers some guidance - specific, actionable feedback yields superior results.</p>
<p>This effect is more pronounced in tasks like Sentiment Transfer, where changing from our feedback to generic feedback leads to a significant performance drop (43.2 to 31.2), and the task fails without feedback. Similarly, in Acronym Generation, without actionable feedback, performance drops from 56.4 to 48.0 , even with iterative refinements. These results highlight the importance of specific, actionable feedback in our approach. Even generic feedback provides some benefit, but the best results are achieved with targeted, constructive feedback.</p>
<p>How important are the multiple iterations of FEEDBACK-REFINE? Figure 4 demonstrates that on average, the quality of the output improves as the number of iterations increases. For instance, in the Code Optimization task, the initial output $\left(y_{0}\right)$ has a score of 22.0 , which improves to 28.8 after three iterations $\left(y_{3}\right)$. Similarly, in the Sentiment Reversal task, the initial output has a score of 33.9, which increases to 36.8 after three iterations. This trend of improvement is also evident in Constrained Generation, where the score increases from 29.0 to 49.7 after three iterations. Figure 4 highlights the diminishing returns in the improvement as the number of iterations increases. Overall, having multiple FEEDBACK-REFINE iterations significantly enhances the quality of the output, although the marginal improvement naturally decreases with more iterations.</p>
<p>The performance may not always monotonically increase with iterations: in multi-aspect feedback tasks like Acronym Generation, where the output quality can vary during iteration with improvement in one aspect but decline in another aspect. To counter this, SELF-REFINE generates numerical scores for different quality aspects, leading to a balanced evaluation and appropriate output selection.</p>

<p>Figure 5: Comparison of code generated by Madaan et al. (2023) (left) and the output after applying SELF-REFINE (right). The initial code by the baseline, which is nearly identical to the slower input program, fails to improve the efficiency and merely alters the logic for reading input. SELF-REFINE first generates feedback that diagnoses that This code is slow because it is using six nested loops to iterate through all possible combinations of coins to pay the amount, and suggests that a more efficient approach would be .... SELF-REFINE then uses this feedback to generate the revised code (right), reducing the time complexity to $\mathcal{O}($ amount $*$ coins $)$. The full example is provided in Appendix H</p>
<p>Can we just generate multiple outputs instead of refining? Does SELF-REFINE improve because of the iterative refinement, or just because it generates more outputs? We compare SELF-REFINE with ChatGPT, when ChatGPT generates $k=4$ samples (but without feedback and refinement). Then, we compare the performance of SELF-REFINE against these $k$ initial outputs in a 1 vs. $k$ evaluation. In other words, we assess whether SELF-REFINE can outperform all $k$ initial outputs. The results of this experiment are illustrated in Figure 6 (Appendix H). Despite the increased difficulty of the 1 vs. $k$ setting, the outputs of SELF-REFINE are still preferred by humans over all $k$ initial outputs. This shows the importance of refinement according to feedback over the alternative of just generating multiple initial outputs.</p>
<p>Does SELF-REFINE work with weaker models? The experiments in Section 3.3 were performed with some of the strongest available models; does SELF-REFINE work with smaller or weaker models as well? To investigate this, we instantiated SELF-REFINE with Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023), a</p>
<p>less powerful base model. While Vicuna-13B is capable of generating initial outputs, it struggles significantly with the refinement process. Specifically, Vicuna-13B was not able to consistently generate the feedback in the required format. Furthermore, even when provided with Oracle or hard-coded feedback, it often failed to adhere to the prompts for refinement. Instead of refining its output, Vicuna-13B either repeated the same output or generated a hallucinated conversation, rendering the outputs less effective. We thus hypothesize that since Vicuna-13B was trained on conversations, it does not generalize as well as instruction-based models to test-time few-shot tasks. Example output and analysis is provided in Appendix G.</p>
<p>Qualitative Analysis We conduct a qualitative analysis of the feedback generated by SELF-REFINE and its subsequent refinements. We manually analyze 70 samples in total ( 35 success cases and 35 failure cases) for Code Optimization (Madaan et al., 2023) and Math Reasoning (Cobbe et al., 2021). For both Math Reasoning and Code Optimization, we found that the feedback was predominantly actionable, with the majority identifying problematic aspects of the original generation and suggesting ways to rectify them.
When SELF-REFINE failed to improve the original generation, the majority of issues were due to erroneous feedback rather than faulty refinements. Specifically, $33 \%$ of unsuccessful cases were due to feedback inaccurately pinpointing the error's location, while $61 \%$ were a result of feedback suggesting an inappropriate fix. Only $6 \%$ of failures were due to the refiner incorrectly implementing good feedback. These observations highlight the vital role of accurate feedback plays in SELF-REFINE.
In successful cases, the refiner was guided by accurate and useful feedback to make precise fixes to the original generation in $61 \%$ of the cases. Interestingly, the refiner was capable of rectifying issues even when the feedback was partially incorrect, which was the situation in $33 \%$ of successful cases. This suggests resilience to sub-optimal feedback. Future research could focus on examining the refiner's robustness to various types of feedback errors and exploring ways to enhance this resilience. In Figure 5, we illustrate how SELF-REFINE significantly improves program efficiency by transforming a brute force approach into a dynamic programming solution, as a result of insightful feedback. Additional analysis on other datasets such as Dialogue Response Generation is provided in Appendix H.</p>
<p>Going Beyond Benchmarks While our evaluation focuses on benchmark tasks, SELF-REFINE is designed with broader applicability in mind. We explore this in a real-world use case of website generation, where the user provides a high-level goal and SELF-REFINE assists in iteratively developing the website. Starting from a rudimentary initial design, SELF-REFINE refines HTML, CSS, and JS to evolve the website in terms of both usability and aesthetics. This demonstrates the potential of SELF-REFINE in real-world, complex, and creative tasks. See Appendix I for examples and further discussion, including broader, societal impact of our work.</p>
<h1>5 Related work</h1>
<p>Leveraging human- and machine-generated natural language (NL) feedback for refining outputs has been effective for a variety of tasks, including summarization (Scheurer et al., 2022), script generation (Tandon et al., 2021), program synthesis (Le et al., 2022a; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020), and other tasks (Bai et al., 2022a; Schick et al., 2022b; Saunders et al., 2022a; Bai et al., 2022b; Welleck et al., 2022). Refinement methods differ in the source and format of feedback, and the way that a refiner is obtained. Table 3 summarizes some related approaches; see Appendix B for an additional discussion.</p>
<p>Source of feedback. Humans have been an effective source of feedback (Tandon et al., 2021; Elgohary et al., 2021; Tandon et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a). Since human feedback is costly, several approaches use a scalar reward function as a surrogate of (or alternative to) human feedback (e.g., (Bai et al., 2022a; Liu et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022a; Welleck et al., 2022)). Alternative sources such as compilers (Yasunaga and Liang, 2020) or Wikipedia edits (Schick et al., 2022b) can provide domain-specific feedback. Recently, LLMs have been used to generate feedback for general domains (Fu et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2022), However, ours is the only method that generates feedback using an LLM on its own output, for the purpose of refining with the same LLM.</p>
<p>Representation of feedback. The form of feedback can be generally divided into natural language (NL) and non-NL feedback. Non-NL feedback can come in human-provided example pairs (Dasgupta</p>

et al., 2019) or scalar rewards (Liu et al., 2022; Le et al., 2022b). In this work, we use NL feedback, since this allows the model to easily provide self-feedback using the same LM that generated the output, while leveraging existing pretrained LLMs such as GPT-4.</p>
<p>Types of refiners. Pairs of feedback and refinement have been used to learn supervised refiners (Schick et al., 2022b; Du et al., 2022; Yasunaga and Liang, 2020; Madaan et al., 2021). Since gathering supervised data is costly, some methods learn refiners using model generations (Welleck et al., 2022; Peng et al., 2023). However, the refiners are trained for each new domain. Finally, (Yang et al., 2022) use prompted feedback and refinement specifically tailored for story generation. In this work, we avoid training a separate refiner, and show that the same model can be used as both the refiner and the source of feedback across multiple domains.</p>
<p>Non-refinement reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Rather than having explicit refinement, an alternative way to incorporate feedback is by optimizing a scalar reward function, e.g. with reinforcement learning (e.g., Stiennon et al. (2020); Lu et al. (2022); Le et al. (2022a)). These methods differ from SELF-REFINE in that the model does not access feedback on an intermediate generation. Second, these RL methods require updating the model's parameters, unlike SELF-REFINE.</p>
<h1>6 Limitations and Discussion</h1>
<p>The main limitation of our approach is that the base models need to have sufficient few-shot modeling or instruction-following abilities, in order to learn to provide feedback and to refine in an in-context fashion, without having to train supervised models and rely on supervised data.
Further, the experiments in this work were performed with language models that are not open-sourced, namely GPT-3.5, ChatGPT, GPT-4, and CODEX. Existing literature (Ouyang et al., 2022) does not fully describe the details of these models, such as the pretraining corpus, model sizes, and model biases. Further, these models are not free to use, and using them for research requires some funding. Nonetheless, we release our code and model outputs to ensure the reproducibility of our work.
Another limitation of our work is that we exclusively experiment with datasets in English. In other languages, the current models may not provide the same benefits.
Finally, there is a possibility for bad actors to use prompting techniques to steer a model to generate more toxic or harmful text. Our approach does not explicitly guard against this.</p>
<h2>7 Conclusion</h2>
<p>We present SELF-REFINE: a novel approach that allows large language models to iteratively provide self-feedback and refine their own outputs. SELF-REFINE operates within a single LLM, requiring neither additional training data nor reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the simplicity and ease of use of SELF-REFINE across a wide variety of tasks. By showcasing the potential of SELF-REFINE in diverse tasks, our research contributes to the ongoing exploration and development of large language models, with the aim of reducing the cost of human creative processes in real-world settings. We</p>
<p>hope that our iterative approach will help drive further research in this area. To this end, we make all our code, data and prompts anonymously available at https://selfrefine.info/.</p>

<p>Table 4: An overview of the tasks which we evaluate SELF-REFINE on, along with their associated datasets and sizes. For every task, we demonstrate a single iteration of refinement of input $x$, the previously generated output $y_{t}$, the feedback generated $f b_{t}$, and the refinement $y_{t+1}$. Few-shot prompts used for FEEDBACK and REFINE are provided in Appendix S.</p>
<h1>B Broader Related Work</h1>
<p>Compared to a concurrent work, Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), our approach involves correction using feedback, whereas their setup involves finding the next best solution in planning using ReAct. While ReAct and Reflexion provide a free-form reflection on whether a step was executed correctly and potential improvements, our approach is more granular and structured, with multi-dimensional feedback and scores. This distinction allows our method to offer more precise and actionable feedback, making it suitable for a wider range of natural language generation tasks, including those that may not necessarily involve step-by-step planning such as open-ended dialogue generation.</p>
<p>Comparison with Welleck et al. (2022) The closest work to ours may be Self-Correction (Welleck et al., 2022); however, Self-Correction has several disadvantages compared to SELF-REFINE:</p>
<ol>
<li>Self-Correction does not train their model to generate explicit feedback; instead, Welleck et al. (2022) trained their models to refine only. As we show in Section 4 and Table 2, having the model generate explicit feedback results in significantly better refined outputs.</li>
<li>Self-Correction trains a separate refiner (or "corrector") for each task. In contrast, SELFREFINE uses instructions and few-shot prompting, and thus does not require training a separate refiner for each task.</li>
<li>Empirically, we evaluated SELF-REFINE using the same base model of GPT-3 as SelfCorrection, and with the same settings on the GSM8K benchmark. Self-Correction achieved $45.9 \%$ accuracy while SELF-REFINE (this work) achieved $\mathbf{5 5 . 7 \%}$ ( $\mathbf{1 9 . 8}$ ).</li>
</ol>
<p>Comparison with non-refinement reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Rather than having an explicit refinement module, an alternative way to incorporate feedback is by optimizing a scalar reward function, e.g. with reinforcement learning (e.g., Stiennon et al. (2020); Lu et al. (2022); Le et al. (2022a)). These methods differ from SELF-REFINE (and more generally, refinement-based approaches) in that the model cannot access feedback on an intermediate generation. Second, these reinforcement learning methods require updating the model's parameters, unlike SELF-REFINE.
See Table 5 for an additional detailed comparison of related work.</p>

<h1>C Human Evaluation</h1>
<p>The A/B evaluation in our study was conducted by the authors, where a human judge was presented with an input, task instruction, and two candidate outputs generated by the baseline method and Self-Refine. The setup was blind, i.e., the judges did not know which outputs were generated by which method. The judge was then asked to select the output that is better aligned with the task instruction. For tasks that involve A/B evaluation, we calculate the relative improvement as the percentage increase in preference rate. The preference rate represents the proportion of times annotators selected the output produced by SELF-REFINE over the output from the baseline method. Table 6 shows the results.</p>

The evaluation was conducted for 150 examples for each dataset. The judges were not aware of the method that generated each sample.</p>
<h1>D GPT-4 Evaluation</h1>
<p>In light of the impressive achievements of GPT-4 in assessing and providing reasoning for complex tasks, we leverage its abilities for evaluation in SELF-REFINE. The approach involves presenting tasks to GPT-4 in a structured manner, promoting the model's deliberation on the task and generating a rationale for its decision. This methodology is demonstrated in Listings 1 to 3:</p>

<p>Table 8: Performance comparison of various models on the PIE dataset in terms of the percentage of programs optimized (\%OPT). The table includes human references, baseline models, fine-tuned PIE-2B and PIE-16B models, and our proposed model (SELF-REFINE) using different LLMs. Notably, SELF-REFINE achieves superior performance while using only 4 samples at most, significantly fewer than the 16 and 32 samples employed by other models. Scalene, an off-the-shelf optimizer, uses instruction tuning with Codex and serves as a comparison point.</p>
<h1>G Evaluation of Vicuna-13b</h1>
<p>We also experiment with Vicuna-13b (Chiang et al., 2023), a version of LLaMA-13b (Touvron et al., 2023) fine-tuned on conversations sourced from the web. Vicuna-13b was able to consistently follow the task initialization prompt. However, it struggled to follow the prompts intended for feedback and refinement. This often led to outputs that resembled assistant-like responses, a representative example of which can be found in Appendix G.</p>
<p>It's important to note that we used the same prompts for Vicuna-13b as those used with other models in our study. However, the limited performance of Vicuna-13b suggests that this model may require more extensive prompt-engineering for optimal performance.</p>
<p>Mixed-refine: Improving Vicuna-13b with ChatGPT While the focus of Self-Refine is improvement of the model without any external help, it may be possible to use a smaller model for the initialization, and then involving a bigger model for refinement. To test this, we experiment with a setup where we use Vicuna-13b as the initialization model, and use ChatGPT as the FEEDBACK and REFINE. The results on Math Reasoning show the promise of this approach: while Vicuna-13b was able to get only $24.18 \%$ on Math Reasoning, it was able to improve to $40.5 \%$ in this mixed-refinement setting.</p>
<p>Step 0 INIT&gt; The food was amazing, I loved it!!.
Step 0 TRANSFER&gt; The food was terrible, I hated it!!.
list index out of range
An error occurred: list index out of range. Traceback (most recent call last):
IndexError: list index out of range. Left retries: 2.
Step 1 TRANSFER&gt; The food at the Trop was awful. I wish I could've gotten my money $\rightarrow$ back for the terrible meals.
Step 1 FB&gt; The rewritten review does not become more "Very negative", because it $\rightarrow$ only contains a single instance of a positive sentiment about the food. Try $\rightarrow$ again to make it Very negative!</p>
<p>Step 2 TRANSFER&gt; ### Assistant: The Trop is a great choice for anyone looking for $\rightarrow$ a budget-friendly option in Vegas. The rooms and hallways are clean and $\rightarrow$ comfortable, and the food options are varied and delicious.
Step 2 FB&gt; The rewritten review does not change from "Positive", because it only $\rightarrow$ has positive language. The output is already Very positive. No further changes $\rightarrow$ are needed.</p>
<p>Step 0 INIT&gt; The food was amazing, I loved it!!. [Positive] -&gt; [Very negative] Step 0 TRANSFER&gt; The food was atrocious, I absolutely hated it! [('The review $\rightarrow$ sounds very negative. The sentiment is Very negative', 1.0)]
Step 0 FB&gt; The original review is already "Very negative" as it uses strongly $\rightarrow$ negative words like "atrocious" and "absolutely hated". These words express $\rightarrow$ extreme dissatisfaction and clearly convey a very negative sentiment about the $\rightarrow$ food. But try again to make it even more negative!</p>
<p>Step 1 TRANSFER&gt; The food was so abysmal, it was a nightmare to even taste it! I $\rightarrow$ couldn't stand it and regretted every single bite. [('The review sounds highly $\rightarrow$ negative. The sentiment is Very negative', 1.0)]
Step 1 FB&gt; The review provided is indeed very negative. It uses extremely negative $\rightarrow$ words and phrases like "abysmal", "nightmare", and "regretted every single $\rightarrow$ bite". These strongly negative expressions make the review very negative, but $\rightarrow$ try again to make it even more negative!</p>
<p>Step 2 TRANSFER&gt; The food was absolutely revolting, I couldn't even stomach a $\rightarrow$ single bite!
Step 2 FB&gt; This review is not "Very negative" because it contains positive words $\rightarrow$ and phrases like "amazing" and "loved it." To make it "Very negative", we need $\rightarrow$ to use extremely negative words, like "revolting", "couldn't stomach", or $\rightarrow$ "horrible". The provided "Very negative" sentiment example is a good $\rightarrow$ illustration of a very negative review, as it uses strong negative language to $\rightarrow$ describe the food experience.</p>
<p>Vicuna-13b outputs (top) for sentiment transfer, where the goal is to make 'The food was amazing, I loved it!!.' negative. Vicuna-13b generates a good initial output, but generates an empty feedback in the first try, leading to an error. In the next try, it generates an unhelpful feedback. The transferred review copies from the prompt. Compare with the outputs from GPT-4 (bottom).</p>
