                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) administration is a novel and promising therapeutic approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Focusing on an intervention easily translatable into clinical practice, we administered allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSCs intravenously in a mouse model of AD (3xTg-AD). We systematically evaluated the effects of a single-dose and multiple-doses of MSCs in young and old mice (5 or 10 months old), comparing the short-term and long-term effects after 1, 2, or 7 months of treatment. A single dose of MSCs in young mice attenuated neuroinflammation 1 and 7 months after injection, whereas multiple-doses did not show any effect. Multiple-doses of MSCs (administered at 5 to12 mo, or 10 to12 mo) reduced the β-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein, although levels of Aβ-42 did not change. Most interestingly, multiple doses of MSCs affected tau hyperphosphorylation. MSCs administered in young mice for 7 months decreased the pathological tau phosphorylation at T205, S214, and T231. MSCs administered in old mice for 2 months decreased tau phosphorylation at S396. Our findings show how different timing and frequency of MSC injections can affect and modulate several aspects of the AD-like neuropathology in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, strengthening the concept of fine-tuning MSC therapy for Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory loss and cognitive decline, is the cause of approximately 60-80% of all dementia cases. The utmost risk factor for this disease is aging. As our life expectancy increases, a consistent increment of dementia and AD cases is anticipated, making the search for an effective treatment a priority (Alzheimer's Association, 2020). Currently, FDA-approved therapies for AD provide symptomatic relief but do not alter the disease progression (Anand et al., 2014;Mishra et al., 2019).</p>
<p>The main pathological features of AD include extracellular plaques consisting of amyloid β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. Together, amyloid and tau pathologies drive the neuronal impairment that widely affects the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Masters et al., 2015). The immune processes of the brain also contribute to the progression and severity of AD. In response to Aβ accumulation and neuronal damage, microglia and Abbreviations: AD, Alzheimer's disease; Aβ, Beta-amyloid peptide; APP, Amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1; BBB, Blood-brain barrier; BM, Bone-marrow; CNS, Central nervous system; CTF, C-terminal fragment of APP after cleavage; ctx, Cortex; EGFP, Enhanced green fluorescence protein; GFAP, Glial fibrillary acidic protein; GSK3, Glycogen synthase kinase 3; hip, Hippocampus; Iba1, Ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1; IC, Intracranial; IP, Intraperitoneal; IV, Intravenous; m.i., Multiple injections; mo, Months old; MSC, Mesenchymal stem cell; NeuN, Neuronal nuclei (neuronal marker); NFT, Neurofibrillary tangles; PS1, Presenilin-1; pTau, Phosphorylated tau; s.i., Single injection; TUJ1, Class III beta-tubulin (neuronal marker); WT, Wild type mice (non-transgenic). astrocytes release inflammatory mediators leading to chronic neuroinflammation (Heneka et al., 2015).</p>
<p>As the pathophysiology of AD is multifactorial, a treatment approach with more than one mechanism of action may increase the likelihood of treatment efficacy. On this basis, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a new and very promising therapeutic strategy for AD (Amemori et al., 2015). MSCs are highly proliferative, easily handled, multipotent progenitor cells. They exert multi-faceted functions in tissue remodeling and healing and can be isolated from several tissues, such as bone marrow, umbilical cord blood, or adipose tissue (Ding et al., 2011). Their unique properties include the capacity to differentiate into neuronal and glial cells, stimulate endogenous repair mechanisms, regulate immune cells, and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors Vasic et al., 2019). Their paracrine effects are essential to induce neural regeneration and immunomodulation (Phinney and Pittenger, 2017).</p>
<p>In animal models of AD, intracerebral transplantation of MSCs reduces Aβ deposition by stimulating the endogenous mechanism of Aβ clearance and decreasing the activity of secretases that cleave the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Bae et al., 2013;Lee et al., 2012;Shin et al., 2014;Yun et al., 2013). Additionally, MSCs can modulate the function of activated microglial cells by increasing their phagocytic activity towards Aβ deposits and by decreasing their expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Harach et al., 2017;Kim et al., 2013;Ma et al., 2013;Naaldijk et al., 2017). Yet, the mechanisms underlying MSCs' therapeutic actions are still not fully elucidated and administration routes used in animal models, such as intracranial stereotactic transplantation, are not easily approachable in the clinic.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the effects of single-dose and multiple-dose administration of murine bone marrowderived MSCs in an animal model of AD. We used the 3xTg-AD mice (Oddo et al., 2003), the most complete model available that develops a progressive neuropathology including both plaques and tangles (Belfiore et al., 2019;Drummond and Wisniewski, 2017;Esquerda-Canals et al., 2017;Puzzo et al., 2015;Sterniczuk et al., 2010). The MSC intervention was designed to be easily translated into clinical practice. We administered MSCs intravenously and compared different administration paradigms: single or multiple injections; early or late administration; short or long-term effects. We assessed the ability of MSCs to cross the brain-blood barrier and investigated the effects of MSC administration on the mice neuropathology.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<p>The penetrance of the phenotype is 100% in female carriers, while males seem to be less affected (Carroll et al., 2010), therefore we used 3xTg-AD females (B6;129-Tg (APPSwe,tauP301L)1Lfa Psen1tm1Mpm/ Mmjax, MMRRC Stock No: 34830-JAX). Mice were housed with a 12-h light/dark cycle with controlled humidity and temperature. Food and water were available ad libitum. Experiments were conducted during the daytime in the research laboratory and animals were simply randomized into treatments. All procedures for the treatments and euthanasia were reviewed and approved by University of Miami IACUC (American Association for Laboratory Animal Science). All efforts were made to minimize animal discomfort and to reduce the number of animals used.</p>
<p>MSCs (isolation, expansion, and characterization)</p>
<p>Murine MSCs were manufactured by the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Cell Production Facility at the Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, as previously described (Oskouei et al., 2012). Briefly, one adult c57black mouse was sacrificed by cervical dislocation, femurs, and tibias were isolated and cleaned from skin and muscle in cold PBS on ice. Bones were flushed with MSC media and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 rpm. ACK Lysis buffer (Quality Biological) was added for 10 min and then deactivated with the medium. Cells were then spun down and plated into two 25 cm flasks for 5 days without changing medium. On day 5, flasks were washed once with medium (αMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and cultured normally (changing medium every other day). Cells were cultured until passage p14 to p17 and subsequently frozen in a cryopreservation medium (90% fetal bovine serum with 10% DMSO). The cell characterization was performed using flow cytometry analysis. Cells were tested for the absence of CD45 and the presence of the standard MSC markers CD90, and CD105. Cell function was assessed by fibroblast colony forming assay (CFU-F). Cells were tested for mycoplasma and endotoxin prior to cryopreservation. On the day of infusion, cells were thawed, re-assessed for cell viability and count, and passed through a cell strainer to avoid clumping. Each injection contained 1 × 10 6 MSCs diluted in 200 μl of sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). Injections were administrated intravenously via tail vein.</p>
<p>Evan's blue assay</p>
<p>Evan's blue solution (EBS) of 4% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was slowly injected into the tail vein of the mice at 200 mg/kg. As a positive control, wild type (WT) mice were treated with 25% mannitol solution (500 μl IP) 15 min after IV injection of EBS using the protocol adapted from (Dufkova et al., 2019), to disrupt of the BBB. Mice were perfused with PBS 2 h after the EBS injection, and brains were dissected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. ¼ of the brain was homogenized in 200 μl of PBS. Then, 200 μl of trichloroacetic acid was added (final concentration of 50%) to each sample, mixed in a vortex for 5 s, and incubated at 4 • C. After 24 h, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4 • C for 30 min and the supernatant was collected. The absorbance of the supernatants was measured at 620 nm and the results were normalized to the tissue weight (in grams). The amount of extravasated Evan's blue in each sample was determined using a standard curve ranging from 200 μg/ml to 0.4 μg/ml of EBS in 50% trichloroacetic acid.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemistry</p>
<p>Mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA. Brains were isolated, cut in half (coronal plane), and immersed in 30% sucrose solution for at least 24 h. The brains were then frozen in isopentane-liquid nitrogen, mounted with OCT, and sectioned at 20 μm thickness with a cryostat. The sections were blocked with 5% BSA, permeabilized with 0.4% TritonX-100 in PBS, and incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 • C. The following antibodies were used: NeuN (1:500, Chemicon), GFAP (1:1000, Cell Signaling), and Iba1 (1:500, Wako). Subsequently, slides were incubated with the secondary antibody tagged with fluorescent Alexa-fluor (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature, mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI, and visualized by confocal microscopy.</p>
<p>For plaque staining, sections were pretreated with 70% formic acid for 20 min and then incubated with 0.3% H 2 O 2 in 100% methanol for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) and incubated with primary antibody anti-β-amyloid 6E10 (1:1000, Covance) overnight at 4 • C. Slides were then incubated with secondary antibody biotin-conjugated goat antimouse (KPL) for 1 h at room temperature and Streptavidin-Peroxidase (KPL) for 30 min. Staining was visualized using a solution of 0.05% 3,3 ′ -diaminobenzidine (DAB) diluted in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.2 + 0.02% H 2 O 2 . Images were captured with an optical microscope.</p>
<p>Plaque counting</p>
<p>Immunostained brain section images were captured using an Olympus BX51 microscope. As previously described (Pinto et al., 2013), the total number of amyloid plaques per tissue area (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) were counted from 10 consecutive stained sections per animal (n = 4 per group), scanning the whole area using a 20× objective.</p>
<p>Nissl staining</p>
<p>PFA-fixed frozen sections were dried for 3 h, then incubated in 1:1 ethanol/chloroform overnight for de-fattening. Slides were then rehydrated through 100% ethanol to distilled water. Staining was performed in warm (37 • C) 0.1% cresyl violet solution for 5-10 min (Abcam 246,817). Slides were then rinsed in running distilled water, serially dehydrated to 100% ethanol 2 × 5 min, cleared in xylene 2 × 5 minutes, and mounted with a permanent mounting medium.</p>
<p>Quantification of Ab-42 levels in the brain by ELISA</p>
<p>Cortices and hippocampi were homogenized in cold guanidine buffer [5 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM Tris⋅HCl (pH 8.0)]. Total Aβ-42 content was quantified using a human Aβ-42 colorimetric ELISA kit (Invitrogen KHB3441) according to the manufacturer's instruction with an incubation time of 16 h at 4 • C. The absorbance of the homogenates was measured at 450 nm and the final results were normalized to the protein concentration.</p>
<p>Western Blot</p>
<p>Mice were perfused with PBS. Protein extracts were prepared from the cortical, and hippocampal neuroanatomical regions, homogenized in PBS containing protease inhibitor (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Homogenates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 g at 4 • C, and the supernatant was collected for analysis. Protein concentration was determined by DC kit (BioRad). Approximately 20 μg of protein was run on a 4-20% gradient Tris-HCl gel (BioRad) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (BioRad). Membranes were blocked in 4% milk in PBST (PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (see Supplementary Table 1 for a list of antibodies used) were diluted in 4% milk in PBST and incubated overnight at 4 • C. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell signaling) were used, and the reaction was developed by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West reagent (Rockford, IL). Blots were visualized with Chemidoc Imaging System (BioRad). Optical density measurements were taken by software supplied by BioRad. Bands were normalized for the total protein loading (visualized by stain-free technology, in the Chemidoc system, Biorad).</p>
<p>Statistical analysis</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8. Statistical significance between groups, defined as p &lt; 0.05, was calculated by the Student's t-test (two-tailed) between two groups, otherwise by oneway ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc test between three or more groups. The number of animals used in all experiments was n = 4-5 mice per group. Data in figures are expressed as mean ± SEM. The symbol (<em>) indicates the statistical difference between marked groups (</em>p &lt; 0.05; <strong>p &lt; 0.01; </strong>*p &lt; 0.001).</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Blood-brain barrier permeability to MSCs</p>
<p>To detect the presence of MSCs in the brains of 3xTg-AD animals, we injected IV (tail vein) 1 × 10 6 MSCs stably expressing Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (EGFP). After 24 h, we perfused the 3xTg-AD animals and performed IHC with anti EGFP on the brain, liver, heart, and lungs. In accordance to previous reports, we detected the vast majority of EGFP+ cells in the lungs, while in the heart, liver, and brain, we detected only a few EGFP+ cells (Fig. 1A). At this time point, the cells detected in the brain were mainly localized in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle ( Fig. 1B), no cells were found in the brain parenchyma.</p>
<p>Due to the disease progression in the 3xTg-AD mice, we also tested whether the BBB permeability was impaired at 12 months of age. We measured the levels of Evan's blue dye extravasated in the brain of 3xTg-AD mice compared to non-transgenic mice (wild-type, WT). In the positive control group, WT mice of the same age were treated with mannitol to allow a temporary disruption of the BBB (Gonzales-Portillo et al., 2014). Our data showed no statistical difference between the 3xTg-AD mice and WT mice (Fig. 1C), indicating no increase of the BBB permeability in the 3xTg-AD at 12 months of age.</p>
<p>Treatments</p>
<p>3xTg-AD mice were randomly separated into 3 different administration paradigms based on their age. For each group of treatment G1, G2, or G3 (see Table 1), single and multiple injections of MSCs were administrated intravenously through the tail vein. 3xTg-AD mice injected with saline (vehicle) were used as controls. In G1, early shortterm treatment, mice were first injected at 5 months and analyzed at 6 months. Multiple injections were performed weekly for a total of 4 injections. In G2, early long-term treatment, mice were first injected at 5 months and analyzed at 12 months. Multiple injections were performed every two months for a total of 4 injections. In G3, late short-term treatment, mice were first injected at 10 months and analyzed at 12 months. Multiple injections were performed every two weeks for a total of 4 injections.</p>
<p>Neurodegeneration</p>
<p>We investigated whether MSCs injections influenced neurodegeneration by measuring the steady-state level of a neuronal marker TUJ1 (class III beta-tubulin). We performed a Western Blot to quantify the levels of TUJ1 in the cortex and hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mice treated with MSCs compared to controls. Our results showed that multiple injections of MSCs in group G1 (5-6 mo) significantly increased the levels of TUJ1 in the hippocampus (Fig. 2B). In the other groups, we did not find any significant changes. To analyze the neuroanatomy of the cortex and hippocampus we also performed Nissl staining (nucleic acid staining method used for nervous tissue) and immunohistochemistry staining for NeuN (a marker of neuronal nuclei) on PFA-fixed frozen sections of the mice belonging to the different groups. We did not detect any gross change comparing MSCs-treated and saline-treated mice in any group. Representative images of the multiple injection treatments (MSCs or saline) are shown in Suppl. Fig. 1 (Nissl staining) and in Fig. 2A (NeuN IHC). Finally, we investigated the effects of MSCs treatments on synapses by measuring the levels of synaptophysin, a specific marker for vesicles in synaptic terminals. Our results showed a significant decrease in synaptophysin levels in the cortex of mice treated with multiple injections of MSCs in groups G1 (5-6 mo) and G3 (10-12 mo), as well as in the single injection treatment in G3 (Fig. 2C). In the hippocampus, there were no significant alterations in levels of synaptophysin within all the treatment groups.</p>
<p>Neuroinflammation</p>
<p>To measure the neuroinflammation in 3xTg-AD mice treated with MSCs, we analyzed by Western Blot the steady-state level of GFAP (a marker of activated astrocytes) and Iba1 (a marker of microglia) in the cortex and hippocampus. Our results showed that a single injection of MSCs early in the pathology (group G1, 5-6 mo) significantly decreased Iba1 level to 33% in the hippocampus (Fig. 3A). Early single injection of MSCs (group G2, 5-12 mo) significantly decreased the level of GFAP (56%) in the hippocampus (Fig. 3B). GFAP levels trended to decrease in the early treatments (G1 and G2) also after multiple injections in both cortex and hippocampus, but these changes did not reach statistical significance. We then performed immunohistochemistry to detect activated astrocytes and microglia using fluorescence staining against GFAP and Iba1, respectively. Although the Western Blot results showed no reduction in Iba1 levels in the single injection of G2, the number of Iba1positive cells in the hippocampus was statistically lower than in the saline group ( Fig. 3C and D).

<p>Amyloid pathology</p>
<p>To investigate whether single or multiple injections of MSCs decreased the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), we performed a Western Blot to measure the levels of APP and the C-terminal fragments CTFα-β, peptides that remain membrane-bound after the first APP cleavage by αor β-secretase. Results are shown in Fig. 4A as CTFα-β/APP ratio. The treatment with multiple injections of MSCs in groups G2 (5-12 mo) and G3 (10-12 mo) significantly decreased the ratio of CTFα-β/APP in the cortex to 82% and 78% respectively, which indicates a reduction of the APP processing by α or β-secretase in the MSCs-treated mice. In the early treatment (group G1, 5-6mo), we did not detect any significant difference between treatments. We then performed an ELISA assay to measure the levels of the Aβ-42 peptide in the cortex and hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mice treated with the MSCs compared to saline-treated controls. We did not detect any alteration in the levels of Aβ-42 within all the treatment groups (Fig. 4B).</p>
<p>We then performed immunohistochemistry on serial coronal sections with an anti-human Aβ antibody (6E10) and analyzed the presence of plaques in the cortex and hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mice, injected with saline or with the MSCs. In Suppl. Fig. 2A representative images of the stained brains from multiple injection treatments (MSCs or saline) in group G3 are shown. At 12 months of age, the majority of the signal was intracellular, most of the plaques were present in the CA1/subiculum region of the hippocampus and very few in the cortex (Suppl. Fig. 2A). To evaluate whether the MSCs treatments decrease amyloid deposits in the mice's brain, the number of plaques was counted. However, no significant change in plaque number or in the intracellular signal was observed in any of our treatments (Suppl. Fig. 2B).</p>
<p>Tau protein analysis</p>
<p>Tau contains 85 putative phosphorylation sites out of which 45 have been found highly phosphorylated in AD brains (Noble et al., 2013). Of those, we analyzed 8 phosphorylation sites distributed within the proline-rich domain and the C-terminal of tau protein: S198, S199, T205, S214, T231, S396, S404, S422 (see Fig. 5A). The levels of the total tau (Tau5) and the levels of phosphorylation on the 8 sites were determined by Western Blot and the ratios of the phosphorylated tau site (pTau) normalized by total Tau. In the 3xTg-AD mice, the hyperphosphorylated and conformational altered tau is detectable starting at 12 months of age (Oddo et al., 2003). Thus, for the tau pathology, we only analyzed G2 (5 to 12 mo) and G3 (10 to 12 mo) treatments, comparing mice receiving single and multiple injections of MSCs to the controls injected with saline.</p>
<p>Remarkably, in the G2 treatment (5 to 12 mo), the levels of total tau significantly decreased to 76% in the cortex of mice treated with multiple doses of MSCs when compared to saline (Fig. 5B). Similarly, the phosphorylation of tau on T205, S214, and S231 was also significantly reduced in the cortex of mice treated with MSCs: Tau phosphorylation at T205 decreased to 29% after treatment with multiple doses of MSCs; phosphorylation at S214 decreased to 63% with single and 67% with multiple doses of MSCs; phosphorylation at T231 decreased to 65% with multiple doses of MSCs. In the G3 treatment (10 to 12 mo) the levels of total tau were slightly increased in the cortex of mice treated with multiple doses of MSCs (Fig. 5C) and the only phosphorylated site that showed a significant decrease was S396 (50%). The phosphorylation levels at the other residues were not statistically significant in the MSCstreated groups (Suppl. Fig. 4). These results suggest that the single and multiple doses of MSCs administered in young 3xTg-AD mice (5 mo) can reduce tau phosphorylation long-term. One strategy for MSCs treatment to reverse tau hyperphosphorylation is the inhibition of the glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β) (Zhao et al., 2018). Thus, we investigated whether MSCs treatments modulate the activity of GSK3α and β. We performed Western Blots to measure the levels of both GSK3 isoforms and their respective inactivated phosphorylated forms pGSK3α (S21) and pGSK3β (S9). Results are shown in Fig. 6 as the ratio of the inactive form normalized by the total (pGSK3/GSK3), both values previously normalized by the protein loading. If GSK3 was responsible for the decrease in tau phosphorylation we see in our treatments, we expected an increase of the inactive form of GSK3 in G2. Instead, the levels of both GSK3α and β inactive forms were significant decreased in the cortex of mice treated with multiple injections of MSCs (Fig. 6A). In G3, however, we did not detect significant statistical differences in the levels of both inactive kinases in the cortex of mice treated with multiple doses of MSCs (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the decrease in tau phosphorylation shown in Fig. 5 are independent of GSK3 activity.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Despite decades of massive efforts to find an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease, and over 100 drugs failing during clinical trials, the disease still remains largely untreatable (Anand et al., 2014).  Naaldijk et al., 2017;Shin et al., 2014). The therapeutic effects of the MSCs treatment include improvement of memory and spatial learning, a decrease of plaque burden, regulation of inflammation, and increased neurogenesis (Lo Furno et al., 2018;Zhang et al., 2020).</p>
<p>In the present study, we focused on characterizing a cell-based therapy with MSCs that could be easily translated into clinical practice, and more importantly, we focused on systematically comparing the effects of single versus multiple injections of MSCs. We administered allogeneic murine bone marrow-derived MSCs intravenously (tail vein) in 3xTg-AD mice at different ages, comparing the outcomes on mice neuropathology. We analyzed the amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and the hyperphosphorylation of tau. To compare the effects of MSCs at different phases of the pathology, we injected the 3xTg-AD mice following 3 treatment paradigms. The first group (G1: mice started the treatment at 5 months and were analyzed a month later) was designed to investigate whether MSC therapy had a short-term effect during the earlier development of the AD-like neuropathology. The second group (G2: mice started the treatment at 5 months and were analyzed seven months later) was designed to investigate whether MSC therapy had a long-term effect on the progression of the neuropathology. The last group (G3: mice started the treatment at 10 months and were analyzed two months later) aimed to investigate whether MSC therapy had a short-term effect on advanced neuropathology. All the results described in this work are summarized in Table 1.</p>
<p>Safety and localization</p>
<p>Studies have previously demonstrated the safety of the systemic administration of MSCs (Ra et al., 2011;Tanaka et al., 2018). In the present work, 18 mice received multiple intravenous doses of MSCs. One of them died immediately after the injection due to technical issues from the tail vein injection itself. Of the other 17 mice, none suffered any type of reaction attributable to the repeated injections. In agreement with our results, another study demonstrated that multiple doses of BM-MSCs in a rat model of vascular dementia did not cause any detriment to the animals' health and were associated with neuroprotective effects (Kong et al., 2017). Our current results show how too frequent administration of MSCs might be deleterious, possibly affecting the number of synaptic vesicles in the cortex. When groups received multiple injections of MSCs more than twice per month -G1 (5-6 mo) and G3 (10-12 mo) -the levels of synaptophysin, were significantly decreased after multiple injections of MSCs.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of systemically administered MSCs, a study tracking radioactively labeled cells shows that, when administered In green: sites phosphorylated in both normal and AD brains. In orange: sites phosphorylated only in AD brain. The callouts point out the common pathology associated with hyperphosphorylation in different Tau domains. (B-C) Western blot analysis of total Tau (Tau5) and the phosphorylated Tau sites on cortical homogenates of mice injected with saline, single, and multiple dosages of MSCs in treatment groups G2 (B) and G3 (C). Graphs represent the ratio of phosphorylated Tau site (pTau) normalized by total Tau. Total Tau and the phosphorylation of Tau at T205, S214, and T231 were significantly decreased in cortex of mice injected with multiple doses of MSCs in treatment group G2 (B). total Tau was increased in cortex of mice injected with multiple doses of MSCs in treatment group G3, while phosphorylation of Tau at S396 was decreased (C). N = 4-5/group, data are expressed as mean ± SEM. * = p &lt; 0.05, ** = p &lt; 0.01.</p>
<p>intravenously, MSCs localize primarily in the lungs, then in the liver, and other organs (Gao et al., 2001). Others have also shown how MSCs are attracted to inflammation (Conaty et al., 2018) and can actively cross the blood-brain barrier (Kim et al., 2012). In this study, we observed that 24 h after IV injection, MSCs crossed the blood-brain barrier (or the blood-csf barrier, since we cannot exclude that MSCs crossed through the choroid plexus) and reached the brain in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle. Previous studies also showed MSCs localization to different parts of the brain after IV injection. Panchenko, et al. showed MSCs in the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, and temporal cortex of bulbectomized mice after IV injection (Panchenko et al., 2014). Harach et al. showed that after a single intravenous injection, hMSCs were detected in brain parenchyma of APP/PS1 mice up to one week after administration (Harach et al., 2017). While MSCs crossing the blood-brain-barrier may still not be an efficient process for CNS delivery, the presence of a few cells can still be therapeutic as a result of the paracrine expression and secretion of neurotrophic factors and cytokines by MSCs engrafted somewhere else in the body, rather than by transformation into various cell types themselves (Linero and Chaparro, 2014;Volkman and Offen, 2017).</p>
<p>Effect of MSCs on neurodegeneration</p>
<p>The neuron-specific Class III β-tubulin (TUJ-1) is present in newly generated immature postmitotic neurons and its expression is also persistent in differentiated neurons (Von Bohlen Und Halbach, 2007), while NeuN is only expressed in mature neurons. In our study, we detect a discrepancy between the TUJ1 content, analyzed by western blot, and NeuN staining: in young mice (5 to 6 mo) treated with multiple injections of MSCs, TUJ1 expression is increased, while neuronal count (NeuN and Nissl staining) do not change. This discrepancy might indicate that multiple injections of MSCs enhance neuronal proliferation in the hippocampus in the G1 group treatment. For this work, we did not use any other marker to explore this possibility (NeutoD1, TBR1, Doublecortin). The issue of neuronal proliferation and regeneration in the adult brain has many controversies and even if it is a very interesting possibility, it will require further detailed analysis in future projects.</p>
<p>Effect of MSCs on amyloid pathway</p>
<p>Bone marrow-derived MSCs have been shown to reduce Aβ deposition in various mouse models of AD: intra-cerebral transplantation of allogenic MSCs in APP/PS1 mice significantly decreased extracellular deposits of Aβ in the brain of aged (Lee et al., 2009) and young (Bae et al., 2013) mice. Our results show that IV injections of MSCs did not affect the levels of Aβ-42 in either the cortex or the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice. Moreover, when we performed an IHC with 6E10 antibody for plaque counting on 12 months old animals, we observed that the majority of signal was intracellular and we encountered few plaques and high variability between animals (Suppl. Fig. 2). Even though Aβ deposition in 3xTg-AD mice is already observed at 6 months, a widespread burden of Aβ plaques is typically not detected until they reach older age (Belfiore et al., 2019;Oddo et al., 2003). The progression of the Aβ pathology in 3xTg-AD mice is less extensive and temporarily delayed compared to the APP/PS1 mice (Drummond and Wisniewski, 2017;Mastrangelo and Bowers, 2008;Puzzo et al., 2015). It is possible that MSCs treatment shows a significant improvement only in mice with an advanced amyloid pathology like the APP/PS1 model.</p>
<p>We further investigated whether the MSCs treatments affected APP processing, which precedes the Aβ accumulation and plaque burden. MSCs have been demonstrated to reduce Aβ deposition by increasing the activity of endogenous mechanisms of Aβ clearance (Shin et al., 2014), or by decreasing the activity of secretases during APP processing. The intra-cerebral transplantation of human umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs in APP/PS1 mice dramatically reduced the level of β-secretase 1 (BACE-1) (Lee et al., 2012). Another study also showed the activity of β-secretase and γ-secretase was significantly reduced in Aβ 1-42 -infused mice transplanted intravenously with placenta-derived MSCs (Yun et al., 2013). In agreement, our results showed that multiple IV doses of MSCs in mice treated earlier (G2: 5-12 mo) or later in the pathology (G3: 10-12 mo) significantly decreased the ratio of CTF/APP in the cortex. Although the MSC administration did not show an effect on improving In G3, both inactive kinases in cortex of mice treated with multiple doses of MSCs were increased (B) but no statistical differences were found between any groups. N = 4/group, data are expressed as mean ± SEM. * = p &lt; 0.05, Aβ clearance, the low ratio of CTFα-β/APP levels in the MSCs-treated mice suggests a reduction of the APP cleavage by BACE-1.</p>
<p>Effect of MSCs on neuroinflammation</p>
<p>Neuroinflammation orchestrated by microglia and astrocytes is another hallmark of AD pathogenesis. These cells are able to sense pathological alterations in the brain, such as the amyloid deposits, and respond by adopting a series of morphological and functional changes (Medeiros and LaFerla, 2013;Prokop et al., 2013). The initial effort to clear the Aβ deposits is an endogenous mechanism of the brain's defense, however, the chronic exposure to pro-inflammatory molecules induce an abnormal state characterized by reduced phagocytic capacity and altered cytokine production (reviewed elsewhere Heneka et al., 2015;Heppner et al., 2015). Thus, microglia and astrocytes aggravate the AD pathology by promoting neuroinflammation. When exposed to the inflammatory environment, MSCs are stimulated to release a variety of mediators and can potently suppress the function of various immune cells (Li and Hua, 2017;Shi et al., 2018). In mouse models of AD, MSC transplantation reduced the expression of activated microglia and astrocyte-produced proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α Ma et al., 2013;Naaldijk et al., 2017). These findings suggest that MSCs possibly regulate the functions of microglia and astrocytes to reduce neuroinflammation in AD models.</p>
<p>During neuroinflammation, activated astrocytes and microglia upregulate their expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1 (Iba1), respectively, as part of a series of morphological and functional changes (Hovens et al., 2014;Zhang et al., 2019). We found that a single dose of MSCs in the young mice (5 mo) significantly decreased the levels of Iba1 (one month later, at 6 mo) and GFAP (7 months later, at 12 mo) in the hippocampus of treated mice. Microglia, as the resident immune cell of the CNS, undergo functional changes after Aβ exposure triggering an innate immune response by locally releasing various inflammatory mediators. Meanwhile, astrocyte activation is responsible for continuing the inflammatory processes in the brain leading to a chronic inflammatory state (Heneka et al., 2015;Heppner et al., 2015). Thus, our results suggest that MSCs may play an important role in reducing both short-and longterm neuroinflammation in the 3xTg-AD mice.</p>
<p>Effect of MSCs on Tau phosphorylation</p>
<p>Intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a major pathological hallmark contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. As a result of the imbalance between the activity of tau kinases and phosphatases, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, which prevents its essential function on microtubule assembly and promotes its self-aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles (Chong et al., 2018). Few studies have investigated the effect of systemic MSCs transplantation on the tau pathology in AD mice models. In APP/PS1 double-transgenic mice, histological analysis showed a reduction in S202/T205 phosphorylated tau after intracerebral transplantation of BM-MSCs (Lee et al., 2009) or human umbilical cord -MSCs (Lee et al., 2012). Recently, another study using APP/PS1 mice suggested intracerebral transplantation of human MSCs reduced tau phosphorylation at S202/T205 and S396 (Zhao et al., 2018).</p>
<p>In APP/PS1 mice, phosphorylation of tau can sometimes be observed as a pathologic downstream consequence of the Aβ deposition, but this model lacks the typical NFT pathology associated with AD (for review see Sasaguri et al., 2017). In the present study, we analyzed the phosphorylation of tau at 8 specific residues: S198, S199, T205, S214, T231, S396, S404, and S422. Multiple injections of MSCs in young 3xTg-AD mice (G2: 5-12mo) significantly decreased the pathological phosphorylation of tau at T205, S214, and T231. In older mice (G3: 10-12mo) tau phosphorylation was only significantly decreased at S396. Interestingly, phosphorylation at T205, S214, T231, and S396 has been observed in AD brains but not under normal physiologic conditions (Martin et al., 2013). Thus, our findings suggest the MSCs treatment in the 3xTg-AD mice could specifically module the pathological phosphorylation of tau in AD.</p>
<p>Tau pathology is a consequence of the phosphorylation of tau protein at discrete sites and domains (Haj-Yahya et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2007;Steinhilb et al., 2007). Specific tau phosphorylation at S214 or S396 strongly reduces the affinity of tau to bind to microtubules (Kadavath et al., 2018;Schneider et al., 1999). Tau phosphorylation at S202/T205 and T231/S235 decreases the ability of tau to assemble tubulin into microtubules (Amniai et al., 2009). Additionally, tau phosphorylation at S202, T205, and S208 stimulates tau self-aggregation (Despres et al., 2017). By analyzing the timing of tau phosphorylation patterns, it is possible to characterize the progression of the AD-like pathology in the 3xTg-AD mice. As an example, tau phosphorylation at T231 characterizes the pre-tangle state (Augustinack et al., 2002), whereas phosphorylation at S202/T205 and T212/S214 refers to the states of intra-and extra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, respectively (Belfiore et al., 2019). Together with the phosphorylation at S396/S404, phosphorylation at these sites defines neurofilaments structures in AD brains (Augustinack et al., 2002). By comparing our findings with these phosphorylation patterns, our results suggest that early intervention with MSCs (G2: 5-12mo) could regulate tau hyperphosphorylation in every phase of the pathology.</p>
<p>Abnormal tau phosphorylation is a result of the imbalance between the activity of kinases and phosphatases. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) is a major kinase involved in tau phosphorylation (Lauretti et al., 2020), acting on 29 of the 45 sites of the tau protein that are found phosphorylated in AD (Martin et al., 2013), including the sites we have analyzed. There are two isoforms of GSK3 -α and β -and both kinases are known to affect all the major hallmarks of AD including tau phosphorylation (Lauretti et al., 2020), amyloid-β production, neurogenesis, and synaptic function (Ma, 2014). We investigated the activity of GSK3α and β in the cortex of 3xTg-AD mice injected with MSCs, but we did not find a correlation between the reduction on tau phosphorylation at T205, S214, T231, and S396 and GSK3 activity.</p>
<p>There are several kinases involved in tau phosphorylation and frequently more than one kinase can phosphorylate the same tau residue (Martin et al., 2013). In AD, other than GSK3, the most relevant ones include casein kinase (CK), cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk5), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Hanger et al., 2009). Each kinase has a preference for specific sites on the tau molecule, and frequently a pre-phosphorylation of tau is required to facilitate subsequent tau phosphorylation by other kinases. In vitro tau phosphorylation of S214, S262, and S409 by PKA dramatically increased the phosphorylation of T181, S199, S202, T205, T217, T231, S396, and S422 by GSK-3β but inhibited it at S404 (Liu et al., 2006). Therefore, a hypothesis for the mechanism of MSC-mediated reduction of hyperphosphorylation could be the modulation of the cAMP-PKA activity on priming tau phosphorylation. Another hypothetical mechanism is an increase in the activity of specific tau phosphatases, such as the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A), which is considered the most important phosphatase for dephosphorylating the pathological tau (Wang et al., 2007). However, to date, the authors are not aware of any studies that suggest stem cell therapy affects the activity of either PKA or PP2A on tau pathology in AD. Further investigations will be needed to understand the mechanisms of action involved in the MSCs therapy.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Although more comprehensive behavioral assessment remains to be done, we observed that MSC injections given to young 3xTg-AD mice showed a long-lasting beneficial effect on the overall AD-like neuropathology. A single dose of MSCs at 5 months of age reduced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mice 1 month and 7 months after injection. Also, the early treatment with multiple doses of MSCs increased the levels of TUJ1 in the hippocampus and reduced the APP cleavage by β-secretase in the cortex. Most interestingly, multiple doses of MSCs affected the tau pathology, modifying the tau phosphorylation pattern. Early administration of MSCs decreased the levels of total tau protein and decreased its phosphorylation at T205, S214, and T231. Late administration of MSCs instead, reduced the levels of tau phosphorylation at S396. Our systematic investigation on the effects of an MSC-based intervention showed ample modulation on several aspects of the AD-like neuropathology, strengthening the concept of adapting MSCs therapy to Alzheimer's disease.</p>

4Stem cellbased therapy provides a new approach to future AD therapeutic options. MSCs are one of the most used stem cells in preclinical studies and have been tested in various transgenic mouse models of AD showing positive results. Most of the studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the intracerebral transplantation of MSCs to treat mice models of AD (Lee et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2013; Ruzicka et al., 2016; Zheng et al., 2017). Similarly, intravenous injection of MSCs also shows beneficial effects on AD mice models (Kanamaru et al., 2015; Lykhmus et al., 2019; Early and late MSCs treatments decrease the APP processing in the cortex of 3xTg-AD mice.
