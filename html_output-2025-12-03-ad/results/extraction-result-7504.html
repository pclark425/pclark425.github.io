                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The averaged null energy condition (ANEC) requires that the integral over a complete null geodesic of the stress-energy tensor projected onto the geodesic tangent vector is never negative. This condition is sufficient to prove many important theorems in general relativity, but it is violated by quantum fields in curved spacetime. However there is a weaker condition, which is free of known violations, requiring only that there is no self-consistent spacetime in semiclassical gravity in which ANEC is violated on a complete, achronal null geodesic. We indicate why such a condition might be expected to hold and show that it is sufficient to rule out closed timelike curves and wormholes connecting different asymptotically flat regions.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The averaged null energy condition (ANEC) requires that the integral over a complete null geodesic of the stress-energy tensor projected onto the geodesic tangent vector is never negative. This condition is sufficient to prove many important theorems in general relativity, but it is violated by quantum fields in curved spacetime. However there is a weaker condition, which is free of known violations, requiring only that there is no self-consistent spacetime in semiclassical gravity in which ANEC is violated on a complete, achronal null geodesic. We indicate why such a condition might be expected to hold and show that it is sufficient to rule out closed timelike curves and wormholes connecting different asymptotically flat regions.</p>

<h1>I. INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>General relativity alone allows any smooth Lorentzian manifold to be a spacetime. Given a desired spacetime geometry, one simply solves Einstein's equations in reverse to determine the stress-energy tensor $T_{a b}$ needed to produce it. Thus any restrictions on exotic phenomena, such as wormholes or time machines, must be given in terms of energy conditions that restrict the set of possible stress-energy tensors.</p>
<p>One would hope that such conditions are satisfied in semiclassical gravity, i.e., that every quantum state would satisfy a condition on $\left\langle T_{a b}\right\rangle$, where the angle brackets denote the quantum mechanical average. Unfortunately, all the conditions usually considered are known to be violated by quantum fields in in curved spacetime. The weakest such condition is the averaged null energy condition (ANEC), which requires that</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\gamma} T_{a b} k^{a} k^{b}&gt;0
$$</p>
<p>where the integral is taken over a complete null geodesic $\gamma$ with tangent vector $k^{a}$. In flat space, this condition has been found to be obeyed by quantum fields in many backgrounds where one might expect it to be violated, such a domain wall [1] or a Casimir plate with a hole [2]. The latter result has has been generalized to arbitrary Casimir systems, as long as the geodesic does not intersect or asymptotically approach the plates [3]. However, a quantum scalar field in a spacetime compactified in one spatial dimension or in a Schwarzschild spacetime around a black hole violates ANEC [4].</p>
<p>We will therefore consider a weaker condition, which for clarity we will call the selfconsistent achronal averaged null energy condition:</p>
<p>Condition 1 (self-consistent achronal ANEC) There is no self-consistent solution in semiclassical gravity in which ANEC is violated on a complete, achronal null geodesic.</p>
<p>We conjecture that all semiclassical systems obey self-consistent achronal ANEC.
There are two changes here from the usual ANEC. The first is that we require it to hold only on achronal geodesics (those that do not contain any points connected by a timelike path). This requirement avoids violation by compactified spacetimes and Schwarzschild spacetimes, as discussed in Sec. II. But for proving theorems, this restriction is generally unimportant, as discussed in Sec. IV. The null geodesics used in the proofs are generally those which represent the "fastest" paths from one place to another or those which are part of a horizon separating two parts of spacetime that have different causal relationships to some certain region. To play either of these roles, geodesics must be achronal.</p>
<p>The second change is that we are no longer discussing the stress-energy tensor of the fluctuating quantum field separately from the stress-energy tensor of the background. Instead, we consider a situation in which Einstein's equation relates the spacetime curvature to the full stress-energy tensor, comprising both the classical contribution from ordinary matter and the induced quantum contribution one obtains in the background of this curvature. This approach avoids a potential violation due to the scale anomaly, as discussed in Sec. III.</p>
<p>The idea of requiring ANEC to hold only on achronal geodesics appears to have been introduced by Wald and Yurtserver [5], who proved Condition 1 for a massless scalar field in $1+1$ dimensions. In that case, however, all geodesics are achronal unless the spacetime is periodic in space, in which case no geodesics are achronal. The idea of not requiring ANEC to hold on test fields but only in a self-consistent system appears to have been introduced</p>
<p>by Penrose, Sorkin and Woolgar [6]. Self-consistent systems were studied extensively by Flanagan and Wald [7].</p>
<p>We restrict this analysis to semiclassical gravity, meaning that Condition 1 should be expected to hold only in cases where the curvature is well below the Planck scale, where a semiclassical analysis of a quantum field on a classical curved space background is applicable. This condition eliminates classical violations of ANEC [8], because they are obtained by increasing the fields to Planck scale values. This process increases the effective gravitational coupling $G$ through a region where it diverges, and thus clearly leaves the semiclassical regime.</p>
<p>An immediate consequence of Condition 1 is the following:
Lemma 1 In a generic spacetime obeying Condition 1, there are no complete, achronal null geodesics.</p>
<p>By a generic spacetime we mean one that obeys the null generic condition, which states that every complete null geodesic contains a point where $k^{a} k^{b} k_{[c} R_{d] a b[c} k_{f]} \neq 0$, where $k^{a}$ is the tangent vector. This condition says that every null geodesic is affected by some matter or tidal force. In such a spacetime, every complete null geodesic that obeys ANEC has a pair of conjugate points [9] and thus is chronal [10].</p>
<p>Why should one believe that self-consistent achronal ANEC holds, when other conditions have failed? First of all, no violations are known, as we discuss below. But we also suggest that self-consistent achronal ANEC can be proved along the lines of Ref. [3]. That paper showed that ANEC holds for a minimally coupled scalar field on a geodesic that travels in a tube of flat space embedded in an arbitrary curved spacetime, assuming that the causal structure of the tube is unaffected by the exterior spacetime. This last condition guarantees that the geodesic is achronal. We expect that any spacetime could be slightly deformed in the vicinity of a given geodesic to produce the necessary tube, so that self-consistent achronal ANEC could be proved along similar lines, but such a proof will have to await future work.</p>
<h1>II. EXPLICIT COUNTEREXAMPLES TO ANEC</h1>
<p>To our knowledge, there are two specific spacetimes in which ANEC has been explicitly calculated and found to be violated. The first is Minkowski space compactified in one spatial dimension. For example, one could identify the surfaces $z=0$ and $z=L$. The resulting situation is very much analogous to the Casimir effect. ANEC is violated on any geodesic that does not remain at constant $z$. However, no such geodesic is achronal. Since the system is invariant under all translations and under boosts in the $x$ and $y$ directions, it suffices to consider the geodesic through the origin in the $z$ direction. This returns infinitely often to $x=y=z=0$, and thus is chronal.</p>
<p>The second known violation is in Schwarzschild spacetime, in particular in the Boulware vacuum state [4]. But every complete geodesic in the Schwarzschild spacetime is chronal, ${ }^{1}$</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>so self-consistent achronal ANEC is (trivially) satisfied.
In addition, Flanagan and Wald [7] found violations of ANEC in self-consistent perturbation theory about Minkowski space. Although they stated ANEC in the achronal form, they did not discuss the question of whether the ANEC violations that they found were on chronal or achronal geodesics.</p>
<p>With pure incoming states, they found that the ANEC integral vanished, but at second order ANEC could be violated. In this case, the geodesics in question are chronal. Almost all first-order perturbations obey the generic condition, and a complete null geodesic satisfying the generic condition with ANEC integral zero will have conjugate points. Thus at first order, almost all geodesics are chronal, and is not necessary to go to second order. However, in the case of mixed incoming states they found ANEC violations at first order, and in this case we cannot be sure whether the geodesics are chronal or not.</p>
<h1>III. ANOMALOUS VIOLATION OF ANEC</h1>
<p>Visser [11], expanding upon the added note in Ref. [5], points out that the stress-energy tensor has anomalous scaling. If we make a scale transformation,</p>
<p>$$
g \rightarrow \bar{g}=\Omega^{2} g
$$</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>$$
T_{b}^{a}(\bar{g})=\Omega^{-4}\left(T_{b}^{a}(g)-8 a Z_{b}^{a} \ln \Omega\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $a$ is a constant depending on the type of field under consideration, and</p>
<p>$$
Z_{b}^{a}=\left(\nabla_{c} \nabla^{d}+\frac{1}{2} R_{c}^{d}\right) C^{c a}{ }_{d b}
$$</p>
<p>Thus if $\gamma$ is some geodesic with tangent $k^{a}$,</p>
<p>$$
\int_{\gamma} T_{b}^{a}(\bar{g}) k^{a} k_{b}=\Omega^{-4}\left(T_{\gamma}-8 a \ln \Omega J_{\gamma}\right)
$$</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>$$
T_{\gamma}=\int_{\gamma} T_{b}^{a}(g) k^{a} k_{b}
$$</p>
<p>is the original ANEC integral, and</p>
<p>$$
J_{\gamma}=\int_{\gamma} Z_{a b} k^{a} k^{b}
$$</p>
<p>Thus if $J_{\gamma}$ does not vanish, there will be a rescaled version of this spacetime in which $J_{\gamma}$ dominates $T_{\gamma}$, so that ANEC is violated. However, the necessary rescaling is enormous. For example, for a scalar field, $a=1 /\left(2880 \pi^{2}\right)$. Thus if the initial $J_{\gamma}$ and $T_{\gamma}$ are of comparable magnitude, we will need $\Omega$ of order $\exp \left(2880 \pi^{2}\right)$. If $J_{\gamma}&lt;0$, then the rescaling is contraction, and the curvature radius will become far less than the Planck length, so semiclassical analysis (including that used to derive the expression for the anomaly in the first place) will not be applicable. If $J_{\gamma}&gt;0$, then the rescaling is dilation. In that case, the curvature radius of the spacetime is increased by $\Omega$, so the Einstein tensor $G_{b}^{a}$ is multiplied by $\Omega^{-2}$, while the</p>
<p>stress-energy tensor $T_{b}^{a}$ is multiplied by $\Omega^{-4}$. Thus $T_{b}^{a}$ is infinitesimal compared to $G_{b}^{a}$ and so cannot contribute to a self-consistent spacetime with achronal geodesics. In either case, then, this phenomenon does not violate self-consistent achronal ANEC as formulated above.</p>
<p>Alternatively, as pointed out in [11], one can implement the anomalous scaling by changing the renormalization scale $\mu$. However, the result of such a drastic change in scale is a theory vastly different from general relativity, since higher-order terms in the renormalized Lagrangian now enter with large coefficients. Such a situation is also far from the domain of validity of the semiclassical approximation.</p>
<h1>IV. PROOFS USING SELF-CONSISTENT ACHRONAL ANEC</h1>
<p>Several theorems in general relativity have been proved using ANEC (or some variation thereof) as a premise. The proofs of these theorems only require that ANEC hold on achronal geodesics, so they apply equally when the premise is replaced by Condition 1. In fact we can rule out wormholes connecting different regions and time machine construction using only Lemma 1.</p>
<h2>A. Topological censorship</h2>
<p>Topological censorship theorems state that no causal path can go through any nontrivial topology. They rule out such things as traversable wormholes. We use the formulation of Friedman, Schleich and Witt [12] with Condition 1 instead of regular ANEC. We must also restrict ourselves to simply-connected spacetimes, which means that the wormholes we rule out are only those which connect one asymptotically flat region to another, not those which connect a region to itself.</p>
<p>Theorem 1 (Topological censorship) Let $M, g$ be a simply-connected, asymptotically flat, globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying Condition 1 and the generic condition. Then every causal curve from past null infinity $\left(\mathcal{I}^{-}\right)$to future null infinity $\left(\mathcal{I}^{+}\right)$can be deformed to a curve near infinity.</p>
<p>Friedman and Higuchi [13] (see also [6]) outline a simple proof of this theorem which applies equally well in our context. Suppose there is a causal curve $\gamma$ from $\mathcal{I}^{-}$to $\mathcal{I}^{+}$ that cannot be deformed to a curve near infinity (because it goes through a wormhole, for example). It is then possible to construct a "fastest" causal curve $\gamma^{\prime}$ homotopic to $\gamma$, where one curve is (weakly) "faster" than another if it arrives at $\mathcal{I}+$ in the causal past and departs from $\mathcal{I}-$ in the causal future of the other. Such a "fastest" causal curve must be a complete null geodesic. Since $M$ is simply connected, if $\gamma^{\prime}$ were chronal we could deform it to a timelike curve, and then to a "faster" curve. Thus $\gamma^{\prime}$ is an achronal, complete null geodesic, but such a geodesic is ruled out by Lemma 1.</p>
<p>One can see the necessity of simple connectedness (or some other additional assumption) by considering the following example. ${ }^{2}$ Let $M$ be a static spacetime with a single asymptotically flat region and a wormhole connecting the region to itself, and suppose the throat of the wormhole is longer than the distance between the mouths on the outside. Any causal</p>
<p><sup id="fnref3:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>path through the wormhole emerges in the future of the place where it entered, and thus is not achronal. We can still find fastest paths through the wormhole, but they are chronal. This can happen because the timelike connections between points on such a path are not in the same homotopy class as the path itself.</p>
<h1>B. Closed timelike curves</h1>
<p>The first use of global techniques to rule out causality violation was by Tipler [14]. His theorem and proof transfer straightforwardly to self-consistent achronal ANEC.</p>
<p>Theorem 2 (No construction of time machines - Tipler version) An asymptotically flat spacetime $M, g$ cannot be null geodesically complete if (a) Condition 1 holds on $M, g$, (b) the generic condition holds on $M, g$, (c) $M, g$ is partially asymptotically predictable from a partial Cauchy surface $S$, and (d) the chronology condition is violated in $J^{+}(S) \cap J^{-}\left(\mathcal{I}^{+}\right)$.</p>
<p>In order for the chronology condition to be violated (i.e., in order for there to be closed timelike curves), there must be a Cauchy horizon $H^{+}(S)$, which is the boundary of the region $D^{+}(S)$ that is predictable from conditions on $S$. The Cauchy horizon is composed of a set of null geodesic "generators." Tipler [14] shows that conditions (c) and (d) imply that there is at least one such generator $\eta$ which never leaves $H^{+}(S)$. If the spacetime were null geodesically complete, then $\eta$ would be a complete null geodesic lying in $H^{+}(S)$. No point of $H^{+}(S)$ could be in the chronological future of any other such point, so $\eta$ would be a complete, achronal null geodesic. But Lemma 1 shows that no such geodesic can exist if conditions (a) and (b) are satisfied.</p>
<p>A similar theorem was proved by Hawking [15], which we can similarly extend.
Theorem 3 (No construction of time machines - Hawking version) Let $M, g$ be an asymptotically flat, globally hyperbolic spacetime satisfying self-consistent achronal ANEC and the generic condition, with a partial Cauchy surface $S$. Then $M, g$ cannot have a compactly generated Cauchy horizon $H^{+}(S)$.</p>
<p>The Cauchy horizon is compactly generated if the generators, followed into the past, enter and remain within a compact set. Hawking [15] shows that in such a case, there will be generators which have no past or future endpoints. As above, such generators would be complete, achronal null geodesics, which cannot exist under the given conditions.</p>
<h2>C. Positive mass theorems</h2>
<p>Penrose, Sorkin and Woolgar [6] proved a positive mass theorem based on ANEC. Their proof depends only on the condition that every complete null geodesic has conjugate points. As they point out, it is sufficient to require that every achronal, complete null geodesic has conjugate points, and thus that there are no such geodesics.</p>
<h1>D. Singularity theorems and superluminal communication</h1>
<p>Galloway [16] and Roman [17, 18] showed that a spacetime with a closed trapped surface must contain a singularity if ANEC holds, but the ANEC integral is taken not on a complete geodesic, but rather on a "half geodesic" originating on the surface and going into the future. The argument depends only on the fact that any such half geodesic must have a point conjugate to the surface within finite affine length. But if the half geodesic were chronal, then it would have such a conjugate point. Thus a sufficient premise would be that every achronal half geodesic must satisfy ANEC.</p>
<p>The problem with this "half achronal ANEC" condition is that it does not hold for quantum fields, even in flat space. A simple example is a minimally-coupled scalar field in flat space with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the $x-y$ plane. Consider a null geodesic in the positive $z$ direction starting at some $z=z_{0}&gt;0$. On this geodesic, $T_{a b} k^{a} k^{b}=-1 /\left(16 \pi^{2} z^{4}\right)$, so the half ANEC integral can be made arbitrarily negative by making $z_{0}$ small. While this system is not self-consistent (nor does it obey the generic condition), it is hard to imagine that a self-consistent version could not be created, for example using a domain wall [1]. Thus our weakened version of ANEC is just as effective as the standard one, but in either case it is necessary to add additional qualifications to the singularity theorems in order for them to be obeyed by quantum fields.</p>
<p>No-superluminal-communication theorems are similar to singularity theorems. Ref. [19] defined a superluminal travel arrangement as a situation in which a central null geodesic leaving a flat surface arrives at a destination flat surface earlier than any other null geodesic, and proved that such a situation requires weak energy condition violation. The argument is that the null geodesics orthogonal to the surface are parallel when emitted, but diverge at the destination surface, and thus must be defocused. Such defocussing means that ANEC must be violated, with the integral along the path from the source to the destination.</p>
<p>Since a chronal geodesic could not be the fastest causal path from one point to another, it is sufficient to require that ANEC hold on achronal partial geodesics. But once again, this principle is easily violated. An example using the Casimir effect is discussed in Ref. [19]. So, as with singularity theorems, self-consistent achronal ANEC is an adequate substitute for ordinary ANEC, but additional constraints are necessary to rule out superluminal communication.</p>
<h2>V. DISCUSSION</h2>
<p>A longstanding open question in general relativity is what principle - if any - prevents exotic phenomena such as time travel. Standard energy conditions on the stress-energy tensor, such as ordinary ANEC, provide well-motivated means for restricting exotic phenomena, but suffer from known violations by simple quantum systems. We have discussed here an improved energy condition, self-consistent achronal ANEC. It is strong enough to rule out exotic phenomena as effectively as ordinary ANEC, but weak enough to avoid known violations. The key qualification is the restriction to achronal geodesics, which both disallows several known violations of ordinary ANEC and is a necessary condition to apply techniques that have been used to prove ANEC for models in flat space.</p>
