                <p><strong>Paper Venue:</strong> Physical Review D</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Three very recent articles have claimed that it is possible to, at least in theory, either set up positive energy warp drives satisfying the weak energy condition (WEC), or at the very least, to minimize the WEC violations. These claims are at best incomplete, since the arguments presented only demonstrate the existence of one set of timelike observers, the co-moving Eulerian observers, who see"nice"physics. While these observers might see a positive energy density, the WEC requires all timelike observers to see positive energy density. Therefore, one should revisit this issue. A more careful analysis shows that the situation is actually much grimmer than advertised -- all physically reasonable warp drives will violate the null energy condition, and so also automatically violate the WEC, and both the strong and dominant energy conditions. While warp drives are certainly interesting examples of speculative physics, the violation of the energy conditions, at least within the framework of standard general relativity, is unavoidable. Even in modified gravity, physically reasonable warp drives will still violate the purely geometrical null convergence condition and the timelike convergence condition which, in turn, will place very strong constraints on any modified-gravity warp drive.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Three recent articles have claimed that it is possible to, at least in theory, either set up positive energy warp drives satisfying the weak energy condition (WEC), or at the very least, to minimize the WEC violations. These claims are at best incomplete, since the arguments as presented only assert but do not prove the existence of one set of timelike observers, the co-moving Eulerian observers, who see relatively "nice" physics. While these particular observers might arguably see a positive energy density, the WEC requires all timelike observers to see positive energy density. Therefore, one should carefully revisit this issue. A more careful analysis shows that the situation is actually much grimmer than advertised - within the framework adopted by those three papers all physically reasonable warp drives will certainly violate the WEC, and both the strong and dominant energy conditions. Under plausible subsidiary conditions the null energy condition is also violated. While warp drives are certainly interesting examples of speculative physics, the violation of the energy conditions, at least within the framework of standard general relativity, is unavoidable. Even in modified gravity, physically reasonable warp drives will still violate the purely geometrical null convergence condition and the timelike convergence condition which, in turn, will place very strong constraints on any modified-gravity warp drive.</p>

<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>Three recent articles [1-3] have argued for the existence of "physically reasonable" positive-energy warp drive configurations, either satisfying the weak energy condition (WEC), or minimizing violations thereof. (See also the series of articles [4-8].) These claims are in sharp contrast to the 25 -year-old consensus opinion that at least some energy condition violations are necessary for the generation of warp fields [9-29].</p>
<p>Specifically, known results already include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcubierre warp drives have long been known to violate the WEC [9], and have more recently been shown to also violate the null energy condition (NEC) [29].</li>
<li>Natário zero-expansion warp drives have long been known to violate the WEC [10].</li>
<li>Generic Natário warp drives are known to violate the dominant energy condition (DEC) [15], and have also been shown to violate either the strong energy condition (SEC) or the WEC [10].</li>
</ul>
<p>We shall strengthen these well known results below, first showing that the Natário zeroexpansion warp drives also violate the SEC, and the NEC, and then ultimately showing that generic Natário warp drives (including the variants discussed in references [1-3]) violate the WEC, and under plausible subsidiary conditions also violate the NEC.</p>
<p>How, then, is this result compatible with the various rather bold claims made in references [1-3]? (And, for that matter, various parts of the popular press.) The key observation is that WEC requires all timelike observers to see positive energy density, whereas the analyses of references [1-3] at best only investigate the energy density as seen by one class of timelike observers (the co-moving Eulerian observers). Thus the claims made in references [1-3] are at best grossly incomplete, and in many key specific details, wrong.</p>
<p>To set the stage, in section 2 we shall first discuss the kinematics of generic Natário warp drive spacetimes, and then calculate the relevant spacetime curvature (Riemann, Ricci, and Einstein tensors) in section 3. Assuming standard general relativity, we calculate in section 4 all the components of the generic Natário warp-field stress-energy tensor. In section 5, we then provide a number of general results regarding the implications of the point-wise energy conditions, and relate them to the null and timelike convergence conditions in section 6 . With those preliminaries out of the way, the actual proof of energy condition violations in generic Natário warp-field spacetimes will be straightforward (section 7). We conclude with some comments on the possibility of either moving beyond Einstein gravity, or the possibility of further generalizing the notion of warp-field spacetimes. Nevertheless, within the context of standard Einstein gravity, we emphasize that in physically reasonable warp field spacetimes energy condition violations are utterly unavoidable, and must be squarely faced.</p>
<p>In the appendices, we discuss various technical issues arising in recent papers concerning themselves with warp drives: Appendix A deals with a confusion over the precise meaning of "spherical symmetry" in warp space-times. Appendix B points to misunderstandings regarding coordinate transformations. Appendix C addresses issues of differentiability and related technical issues. Finally, Appendix D lists further technical oversights, small and large, of recent publications.</p>
<h1>2 Warp drive kinematics</h1>
<p>The generic Natário warp drive line element we shall consider is this [10]:</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{d} s^{2}=-\mathrm{d} t^{2}+\delta_{i j}\left(\mathrm{~d} x^{i}-v^{i}(x, y, z, t) \mathrm{d} t\right)\left(\mathrm{d} x^{j}-v^{j}(x, y, z, t) \mathrm{d} t\right)
$$</p>
<p>Natário calls this a "warp drive spacetime". Both the vector $v^{i}(x, y, z, t)$ and its derivatives are assumed to be smooth and bounded [10]. This line element is sufficiently general to cover well over $99 \%$ of the relevant literature, and the very few exceptions in the extant literature will be explicitly discussed later on in appendix B. Certainly the models discussed in references [1-3] fall into this generic Natário framework.</p>
<p>The line element represents an ADM-like (3+1) decomposition of the metric [30-36], with unit lapse $N \rightarrow 1$; a flow vector $v^{i}=-$ (shift vector); and a flat spatial 3 -metric $g_{i j}=\delta_{i j}$. The sign-flip on the shift vector is traditional in a warp drive context, and inspired by the notion of "flow" rather than "shift". Accordingly we shall speak of the "flow vector" rather than the "shift vector". (See also the traditional usage in the "analogue spacetime" programme [37-41].) The explicit metric components are</p>
<p>$$
g_{a b}=\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
-\left(1-v^{2}\right) &amp; -v_{j} \
\hline-v_{i} &amp; \delta_{i j}
\end{array}\right], \quad g^{a b}=\left[\begin{array}{c|c}
-1 &amp; -v^{j} \
\hline-v^{i} &amp; \delta^{i j}-v^{i} v^{j}
\end{array}\right]
$$</p>
<p>The metric signature is manifestly $-+++$, while spacetime indices such as $a, b, \ldots$ run from 0 to 3 , and spatial indices such as $i, j \ldots$ run from 1 to 3 . At large spatial distances we want the spacetime to be asymptotically flat, (that is, asymptotically Minkowski or at worst asymptotically Schwarzschild).</p>
<p>The most natural boundary conditions to impose are that $v^{i}(x, y, z, t) \rightarrow 0$ at spatial infinity. One could alternatively impose $v^{i}(x, y, z, t) \rightarrow v_{<em>}^{i}(t)$ at spatial infinity, with $v_{</em>}^{i}(t)$ some function of time only. This would still be asymptotically Minkowski, but with new spatial coordinates $x^{i} \rightarrow \bar{x}^{i}=x^{i}-\int v_{*}^{i}(t) \mathrm{d} t$. This would be useful, for instance, if one wishes to adopt a coordinate system moving with the warp bubble. But there is certainly no loss of generality in enforcing $v^{i}(x, y, z, t) \rightarrow 0$ at spatial infinity.</p>
<p>Indeed there is a very important issue of physics hiding here - physically we want the warp bubble (for at least part of the time) to be "moving" with respect to the "fixed stars" - otherwise the construction is physically uninteresting. Motion between the warp bubble and the fixed stars can be achieved thusly: Either by choosing coordinates such that $v^{i}(x, y, z, t) \rightarrow 0$ at spatial infinity (so the fixed stars are "at rest") while the warp bubble has explicit time dependence, or alternatively, by choosing coordinates where the warp bubble (the central region of the spacetime) is time independent and the fixed stars are in motion $v^{i}(x, y, z, t) \rightarrow v_{*}^{i}(t)$ at spatial infinity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we want the warp bubble to be physically well-localized; we do not wish to have to accelerate the entire universe to get an interesting warp field. On the other hand, demanding that the flow vector have compact support (while mathematically convenient) is physically unnecessarily restrictive. For our purposes it will be more than sufficient for us to demand that the flow field falls off sufficiently rapidly near spatial infinity so that we can integrate by parts. The key point in proving NEC violations (and so implicitly proving violations of WEC, SEC, and DEC) is the significantly weaker condition that gradients of the flow field tend to zero at spatial infinity. We shall expand on this point more extensively in the discussion below.</p>
<p>Following Natário, we shall also demand that the flow field (and hence the metric) be sufficiently smooth and bounded. At the very worst we shall allow Israel-Lanczos-Sen "thin-shell" distributional contributions to the Riemann tensor. Such assumptions are completely standard and implicit in the extant literature.</p>
<p>Specifically, we shall demand that the flow $\vec{v}$ (and hence the metric) be $C^{2-}$ at worst, that is, piecewise twice differentiable, with at worst discontinuous first derivatives. Then the Christoffel symbols are $C^{1-}$ at worst, that is, piecewise once differentiable with at worst step-function discontinuities. Then the Riemann tensor is $C^{0}$ at worst, piecewise continuous with at worst delta-function contributions.</p>
<p>Finally, we emphasize the need for at least some subsidiary conditions to be applied to the generic Natário metric (2.1) in order to distinguish a warp drive from, for instance, the Painlevé-Gullstrand version of Schwarzschild spacetime. The line element (2.1) is sufficiently general and explicit to be physically interesting as a warp drive exemplar, but some subsidiary conditions would still be desirable.</p>
<p>Because the spatial 3-slices are intrinsically flat, and the lapse is unity, the only nontrivial physics hides in the extrinsic curvature of the spatial 3-slices, for which we have the particularly simple result</p>
<p>$$
K_{i j}=v_{(i, j)}
$$</p>
<p>In order to prevent the warp field being trivial (Minkowski space) we will demand that there is at least one point in spacetime where the extrinsic curvature is nonzero.</p>
<p>Let us define $n_{a}=-\nabla_{a} t=(-1 ; 0,0,0)<em b="b">{a}$. Then we have $n^{a}=g^{a b} n</em> t$ are in fact timelike geodesics. This is a simple consequence of the fact that the warp spacetimes are unit-lapse:}=-g^{a t}=\left(1, v^{i}\right)$. Thus $n^{a}$ is future-pointing. It is actually a future-pointing 4 -velocity normal to the spatial 3-slices: $g^{a b} n_{a} n_{b}=-1=g_{a b} n^{a} n^{b}$. Observers with 4 -velocity $n^{a}$ are often called "Eulerian". In some sense (see discussion below) they "go with the flow", they are "co-moving". Furthermore, the Eulerian observers $n^{a}=-g^{a b} \nabla_{b</p>
<p>$$
n^{b} \nabla_{b} n^{a}=g^{a c} n^{b} \nabla_{b} \nabla_{c} t=g^{a c} n^{b} \nabla_{c} \nabla_{b} t=g^{a c} n^{b} \nabla_{c} n_{b}=\frac{1}{2} g^{a c} \nabla_{c}\left(n^{b} n_{b}\right)=\frac{1}{2} g^{a c} \nabla_{c}(-1)=0
$$</p>
<p>The warp drive spacetime is by construction globally hyperbolic, and at each and every instant in time " $t$ " the Eulerian observers are 4 -orthogonal to the flat spatial slices so the Eulerian observers define a zero-vorticity congruence of timelike geodesics that by construction cannot have any focussing points. ${ }^{1}$</p>
<p>From the metric line element one can easily read off a suitable choice of co-tetrad: The timelike covector is simply</p>
<p>$$
\left(e^{\hat{0}}\right)<em a="a">{a}=(1 ; 0,0,0)</em>
$$}=n_{a</p>
<p>while the spatial co-triad is</p>
<p>$$
\left(e^{\hat{1}}\right)<em x="x">{a}=\left(-v</em> ; 1,0,0\right)<em a="a">{a}, \quad\left(e^{\hat{2}}\right)</em> ; 0,1,0\right)}=\left(-v_{y<em a="a">{a}, \quad\left(e^{\hat{3}}\right)</em>
$$}=\left(-v_{z} ; 0,0,1\right)_{a</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The corresponding tetrad is then easily determined: The timelike leg is</p>
<p>$$
\left(e_{\hat{0}}\right)^{a}=\left(1 ; v^{x}, v^{y}, v^{z}\right)^{a}=n^{a}
$$</p>
<p>while now the spatial triad is particularly simple</p>
<p>$$
\left(e_{\hat{1}}\right)^{a}=(0 ; 1,0,0)^{a}, \quad\left(e_{\hat{2}}\right)^{a}=(0 ; 0,1,0)^{a}, \quad\left(e_{\hat{3}}\right)^{a}=(0 ; 0,0,1)^{a}
$$</p>
<p>This implies that, in the co-moving orthonormal basis, for any $T_{2}^{0}$ tensor:</p>
<p>$$
X_{\hat{a} \hat{b}}=e_{\hat{a}}{ }^{a} e_{\hat{b}}{ }^{b} X_{a b}=\left[\frac{X_{\hat{0} \hat{0}}}{X_{\hat{i} \hat{0}}} \frac{X_{\hat{0} \hat{j}}}{X_{\hat{i} \hat{j}}}\right]=\left[\frac{X_{n n}}{X_{i n}} \frac{X_{n j}}{X_{i j}}\right]=\left[\frac{X_{a b} n^{a} n^{b}}{X_{i a} n^{a}} \frac{X_{a j} n^{a}}{X_{i j}}\right]
$$</p>
<p>This is why objects such as $X_{n n}=X_{a b} n^{a} n^{b}=X_{\hat{0} \hat{0}}$ and $X_{n i}=X_{a i} n^{a}=X_{\hat{0} \hat{i}}$ are so important. Subject to this choice of coordinates and tetrad, for the covariant spatial components we have the particularly simple result $X_{\hat{i} \hat{j}}=X_{i j}$. We will often use this observation to simplify formulae by suppressing the "hats" when they are not critical to understanding.</p>
<p>Similarly, for any fully covariant $T_{4}^{0}$ tensor one has $X_{\hat{a} b \hat{c} \hat{d}}=e_{\hat{a}}{ }^{a} e_{\hat{b}}{ }^{b} e_{\hat{c}}{ }^{c} e_{\hat{d}}{ }^{d} X_{a b d c}$. Then for any tensor that has the same symmetries as the Riemann tensor it suffices to calculate</p>
<p>$$
X_{\hat{0} \hat{i} \hat{0} \hat{j}}=X_{n i n j}=n^{a} n^{b} X_{a i b j} ; \quad X_{\hat{0} \hat{i} \hat{k}}=X_{n i j k}=n^{a} X_{a i j k} ; \quad X_{\hat{i} \hat{k} \hat{l}}=X_{i j k l}
$$</p>
<p>Some specific examples of the generic warp drive spacetime are:</p>
<h1>Alcubierre warp field [9]:</h1>
<p>The original Alcubierre warp field [9], taken to be moving in the $z$ direction with constant velocity $v_{*}$, is given by</p>
<p>$$
v^{i}(x, y, z, t)=(0,0,1)^{i} v_{<em>} f\left(\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+\left(z-v_{</em>} t\right)^{2}}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Here, $f(0)=1$, and $f(\infty)=0$.
This was rapidly generalized [9] to a time-dependent velocity for the warp bubble</p>
<p>$$
v^{i}(x, y, z, t)=(0,0,1)^{i} v_{<em>}(t) f\left(\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+\left(z-\int v_{</em>}(t) \mathrm{d} t\right)^{2}}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Note these specific models are "spherically symmetric". More on this point below. Despite repeated assertions in reference [2] there is absolutely no difficulty in making the velocity of the warp bubble time-dependent.</p>
<h1>Natário zero-expansion warp field [10]:</h1>
<p>The Natário zero-expansion warp drive simply sets $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \vec{v}=0$. Note that the second half of Natário's 2001 paper [10] focusses on this zero-expansion warp field, whereas the first half of that paper deals with the generic Natário warp field spacetime of equation (2.1). When mentioning Natário's warp field, it is therefore important to make explicit which of these two specific warp drives one is referring to.</p>
<h2>Lentz/Fell-Heisenberg zero-vorticity warp field [1, 3]:</h2>
<p>The Lentz/Fell-Heisenberg zero-vorticity warp drive uses a purely gradient flow $\vec{v}=\boldsymbol{\nabla} \Phi$, implying $\vec{\omega}=\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \vec{v}=0$.</p>
<p>Thus the generic warp drive line element (2.1), introduced by Natário in [10], covers all three of these specific cases, and many more, and is sufficiently general to cover almost all of the relevant literature.</p>
<h2>3 Warp-field curvature</h2>
<p>The spacetime curvature for warp drive spacetimes is relatively easily determined via a specific application of the ADM formalism [30-36].</p>
<h3>3.1 Riemann tensor</h3>
<p>The Gauss-Codazzi equations would in general imply ${ }^{2}$ :</p>
<p>$$
R_{\bar{i} \bar{j} \bar{k} \bar{l}}={ }^{(3)} R_{\bar{i} \bar{j} \bar{k} \bar{l}}+K_{\bar{i} \bar{k}} K_{\bar{j} \bar{l}}-K_{\bar{i} \bar{l}} K_{\bar{j} \bar{k}}
$$</p>
<p>However, since our 3 -geometry is flat, we have ${ }^{(3)} R_{\bar{i} \bar{j} \bar{k} \bar{l}} \rightarrow 0$, and because of our choice of spatial triad we can dispense with the "hats". So for warp drive spacetimes we simply have</p>
<p>$$
R_{i j k l}=K_{i k} K_{j l}-K_{i l} K_{j k}
$$</p>
<p>The Gauss-Mainardi equations imply ${ }^{3}$ :</p>
<p>$$
R_{n i j k}=R_{a i j k} n^{a}=K_{i j, k}-K_{i k, j}=v_{(i, j), k}-v_{(i, k), j}=v_{[j, k], i}
$$</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>The remaining components of the Riemann tensor do not (to our knowledge) seem to have a special name, and are a little trickier to calculate. In the present context, to explicitly calculate $R_{\text {ninj }}$ one could either use brute force (e.g., Maple), or appeal to a simplification of the ADM formalism, ${ }^{4}$ or use the general commutator identity</p>

<h1>4 Warp-field stress-energy tensor</h1>
<p>In this section, we use the standard Einstein equations $G_{a b}=8 \pi T_{a b}$ and analyse the density, flux, and spatial components of the stress-energy.</p>
<h3>4.1 Density</h3>
<p>In the Eulerian orthonormal basis, using (3.19), for the density we have:</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{G_{n n}}{8 \pi}=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left(K^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>(Everyone agrees with this. This is the quantity that Lentz [1] and Fell-Heisenberg [3] eventually try to force to be positive. This is the only quantity Bobrick-Martire [2] explicitly calculate.) Now it is a mathematical identity that for any $3 \times 3$ matrix</p>
<p>$$
K^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)=2 \operatorname{tr}\left(\operatorname{cof}\left(K_{i j}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>That is, $K^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)$ is twice the trace of the cofactor matrix of the $3 \times 3$ matrix $K_{i j}$. This is most easily established by diagonalizing the $3 \times 3$ matrix. So in $(3+1)$ dimensions the Eulerian energy density is intimately related to the cofactor matrix of the extrinsic curvature. This is the "hidden geometric structure" alluded to by Fell-Heisenberg in reference [3], a curiosity which is unfortunately less useful than one might hope.</p>
<p>In the present context we have the fully explicit result</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left(\left(v_{i, i}\right)^{2}-v_{(i, j)} v_{(i, j)}\right)
$$</p>
<p>It is straightforward to rewrite this as a spatial divergence plus a negative semi-definite contribution:</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left{\partial_{i}\left(v_{i} v_{j, j}-v_{j} v_{i, j}\right)-v_{[i, j]} v_{[i, j]}\right}
$$</p>
<p>In terms of the vorticity $\omega_{i}=\epsilon_{i j k} v_{[j, k]}$ this becomes</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left{\partial_{i}\left(v_{i} v_{j, j}-v_{j} v_{i, j}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\left(\omega_{i} \omega_{i}\right)\right}
$$</p>
<p>or even</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left{\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot{\vec{v} K-(\vec{v} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla}) \vec{v}}-\frac{1}{2}(\vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{\omega})\right}
$$</p>
<p>That is, for the generic warp field, the Eulerian energy density is always the sum of a 3 -divergence plus a quantity that is negative semi-definite. We will have occasion to repeatedly use this result in subsequent discussion.</p>
<h1>4.2 Flux</h1>
<p>For the flux, in the Eulerian orthonormal basis, using (3.20) we have:</p>
<p>$$
f_{i}=\frac{G_{n i}}{8 \pi}=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left(K_{i j, j}-K_{, i}\right)=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left(v_{i, j j}-v_{j, j i}\right)=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left(\boldsymbol{\nabla}^{2} v_{i}-\boldsymbol{\nabla}_{i}(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \vec{v})\right)
$$</p>
<p>That is</p>
<p>$$
f_{i}=\frac{1}{16 \pi}(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \vec{v}))_{i}
$$</p>
<p>(Everyone agrees with this. Note that in the Lentz/Fell-Heisenberg [1, 3] framework $\vec{v}=\nabla \Phi$ is a gradient, so this co-moving Eulerian flux is identically zero.)</p>
<h3>4.3 Spatial stresses</h3>
<p>Finally, using (3.21), the spatial stresses are given by the $3 \times 3$ matrix:</p>
<p>$$
T_{i j}=\frac{G_{i j}}{8 \pi}=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left(\mathcal{L}<em i="i" j="j">{n} K</em>\right)}+K K_{i j}-2\left(K^{2<em n="n">{i j}-\left(\mathcal{L}</em>\right)
$$} K+\frac{1}{2} K^{2}+\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right) \delta_{i j</p>
<p>So for the average pressure, which we define to be $\bar{p}=\frac{1}{3} T_{i j} \delta^{i j}$, and noting that</p>
<p>$$
\left(\mathcal{L}<em i="i" j="j">{n} K</em>\right)}+K K_{i j}-2\left(K^{2<em n="n">{i j}\right) \delta^{i j}=\mathcal{L}</em>} K+K^{2}-2 \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)-K_{i j} \mathcal{L<em n="n">{n} \delta^{i j}=\mathcal{L}</em>
$$} K+K^{2</p>
<p>we find</p>
<p>$$
\bar{p}=\frac{1}{3} T_{i j} \delta^{i j}=\frac{1}{24 \pi}\left(-2 \mathcal{L}_{n} K-\frac{1}{2} K^{2}-\frac{3}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>It is furthermore useful to note that</p>
<p>$$
\rho+3 \bar{p}=-\frac{1}{4 \pi}\left(\mathcal{L}_{n} K+\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>$$
\rho+\bar{p}=\frac{1}{24 \pi}\left(-2 \mathcal{L}_{n} K+K^{2}-3 \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>These quantities will soon be seen to be useful when investigating violations of the SEC and NEC, respectively.</p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to also note that</p>
<p>$$
\nabla_{a} n^{a}=\partial_{a} n^{a}=K
$$</p>
<p>and so write</p>
<p>$$
\mathcal{L}<em a="a">{n} K=n^{a} \nabla</em>
$$} K=\nabla_{a}\left(K n^{a}\right)-K^{2</p>
<p>whence</p>
<p>$$
\bar{p}=-\frac{1}{24 \pi}\left(2 \nabla_{a}\left(K n^{a}\right)-\frac{3}{2} K^{2}+\frac{3}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>Equivalently</p>
<p>$$
\bar{p}=\rho-\frac{1}{12 \pi} \nabla_{a}\left(K n^{a}\right)
$$</p>
<p>That is, for the generic warp field, the average spatial pressure equals the energy density plus a 4 -divergence. We will have occasion to repeatedly use this result in subsequent discussion.</p>
<p>For completeness we point out that the trace-free part of the $3 \times 3$ spatial stress tensor, $\left(T_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}=T_{i j}-\frac{1}{3} \bar{p} \delta_{i j}$, can be computed in terms of the trace-free part of the extrinsic curvature, $\left(K_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}=K_{i j}-\frac{1}{3} K \delta_{i j}$.</p>
<p>We find</p>
<p>$$
\left(T_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left{n^{a} \partial_{a}\left(K_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}+K\left(K_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}+\partial_{[i} v_{k]}\left(K_{k j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}+\left(K_{i k}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}} \partial_{[j} v_{k]}\right}
$$</p>
<p>That is</p>
<p>$$
\left(T_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}=\frac{1}{8 \pi}\left{\partial_{a}\left[n^{a}\left(K_{i j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}\right]+\partial_{[i} v_{k]}\left(K_{k j}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}}+\left(K_{i k}\right)^{\mathrm{tf}} \partial_{[j} v_{k]}\right}
$$</p>
<p>Overall, we see that the generic Natário line element (2.1) is sufficiently simple to permit detailed and explicit calculations, while being sufficiently general to encompass almost all physically interesting warp drive spacetimes.</p>
<h1>5 Energy conditions</h1>
<p>The (classical point-wise) energy conditions are constraints one places on the stressenergy as a way of keeping unusual physics somewhat under control. The energy conditions all correspond, in some sense, to demanding that for some class of observers the energy density be non-negative.</p>
<p>Standard definitions are [31-33, 42-48]:</p>
<p>NEC: For all null vectors $k^{a}$ we demand $T_{a b} k^{a} k^{b} \geq 0$.</p>
<p>WEC: For all timelike vectors $V^{a}$ we demand $T_{a b} V^{a} V^{b} \geq 0$.</p>
<p>SEC: For all timelike vectors $V^{a}$ we demand $\left(T_{a b}-\frac{1}{2} T g_{a b}\right) V^{a} V^{b} \geq 0$.</p>
<p>DEC: For all future-pointing timelike vectors $V^{a}$ and $W^{a}$ we demand $T_{a b} V^{a} W^{b} \geq 0$. (The DEC in particular has a number of equivalent formulations [45].)</p>
<p>The standard linkages between energy conditions are [31-33, 42-48]:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{DEC} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{WEC} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{NEC} \
\mathrm{SEC} \Longrightarrow \mathrm{NEC}
\end{gathered}
$$</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{WEC} \stackrel{\text { 口 }}{\Longleftrightarrow} \mathrm{SEC}
$$</p>
<p>Despite claims made in early versions of [3], the WEC is not the weakest of the energy conditions.</p>
<p>Some examples of the subtleties involved are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A positive cosmological constant (positive vacuum energy density) satisfies the NEC and WEC, but not the SEC.</li>
<li>A negative cosmological constant (negative vacuum energy density) satisfies the NEC and SEC, but not the WEC.</li>
<li>Massive scalar fields, (classical, minimally coupled, with positive kinetic energy, and positive mass squared so that they are not tachyonic), satisfy the NEC and WEC but can violate the SEC. For example the standard scalar inflaton field of cosmological inflation satisfies the NEC and WEC but violates the SEC.</li>
<li>Classical Maxwell electromagnetism satisfies all the usual energy conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These examples suggest some caution when interpreting the physical significance of the energy conditions [49-58].</p>
<p>There are indications that NEC and WEC can be violated on microscopic (quantum) scales [59-77], though they seem to be satisfied by (reasonable) matter on macroscopic scales. In contrast the SEC appears to be observationally violated on the largest cosmological scales [51-57].</p>
<p>While for the purposes of this paper we will be focussing on applying these pointwise energy conditions specifically to warp drive spacetimes, it should be noted that these energy conditions also have direct applications to singularity theorems, positivemass theorems, traversable wormholes [78-87], topological censorship, and chronology protection [89-93].</p>
<p>Other less commonly used energy conditions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>TEC - trace energy condition: $\rho-3 p \geq 0$. Mainly of historic interest [49, 50]. Believed to be violated deep in the cores of neutron stars. Definitely violated by (hypothetical) "stiff matter" $\rho=p$, where (speed of sound) $=$ (speed of light).</li>
<li>FEC - flux energy condition: for all timelike observers, $V^{a}$, the flux $F^{a}=T^{a b} V_{b}$ is either timelike or null $[59,60]$.
(FEC is a weakening of DEC; that is, DEC $\Longrightarrow$ FEC.)</li>
<li>Averaged energy conditions (typically averaged along timelike or null geodesics) are weaker than their corresponding point-wise counterparts. The most useful of the averaged energy conditions is typically the ANEC (averaged null energy condition) where one averages the NEC along timelike geodesics using an affine parameterization $[43,71-77]$.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a cautionary example regarding application of the energy conditions, note that all three of the recent Lentz [1], Bobrick-Martire [2], and Fell-Heisenberg [3] articles merely assert the existence of one sub-class of timelike observers for which the energy density is positive. This is not enough to show that the WEC is satisfied. To explicitly see a specific example of this behaviour, let us work in an orthonormal basis. Take $\rho_{0}&gt;0$ and $\Gamma&gt;1$, and consider:</p>
<p>$$
T_{\hat{a} \hat{b}}=\rho_{0}\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; -\Gamma^{2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\Gamma^{2} &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -\Gamma^{2}
\end{array}\right]_{\hat{a} \hat{b}}
$$</p>
<p>Then in the natural rest frame $V^{\hat{a}}=(1 ; 0,0,0)^{\hat{a}}$ we have $\rho=T_{\hat{a} b} V^{\hat{a}} V^{\hat{b}}=\rho_{0}&gt;0$. But a moving observer, with 4 -velocity $V^{\hat{a}}=\gamma\left(1 ; v n^{i}\right)^{\hat{a}}$, where $n^{i}$ is any unit spatial 3 -vector, will see an energy density</p>
<p>$$
\rho=T_{\hat{a} \hat{b}} V^{\hat{a}} V^{\hat{b}}=\rho_{0} \gamma^{2}\left(1-\Gamma^{2} v^{2}\right)
$$</p>
<p>For a sufficiently rapidly moving but still subluminal observer, with $|v|&gt;1 / \Gamma$, the energy density will be seen to be negative. So in this example the WEC is violated.</p>
<p>What Lentz [1], and Bobrick-Martire [2], and Fell-Heisenberg [3] should be doing is to also calculate all of the stress components $T_{i j}$. It is not enough for them to just focus on $T_{n n}$ and $T_{n i}$.</p>
<p>One way of proceeding is to assume the stress-energy tensor is of Hawking-Ellis type I, see references [42-44, 60, 96-100], and work with the Lorentz-invariant eigenvalues $\left{\rho, p_{i}\right}$, the Lorentz-invariant eigen-energy-density and principal pressures, respectively.</p>
<p>Then it is a standard result that in terms of the Lorentz-invariant eigenvalues of a type I stress-energy tensor one has the two-way implications [42-44, 60, 96-100]</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NEC} &amp; \Longleftrightarrow \rho+p_{i} \geq 0 \
\mathrm{WEC} &amp; \Longleftrightarrow \rho+p_{i} \geq 0 \quad \&amp; \quad \rho&gt;0 \
\mathrm{SEC} &amp; \Longleftrightarrow \rho+p_{i} \geq 0 \quad \&amp; \quad \rho+\sum_{i} p_{i}&gt;0 \
\mathrm{DEC} &amp; \Longleftrightarrow\left|p_{i}\right| \leq \rho
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not know a priori whether or not the stress-energy for the warp drive is Hawking-Ellis type I in general, nor do the Eulerian observers typically diagonalize the stress-energy. So one has to be a little more indirect. (A limited result is this: For the zero-vorticity warp drives, because the Eulerian observers see zero flux $\vec{f}=0$, the stress-energy is block diagonal, and so of Hawking-Ellis type I. In particular, an even more limited and precise result is this: For a zero-vorticity warp drive, since the stress-energy is Hawking-Ellis type I we explicitly have</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{a b} V^{a} V^{b} &amp; =\gamma^{2}\left(\rho+\sum_{i} p_{i} \beta_{i}^{2}\right)=\gamma^{2}\left(\rho\left(1-\beta^{2}\right)+\sum_{i}\left[\rho+p_{i}\right] \beta_{i}^{2}\right) \
&amp; =\rho+\gamma^{2}\left(\sum_{i}\left[\rho+p_{i}\right] \beta_{i}^{2}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Thus, by considering all possible physical values of the $\beta_{i}$ (including relativistic values), we see that non-negative Eulerian density plus the NEC implies the WEC - so for checking the WEC in this situation, checking $\rho \geq 0$ is manifestly insufficient, one additionally needs to check the NEC $\left(\rho+p_{i} \geq 0\right)$ as well.)</p>
<p>In counterpoint, what the Eulerian observers do generically implement is a natural orthonormal frame in which</p>
<p>$$
T_{\dot{a} \dot{b}}=\left[\frac{\rho}{f_{i}} \frac{f_{j}}{T_{i j}}\right]
$$</p>
<p>NEC: Let us first investigate what we can say about the NEC. Let us take any two oppositely oriented null vectors $\ell_{+}^{\dot{a}}=\left(1,+\ell^{i}\right)^{\dot{a}}$, and $\ell_{-}^{\dot{a}}=\left(1,-\ell^{i}\right)^{\dot{a}}$, where $\ell^{i}$ is any</p>
<p>arbitrary unit spatial 3 -vector. Then the NEC would imply both</p>
<p>$$
T_{\dot{a} \dot{b}} \ell_{+}^{\dot{a}} \ell_{\pm}^{\dot{b}}=T_{\dot{a} \dot{b}}\left(1,+\ell^{i}\right)^{\dot{a}}\left(1,+\ell^{j}\right)^{\dot{b}}=\rho+2 f_{i} \ell^{i}+T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
T_{\dot{a} \dot{b}} \ell_{-}^{\dot{a}} \ell_{-}^{\dot{b}}=T_{\dot{a} \dot{b}}\left(1,-\ell^{i}\right)^{\dot{a}}\left(1,-\ell^{j}\right)^{\dot{b}}=\rho-2 f_{i} \ell^{i}+T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Averaging over these two equations, for any unit spatial 3 -vector</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{NEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Note the implication is one-way; effectively one throws away all information contained in the flux $f^{i}$. In terms of the eigenvalues of the 3 -stress we have ${ }^{5}$</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{NEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+\min \left{\lambda\left(T_{i j}\right)\right} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Now pick a triad $\ell_{A}^{i}$ of three mutually orthogonal unit vectors. Then for each member of the triad the NEC implies</p>
<p>$$
\rho+T_{i j} \ell_{A}^{i} \ell_{A}^{j} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Now average over the three members of the triad</p>
<p>$$
\rho+T_{i j}\left(\frac{1}{3} \sum_{A} \ell_{A}^{i} \ell_{A}^{j}\right) \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Thence, noting that by construction $\sum_{A} \ell_{A}^{i} \ell_{A}^{j}=\delta^{i j}$, we see</p>
<p>$$
\rho+T_{i j}\left(\frac{1}{3} \delta^{i j}\right) \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Defining, as usual, the average pressure as $\bar{p}=\frac{1}{3} T_{i j} \delta^{i j}$, (this works even if the 3 -stress $T_{i j}$ is not diagonal), we see that</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{NEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+\bar{p} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>As long as the 3 -stress is even slightly anisotropic we have $\min \left{\lambda\left(T_{i j}\right)\right} \neq \max \left{\lambda\left(T_{i j}\right)\right}$ so that we deduce the strict chain of inequalities</p>
<p>$$
\min \left{\lambda\left(T_{i j}\right)\right}&lt;\bar{p}&lt;\max \left{\lambda\left(T_{i j}\right)\right}
$$</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Thence in the presence of anisotropies we can make the slightly stronger strict inequality involving the average pressure $\bar{p}$ that</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{NEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+\bar{p}&gt;0
$$</p>
<p>The implication is again one-way. Note also that this argument has nothing specific to do with warp drives, it is purely a statement about how the NEC implies an easily checked inequality that depends only on the existence of some orthonormal basis. For our current purposes the point is that it is relatively easy to pick a specific direction and calculate $T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j}$, or to average over all directions and calculate $\bar{p}$.</p>
<p>WEC: Similar things can be said about the WEC, although now one takes some $0 \leq \beta&lt;1$ and considers two oppositely oriented timelike vectors $V_{ \pm}^{a}=\gamma\left(1, \pm \beta \ell^{i}\right)^{a}$. Then for any unit 3 -vector $\ell^{i}$, after averaging over the two orientations:</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{WEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+\beta^{2} T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Then averaging over a triad of unit vectors, for all $0 \leq \beta&lt;1$ one has</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{WEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+\beta^{2} \bar{p} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>By considering $\beta=0$ and the limit $\beta \rightarrow 1$ one has</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{WEC} \Longrightarrow \rho \geq 0 \quad \&amp; \quad \rho+\bar{p} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>The implication is again one-way. And the point is that $T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j}$ and $\bar{p}$ are relatively easy to calculate. As long as the 3 -stress is even slightly anisotropic, we can make the slightly stronger statement involving the average pressure $\bar{p}$ that</p>
<p>$$
\mathrm{WEC} \Longrightarrow \rho \geq 0 \quad \&amp; \quad \rho+\bar{p}&gt;0
$$</p>
<p>SEC: The SEC can be phrased in terms of the so-called "trace-reversed" stress-energy tensor $T_{a b}-\frac{1}{2} T g_{a b}$, as the condition $\left(T_{a b}-\frac{1}{2} T g_{a b}\right) V^{a} V^{b} \geq 0$, which in turn is equivalent to enforcing $T_{a b} V^{a} V^{b} \geq \frac{1}{2}(\rho-3 \bar{p})$. Then the SEC implies</p>
<p>$$
\rho+\beta^{2} T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j} \geq\left(1-\beta^{2}\right) \frac{1}{2}(\rho-3 \bar{p})
$$</p>
<p>This can be rearranged to</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{SEC} \Longrightarrow\left(1+\beta^{2}\right) \rho+3\left(1-\beta^{2}\right) \bar{p}+2 \beta^{2} T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>Averaging over the unit directions $\ell^{i}$, for all $0 \leq \beta&lt;1$ one has</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{SEC} \Longrightarrow\left(1+\beta^{2}\right) \rho+\left(3-\beta^{2}\right) \bar{p} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>By considering $\beta=0$ and the limit $\beta \rightarrow 1$ one has</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{SEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+3 \bar{p} \geq 0 \quad \&amp; \quad \rho+\bar{p} \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>The implication is again one-way. And the point is that $T_{i j} \ell^{i} \ell^{j}$ and $\bar{p}$ are relatively easy to calculate. As long as the 3 -stress is even slightly anisotropic, we can make the slightly stronger statement involving the average pressure $\bar{p}$ that</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{SEC} \Longrightarrow \rho+3 \bar{p}&gt;0 \quad \&amp; \quad \rho+\bar{p}&gt;0
$$</p>
<p>DEC: One version of the DEC, as reported by Hawking and Ellis [42, page 91], is formulated as the requirement that in any orthonormal frame the energy density dominates all the other components of the stress-energy tensor:</p>

\left|T^{\hat{a} \hat{b}}\right| \leq T^{\hat{t} \hat{t}}
$$</p>
<p>In our language this would be</p>
<p>$$
\left|f_{i}\right| \leq \rho \quad \&amp; \quad\left|T_{i j}\right| \leq \rho
$$</p>
<p>But in particular this implies</p>
<p>$$
|\bar{p}|=\left|\frac{1}{3} \sum_{i} T_{i i}\right| \leq \frac{1}{3} \sum_{i}\left|T_{i i}\right| \leq \rho
$$</p>
<p>That is</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{DEC} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad|\bar{p}| \leq \rho
$$</p>
<p>The implication is one-way, but the inequality is particularly clean and easy to work with. As long as the 3 -stress is even slightly anisotropic, we can make the slightly</p>
<p>stronger statement involving the average pressure $\bar{p}$ that</p>
<p>$$
\text { DEC } \quad \Longrightarrow \quad|\bar{p}|&lt;\rho
$$</p>
<h1>6 Timelike and null convergence conditions</h1>
<p>In applications the various energy conditions are, using the Einstein equations, typically immediately converted into purely geometrical convergence conditions such as the null convergence condition (NCC) and the timelike convergence condition (TCC) [42-45]. Within standard general relativity the NCC is equivalent to the NEC, and the TCC is equivalent to the SEC.</p>
<p>NCC: The NCC is the statement that for all null vectors $R_{a b} \ell^{a} \ell^{b} \geq 0$.</p>
<p>TCC: The TCC is the statement that for all timelike vectors $R_{a b} V^{a} V^{b} \geq 0$.
If one wishes to step outside the framework of standard general relativity then this adds a new level of speculative physics to the mix, and then the distinction between geometrical convergence conditions and dynamical energy conditions might become important. However it should be emphasized that in many (but not all) modified theories of gravity the equations of motion can be rearranged into the form</p>
<p>$$
(\text { Einstein tensor })=\text { (some "effective" stress-energy tensor). }
$$</p>
<p>Whenever this can be done, statements about the usual energy conditions in Einstein gravity can be carried over to statements about "effective" energy conditions in modified gravity.</p>
<h2>7 Violation of the energy conditions</h2>
<p>Now consider the energy conditions in the warp drive spacetimes. We shall provide a number of results, ultimately demonstrating the generic violation of the NEC (thereby automatically implying violations of the WEC, SEC and DEC)</p>
<h3>7.1 Alcubierre warp drive</h3>
<p>The key defining characteristic of the Alcubierre warp drive is that $v_{i}(x, y, z, t)$ is always pointing in some fixed direction, which can without loss of generality be taken to be</p>
<p>the $z$-direction $\hat{z}<em i="i">{i}=(0,0,1)</em>$. That is, take</p>
<p>$$
v_{i}(x, y, z, t)=v(x, y, z, t) \hat{z}_{i}
$$</p>
<p>(This is slightly more general than what Alcubierre actually did [9]; but it is the best way of summarizing the key aspects of the physics.) Then the extrinsic curvature is simply</p>
<p>$$
K_{i j}=\partial_{(i} v \hat{z}<em x="x">{j)}=\left[\begin{array}{cc|cc}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{2} \partial</em> v \
0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{2} \partial_{y} v \
\frac{1}{2} \partial_{x} v &amp; \frac{1}{2} \partial_{x} v &amp; \partial_{z} v
\end{array}\right]
$$</p>
<p>Consequently</p>
<p>$$
K=\hat{z}^{i} \partial_{i} v=\partial_{z} v
$$</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>$$
\left(K^{2}\right)<em i="i" j="j">{i j}=\frac{1}{2} K K</em>}+\frac{1}{4}(\partial v)^{2} \hat{z<em j="j">{i} \hat{z}</em> v
$$}+\frac{1}{4} \partial_{i} v \partial_{j</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>$$
\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} K^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(\partial v)^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{x} v\right)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{y} v\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{z} v\right)^{2}
$$</p>
<p>Then</p>
<p>$$
\rho=\frac{1}{16 \pi}\left(K^{2}-\operatorname{tr}\left(K^{2}\right)\right)=-\frac{1}{32 \pi}\left(\left(\partial_{x} v\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y} v\right)^{2}\right) \leq 0
$$</p>
<p>But to have a non-trivial warp bubble, we must avoid the situation where one has an everywhere flat Minkowski space. So we need $\left(\left(\partial_{x} v\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{y} v\right)^{2}\right)&gt;0$ somewhere in the spacetime, and so $\rho&lt;0$ at those particular locations, and is at best zero everywhere else. Therefore the Alcubierre warp bubble definitely violates the WEC.</p>
<p>In his original article [9] Alcubierre also claims (without proof): "In a similar way one can show that the strong energy condition is also violated." However in a more recent article by Alcubierre and Lobo [29], they explicitly prove the stronger result that the Alcubierre warp drive violates the NEC. (So SEC, WEC, and DEC are all definitely violated, because NEC is.)</p>
<p>Their proof is slightly tricky and depends (for a warp bubble moving in the $z$ direction) on the identity $G_{z z}=3 G_{n n}&lt;0$. This identity is established by explicit computation, there does not seem to be an obvious geometrical reason for it. From this geometrical identity we have $T_{z z}=3 \rho&lt;0$ in the comoving frame. Hence $\rho+T_{z z}=4 \rho&lt;0$ and the NEC is violated in all Alcubierre warp drives.</p>
