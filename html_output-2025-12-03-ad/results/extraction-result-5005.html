<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) are documented to struggle in settings that require complex reasoning. Nevertheless, instructing the model to break down the problem into smaller reasoning steps, or ensembling various generations through modifying decoding steps boosts performance. However, these methods assume that the input prompt is fixed and expect the decoding strategies to introduce the diversity needed for ensembling. In this work, we discuss how one can create and leverage variations of the input prompt as a means of diversity of thought. We propose a method that automatically improves prompt diversity by soliciting feedback from the LLM to ideate approaches that are apt for the problem. We then ensemble the diverse prompts in our method DIVSe (DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble) across multiple inference calls, or use diverse approaches within a single inference call; we call the latter IDiv-Se (In-call DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble). Apart from our approaches outperforming prior work, Div-SE (in particular) advances state-of-the-art performance on the challenging planning and graph coloring benchmarks. Our results improve the Pareto frontier of the accuracy-cost trade-off.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit state-of-the-art performance across a myriad of tasks, but their effectiveness is strongly influenced by prompt design (Anil et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023a; Nori et al., 2023). For complex reasoning tasks, the right prompt can enable LLMs to capitalize on task structure (Guidance, 2024), such as by facilitating memory (by externalizing thought processes), or through tractable problem decomposition (Zhou et al., 2024). However, existing prompt design</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>either relies on iterative trial-and-error (White et al., 2023), or is expensive (Lester et al., 2021).</p>
<p>Previous works identified two simple, yet general prompting principles to enable complex reasoning: (i) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and (ii) ensembling multiple solutions from diverse decoding paths. CoT prompting (Wei et al., 2022) improves performance by guiding the LLM to follow step-by-step reasoning. Selfconsistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2023) instead increases the stochasticity by modifying the decoding process and obtaining multiple completions, which are then ensembled.</p>
<p>However, combining the two principles raises limitations. First, inference is significantly more expensive due to numerous runs, each generating long completions with many reasoning steps. Next, it may be impermissible to modify the decoding process in some settings, such as commercial deployments. Finally, stochasticity-based methods do not directly guide the diversity at the level of thought or method, but rather at the token level. This poses limitations because linguistic token diversity does not always ensure diverse and independent solution approaches.</p>
<p>In this paper, we explore how to explicitly promote the diversity of thought while mitigating the aforementioned issues. Prior work by Li et al. (2023) highlights the importance of prompt diversity, but their notion of diversity is captured through variety in the few-shot examples provided with the prompt; ours focuses on the reasoning approach. We first solicit the LLM to produce multiple-highlevel reasoning approaches for problem-solving (e.g., method of elimination, visualization techniques etc. for math reasoning problems). We then leverage GPT-4 to augment few-shot examples used in prior work (Wei et al., 2022) into the corresponding approaches, whenever applicable.</p>
<p>We propose Div-SE (DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble) to extract and aggregate responses</p>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Diversity of Thought enhances the inference cost vs. accuracy trade-off. We compare DIV-SE and IDIV-SE with SC <em>Wang et al. (2023)</em> and CoT <em>Wei et al. (2022)</em> across three benchmarks. The x-axis indicates the total inference cost (as defined in § 3) on the benchmark using the given method, while the y-axis represents the LLM's performance. The few-shot-CoT setting is represented by filled gray dots, while the zero-shot-CoT setting is indicated by unfilled dots. Notice that for a fixed cost, our approaches always give better performance.</p>
<p>(via majority vote) across multiple inference calls (§ 2.2). Since distinct approaches introduce diversity at the "thought" level, our methodology results in improved ensemble accuracy. In Fig. 1, we show that it yields more accurate results across multiple reasoning benchmarks at a fixed inference cost, without modifying the decoding procedure. For instance, in the BlockSwordD 4/5 task <em>Valmeekam et al. (2022)</em>, DIV-SE improves the performance by 29.6 percentage points (p.p). However, this method still leverages multiple inference calls, which could be costly.</p>
<p>To reduce inference costs, we build on the observation that the approaches are often mutually independent, and can be combined in a <em>single prompt</em> to solicit multiple solutions <em>Cheng et al. (2023)</em>. Based on this premise, we propose IDIV-SE (Incall DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble; § 2.2), which combines all approaches within the same prompt and aggregates all resulting outputs to leverage diversity with a reduced cost. Fig. 1 demonstrates that this method obtains comparable accuracy to DIV-SE and better performance than prior work with lower inference costs.</p>
<p>We push the pareto frontier of the cost-accuracy trade-off of prompting strategies across multiple reasoning tasks (§ 4), outperforming both CoT and SC prompting on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This is evident from Fig. 1 for the AQUA-RAT <em>Ling et al. (2017)</em>, planning <em>Valmeekam et al. (2023)</em>, and graph coloring <em>Stechly et al. (2023)</em> benchmarks, where there is a performance improvement of 16.52, 29.6, and 82.5 p.p respectively. These improvements, some of which are state-of-the-art, show the potential of thought diversity to extract complex reasoning abilities from LLMs that were impossible to leverage otherwise. We will open source our code upon publication to encourage further research.</p>

(2021)</em>, a benchmark of grade-school math problems, some of the (generated) approaches can include <em>a</em><sup>1</sup> = "using visualizations", <em>a</em><sup>2</sup> = "working backwards", <em>a</em><sup>3</sup> = "using direct calculation", and <em>a</em><sup>4</sup> = "method of elimination".</p>
<p>Persona: In addition to specifying "how" to solve a reasoning problem, specifying a persona can also influence how the LLM behaves <em>Salewski et al. (2023)</em>. We denote this with the variable <em>p</em> e.g., <em>p</em><sup>1</sup> = "Thinking like Alan Turing", <em>p</em><sup>2</sup> = "Thinking like Math Professor" for the GSM8K task. Note that both approaches and personas are dependent on the reasoning problem.</p>
<h3>2.1 Using the LLM as a guide</h3>
<p>Proposed method for creating prompts, which we term DIVERSEPROMPTING is presented in Algorithm 1. Below, we will describe each step in more detail. At a high-level, we solicit feedback from the LLM on how to solve tasks.</p>
<p>Step 1+2. Extracting Approaches &amp; Personas: Note that LLMs trained on internet-scale data encode a significant knowledge from multiple do-</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>

<p>mains (Liang et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023). While LLMs may not be perfect at solving reasoning tasks, we hypothesize that they are helpful in providing high-quality intermediate feedback.</p>
<p>To extract approaches, we utilize the following methodology: (i) Randomly picking a question from the reasoning dataset $D$ we want to evaluate; and (ii) Creating an instruction prompt where we ask the LLM to generate the names of $b \in[1,5]$ approaches to solve the aforementioned question conforming to a predefined template (for easier post-processing). Refer to Figure 5 for an example of the prompt used.</p>
<p>We extract the part of the response that is compliant with the template and store it. We repeat this process $c$ times (obtaining of $c \cdot b$ candidate approaches), and pick the $n$ most frequent approaches to store in set $A^{1}$. This process is abstracted as method det_approaches( .).</p>
<p>One can repeat the above process used to extract relevant personas for a given reasoning task. However, we followed a simpler route and asked the model directly for relevant personas for a given task and then included them in the set of $m$ candidate personas $P$ used. This is abstracted as method det_personas( .). Note that no persona $(\phi)$ is also part of the persona set.</p>
<h2>Step 3. Choosing the Best Persona, Approach</h2>
<p>Pairs: The choice of persona and approaches introduces a principled way to promote diversity.</p>
<p>If the set of personas is $P$, and the set of approaches is $A$, the Cartesian product of $P$ and $A$ yields the total number of prompts. In practice, for each combination (denoted by $s_{i}$ ) of persona and approach, we evaluate the prompt formed using the composition on a small validation set $V^{1}$ and choose the best performing "size" elements on the given task ${ }^{2}$.
Step 4. Augmenting few-shot examples: Once the (subset of) approach and persona pairs are fixed, we ask the LLM to augment existing few-shot examples (denoted $F=\left{f_{1}, \cdots\right}$ ) with the given set of approaches. Specifically, we take the few-shot examples provided by Wei et al. (2022), and ask the LLM to solve them in the style of a chosen approach and persona pair (Fig.8); we term the</p>

<h3>2.2 Designing the Prompts</h3>
<p>Step 5. Prompt Composition: We create prompts for our approach using the best approach and persona pairs identified in step 3, and augmented fewshot examples from step 4 as shown in Fig. 2 and 4.</p>
<p>We now describe two techniques to generate prompts with the augmented demonstrations $(T)$ that have been accumulated.
Candidate 1. Div-SE: We first propose Div-SE (DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble), a method to execute the diverse set of approaches in different inference calls and aggregate their solutions. Apart from the question to be solved and the augmented few-shot examples, the final prompt contains a persona, approach, and additional instructions. One example is visualized in Fig. 4 (please refer to appendix for more examples of prompts: Fig. 9 through 16). Diversity is ensured through running inference with multiple prompts, each with a different approach and persona pairs and augmented few-shot examples. However, since the approaches are executed separately, generating a solution (via
aggregation of multiple responses) requires multiple inference calls, which can be costly.
Candidate 2. IDIV-SE: To further reduce the inference costs while promoting diversity, we propose IDIV-SE (In-call DIVerse reasoning path SelfEnsemble). In IDIV-SE, the final prompt is a composition of all approach and persona pairs and corresponding augmented few-shot examples, and the question to be solved. An example is presented in Fig. 2 (bottom left). More examples of prompts are presented in the appendix in Fig. 9 through 16. This noticeably decreases the number of calls to be made, since all few-shot examples are presented within the same prompt. We note that there might be error propagation due to the autoregressive nature of models. We evaluate this in detail in § 4.3.
Practicality. Crucially, DiversePrompting finds approaches that are general and reusable across similar reasoning problems. We reused the strategies identified for solving AQUA-RAT and Planning benchmark respectively in the MATH (counting and probability) and Graph Coloring benchmarks. This also reduces the cost of repeated evaluation on a separate evaluation set.
Aggregation. We aggregate the responses via majority vote for both prompting strategies. Other aggregation strategies can also be leveraged, such as utilizing the LLM itself to aggregate responses or weighted aggregation. In $\S 4.4$, we consider an aggregation strategy proposed by Yoran et al. (2023) and describe how compatible it is with our prompting approaches.</p>
<h2>3 Experiments</h2>
<p>We consider the following reasoning benchmarks. Arithmetic Reasoning: We use: (i) AQUARAT (Ling et al., 2017), a suite of algebraic word problems, (ii) GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), a benchmark of grade-school math problems described in natural language (involving elementary arithmetic operations), and (iii) MATH (Counting and Probability) (Hendrycks et al., 2021), a collection of math problems from which we choose only counting and probability as these are not covered by GSM8K and AQUA-RAT. For all datasets, we use the test split for evaluation, containing 254, 1319, and 474 questions respectively.
Planning Capabilities: We use the Blocksworld Planning benchmark proposed in Valmeekam et al. (2022, 2023). The benchmark has two datasets: one involves 3 blocks (BlockSWORLD 3, 100</p>
<p><img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Diversity of Thought enhances the inference cost and accuracy trade-off. We compare DIV-SE and IDIV-SE with SC (Wang et al., 2023) and CoT (Wei et al., 2022) across three benchmarks. The x-axis indicates the total cost (as defined in § 3) of running inference with the LLM on the benchmark using the given method, while the y-axis represents the LLM's performance. The FS-CoT setting is represented by filled gray dots, while the ZS-CoT setting is indicated by unfilled dots. Notice that for BLOCKSWORLD 3, despite being in the ZS-CoT setting, our approaches are more performant than the SC-s (FS-CoT) baseline.</p>
<p>instances), while the other dataset involves 4 or 5 blocks (BLOCKSWORLD 4/5, 500 instances).</p>
<p><em>Constraint Satisfaction Optimization</em>: We use the GRAPH COLORING benchmark (Stechly et al., 2023) containing 100 examples to test reasoning for constraint satisfaction. <em>Commonsense Reasoning</em>: We use COMMONSENSEQA (Talmor et al., 2019) which consists of generic multiple-choice questions elicited for testing common sense reasoning. We use the validation split containing 1,221 questions.</p>
<p><strong>Language Models.</strong> We evaluate our proposed methods on both GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023b). We also conduct an additional evaluation on LLaMA-2 70B (Touvron et al., 2023) to explore the performance of our technique on open-source LLMs. For the latter, we use meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf through the Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2019).</p>
<p><strong>Baselines.</strong> We consider Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and Self-Consistency (SC) (Wang et al., 2023) as our baselines. For CoT, we consider two settings: zero-shot (ZS) CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) (i.e., "Think step by step" is added to the prompt), and few-shot (FS) CoT (i.e., CoT with demonstrations). In our SC runs, we set the temperature T = 0.7 without top-k truncation and sample up to s ∈ [1, 10] outputs (denoted SC-s). For all other approaches, we set T = 0. We use ensembles of size 5 in IDIV-SE and DIV-SE for GSM8K and AQUA-RAT. For the planning, GRAPH COLORING, and COMMONSENSEQA benchmarks, we use a size of 3.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Metrics.</strong> We measure the accuracy on the task, and the generation inference cost. To measure the cost, we assume 1000 tokens are about 750 words<sup>3</sup>. For GPT-4 (8K) the input and output prices used to estimate inference cost are $0.03/1k tokens and $0.06/1k tokens, respectively. For GPT 3.5 Turbo (16K), the input and output prices used in the cost estimation are $0.003/1k (tokens) and $0.004/1k (tokens) respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Results Summary.</strong> include: Across most benchmarks we consider, our techniques provide substantial performance gains (e.g., 16.52, 82.5, and 14.3 p.p improvements for AQUA-RAT, GRAPH COLORING, and MATH respectively). They are also Pareto optimal (in terms of the utility vs. cost trade-off). For the challenging planning benchmark (BLOCKSWORLD 4/5), our techniques improve accuracy by 29.6 p.p achieving <em>state-of-the-art</em> performance. Using GPT-4 for BLOCKSWORLD 3, our approach (in the ZS-CoT setting) is substantially more effective than SC-10 (in the FS-CoT setting) at 4× lower cost (Figure 3 (center figure)).</p>
<p>Since prompts are chained together in IDIV-SE, error propagation is possible. Our evaluation on AQUA-RAT in § 4.3 suggests that even though error propagation is estimated as less than 6.5% for both models, these rates are comparable to differences in performance between DIV-SE and IDIV-SE. When combined with aggregation approaches that are capable of reasoning across the diverse generations (Yoran et al., 2023), we observe additional performance gains as shown in § 4.4. For the AQUA-RAT benchmark for instance, we see an accuracy of 67.7% for GPT-3.5 (3.23 p.p improvement to majority voting).</p>

<p>Table 2: Performance on AQUA-RAT, MATH (Counting and Probability), and COMmonsenseQA for GPT3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 in the ZS-CoT and few-shot-CoT settings respectively.</p>
<h3>4.1.1 Arithmetic reasoning via AQUA-RAT</h3>
<p>GPT-4 Results: In Table 2, we observe that Div-SE achieves an accuracy increase of 9.84 and 14.6 p.p in the FS-CoT (baseline accuracy of $71.9 \%$ ) and ZS-CoT (baseline of $70.47 \%$ ) settings, respectively. While the gains from IDIV-SE are nominal in ZSCoT, it achieves a boost of 7.7 p.p for FS-CoT.
GPT-3.5 Results: In Table 2, we see that Div-SE yields a gain of 14.23 and 16.52 p.p in the FSCoT (baseline of $57.48 \%$ ) and ZS-CoT (baseline of $59 \%$ ) settings, respectively. Within the FS-CoT setting, IDIV-SE gets an absolute increase of 7 p.p.</p>
<p>Note that Fig. 1 also displays the total inference cost. Both IDIV-SE and Div-SE are Pareto optimal, indicating their capacity to achieve a higher
accuracy while maintaining low costs.</p>
<h3>4.1.2 Counting and probabilistic reasoning via MATH</h3>
<p>GPT-4 Results: From Table 2, we see that Div-SE achieves an accuracy increase of 14.3 and 16.87 p.p in the FS-CoT (baseline of $66.46 \%$ ) and ZS-CoT (baseline of $62.24 \%$ ) settings, respectively. On the other hand, IDIV-SE achieves a boost of 5.54 and 9.76 p.p in the FS-CoT and ZS-CoT settings, respectively, over the baseline.
GPT-3.5 Results: From Table 2, we see that DivSE yields a gain of 21.84 and 13.04 p.p in the FSCoT (baseline of $30.38 \%$ ) and ZS-CoT (baseline of $31.90 \%$ ) settings, respectively. Likewise IDIVSE achieves a boost of 13.72 and 10.60 p.p in the FS-CoT and ZS-CoT settings, respectively.</p>
<h3>4.1.3 Planning via Blocksworld</h3>
<p>Setup: The benchmark provides both natural language and Planning Definition and Domain Language prompts (McDermott et al., 1998). We use natural language prompts in all the experiments. For the baseline runs, we introduce minor alterations to the prompt originally proposed by Valmeekam et al. (2023). These changes involve incorporating an explicit directive to prevent under-block movement and resolving minor language ambiguities we observed to be problematic during initial investigation. Furthermore, we reposition the initial condition and goal state information to the beginning of the prompt. The modified improved prompt is presented in Fig. 9.</p>
<p>We aggregate the plans through majority voting and utilize string matching for comparing the plans. As a result, we optimize the plan by eliminating the redundant "no-op" steps.
GPT-4 Results: We note that GPT-4 performs slightly better in a ZS setting, and use this to run all experiments. From Fig. 1, we observe that for Blocksworld 3, ZS-CoT records an accuracy of $70 \%$, while SC-10 reaches an accuracy level of $73 \%$. IDIV-SE enhances the absolute accuracy by 12 p.p above the ZS-CoT baseline, while Div-SE produces an impressive state-of-the-art accuracy of $94 \%$. An analysis of the six unsuccessful instances suggests the capacity for further performance improvement by increasing the size of the ensemble, as already two out of five current approaches generate accurate plans. For the Blocksworld 4/5 case, the ZS-CoT accuracy is $40 \%$, while SC-10 has an accuracy of $41.2 \%$. Here, IDIV-SE results</p>
<p>in an absolute gain of 17 p.p above the ZS-CoT baseline, and Div-SE too enhances performance, leading to $69.6 \%$. As outlined in Fig. 1 and 3, both IDIV-SE and DIV-SE achieve Pareto optimality. GPT-3.5 Results: The baseline performance on Blocksworld 3 is $6 \%$, and on Blocksworld $4 / 5$ is $0.6 \%$. We do not see any additional improvement using both IDIV-SE and DIV-SE. Qualitatively, we observe that during plan generation, GPT-3.5 fails to follow the restrictions provided as part of the problem instructions too often, leading to either infeasible or incorrect plans. This shows instruction following capabilities are crucial to the success of the methods proposed here.</p>
<h3>4.1.4 Constraint Satisfaction via GRAPH COLORING</h3>
<p>There may exist numerous non-optimal yet valid colorings for a given graph. Since exact string matching is not usable for identifying the majority solution from the ensembles of IDIV-SE and DiVSE, we employ the external, sound verifier (Stechly et al., 2023) to pick the correct solution.
GPT-4 Results: From Fig. 1, it is observed that ZS-CoT achieves an accuracy of $15 \%$, whereas SC-10 attains an accuracy level of $23 \%$. IDIV-SE improves the absolute accuracy by 59 p.p above the ZS-CoT baseline. Remarkably, Div-SE delivers a state-of-the-art accuracy of $97 \%$. Given that GPT-4's performance plateaus in the ZS setting, we chose to omit conducting the few-shot experiments. Summary: Methods in this work often demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on reasoning tasks. This is most significant in the planning and constraint satisfaction benchmarks, where the corresponding authors claimed immense difficulty for existing LLMs. Our work shows that statusquo prompt design approaches including chain of thought are too generic for these problems, and prompt customization (via DIVERSEPROMPTING) can yield substantial gains by guiding the chain of thought to the general nature of the problem.</p>
<h3>4.2 Open Source Models</h3>
<p>Due to the limited computational budget, we only performed experiments with the AQUA-RAT benchmark. Please refer to Appendix B for further details. Table 3 demonstrates the results for LLaMA-2 70B with 8-bit quantization. Div-SE and IDIV-SE demonstrate an improvement of over 10 p.p over the baseline in the FS-CoT settings. However, the gain in the ZS-CoT setting has been negligible. We hypothesize that this is partly due to model's lack of capabilities to both follow instructions and the mentioned approach in the absence of examples.</p>

<p>Table 3: Results on AQUA-RAT and LLaMA-2 70B.</p>
<h3>4.3 Errors \&amp; Prompt Utility</h3>
<p>Error Propagation: Due to the autoregressive nature of LLM decoding, early incorrect answers in IDIV-SE may get propagated to the latter ones. To quantify this, we select examples where the solution is incorrect and all five approaches produce the same erroneous answer. We focus only on these cases to see if e.g., a wrong conclusion in the initial approaches leaks into the following ones. Next, we attempt the last two approaches again in a separate session: if the LLM generates the same outcomes as in the original session (i.e., IDIV-SE setup) within 3 attempts, we consider it as no error propagation. However, if it does not produce the same answer within the 3 attempts, we interpret this as a case of error propagation since the change in answer could be attributed to the initial approaches with wrong answers in the chain. We measure this phenomenon on AQUA-RAT (FSCoT) on both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. We find that GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have error propagation rates of $6.2 \%$ and $5.5 \%$ respectively, which are comparable to performance differences between Div-SE and IDIV-SE, making error propagation one of the main explanatory hypotheses for the differences between the two methods. Reducing these error rates remains a challenging problem given the autoregressive nature of current LLMs.
Beyond Thinking Step by Step: The diverse approaches and personas we utilize not only enhance the performance in IDIV-SE and IDIV-SE, but are also independently superior to ZS-CoT. Table 4 highlights this effect, which showcases the importance of conditioning the model for solutions via DIVERSEPROMPTING.</p>

To this end, we store the responses generated by IDIV-SE, and request the model to meta reason over them in a different prompt and session. Table 5 suggests that the proposed reasoning paths contain rich information that is effectively exploited by the meta reasoning aggregation. Future post-hoc techniques may consider to learn the accuracy of the diverse prompting approaches, and weigh them accordingly. Nevertheless, the fact that techniques presented here provide visible improvements even with simple approaches like majority voting, demonstrates their added value independently from different aggregation algorithms.</p>
<h2>5 Related Work</h2>
<p>Prompt Optimization: Pryzant et al. (2023) models the prompts as optimizable discrete variables, and minimizes the loss of the reasoning task. Jones et al. (2023) optimize over the prompt space, but to identify failure modes. However, optimizationbased approaches often require the task to have a differentiable loss function, which is a strong condition. In our work, we utilize feedback from the LLM (not through gradients) during prompt design. Similarly to Cheng et al. (2023), IDIV-SE batches the responses for multiple queries within a prompt. Decoding Optimizations and Tools: Wang et al. (2023) replace the naive greedy decoding by sampling a diverse set of reasoning paths (e.g., through temperature sampling), and then selects the most consistent answer. Chen et al. (2022) express the reasoning process as a program, which is then delegated to an external tool. In our work, we neither change the decoding process nor assume the existence of trusted tools. This makes our solution directly applicable to black-box models.
Prompting Strategies: Brown et al. (2020) note that demonstrations to prompts, encoded as inputoutput pairs, produce drastic performance increase in larger LLMs. Wei et al. (2022) encourage internal dialogue by forcing the LLM to generate a sequence of intermediate steps for reasoning problems. This improves reasoning performance on larger LLMs (Nye et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022). Zhou et al. (2022) automatically break a complex problem into simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Across all these techniques, the common practice is to keep the prompts fixed, but aggregate responses across multiple trials by varying the temperature. In our work, we vary the input prompt itself. A work that is similar in spirit is that of Yoran et al. (2023), which instead of aggregating the response of multiple reasoning paths, forces the model to reason across them before aggregation. Another relevant work is that of Li et al. (2023), which shows the importance of prompt diversity. However, they rely on selecting few-shot demonstrations from a holdout set (which defines diversity in their method), without explicitly stating reasoning pathways.</p>
<h2>6 Conclusions</h2>
<p>In this work, we promoted diversity of thought as a principled prompting strategy and proposed methodologies that leverage the LLM as a guide to design a diverse set of approaches to solve complex reasoning tasks. Extracting solution approaches from LLMs themselves becomes a discovery mechanism that seeds and conditions generative solutions. Reported results on a variety of tasks confirm that there is a large space for improvement in com-</p>
<p>plex reasoning by uncovering the necessary skills and knowledge from LLMs through targeted and diverse prompting methods. These results demonstrated how promoting diversity can improve the Pareto frontier of accuracy-cost trade-off for current LLMs and yield state-of-the-art solutions for planning and mathematical reasoning tasks. We hope that future work will expand these results to complex tasks from other real-world applications.</p>
<h2>7 Limitations</h2>
<p>Our study mainly experimented with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models because of their instructionfollowing capabilities. While current open-source models have shown remarkable improvements to this end, they are still not able to reliably follow instructions relevant to complex reasoning tasks (e.g. state tracking, plan validity, constraint satisfaction). We hope that progress in the field will enable further experimentation in this direction.</p>
<p>In addition, we also observe that error propagation during autoregressive generation may sometimes negatively impact the performance of IDivSe, where all approaches are executed in order within the same prompt. Some of this could be addressed by explicitly instructing the model to forget about the previous solution but ultimately as long as previous generation history remains in context and short-term memory, error propagation risks may still need to be tracked and measured.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>
<h2>A Prompt used for DIVERSEPROMPTING</h2>
<p>Our diverse prompting strategy for IDIV-SE and DIV-SE is showcased in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 respectively. The instrumental prompt template that determines our approaches is presented in Fig. 5.</p>
<h2>B Model Details</h2>
<h2>B. 1 Open-Source Models</h2>
<p>We perform the Llama-2 70B experiments with a single 80GB A100 GPU. To fit the 70B model to a single A100, we use 8-bit precision through bitsandbytes (Dettmers et al., 2022a,b). Further, Dettmers et al. (2022a) reports no performance drop with this quantization method.</p>
<p>As the system prompt, we use You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. We perform inference with greedy decoding, having temperature $T=0$.</p>
<h2>C Additional Results</h2>
<p>In this section, we provide additional results on COMMONSENSEQA and GSM8K benchmarks.</p>
<h2>C. 1 Common sense via COMMONSENSEQA</h2>
<p>Table 2 presents the results of the experiments. Overall, the improvements in accuracy are relatively modest. This is likely because answering questions in COMMONSENSEQA does not demand as much reasoning and thought diversity as is required in some other benchmarks. In addition, the dataset also contains a number of ambiguous questions, which if read verbatim may have many plausible answers but the ground truth contains only one answer.</p>
<h2>C. 2 Arithmetic reseasoning via GSM8K</h2>
<p>GPT-4 Results: As shown in Fig. 6, accuracy on GSM8K have nearly plateaued, with the ZS-CoT and FS-CoT baselines achieving accuracies of $94 \%$ and $95 \%$ respectively. IDIV-SE does not produce any significant gains in either setting. On the other hand, DIV-SE reaches accuracy of $96.3 \%$ in both FS-CoT and ZS-CoT settings, providing a modest improvement.
GPT-3.5 Results: Here, the gains are more substantial. Compared to the ZS-CoT baseline of $76.11 \%$, IDIV-SE provides an improvement of 5.31 p.p. DIV-SE goes a step further, enhancing the accuracy by 10.39 p.p. In the FS-CoT setting, DIV-SE posts an accuracy improvement of 7.68 p.p (with a baseline accuracy of $81.4 \%$ ).</p>
<p>Fig. 3 (rightmost) presents the cost vs. accuracy trade-offs between IDIV-SE, DIV-SE, and SC. While the performance of SC does improve with the expansion of reasoning paths, both IDIV-SE and DIV-SE offer better trade-offs.</p>
<h2>D Evaluating Ensemble Sizes</h2>
<p>Figure 6 depicts the average accuracy of different ensemble sizes on GSM8K for both ZS-CoT and FS-CoT settings, utilizing GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. Similarly, Figure 7 demonstrates the average accuracy of various ensemble sizes on AquA for both ZS-CoT and FS-CoT settings, using GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. It is noteworthy that in both AQuA and GSM8K, even an ensemble of size three yields significant performance improvements over the baseline, which we attribute to the high diversity and independence of reasoning paths.</p>
<h2>E Prompt Templates</h2>
<p>The following section provides a comprehensive visual representation of the prompts used in our study. These prompts, depicted in Figures 9 through 16, were used in different settings and for the planning, AQuA, and graph coloring benchmarks, and incorporate various personas and approaches.</p>
<p>Figure 9 illustrates the prompt used in the baseline run, Figure 10 demonstrates the prompt employed when applying a Finite State Machine approach, Figure 11 depicts the prompt used when incorporating the persona of Alan Turing and an Action Rationale approach, and lastly, Figure 12 shows the prompt used when applying the persona of Alan Turing and the Progressive Block Placement approach in the zero-shot setting for the planning benchmark.</p>
<p>Figure 13 illustrates the algebraic approach, while Figure 14 and Figure 15 demonstrate the prompts incorporating the personas of Alan Turing and Dr. Patel, a renowned mathematician, respectively, in the few-shot-CoT setting for the AQuA benchmark.</p>

<h1>Input Prompt</h1>
<p>Solve the problem accurately using {approach name}.
Question: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40 . If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers
Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 45 (C) 65 (D) 78 (E) 64
A: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10 . So the new mean would be 50 . The answer is $(A)$.</p>
<p>Approach <using \{approach name\} >:</p>
<h2>Augmented Few-shot Examples</h2>
<h2>Approach <using visualization>:</h2>
<p>To solve this problem using visualization, let's consider the given information and the effect of adding 10 to each number on the average.</p>
<ol>
<li>The average of 15 numbers is 40 . This means that the sum of these 15 numbers is 15 * $40=600$.</li>
<li>Now, we add 10 to each number. Since there are 15 numbers, the total added is $15 *$ $10=150$.</li>
<li>The new sum of the 15 numbers is $600+150=750$.</li>
<li>To find the new average, we divide the new sum by the number of values, which is $750 / 15=50$. So, the mean of the numbers after adding 10 to each number is 50 . The answer is: (A) 50</li>
</ol>
<h2>Approach <using logical reasoning>:</h2>
<p>We know that adding the same constant to each number in a set will increase the average by that constant. In this case, we are adding 10 to each number, so the average will increase by 10 . New average $=40+10=50$ The answer is: (A) 50</p>
<h2>Approach <using elimination strategy>:</h2>
<p>We know that adding 10 to each number will increase the average by 10 . So, we're looking for an answer choice that is 10 more than the original average of 40 .
(A) 50 is 10 more than 40 .
(B) 45 is only 5 more than 40 .
(C) 65 is 25 more than 40 .
(D) 78 is 38 more than 40 .
(E) 64 is 24 more than 40 .</p>
<p>Only (A) 50 is exactly 10 more than the original average of 40 , so that's the correct answer. The other choices can be eliminated because they are not 10 more than the original average.</p>
<h2>Approach <using algebra>:</h2>
<p>Let's denote the sum of the 15 numbers as $S$. Since the average of the 15 numbers is 40 , we can write the equation: $S / 15=40 S=40 * 15=600$ Now, we add 10 to each number, so the new sum is $S+15 * 10=600+150=750$. The new average is: New average $=750 / 15=50$ The answer is: (A) 50</p>

<p>Question: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40 . If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers
Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 45 (C) 65 (D) 78 (E) 64
Approach: <using algebra>
Let's denote the sum of the 15 numbers as $S$. Since the average of the 15 numbers is 40 , we can write the equation: $S / 15=40 S=40 * 15=600$ Now, we add 10 to each number, so the new sum is $S+15 * 10=600+150=750$. The new average is: New average $=750 / 15=50$
The answer is: (A) 50
Question: If a / b = 3/4 and $8 a+5 b=22$, then find the value of a.
Answer Choices: (A) $1 / 2$ (B) $3 / 2$ (C) $5 / 2$ (D) $4 / 2$ (E) $7 / 2$
Approach: <using algebra>
To solve the given problem, we can use substitution. Since a / b = 3/4, we can write that as: $a=3 b / 4$ Now, substitute this expression for a into the second equation: $8(3 b / 4)+$ $5 b=22$ Simplify and solve for $b: 6 b+5 b=2211 b=22 b=2$ Now that we have the value of $b$, we can find the value of $a: a=3 b / 4 a=3(2) / 4 a=6 / 4 a=3 / 2$ So, the value of a is (B) $3 / 2$.
The answer is: (B) $3 / 2$

Approach: <using algebra>
Using the formula distance $=$ speed $\times$ time, we can calculate the distance as follows:
Distance $=20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr} \times 2.5 \mathrm{hr}=50 \mathrm{~km}$ So, the closest answer choice is (e) 50 km .
The answer is: (e) 50 km
Question: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500 ?
Answer Choices: (a) 1156 (b) 1392 (c) 1480 (d) 1562 (e) 1788
Approach: <using algebra>
Let's break down the number of keystrokes needed into groups based on the number of digits: One-digit numbers (1-9): There are 9 one-digit numbers, so we need 9 keystrokes. Two-digit numbers (10-99): There are 90 two-digit numbers, each requiring 2 keystrokes, so we need $90 * 2=180$ keystrokes. Three-digit numbers (100-500): There are 401 three-digit numbers ( $500-100+1$ ), each requiring 3 keystrokes, so we need $401 * 3=$ 1203 keystrokes. Now let's add up the keystrokes from all groups: $9+180+1203=$ 1392. Therefore, the closest option is (b) 1392.</p>
<p>The answer is: (b) 1392</p>

<p>Question: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40 . If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers
Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 45 (C) 65 (D) 78 (E) 64
Approach : <think like Alan Turing>
Let's analyze the problem step by step: The average of 15 numbers is 40 . So, the sum of these 15 numbers is $15 * 40=600.10$ is added to each number. Now, since there are 15 numbers, the total increase in the sum will be $15 * 10=150$. The new sum of these 15 numbers will be $600+150=750$. To find the new mean, divide the new sum by the total number of values, which is 15 . New mean $=750 / 15=50$. Therefore, the closest option to the new mean is (A) 50 .
The answer is: (A) 50
Question: If a / b $=3 / 4$ and $8 \mathrm{a}+5 \mathrm{~b}=22$, then find the value of a.
Answer Choices: (A) $1 / 2$ (B) $3 / 2$ (C) $5 / 2$ (D) $4 / 2$ (E) $7 / 2$
Approach : <think like Alan Turing>
Let us analyze the given information and solve the problem step by step. We are given that a / b $=3 / 4$, which can be written as a $=(3 / 4) <em>$ b. We are also given the equation $8 \mathrm{a}+5 \mathrm{~b}=22$. Substitute the value of a from step 1 into the equation from step $2: 8^{</em>}$ $(3 / 4) * b+5 b=22$ Simplify the equation: $6 b+5 b=22$ Combine the terms and solve for b: $11 \mathrm{~b}=22 \mathrm{~b}=2$ Now that we have the value of b, let's find the value of a using the equation from step 1: $a=(3 / 4) * b a=(3 / 4) * 2$ Simplify to find the value of $a: a=$ $3 / 2$ Thus, the value of a is $3 / 2$, which corresponds to answer choice (B).
The answer is: (B)
Question: A person is traveling at $20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?
Answer Choices: (a) 53 km (b) 55 km (c) 52 km (d) 60 km (e) 50 km
Approach : <think like Alan Turing>
To find the distance, we can use the formula: distance $=$ speed $\times$ time. In this case, the speed is $20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ and the time is 2.5 hours. Distance $=20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr} \times 2.5 \mathrm{hr}=50 \mathrm{~km}$ So, the closest option is (e) 50 km .
The answer is: (e) 50 km
Question: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?
Answer Choices: (a) 1156 (b) 1392 (c) 1480 (d) 1562 (e) 1788
Approach : <think like Alan Turing>
To determine the number of keystrokes needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500, let's break it down by digit count: One-digit numbers (1-9): There are 9 one-digit numbers, each requiring 1 keystroke. Total: 9 keystrokes. Two-digit numbers (10-99): There are 90 two-digit numbers, each requiring 2 keystrokes. Total: $90 * 2=180$ keystrokes. Three-digit numbers (100-500): There are 401 three-digit numbers, each requiring 3 keystrokes. Total: $401 * 3=1203$ keystrokes. Adding the keystrokes for each group, we get: $9+180+1203=1392$ keystrokes. Thus, the closest option is (b) 1392
The answer is: (b) 1392</p>

<p>Question: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40 . If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers
Answer Choices: (A) 50 (B) 45 (C) 65 (D) 78 (E) 64
Approach : <think like Dr. Patel>
Let's consider the problem step by step. John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40 . To find the sum of these 15 numbers, we can use the formula: Sum $=$ Average $\times$ Number of elements Sum $=40 \times 15$ Sum $=600$ Now, 10 is added to each of the 15 numbers. So, we can find the new sum by adding $10 \times 15=150$ to the original sum: New Sum $=600$ +150 New Sum $=750$ To find the new average (mean), we can use the formula: New Average $=$ New Sum $\div$ Number of elements New Average $=750 \div 15$ New Average $=50$ The answer is: (A) 50</p>
<p>Question: If a / b $=3 / 4$ and $8 \mathrm{a}+5 \mathrm{~b}=22$, then find the value of a.
Answer Choices: (A) $1 / 2$ (B) $3 / 2$ (C) $5 / 2$ (D) $4 / 2$ (E) $7 / 2$
Approach : <think like Dr. Patel>
To solve this problem, first we can rewrite the equation a / b $=3 / 4$ as a $=(3 / 4) \mathrm{b}$. Now we can substitute this expression for a into the second equation: $8 \mathrm{a}+5 \mathrm{~b}=22$. Substitute a with $(3 / 4) \mathrm{b}: 8(3 / 4) \mathrm{b}+5 \mathrm{~b}=22$ Simplify the equation: $6 \mathrm{~b}+5 \mathrm{~b}=22$ Combine the terms: $11 \mathrm{~b}=22$ Now, divide both sides by $11: \mathrm{b}=2$ Now that we have the value of b , we can find the value of a using the equation $\mathrm{a}=(3 / 4) \mathrm{b}: \mathrm{a}=(3 / 4)(2) \mathrm{a}=3 / 2$ The value of a is $3 / 2$. So, the correct answer is (B) $3 / 2$.
The answer is: (B) $3 / 2$
Question: A person is traveling at $20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ and reached his destiny in 2.5 hr then find the distance?
Answer Choices: (a) 53 km (b) 55 km (c) 52 km (d) 60 km (e) 50 km
Approach : <think like Dr. Patel>
To find the distance, we can use the formula: Distance $=$ Speed $\times$ Time Here, the speed is given as $20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ and the time taken is 2.5 hours. So, we can plug these values into the formula: Distance $=20 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr} \times 2.5 \mathrm{hr}$ Distance $=50 \mathrm{~km}$
The answer is: (e) 50 km
Question: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?
Answer Choices: (a) 1156 (b) 1392 (c) 1480 (d) 1562 (e) 1788
Approach : <think like Dr. Patel>
To determine the number of keystrokes needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500, let's break down the problem by analyzing the number of digits in each range: For numbers $1-9$, there are 9 numbers with 1 digit each, requiring 9 keystrokes. For numbers 10-99, there are 90 numbers with 2 digits each, requiring $90 * 2=180$ keystrokes. For numbers 100-499, there are 400 numbers with 3 digits each, requiring $400 * 3=1200$ keystrokes. For the number 500, it has 3 digits, requiring 3 keystrokes. Now, we can sum up the keystrokes for each range: 9 (for 1-9) +180 (for 10-99) +1200 (for 100-499) +3 (for $500)=1392$ keystrokes.
The answer is: (b) 1392</p>
