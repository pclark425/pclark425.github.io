                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language tasks. However, evaluating their alignment with human preferences remains a challenge. To this end, we propose a comprehensive human evaluation framework to assess LLMs' proficiency in following instructions on diverse real-world tasks. We construct a hierarchical task tree encompassing 7 major areas covering over 200 categories and over 800 tasks, which covers diverse capabilities such as question answering, reasoning, multiturn dialogue, and text generation, to evaluate LLMs in a comprehensive and in-depth manner. We also design detailed evaluation standards and processes to facilitate consistent, unbiased judgments from human evaluators. A test set of over 3,000 instances is released, spanning different difficulty levels and knowledge domains. Our work provides a standardized methodology to evaluate human alignment in LLMs for both English and Chinese. We also analyze the feasibility of automating parts of evaluation with a strong LLM (GPT-4). Our framework supports a thorough assessment of LLMs as they are integrated into real-world applications. We have made publicly available the task tree, TencentLLMEval dataset, and evaluation methodology which have been demonstrated as effective in assessing the performance of Tencent Hunyuan LLMs. By doing so, we aim to facilitate the benchmarking of advances in the development of safe and human-aligned LLMs.</p>

TencentLLMEval: A Hierarchical Evaluation of Real-World Capabilities for Human-Aligned LLMs
9 Nov 2023742EA636E71FDA8AF1B73B88DE68FF02arXiv:2311.05374v1[cs.CL]
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across various natural language tasks.However, evaluating their alignment with human preferences remains a challenge.To this end, we propose a comprehensive human evaluation framework to assess LLMs' proficiency in following instructions on diverse real-world tasks.We construct a hierarchical task tree encompassing 7 major areas covering over 200 categories and over 800 tasks, which covers diverse capabilities such as question answering, reasoning, multiturn dialogue, and text generation, to evaluate LLMs in a comprehensive and in-depth manner.We also design detailed evaluation standards and processes to facilitate consistent, unbiased judgments from human evaluators.A test set of over 3,000 instances is released, spanning different difficulty levels and knowledge domains.Our work provides a standardized methodology to evaluate human alignment in LLMs for both English and Chinese.We also analyze the feasibility of automating parts of evaluation with a strong LLM (GPT-4).Our framework supports a thorough assessment of LLMs as they are integrated into real-world applications.We have made publicly available the task tree, Ten-centLLMEval dataset, and evaluation methodology which have been demonstrated as effective in assessing the performance of Tencent Hunyuan LLMs 1 .By doing so, we aim to facilitate the benchmarking of advances in the development of safe and human-aligned LLMs.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, leading to transformative applications across various domains and tasks.These models, powered by advanced deep learning techniques, are trained on massive amounts of textual data, thereby exhibiting remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating human language (Qiu et al., 2020;Liu et al., 2023b;Chang et al., 2023).Numerous studies show that LLMs demonstrate significant potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) by exhibiting generalization power across various tasks (e.g., knowledge-based question answering, creative writing, code generation, logical reasoning, multi-turn conversation, etc.).</p>
<p>After the release of ChatGPT, tech giants have raced to develop their own human-aligned LLMs, such as Anthropic's Claude (Bai et al., 2022), Microsoft's Bing Chat, and Google's Bard (Manyika, 2023).To determine if a large model aligns well with human preferences and possesses comprehensive capabilities, it is critical to establish a thorough evaluation framework to systemically inspect the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs.Recognizing the importance of evaluating LLMs, researchers have proposed various methodologies and frameworks to assess LLMs' capabilities, limitations, and potential biases.Before ChatGPT, automated evaluation was the dominant evaluation method adopted by large research institutions (Chang et al., 2023), such as Google, Meta, and Microsoft, due to their fast and cheap characteristics.These methods rely on metrics such as perplexity and accuracy on benchmark datasets to evaluate the model's ability.For example, MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) is a general benchmark mainly consisting of multi-choice problems, and the Big-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) is a set of NLP tasks proposed for different tasks.More recently, AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023), C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023), and M3KE (Liu et al., 2023a) collect various questions from a range of subjects or standardization examinations and convert them into multi-choice question-answering to make it easy to calculate accuracy.</p>
<p>However, these evaluation benchmarks have two major limitations.First, they mainly focus on evaluating the ability of models to answer closed-form questions with short answers (i.e., multiple choices or short phrases).The evaluation framework constructed in this way cannot assess the model's ability to generate coherent, contextually relevant, and unbiased long texts (Liu et al., 2023b).Second, the questions (prompts) are usually collected at the subject level to cover different topics (e.g., linguistics, biology, physics, and social science) instead of at the user-interested task level.As we know, users often ask AI assistants to accomplish specific goals, ranging from helping users compose a story for creative writing or correcting grammar errors in a sentence to generating a piece of code for software development or solving a complicated mathematical problem.Therefore, there is a pressing need to re-evaluate and re-design the evaluation framework so that it can provide a comprehensive picture of the model's capabilities, especially in real-world scenarios where user needs are diverse and complex.</p>
<p>Human evaluation is naturally best suited for assessing current large models, as these LLMs are inherently trained using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017) to align with human preferences.Overall, the difficulties that stand in the way of human evaluation include the following: 1) How to clearly define and construct a dataset to evaluate the instruction-following ability of LLMs on diverse tasks comprehensively.</p>
<p>2) How to organize numerous evaluators to control evaluation quality and determine the credibility of human evaluation.This requires well-defined assessment criteria, a strict quality control process for evaluators, and a measurable and controllable consistency metric.3) What kind of evaluation protocol should be used to evaluate human preferences, and how to analyze to obtain reasonable results when using different evaluation protocols.</p>
<p>In order to better evaluate human-aligned LLMs, we make efforts in the following aspects.(1) We introduce an evaluation benchmark that specifically and comprehensively evaluates human-preferencealigned LLMs.Compared with the previous datasets or evaluation benchmarks that were biased toward traditional tasks with short or limited answers, our benchmarks build a three-level hierarchy task tree to construct a test dataset, consisting of 7 major areas, 200 categories, and 800 tasks.Our benchmark includes a range of difficulty levels, from basic to advanced to expert, ensuring a thorough evaluation across various levels of human expertise.By introducing a structured hierarchy of tasks, we ensure that the evaluation is not just limited to the surface-level capabilities but dives deep into their understanding and instruction-following abilities.This granularity in evaluation is crucial as LLMs become more integrated into real-world applications where the demands are multifaceted and complex.We release the 3,000+ test set.Unlike previous benchmarks which mainly focus on a single or a few aspects of LLMs' capability, our dataset covers a wide scope of LLMs' capabilities.(2) We formulate the evaluation standard and process in a detailed way, making human evaluation simple, feasible, quality-controllable, and ultimately more reliable.The proposed evaluation standards and process can control the quality of annotation easily, mitigate most kinds of biases, and make the annotation progress and cost manageable.The detailed standards and processes we propose will ensure that human evaluators across different backgrounds and expertise levels can provide feedback in a uniform manner.(3) Our evaluation method is proposed for both Chinese and English, which addresses the gap in Chinese human-aligned LLMs.We hope to promote the development and evaluation of LLMs in low-resource languages.(4) Finally, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the feasibility of using a strong LLM (i.e., GPT-4) to replace human evaluation partially.Through our results, people can gain more insights into the possibility and challenges of using GPT-4 as the automatic evaluator, which may lead to faster, more scalable, and cost-effective evaluation processes.</p>
<p>We believe that these efforts will pave the way for a more standardized, objective, and holistic evaluation of human-aligned LLMs across different languages.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>In this section, we initially present the Task Tree in Section 2.1 that defines the structure of our test data, which is crucial for comprehensive and indetailed evaluation and analysis of the LLMs on many aspects of its skill spectrum.The subsequent data construction process is detailed in Section 2.2.We then discuss evaluator organization and evaluation quality management in Section 2.3, providing the criteria for human evaluation, evaluator scoring methodology, and procedures for addressing anomalies.Lastly, Section 2.4 elucidates our eval-uation protocols, encompassing data distribution, win rate calculation, and quality supervision.</p>
<p>Task Tree</p>
<p>The Task Tree is a hierarchical organization of tasks LLMs are expected to be able to perform.The task tree is designed to cover as many real tasks from LLM users as we can, which provides a fundamental and comprehensive structure of the expected capabilities of LLMs for evaluation.The tasks in the Task Tree not only cover fundamental and essential abilities (e.g., semantic understanding, knowledge proficiency, ethics, and robustness) but also include many complex and high-level capabilities of the model (e.g., long-context memory, creativity, longcontext reading comprehension, chain-of-thought reasoning, and complex logical reasoning).The Task Tree serves as a guiding structure for test data creation, ensuring its wide and balanced coverage of LLM skills.</p>
<p>Principles of Task Tree Design</p>
<p>To guarantee comprehensive evaluation, the Task Tree is constructed following four core principles:</p>
<p>Coverage of Core Abilities: The selected evaluation tasks should cover all fundamental and complex abilities of large language models.The abilities should not be overly specific to a scenario or general to all scenarios.</p>
<p>Task Importance: The volume of evaluation questions within each task category should be proportional to the importance and complexity of that category.The importance level should reflect the popularity of tasks in real online systems.</p>
<p>User-driven Approach: The task definitions and the test items should accurately reflect real-world user demands and scenarios.</p>
<p>Tree Structure: The structure of the Task Tree is a tree, meaning that all tasks are arranged in a hierarchical manner.All terminal nodes are tasks to be evaluated, and all middle nodes are categories of task clusters.This helps make the Task Tree concise and intuitive.</p>
<p>Multi-source: The tasks on the Task Tree should come from many different sources, such as public NLP datasets, ontologies from question-answering websites, public LLM-used datasets and expert knowledge.</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows the mapping relationship between the 7 major areas of the task tree and some representative evaluation capabilities of large language models.We cluster all tasks under 7 ma-jor areas: NLP Basics, Text Generation, Dialogue, Reasoning, Domain Expertise, Safety, and Plugins2 .Within the 7 major areas, there are more than 200 categories, which are further broken down into more than 800 tasks.Please refer to Appendix B for more information.</p>
<p>Dataset Construction</p>
<p>To collect evaluation questions that are practical and applicable to real-world scenarios, we ask human users to write questions for each task.These users were specifically asked to write questions that align with the task's objectives.The instruction for each task contains a task description, question generation scheme, question examples, and example reference answers.These instructions are used to guide the dataset writers, aiding them in grasping the essence of each task.To further enhance the relevance and diversity of the questions generated for each task, we engaged 50 human users with different backgrounds.Please refer to Appendix D for more details.</p>
<p>Task Description: Introduces the background of the task and explains what needs to be completed.</p>
<p>Question Generation Scheme: Provides the direction for sourcing questions, and lists several question templates to make the generation of the question set more diverse and variable.</p>
<p>Example Qestions: Specific question cases to help understand the task and the format of the prompts.</p>
<p>Reference Answers: The reference answers for example questions.We ask the users to write down their expected answers as reference answers so that those answers can be used to facilitate evaluators to quickly judge the quality of the answers.Note that reference answers only assist evaluators in understanding the real intent of the questions, but they are not the only gold standard.</p>
<p>To guarantee data quality, we also conduct a multi-stage review process, which includes the preliminary, secondary, and final reviews.In this way, we construct our evaluation dataset comprising over 75,000 QA pairs, of which we release 3,000+ to the public.Some detailed cases can be found in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Criteria</p>
<p>Following the construction of our dataset, it is crucial to develop the evaluation metrics that help determine the quality of model outputs on a test case.</p>
<p>To ensure precise, reproducible, and comprehensive measures, we extend the conventional 3H (i.e., Helpful, Honest, and Harmlessness) to seven prioritized criteria, which we believe offer a more accurate and detailed assessment for large language models.Safety: It's important that LLMs adhere to ethical and legal standards to ensure the safety and well-being of users.This implies that any content relating to discrimination, pornography, violence, or unlawful behaviors is deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>Neutrality: Outputs should remain unbiased, free from racial or any form of discrimination, and avoid any subjective inclinations.Models must be free from bias to promote fairness, equality, and accurate representation.</p>
<p>Factual Correctness: It is essential to ensure that the information provided by the model is in line with known truths to maintain its credibility and trustworthiness.Output contents should be aligned with truth and common-sense knowledge.</p>
<p>Instruction Following: When users send queries, they seek direct, relevant answers.Therefore, answers provided by the model should directly correspond with the user's query and explicitly follow the user's instructions.</p>
<p>Logical Consistency: Consistency establishes trust and allows users to rely on the model's output for decision-making.Therefore, the model's responses should flow coherently without selfcontradictions.</p>
<p>Language Fluency: Clear and fluent language is critical to ensure the usability of the model's outputs.Thus, the model's outputs should be clear, free from typos and grammatical errors, and should be comprehensible easily.</p>
<p>Informativeness: The output should be informative and comprehensive, covering all key points.For mathematical queries and logical reasoning questions, a step-by-step reasoning process is expected.Nevertheless, the answer should avoid irrelevant or redundant content.</p>
<p>Evaluation Protocol</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss two evaluation protocols for human assessment: pairwise comparison and single model scoring.</p>
<p>Data Sampling Strategy</p>
<p>In each evaluation, we randomly sample questions from the full TencentLLMEval dataset according to tasks.We consider two types of evaluations: major evaluation which is used for big model version release and regular evaluation which aims at fast model iteration.For major version evaluation, we use 30+ overlap questions (mainly objective questions) to identify unreliable evaluators.Nonoverlapping questions are evenly distributed among evaluators based on tasks.For daily iteration evaluation, we don't involve any overlap questions.Each question is evaluated by three individuals to guarantee annotation quality.</p>
<p>Pairwise Comparison</p>
<p>Next, we discuss the fundamental principle of model answer comparison and elaborate on the quality control process that we have implemented, including overlapping question verification, GSB score regulation, re-distribution of unsatisfactory samples, and consistency monitoring.Furthermore, we provide an explanation of the methodology used to determine the win rate, as well as an evaluation of the associated costs.</p>
<p>Basic Comparison Principle</p>
<p>To compare two models A and B, evaluators have four options to choose from: 1) A is better, 2) B is better, 3) they are equally good, or 4) they are equally bad.In the evaluation process, the models are evaluated anonymously (answers are randomized to present to annotators).If evaluators encounter professional questions that they cannot judge, they are allowed to skip those questions, which will be reviewed later by domain experts.If each of the three individuals assigns a different label to a particular instance, that instance will be forwarded to a second-stage inspector for further review.To ensure fast results return, there is no overlapping or second-stage inspecting in daily model iteration evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluator Quality Control Using Overlapping Questions Overlapping questions have objective answers that may not be immediately apparent; they are used to filter out unreliable annotators.If 80% of the responses to an overlapping question are consistent, we consider it as the correct answer, and all other responses to that question are considered incorrect.We count the number of incorrect responses from each evaluator, and evaluators who have more than three incorrect responses are included in the list of disqualified evaluators for overlapping questions.</p>
<p>GSB Score Cotrolling Calculate the GSB score of each evaluator:
z = gsb − µ σ , GSB = #A − #B #A + #B + #EG + #EB ,
where #A, #B, #EG, #EB represent the quantities of questions for which A is better, B is better, equally good, and equally bad, respectively.µ and σ are the mean and variance of the GSB scores of all evaluators.According to empirical values, we set z = 1.7 (which corresponds to a 91.08% probability of falling within the confidence interval in a normal distribution).Evaluators whose z-values are greater than 1.7 or less than -1.7 are included in the list of disqualified evaluators for GSB standard deviation.</p>
<p>The evaluators who appear on both the list of disqualified evaluators for overlapping questions and the list of disqualified evaluators for GSB standard deviation are considered disqualified evaluators.All answer samples from these evaluators are regarded as invalid and are removed.</p>
<p>Unqualified Samples Redistribution After removing the aforementioned samples, the success of the evaluation will be assessed based on the following criteria.If any of the following three conditions are met, the unqualified samples will need to be redistributed for expert panel review: 1) If the proportion of unqualified samples in the total evaluation samples exceeds 15%.2) If the proportion of unqualified samples in a specific major area exceeds 30%.3) If the proportion of unqualified samples in important tasks (i.e., multi-turn dialogue, reasoning, coding ability, mathematical ability, and security) exceeds 15%.</p>
<p>Consistency Monitoring</p>
<p>We check the consistency of the evaluators by calculating the agreement of the major areas and the tasks.The calculation method for agreement is as follows: We calculate the agreement between any two annotators based on the overlapped questions assigned to them.Specifically, agreement equals to the number of questions annotated with the same label divided by the number of questions in common.For each question that is labeled by three annotators, we adopt the same method used in MT-bench (Zheng et al., 2023) to calculate the agreement on the question label3 .The overall agreement is the average agreement across all questions.</p>
<p>Win Rate Calculating After the evaluation is completed, we calculate the win rate between the two models.The normalized win rate is calculated as:
win_rate = #A + 0.5 × #EG #A + #B + #EG + #EB ,
where #A, #B, #EG, #EB represent the number of questions for which A is better, B is better, equally good, and equally bad, respectively.</p>
<p>Annotation Cost Estimation We estimate human annotation cost as follows based on the evaluation of 10k questions.One person can evaluate around 300 questions per day and one question is cross-evaluated by three people.It requires 50 evaluators to complete the evaluation in 2 days.</p>
<p>Considering the evaluation cost of 6k RMB per person per month, the final cost is 0.1 RMB per instance).</p>
<p>Single Model Scoring</p>
<p>The AB comparative evaluation is ideal for comparing the capabilities of two models side by side.However, for situations such as evaluating model absolute performance and plugin usage performance, we found a singular model scoring method is more appropriate.Therefore, we develop a tiered scoring metric with 3 to 5 levels, designed for evaluations ranging from simple to complex scenarios.Consider the 3-tier scoring as an example: 0 point (Fail): The answer is not correct, unsafe, offensive or it has factual errors, etc.</p>
<p>1 point (Pass) : The answer is generally correct but is incomplete, contains redundancies, or has logical inconsistencies, etc.</p>
<p>2 point (Excellent) : Completely correct.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Baselines</p>
<p>We select the following 11 models with strong capabilities for comparison: Claude-2.04, Baichuan-13B-Chat5 , Baichuan2-13B-Chat6 (Yang et al., 2023), ChatGPT7 , Alpaca2-13B8 , GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), Chinese_llama2, Qwen9 , IFlytek_Spark10 , Wenxinyiyan11 , and ChatGLM-6B_v212 .</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Results</p>
<p>Pairwise Comparison</p>
<p>We conduct anonymous battles in pairs involving 2,075 different questions and in total 5,140 anonymous pairs of models.The evaluation results were cross-validated by three evaluators per question.Figure 3 is the result win-rate heat map between eleven models.The results indicate GPT-4's superior performance.chinese_llama2's performs poorly, potentially due to the lack of Chinese knowledge.Baichuan chatbot performs the best among open-sourced models, delivering results only slightly worse than many big commercial models, even though it has only one-tenth the number of parameters.</p>
<p>Agreement Analysis Table 1 presents the agreement analysis, with an overall agreement of 0.6413 .Notably, the Multi-Dialogue domain shows low consistency with a score of 0.49.We believe this is due to the frequent presence of subjective questions, causing considerable differences in individual viewpoints.In contrast, domains that are more objective or standardized, such as Reasoning and Domain Expertise, exhibit high consistency in human evaluations, scoring 0.72 and 0.81 respectively.</p>
<p>Overlap Question Analysis In our experimental setup, we have 20 overlapping questions that all evaluators must assess.Of these questions, 25% relate to fundamental NLP, 65% relate to reasoning, and 10% relate to text generation.The average agreement for these overlapping questions is 0.84, suggesting that the evaluators' assessments are reliable.Most discrepancies arise in complex reasoning questions, where, although the model's final answer is accurate, its reasoning process is flawed.Such cases are challenging to judge correctly.</p>
<p>Single Model Scoring Results</p>
<p>In our single model scoring experiments, we specifically chose GPT-4, ChatGPT-3.5, and chat-glm6b_v2 as our models.The evaluation involved a comprehensive set of 2,332 questions.Each question was independently assessed by three annotators.The results are shown in Table 2.While GPT-4 achieves the highest score among the models evaluated, it is important to note that it is still far from perfect.Specifically, in the domain of dialogue, GPT-4's excellent rate is 0.19.This indicates potential challenges in sustaining coherent and contextsensitive conversations over multiple turns.Furthermore, with a reasoning score of 0.30, GPT-4 demonstrates room for improvement in tasks demanding logical reasoning, problem-solving, and advanced cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Comparison with GPT-4 Auto-Evaluation</p>
<p>Using GPT-4 as a judge to compare models' responses has become a popular automatic evaluation scheme recently.In our work, we conduct GPT-4 automatic evaluation to gain a deeper understanding of how GPT-4 evaluates its own performance and other models.This analysis is crucial as it not only provides insight into the self-awareness and error-detection capabilities of GPT-4, but also offers a unique perspective on the model's internal assessment mechanisms.By contrasting GPT-4's self-evaluation with human evaluation, we aim to identify areas of over-or under-estimation of its capabilities, and further refine our understanding of its functionalities and limitations of automatic evaluation.</p>
<p>Evaluation Data we reuse the same questions from the human evaluation mentioned above.</p>
<p>Elo Scoring For the purpose of model ranking, we utilize the Elo scoring system to rank different models based on the battle results among them.Specifically, an initial baseline score (e.g., 1,000) is assigned to every model.After each pairwise comparison (a contest) between two models, their scores are updated by considering the actual outcome of the contest (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, 0 for a loss) against the expected outcome.The detailed calculation process can be found in Appendix E.</p>
<p>Direct Pairwise Comparison</p>
<p>Inspired by (Wang et al., 2023;Zheng et al., 2023), we exploit the chain-of-thought (Wei et al., 2022) and position-swap14 to help GPT-4 judge the answer for pairwise comparison.The full prompts can be found in Appendix A. Figure 4 presents the results of GPT-4 auto evaluations between 11 models in our six major areas, based on the Elo score system with a baseline score of 1,000.To further understand the strengths and shortcomings  of each model, we retain the Elo score of each model in the six dimensions of NLP Basics, Safety, Multi-Dialogue, Reasoning, Text Generation, and Domain Expertise.Figure 5 illustrates a radar chart showing the capabilities of these 10 models (excluding llama2_chinese which performs poorly) in the six major areas.</p>
<p>Answer Scoring and Comparison</p>
<p>Next, our evaluation approach employs a scoring scheme (rating from 1 to 10) and requests GPT-4 to first give an explanation and then assign a score to a model's answer.In the process of creating prompts, we integrate our evaluation criteria into the prompt.This method ensures that the scoring is preceded by a clear rationale, aligning the scores with specific evaluation standards.To facilitate the comparison, we map the scores of the two models scored by GPT-4 into pair-wise comparison results in the following way.</p>
<p>• If Score_A − Score_B &gt; 2 and Score_A &gt; 5, A is better.</p>
<p>• If Score_A − Score_B &lt;= 2 and Score_B &gt; 5, A and B are equally good.</p>
<p>• In other situations they're equally bad.</p>
<p>The data presented in Figure 6 indicates that the scores for Multi-Dialogues and Reasoning categories are comparatively low.This observation is consistent with the findings detailed in Table 2.We hypothesize that this trend may be attributed to the inherently subjective nature of the Multi-Dialogues and Reasoning evaluations.</p>
<p>Usability Analysis</p>
<p>Given that most researchers are unable to perform extensive human evaluation, we conduct a more detailed analysis here to give some suggestions for the utilization of automatic evaluation.Taking human evaluation as the gold standard, in this part, we analyze the consistency between automatic evaluation and human evaluation and give suggestions on how to employ automatic evaluation.We compare the consistency by using the same questions in both human evaluation and GPT-4 auto-evaluation results.Overall, the agreement between humans is 0.63, while the agreement between humans and GPT-4 single model scoring is 0.41, which has a 22% difference.Looking at Tasks # Questions GPT-4 ChatGPT3.5 chatglm6b_v2  the 6 specific areas, the evaluation results of GPT-4 are very inaccurate for the two major tasks of multi-turn dialogues and reasoning, and there is a significant difference from human evaluation.The reason for the analysis is that in MT-Bench, GPT-4 evaluates multi-turn dialogues, only referring to the previous round of information.In our evaluation questions, some multi-turn dialogues require the model's long-term memory capacity, which depends on a combination of dialogues from ten rounds before.In some complex reasoning, GPT-4 itself cannot give the correct answer.There are also some reasoning questions.The evaluated models answer correctly, but there are minor errors in the reasoning process.Humans can easily judge them, while GPT-4 ignores these details.There is a lot of difficult knowledge that GPT-4 itself cannot judge.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Assessing the capabilities of large-scale models has consistently been a critical and challenging subject in the field of artificial intelligence.This area has seen substantial contributions from numerous researchers.Prior to the emergence of ChatGPT, the focus of model evaluation was predominantly on objective questions, with evaluations conducted on traditional tasks requiring short responses, primarily employing automatic evaluation methods.After ChatGPT, while the majority of studies continue to concentrate on automatic evaluations of objective questions, there has been a noticeable emergence of research exploring subjective assessments.This shift signifies an evolving landscape in the evaluation methodologies of large-scale models.</p>
<p>Before the Emergence of ChatGPT</p>
<p>GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019) were developed to evaluate machine-specific competencies and assess textual understanding capabilities.Subsequently, MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) was introduced as a human-centric evaluation framework, targeting multi-task knowledge comprehension.This framework encompasses 57 topics, categorized into "Elementary," "High School," and "Professional" levels.HELM (Liang et al., 2022) is a comprehensive benchmark that measures 7 metrics across 42 core scenarios, aiming to provide a holistic assessment of LLMs.It primarily evaluates LLMs' knowledge and abilities in various domains and NLP tasks, such as information retrieval, summarization, sentiment analysis, and more.Big-Bench (Srivastava et al., 2022) is a collaboratively created benchmark comprising 204 tasks spanning fields such as linguistics, biology, mathematics, and software development.While it primarily focuses on knowledge-based and reasoning-based tasks, it lacks evaluations for instruction-following, multi-turn dialogues, and other aspects.</p>
<p>After the Emergence of ChatGPT</p>
<p>Owing to the considerable convenience in both data collection and automatic evaluation, numerous evaluation benchmarks leverage diverse examinations.AGIEval (Zhong et al., 2023) gathers official, public, and high-standard admission and qualification exam questions to assess the human-level capabilities of LLMs.C-Eval (Huang et al., 2023) is a comprehensive Chinese evaluation suite, containing 13,948 multiple-choice questions spanning middle school, high school, college, and professional levels.Similarly, CMMLU (Li et al., 2023a) is an extensive evaluation benchmark specifically designed to assess the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs within the context of the Chinese language and culture.GAOKAO-bench (Zhang et al., 2023) is an evaluation framework that employs Chinese high school entrance examination questions.Xiezhi (Zhouhong et al., 2023) constructs a benchmark based on the Chinese Graduate Entrance Examination.Additionally, certain tasks are designed for specific skills.MT-Bench and Chatbot Arena (Zheng et al., 2023) particularly evaluate multi-turn dialogue abilities and attempt to use GPT-4 as an evaluator to test user-interestdriven questions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several works focus on the comprehensive evaluation of LLMs.CLEVA (Li et al., 2023b) proposes the Chinese HELM.Su-perCLUE (Xu et al., 2023) combines three complementary evaluation methods: CArena, OPEN, and CLOSE, aiming to assess ten capabilities of LLMs.These methods comprise 9.9k, 600, and 600 queries, respectively.OpenCompass (Contributors, 2023) collects multiple high-quality opensource datasets, intending to provide a comprehensive evaluation suite and platform designed for large models.While the primary focus remains on collecting objective questions, the inclusion of subjective questions is also planned.FlagEval15 is an evaluation toolkit for large-scale AI foundation models, encompassing various modalities of evaluation solutions.As of now, FlagEval primarily contains objective evaluations, with subjective evaluations under development.Table 3: We present a comparison of two types of agreements: firstly, between human judges (noted as H. vs H.), and secondly, between the majority-voted labels determined by humans and the evaluation results made by GPT-4 (noted as H. vs GPT-4.Note that GPT-4 is used as a judge in two ways: single model scoring and direct pairwise comparison.We also show the difference between "H.vs H." and "H.vs GPT-4".If the difference is greater than 30%, it implies that GPT-4 may not be adequate to assess in that category, which is reflected in the "Usable?" column."</p>
<p>Conclusion and Future Work</p>
<p>We propose a comprehensive human evaluation framework and benchmark to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models in following instructions across diverse real-world tasks.We construct a hierarchical task tree encompassing 7 major areas, over 200 categories, and over 800 sub-tasks to evaluate models in a structured, in-depth manner.Furthermore, this work puts forth a detailed set of human evaluation criteria and processes to facilitate consistent and unbiased judgments.The evaluation protocols, quality control mechanisms, and analysis methods aim to produce credible, reproducible results.Our evaluation framework has been successfully applied to the Hunyuan Assistant developed by Tencent.Our evaluation is not only instrumental in comparing the Hunyuan model with other leading LLMs but also played a crucial role in identifying its unique strengths and pinpointing areas for improvement.</p>
<p>We hope this work will promote standardized, comprehensive evaluations to benchmark progress as LLMs are further integrated into applications.Currently, the TencentLLMEval only includes the Chinese and English datasets, and we will support multilingual evaluation tasks in the near future.In addition to its outstanding text generation capabilities, large language models are also becoming increasingly proficient in multimodal capabilities.Currently, Tencent's Hunyuan model supports various multimodal generative capabilities including text-to-image, image-to-text, text-to-video, etc., and the related evaluation framework is being developed and refined.</p>

<p>B Detail task description</p>
<p>NLP Basics mainly evaluate model performance on traditional NLP tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and syntactic parsing, among others.Text Generation is to evaluate models' performance in tasks such as content creation, writing emails, and couplets generation.Dialogue assesses the models' ability in human interaction, answering questions, and achieving the user's goal through multi-turn conversation.Reasoning covers the models' capabilities in logical reasoning, fact-checking, and identifying cause-and-effect relations.Domain-specific Applications target tasks specific to certain industries or domains, including medical QA, legal consultation, financial advisement, etc. Safety evaluates the models' robustness in terms of identifying malicious content, avoiding inappropriate outputs, and handling adversarial queries.Plugins mainly include some timesensitive issues, as well as some questions that require integration of answers through third-party APIs.</p>
<p>C Test case</p>
<p>There are some data cases used by human evaluation.Question 1: In a bucket, there are 60 marbles, some are red, some are blue, and some are white.The probability of picking a red marble is 35%, and the probability of picking a blue marble is 25%.How many marbles of each color are there in the bucket?Comment: This is an example of our reasoning questions.Question 2: In the early stage of reform and opening up, the street economy once played a positive role in the development of City S, but later it was criticized for its negative impact and even banned in the central urban area.After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy of City S came to a standstill and ensuring employment and people's livelihood became the top priority of the government.The city's tax, finance, transportation, and health departments jointly issued policies to moderately reintroduce the street economy based on the local situation: allowing temporary stalls, market areas, and night markets to be set up in certain areas without occupying blind paths and fire passages, and meeting epidemic prevention requirements, as well as allowing street-facing shops to operate beyond their doors.This policy has helped the retail and catering shops in the central urban area to achieve a resumption rate of over 98%, creating about 80,000 new jobs and promoting the recovery of the order of production and life.Using the relevant knowledge of "production, labor, and management" in "Economic Life", explain the reasons why the street economy can promote the recovery of the order of production and life in City S. Comment: This is an example of our domain expertise question.Question 3: Q1: I like domestic cars, not joint venture cars or imported cars.Can you introduce me to NIO cars?Q2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of electric cars and gasoline cars?Q3: Gasoline cars are not suitable for me, I like electric cars.Are there any other brands?Q4: What are the features of the Tesla Model X? Q5: How about comparing it with BYD Tang?Q6: Which one is more expensive?Q7: How about comparing it with NIO ES8? Q8: What are some gasoline SUVs?Q9: Considering my preferences, please recommend a few cars for me.Comment: This is an example of our multidialogue question.</p>

<p>E Elo Scoring System</p>
<p>The Elo scoring system, originally designed for ranking chess players, is based on the idea of pairwise comparison.The system updates scores by considering the actual outcome of a contest between two entities (in our case, large language models) against the expected outcome.Given two models with ratings R A and R B , the expected score for each model is calculated using the following two formulas:
E A = 1 1 + 10 R B −R A 400 and E B = 1 1 + 10 R A −R B 400
, where:</p>
<p>• E A and E B are the expected scores of models A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>• R A and R B are the current ratings of models A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>After a contest, the actual scores (S A and S B ) are determined.In our experiments, we use S A = 1 to indicate that A wins, S A = 0 to indicate A loses, and S A = 0.5 to indicate a draw.The new ratings are then calculated using:
R ′ A = R A + K × (S A − E A ), R ′ B = R B + K × (S B − E B )
, where:</p>
<p>• R ′ A and R ′ B are the updated ratings.</p>
<p>• K is the weight of the competition, often set between 10 and 40 depending on the certainty of the rating.A higher K value makes the ratings more volatile.In our experiments, we use K=4.</p>
<p>In the context of comparing language models, an analogous "contest" might involve evaluating two models on a shared task and determining the winner according to performance metrics.</p>
<p>In the random selection of questions, we record the previously drawn questions and the two models competing against each other to prevent repeated drawing of the same two models for the same question from interfering with Elo's ranking.If the two models evaluated for a certain question overlap, the two models should be resampled from the 11 model pool until there is no overlap (That is, to prevent two models from playing the same question multiple times, which will affect Elo's ranking).The scoring mechanism of Elo will cause differences in the results due to the different order of appearance in the model battle.Therefore, we shuffle the battle records randomly to prevent deviations in Elo scores and unreasonable rankings caused by the model's appearance order from affecting the final evaluation effect.In order to ensure the stability of the test results, we average the results of 20 repeated experiments, which effectively stabilizes the evaluation results.</p>

The agreement reported in(Zheng et al., 2023) is 0.66. However, it's important to note that they use fewer labeling categories, specifically 3, compared to our 4. We further differentiate ties into two categories: 'same good' and 'same bad'.
We swap positions of two models in two turns if the results are not consistent, it will be regarded as a tie.
