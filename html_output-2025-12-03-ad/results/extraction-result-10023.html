                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Intracellular accumulation of amyloid-ß is a marker of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Defining how amyloid-β and pTau together lead to neurodegeneration is fundamental to understanding Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We used imaging mass cytometry to identify neocortical neuronal subtypes lost with AD in post-mortem brain middle temporal gyri from non-diseased and AD donors. Here we showed that L5,6 RORB+FOXP2+ and L3,5,6 GAD1+FOXP2+ neurons, which accumulate amyloid-β intracellularly from early Braak stages, are selectively vulnerable to degeneration in AD, while L3 RORB+GPC5+ neurons, which accumulate pTau but not amyloid-β, are not lost even at late Braak stages. We discovered spatial associations between activated microglia and these vulnerable neurons and found that vulnerable RORB+FOXP2+ neuronal transcriptomes are enriched selectively for pathways involved in inflammation and glycosylation and, with progression to AD, also protein degradation. Our results suggest that the accumulation of intraneuronal amyloid-β, which is associated with glial inflammatory pathology, may contribute to the initiation of degeneration of these vulnerable neurons.</p>

Nature Portfolio wishes to improve the reproducibility of the work that we publish.This form provides structure for consistency and transparency in reporting.For further information on Nature Portfolio policies, see our Editorial Policies and the Editorial Policy Checklist.Pl ease do not complete any field with "not applicable" or n/a.Refer to the help text for what text to use if an item is not rel evant to your study.For final submission: please carefully check your responses for accuracy; you will not be abl e to make changes later.</p>
<p>Statistics</p>
<p>For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.</p>
<p>n/a Confirmed</p>
<p>The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct sampl es or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly</p>
<p>The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one-or two-sided Onl y common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techni ques in the Methods section.</p>
<p>A description of all covariates tested</p>
<p>A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g.means) or other basi c estimates (e.g.regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g.confidence intervals) For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g.F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P val ues as exact val ues whenever suitable.</p>
<p>For Bayesi an anal ysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes Estimates of effect sizes (e.g.Cohen' s d, Pearson' s r), indicating how they were calculated Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.</p>
<p>Software and code</p>
<p>Policy information about availability of computer code Data collection No code was used for collecting data.</p>
<p>Data analysis 1 SIMPLI (Bortol omeazzi, M. et al, 2022) was used for anal ysi ng the IMC images, R studio (version 2023.06.2+561) was used for data analysis and plotting, scFl ow (Khozoi e, C. et al, 2021) was used for snRNAseq dataset processing and pathway anal ysi s.R scri pts used for data analysis are avail abl e on a public repository (https://github.com/AlessiaCaramello/Vulnerable-neurons-in-AD).Immunofluorescence and IMC images were processed with ImageJ (version 2.14.0/1.54f).Fi gures were assembl ed with Adobe Illustrator (version 28.0).The 2D k-nearest neighbours of nuclei included in the neuronal and gl ial cl usters were detected usi ng the bui ldSpati al Graph function included in the imcRtools R/Bioconductor package (version 1.0.2).Impacted pathway anal ysis (IPA) was performed essentially as previousl y described usi ng the enrichR (v 3.3) package.</p>
<p>For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and reviewers.We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g.GitHub).See the Nature Portfolio guidelines for submitting code &amp; software for further information.Novel plant genotypes Descri be the methods by whi ch all novel plant genotypes were produced.Thi s includes those generated by transgenic approaches, gene editing, chemical/radiation-based mutagenesi s and hybridization.For transgenic li nes, describe the transformation method, the number of independent li nes anal yzed and the generation upon whi ch experiments were performed.For gene-edited li nes, describe the editor used, the endogenous sequence targeted for editing, the targeting gui de RNA sequence (if applicable) and how the editor was applied.</p>
<p>Seed stocks</p>
<p>Report on the source of all seed stocks or other plant material used.If applicable, state the seed stock centre and catalogue number.If plant specimens were collected from the field, describe the collection location, date and sampl ing procedures.</p>
<p>Authentication</p>
<p>Descri be any authentication procedures for each seed stock used or novel genotype generated.Descri be any experiments used to assess the effect of a mutation and, where applicable, how potential secondary effects (e.g.second site T-DNA inserti ons, mosiacism, off-target gene editing) were examined.</p>
