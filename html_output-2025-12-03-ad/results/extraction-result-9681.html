                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Our study explores how well the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4 and Mistral, can assess the quality of scientific summaries or, more fittingly, scientific syntheses, comparing their evaluations to those of human annotators. We used a dataset of 100 research questions and their syntheses made by GPT-4 from abstracts of five related papers, checked against human quality ratings. The study evaluates both the closed-source GPT-4 and the open-source Mistral model's ability to rate these summaries and provide reasons for their judgments. Preliminary results show that LLMs can offer logical explanations that somewhat match the quality ratings, yet a deeper statistical analysis shows a weak correlation between LLM and human ratings, suggesting the potential and current limitations of LLMs in scientific synthesis evaluation.</p>

<p>Large Language Models as Evaluators for Scientific Synthesis
3 Jul 20242E22CED5F91B1D789733C57264650155arXiv:2407.02977v1[cs.CL]
Our study explores how well the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT-4 and Mistral, can assess the quality of scientific summaries or, more fittingly, scientific syntheses, comparing their evaluations to those of human annotators.We used a dataset of 100 research questions and their syntheses made by GPT-4 from abstracts of five related papers, checked against human quality ratings.The study evaluates both the closed-source GPT-4 and the open-source Mistral model's ability to rate these summaries and provide reasons for their judgments.Preliminary results show that LLMs can offer logical explanations that somewhat match the quality ratings, yet a deeper statistical analysis shows a weak correlation between LLM and human ratings, suggesting the potential and current limitations of LLMs in scientific synthesis evaluation.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made a significant impact on natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating exceptional performance in tasks like text generation, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and question answering, with outputs that often rival human-created content (Huang et al., 2023).In addition to their direct applications, LLMs offer substantial benefits in streamlining machine learning model development, particularly in evaluation processes.They reduce the dependency on human-generated ground truth data and the necessity for human evaluators (Bai et al., 2023) in two key ways: by facilitating the generation of synthetic ground truth data and by serving as evaluators for model predictions themselves.This approach not only speeds up the evaluation process but also broadens the scope of evaluation criteria to include factors such as diversity and coverage, enhancing the efficiency and comprehensiveness of model assessments.</p>
<p>This study investigates the use of LLMs as evaluators to streamline the evaluation process, moving away from traditional reliance on human evaluators and human-generated ground truth data.It specifically examines the effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing scientific abstracts seen generally as multi-document summarization tasks.The main focus of this research is to assess how two state-ofthe-art LLMs-the proprietary GPT-4 Turbo (Ope-nAI, 2023) and the open-source Mistral-7B (Jiang et al., 2023)-perform in evaluating scientific syntheses.Furthermore, leveraging LLMs meant better versatility in evaluation considerations, which meant that the evaluations tested varied dimensions of syntheses quality, viz.comprehensiveness, trustworthiness, and utility.</p>
<p>This paper is structured as follows.First, section 2 presents a review of related work in the fields of text summarization and LLM evaluation.In section 3, we show our approach to using LLMs for scientific synthesis evaluation, wherein subsection 3.1 describes the LLM output, while subsection 3.2 presents a qualitative evaluation of this output.In subsection 3.3, we analyze the correlation between LLM ratings and human judgments.A discussion of our findings and final conclusions is described in section 4.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics for Text Summarization.The most common automatic evaluation metric used within summarization research -both singledocument and multi-document -is the ROUGE family of metrics (Ma et al., 2022;Akter et al., 2022;Cohan and Goharian, 2016;Kryscinski et al., 2019;Lloret et al., 2018).ROUGE metrics (Lin, 2004) calculate the lexical overlap between a human-written reference document and an automatically generated one, although variants incorporating semantic information also exist.Within text summarization research, the most commonly used are ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L (Ma et al., 2022), both of which are purely lexical-matching metrics.ROUGE-N evaluates the recall of n-grams by comparing a reference text with a corresponding machine-generated text, whereas ROUGE-L calculates the longest common subsequence of tokens shared between reference and machine-generated texts (Lin, 2004).</p>
<p>Despite its predominance within the field, ROUGE nonetheless has some notable limitations.First, the most commonly used metrics lack semantic awareness (Akter et al., 2022;Ma et al., 2022).Studies have pointed out that ROUGE may not accurately estimate summary quality in cases of terminological variations, paraphrasing, and differences in sentence structure (Cohan and Goharian, 2016).Moreover, there exist 192 ROUGE variants (Graham, 2015), with meaningful differences in how well each performs on a given system or specialized task (Cohan and Goharian, 2016;Graham, 2015;Kryscinski et al., 2019) and how well they correlate with human judgements (Kryscinski et al., 2019;Graham, 2015).Finally, ROUGE evaluates only content selection but not linguistic quality aspects such as grammaticality and referential clarity (Pitler et al., 2010) or overall quality, including the ordering of information and structural clarity (Graham, 2015).</p>
<p>Although no other metrics have gained widespread adoption, other approaches exist.Additional lexical-matching metrics include BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and Pyramid (Nenkova et al., 2007).Semantically enriched metrics include ME-TEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), an expansion of BLEU, and approaches utilizing word embeddings, such as BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), Mover-Score (Zhao et al., 2019), and SUPERT (Gao et al., 2020).However, none of these metrics address all of ROUGE's weaknesses, and the limited use of such metrics within the research community means that ROUGE remains the "de facto" standard (Lloret et al., 2018).</p>
<p>LLMs for Text Evaluation.Using LLMs for text evaluation is still a nascent research topic.Several recent works have compared LLMs' text evaluations to human evaluations on multiple tasks, and report that LLMs produce results similar to human judgements (Chiang and Lee, 2023b;Liu et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023).One work finds only minor variations in results depending on task instructions and hyperparameters, whereas they find a high degree of variation in performance of different LLMs and the quality characteristics being assessed (Chiang and Lee, 2023b).In evaluating the quality of story fragments by grammaticality, cohesiveness, likability, and relevance, they find only a weak correlation between humans and LLMs on grammaticality, but a moderate correlation on relevance.Contrarily, another work finds that Chat-GPT's performance is sensitive to prompt instructions (Wang et al., 2023).They also show that ChatGPT evaluations correlate especially well with human evaluations for creative tasks like story generation (Wang et al., 2023).Another work demonstrates that requiring LLMs to provide a justification for their ratings "significantly improves the correlation between the LLMs' ratings and human ratings" (Chiang and Lee, 2023a).</p>
<p>Only one work has investigated the task of text summarization evaluation (Liu et al., 2023).They evaluate single-document news article summaries on the aspects of coherence, consistency, fluency, and relevance; their results exceed the correlation with human judgements of most automatic approaches, including ROUGE.In another task, Chat-GPT successfully identifies implicit hate speech in Tweets and generates explanations of why the texts are hateful, which human annotators judge equally informative to human-written explanations and of greater clarity (Huang et al., 2023).</p>
<p>LLMs for the Scientific Synthesis Evaluation Task</p>
<p>The accurate evaluation of scientific syntheses is a critical task in research, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the synthesized information.While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of LLMs in generating such syntheses (Pride et al., 2023), their potential in evaluating them remains relatively unexplored.Motivated by the limitations of existing evaluation metrics, such as the ROUGE family, and the success of LLMs in other text evaluation tasks, our work seeks to investigate the suitability of LLMs for the task of assessing the quality of scientific syntheses.</p>
<p>To address this question, we employ the proprietary GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI, 2023) and the opensource Mistral-7B models (Jiang et al., 2023) to evaluate the CORE-GPT dataset (Pride et al., 2023).This dataset comprises 100 research questions spanning 20 diverse domains, each accompanied by the titles and abstracts of five related works and an an-swer to the research question generated by GPT-4 by synthesizing the provided abstracts.Additionally, human ratings from two annotators, on a scale of 0 to 10, are available on the quality of each synthesis in three dimensions, viz.comprehensive, trust, and utility.</p>
<p>For our task, we query the LLMs to evaluate the syntheses according to the same three aspects as the CORE-GPT human raters.Our prompt follows a similar structure to previous work (Chiang and Lee, 2023a).It contains two lines of task instruction, explanation of the quality aspects (as defined for the CORE-GPT dataset annotators) and the rating scale, response format instructions, and finally the answer to be evaluated with its question and abstracts.The response is requested in JSON format, with a numeric rating between 0 and 10 for each aspect as well as a rationale for each rating.The full text of the prompt is in Appendix A.</p>
<p>LLM Synthesis Evaluation Output</p>
<p>A representative example of the evaluation output from GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral is shown in Appendix B and Appendix C, respectively.The output from GPT-4 was exactly as requested, while Mistral had some variability.In one case, Mistral returned ratings of "excellent," "good," and "high" rather than numeric scores; this output was excluded from the analysis.In several other cases, Mistral included a paragraph after the JSON object which summarized the ratings and rationales provided within it.These paragraphs were discarded and only the JSON object content was evaluated.</p>
<p>An overview of LLM performance was obtained by reviewing one synthesis from each domain evaluated by both GPT-4 and Mistral.Qualitatively, both models demonstrated credible and logically consistent ratings and rationales.GPT-4 provided more detailed rationales compared to Mistral, with slightly lower ratings overall.</p>
<p>In their rationales for comprehensive, both LLMs would sometimes highlight relevant topics from the abstracts which were not included in the synthesis, with GPT-4 producing such rationales more often than Mistral.Occasionally, some rationales contained justifications relating to content more specific than just the topics, suggesting more information on the results or the methodology of the studies would improve it.</p>
<p>The LLMs seemed to show the greatest discrepancy between rating and rationale, and the greatest inconsistencies, in their evaluations of trust.In one Mistral evaluation with a rating of 5, the rationale noted that the citations only improved trustworthiness "as long as the abstract accurately represents the study's findings."In the absence of any evidence the abstract is suspect, this rating is disproportionately low.GPT-4 was notably more conservative than human annotators, as it did not give a single 10.Especially for trust, it was often difficult to understand why a rating wasn't higher.For instance, the rationale for one rating of 8 praised the synthesis for accuracy and avoiding unsupported claims.</p>
<p>For the utility ratings, it appears that most rationales from GPT-4 suggested additional content which could make the synthesis more useful, such as actionable information, more detailed examples, technical details of methodologies and implementation, and so on.Mistral made such suggestions less frequently; its rationales tended to echo the rationale for comprehensive.However, Mistral did sometimes provide guidance on who would or would not find the synthesis useful.</p>
<p>Qualitative Evaluations</p>
<p>LLMs are known to sometimes generate content on topics that lack factual basis with a highly persuasive level of linguistic proficiency (Bang et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023).For scientific syntheses which provide an answer to a question, it is especially important that the content is genuinely a synthesis of the provided abstracts, with appropriate citations, and not independently generated based on the LLM's training data.For this reason, we were particularly interested in how the LLMs evaluated quality, and most importantly trust, when there was reason to believe the abstracts were not the (primary) source of the generated content, as in the following three scenarios.The complete question and answer pairs, along with their GPT-4 and Mistral evaluation scores and trust rationales, can be found in Appendix D.</p>
<p>Response Explicitly States Absence of Relevant Abstracts.In six cases, the synthesis directly expressed limitations due to the relevancy of the provided abstracts, e.g."[...] the provided search results do not offer specific information on the longterm health impacts of such medications on these organs."Human annotators responded very positively to this, with such responses "scored highly for trustworthiness" (Pride et al., 2023).Mistral rated four of these syntheses as 10 for trust, citing factual accuracy and abstract sourcing, while two scored 7. GPT-4 ratings varied, at 5, 5, 5, 7, 7, and 8. Mistral rationales did not reference the stated limitation, while GPT-4 acknowledged it positively in three cases.However, as these syntheses were scored 8, 7, and 5, it is unclear to what extent this acknowledgement may have influenced the scores.</p>
<p>Response Contains No Citations.There were three responses which answered the question but contained no citations.GPT-4 gave trust scores of 0, 0, and 1, with rationales referring to the lack of citations.In contrast, Mistral scored 8, 10, and 10, with rationales stating the information was common knowledge or referenced from the abstracts.</p>
<p>Response Contains One Citation.Finally, there were five syntheses which cited only one of the abstracts, which does not align with the task of synthesizing multiple abstracts to provide an answer to the given question.For GPT-4, the trust scores were 5, 7, 8, 8, and 9, with most rationales stating that the synthesis relied on general knowledge without directly referencing the abstracts, despite one citation being present in each case.Meanwhile, the Mistral scores were 7, 9, 9, 10, and 10, with most rationales indistinguishable from those of syntheses with many more citations -three of them claimed that the synthesis accurately references the content in the provided abstracts.</p>
<p>Correlation</p>
<p>Spearman's ρ was calculated to assess the relationship between the human annotators' scores and the LLM-generated scores.Using the publiclyavailable data from CORE-GPT (Pride et al., 2023) 1 , separate vectors for each annotator were obtained.To calculate the correlations, we found the overall mean score for each domain; due to the format of the published data, it was not possible to match individual scores to their corresponding syntheses.Our results for the overall mean are presented in Table 1.We find that only two results showed statistically significant p-values.Human annotators exhibited a strong positive correlation (0.710), as did GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral (0.786).However, correlations between annotators and LLMs were weak or very weak, with p-values indicating insufficient evidence for genuine association.These findings suggest LLMs cannot directly replicate human performance in evaluating scientific syntheses.Despite this, the strong positive correlation between GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral indicates consistency between the two LLMs.</p>
<p>Discussion and Conclusion</p>
<p>We explore the capacity of LLMs in assessing scientific syntheses.GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral are utilized to obtain quality ratings for 100 syntheses from the CORE-GPT dataset (Pride et al., 2023), accompanied by a rationale for each rating.Correlation analysis using Spearman's ρ indicates that the LLM performance does not align with the human annotators' judgements.However, a qualitative evaluation of the responses finds a more mixed result.</p>
<p>Both LLMs generally produce credible and logically consistent ratings and rationales, but GPT-4 appears more conservative in its ratings and provides more detail and specific recommendations in its rationales.GPT-4 also displays greater sensitivity to the presence or absence of citations compared to Mistral.However, both LLMs' rationales occasionally contained inaccuracies or flaws, raising concerns about the credibility of their scores.Moreover, the extent to which the responses are evaluated as syntheses and not simply as answers, without reliance on general knowledge, remains unclear, particularly in the case of Mistral.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight both promising developments and current limitations of leveraging LLMs for the task of evaluating scientific syntheses, illustrating the need for further research to validate and refine the methodology.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>We acknowledge several limitations that may influence the interpretation and generalizability of our findings.First, the reliance on a single, relatively small dataset presents limitations in terms of data representativeness.Moreover, the data format necessitated aggregating scores, which may have obscured potential nuances in individual annotations.</p>
<p>Second, the study focused exclusively on GPT-4 Turbo and Mistral, limiting the generalizability of our conclusions to other LLMs.While these models represent the state-of-the-art, future iterations or alternative architectures may exhibit different performance.Additionally, we were able to obtain only one set of ratings from each LLM.Given the variability of LLM output, taking the average of several runs is preferable, but due to financial limitations, this was not possible in our study.</p>
<p>We note that past work has found LLMs particularly adept at evaluating creative texts (Wang et al., 2023), so the narrow output scope of synthesis for scientific question answering may pose a greater challenge.We also note the difficulty of assessing the quality of syntheses from such a diverse assortment of domains.Judging how comprehensive a synthesis is requires some knowledge of the scope of potential information which might be appropriate to include.Highly specialized domain knowledge still presents a challenge to general use LLMs.</p>
<p>Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>In this work we have presented our study of the efficacy of two LLMs, one proprietary and one open-source, in evaluating the quality of scientific syntheses.There were no living subjects analyzed in this study.Overall, this study complies with the ACL Ethics Policy.</p>
<p>In querying the LLMs for synthesis quality evaluations, we declare that the instructions were intended to align the behavior of the language models towards producing responses that are both helpful (fulfilling our objective) and harmless (not causing any physical, psychological, or social harm to individuals or the environment).All of the intellectual property which was passed to the LLMs is open-access.</p>

<p>D.1.1 Chemistry Question: What is the effect of pH on the efficiency of a common catalyst used in the production of biodiesel?</p>
<p>Answer: The effect of pH on the efficiency of a catalyst used in biodiesel production can be understood through the specific catalyst being used.For instance, mixed oxide catalysts like magnesium oxide (MgO) and calcium oxide (CaO) are used to promote the transesterification of vegetable oils into biodiesel.The basic property of these catalysts plays a crucial role in the biodiesel yield during the reaction [3].However, the provided search results do not offer a direct relationship between pH and the efficiency of such catalysts in biodiesel production.Further research is required to establish a clear connection between pH levels and the performance of common catalysts used in biodiesel production.</p>
<p>Comp.</p>
<p>Trust Utility Trust Rationale GPT-4 7 8 6</p>
<p>The answer is trustworthy as it accurately reflects the information available in the provided abstracts.It does not make unsupported claims and is honest about the limitations of the information provided in the abstracts regarding the direct effect of pH on catalyst efficiency.Mistral 5 7 6</p>

<p>D.1.2 Chemistry</p>
<p>Question: What is the effect of varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide on the rate of catalase enzyme activity?Answer: Varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can affect the rate of catalase enzyme activity.Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down H2O2 into oxygen and water, neutralizing oxidative stress in cells.This process is crucial for maintaining appropriate levels of oxidative stress because reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2, can cause cellular damage by targeting DNA and proteins, which can lead to complications like cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging [2].While the given search results do not provide exact information on how different concentrations of H2O2 impact the rate of catalase enzyme activity, it is evident that altering H2O2 levels will directly influence catalase's efficiency in breaking down H2O2 and neutralizing oxidative stress in cells [2].</p>
<p>Comp.</p>
<p>Trust Utility Trust Rationale GPT-4 3 5 3</p>
<p>The answer is somewhat trustworthy as it correctly describes the function of catalase and the consequences of oxidative stress, which is supported by the abstracts.However, it lacks direct evidence from the abstracts regarding the specific impact of different H2O2 concentrations on catalase activity, which reduces the trustworthiness of the response in the context of the question asked.</p>

<p>Answer: The Doppler effect affects the observed frequency of sound waves emitted from a moving source by causing a change in frequency and wavelength due to the relative motion between the source and the observer.When the source is moving towards the observer, the observed frequency increases, and the wavelength decreases; conversely, when the source is moving away from the observer, the observed frequency decreases, and the wavelength increases.Although the provided search results do not directly give real-world applications, the Doppler effect is relevant in various fields such as astronomy, radar technology, medical imaging, and seismology.For instance, it helps astronomers measure the speed of distant celestial objects and plays a critical role in Doppler radar systems for weather monitoring and forecasting.</p>

<p>Table 9: Ratings for the answer to the question "How did the American Civil War impact the social, economic, and political landscape of the United States?"D.2.3 Physics Question: How does the shape of an object affect its resistance to motion through a fluid medium?Answer: The shape of an object can significantly impact its resistance to motion through a fluid medium.This resistance, referred to as drag, depends on factors such as the size, shape, and surface texture of the object, along with the properties of the fluid in question.A streamlined shape minimizes drag, while a more irregular or bluff shape increases the force exerted by the fluid on the object, thus making it more resistant to motion.In fluid dynamics, this concept is commonly applied to improve the efficiency of objects such as vehicles and aircraft, where a streamlined design results in reduced fuel consumption and increased speed, due to the lowered drag forces acting against the object's movement through the fluid medium.</p>

<p>D.3.1 Geology</p>
<p>Question: What geological factors contribute to the formation and sustainability of hydrothermal ecosystems in deep sea environments?Answer: Hydrothermal ecosystems in deep sea environments are primarily formed and sustained by geological factors, such as tectonic activity and volcanic processes.These factors promote the circulation of seawater through the oceanic crust, which results in the formation of hydrothermal vents.The seawater is heated by the underlying magma and interacts with crustal rocks, enriching it with minerals and chemical elements.Once the heated and mineral-rich fluid meets the cold deep-sea water, it precipitates, creating chimneylike structures from which the hydrothermal fluid is expelled.These vents provide a unique habitat with diverse microbial and chemosynthetic communities, which serve as primary producers in the food chain.Furthermore, these deep-sea ecosystems are enriched by specialized fauna adapted to extreme conditions, such as high pressure, low oxygen, and varying temperatures, contributing to the overall sustainability of these environments [5].</p>

<p>D.3.2 Mathematics</p>
<p>Question: What is the impact of using manipulatives in mathematics instruction on the achievement and attitudes of elementary school students?Answer: The use of manipulatives in mathematics instruction has been shown to have a positive impact on the achievement and attitudes of elementary school students.In a study exploring the relationship between Affective Instructional Design (AID) and children's attitudes towards math learning, a significant positive correlation was found between attitude and math learning (r = 0.936, p = 0.000).Furthermore, significant differences were found between the baseline (pre-intervention) mean score and the final intervention lesson for both attitudes and math learning, indicating the potential effectiveness of manipulatives in enhancing students' attitudes towards mathematics and improving their achievement in the subject [1].</p>

<p>D.3.3 Philosophy</p>
<p>Question: What is the relationship between free will and determinism in philosophy?Answer: In philosophy, the relationship between free will and determinism revolves around whether an individual's actions are genuinely a result of their own choices or are predetermined by external factors.There are two main schools of thought: compatibilism and incompatibilism.Compatibilism argues that free will and determinism can coexist, meaning individuals can still be morally responsible for their actions even if determinism is true.Incompatibilism, on the other hand, claims that free will and determinism cannot coexist; if determinism is true, then individuals cannot have free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.The debate between these two positions contributes to the ongoing philosophical discussions about responsibility, choice, and the implications of determinism [1].</p>
<p>Comp.</p>
<p>Trust Utility Trust Rationale GPT-4 7 9 8</p>
