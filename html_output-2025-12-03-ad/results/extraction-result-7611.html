                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Today, with the advent of Large-scale generative Language Models (LLMs) it is now possible to simulate free responses to interview questions such as those traditionally analyzed using qualitative research methods. Qualitative methodology encompasses a broad family of techniques involving manual analysis of open-ended interviews or conversations conducted freely in natural language. Here we consider whether artificial “silicon participants” generated by LLMs may be productively studied using qualitative analysis methods in such a way as to generate insights that could generalize to real human populations. The key concept in our analysis is algorithmic fidelity, a validity concept capturing the degree to which LLM-generated outputs mirror human sub-populations’ beliefs and attitudes. By definition, high algorithmic fidelity suggests that latent beliefs elicited from LLMs may generalize to real humans, whereas low algorithmic fidelity renders such research invalid. Here we used an LLM to generate interviews with “silicon participants” matching specific demographic characteristics one-for-one with a set of human participants. Using framework-based qualitative analysis, we showed the key themes obtained from both human and silicon participants were strikingly similar. However, when we analyzed the structure and tone of the interviews we found even more striking differences. We also found evidence of a hyper-accuracy distortion. We conclude that the LLM we tested (GPT-3.5) does not have sufficient algorithmic fidelity to expect in silico research on it to generalize to real human populations. However, rapid advances in artificial intelligence raise the possibility that algorithmic fidelity may improve in the future. Thus we stress the need to establish epistemic norms now around how to assess the validity of LLM-based qualitative research, especially concerning the need to ensure the representation of heterogeneous lived experiences.</p>

<p>As for the future, I think that learning some new techniques and exercises that are specifically geared towards managing heart failure and arthritis lack skills (symptom management) I might also need to learn how to monitor my heart rate, and how to avoid complications lack skills (symptom hypervigilance)</p>
<p>Table 1: Belief statements: Human (left) and Silicon (right).Belief statements were aligned based on their similarity when comparing human and silicon responses.The term 'Rank' refers to how frequently a domain was mentioned by humans and silicon participants, assessed separately for these groups.Instances, where beliefs are repeated, suggest that human participants expressed more detailed perspectives.For example, while humans might provide three distinct statements about how "Physical activity exacerbates my symptoms" -citing (1) fatigue, (2) a tight chest, and (3) heavy limbs -a silicon participant might simply state that "Physical activity worsens my symptoms".</p>
<p>I require training to be able to perform physical activityIn the future, as my health conditions change, I may need to learn new exercises or activities that are better suited to my abilities lack exercise techniques I may also need to learn how to use new equipment or technology that can help me to stay active lack skills (equipment)
