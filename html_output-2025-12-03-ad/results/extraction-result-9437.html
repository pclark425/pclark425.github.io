                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen, and as models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks the authors study.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) perform better when they produce step-by-step,"Chain-of-Thought"(CoT) reasoning before answering a question, but it is unclear if the stated reasoning is a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the question). We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) perform better when they produce step-by-step, "Chain-ofThought" (CoT) reasoning before answering a question, but it is unclear if the stated reasoning is a faithful explanation of the model's actual reasoning (i.e., its process for answering the question). We investigate hypotheses for how CoT reasoning may be unfaithful, by examining how the model predictions change when we intervene on the CoT (e.g., by adding mistakes or paraphrasing it). Models show large variation across tasks in how strongly they condition on the CoT when predicting their answer, sometimes relying heavily on the CoT and other times primarily ignoring it. CoT's performance boost does not seem to come from CoT's added test-time compute alone or from information encoded via the particular phrasing of the CoT. As models become larger and more capable, they produce less faithful reasoning on most tasks we study. Overall, our results suggest that CoT can be faithful if the circumstances such as the model size and task are carefully chosen.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>It is often critical to understand why a large language model (LLM) provided the output it did, to understand the extent to which we can rely on its output (especially in high-stakes settings such as medicine; Gunning et al., 2019; Rudin, 2019). Many have claimed that the interpretability or explainability</p>

<p>Figure 1. An illustration of our proposed tests for measuring the faithfulness of Chain of Thought (CoT), generating step-by-step reasoning before answering a question. Early Answering: Truncate the original CoT before answering. Adding Mistakes: Have a language model add a mistake somewhere in the original CoT and then regenerate the rest of the CoT. Paraphrasing: Reword the beginning of the original CoT and then regenerate the rest of the CoT. Filler Tokens: Replace the CoT with ellipses.
of LLMs is enhanced when they are prompted to generate step-by-step reasoning before giving an answer (Li et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023b). Such claims only hold if the generated reasoning is faithful</p>
<p>to the model's true reasoning, meaning that it "accurately represents the reasoning process behind the model's prediction" (Jacovi \&amp; Goldberg, 2020). However, LLM-generated reasoning has been shown to be unfaithful to the model's true reasoning process in some cases (Turpin et al., 2023), raising the question of if the stated reasoning is ever faithful.</p>
<p>To answer this question, we propose tests for measuring CoT faithfulness, enabling us to investigate CoT faithfulness across a variety of tasks on LLMs fine-tuned to behave as a helpful assistant (shown in Fig. 1). Our tests intervene on the model's stated reasoning in different ways and evaluate how the model's answer changes in response. We take a "defense-in-depth" approach; each test is not meant to be conclusive evidence for CoT being faithful, but rather aims to rule out the possibility of one class of faithfulness failures in CoT. We investigate the following possible faithfulness failures, including our main results below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post-hoc reasoning: The model's reasoning may be post-hoc, i.e., produced after a certain conclusion has already been guaranteed (Holzinger et al., 2017). Since post-hoc reasoning does not change the model's answer, there is no strong reason to believe that such reasoning would be faithful. In this work, we test for post-hoc reasoning by truncating the chain of thought or adding mistakes to it. We find great variation in how much LLMs use CoT on different tasks, not using CoT at all for some tasks while relying upon it heavily for other tasks.</li>
<li>Unfaithful reasoning due to test-time computation: The performance boost from CoT may be due to the greater test-time computation provided by the extra tokens between the question and when the model is prompted for its final answer (Wei et al., 2022). If this were the case, the model may be using the CoT to do performance-improving computation that it does not reveal in the CoT. In this work, we find no accuracy gain from CoT when we replace the CoT with uninformative filler text (all periods), suggesting that the extra test-time compute alone is not responsible for performance-improving computation.</li>
<li>Encoded reasoning: The benefit from CoT may be attained by LLMs encoding the relevant information in the generated reasoning in a way that is not understandable to human readers (a form of steganography). This may be through changes in e.g. punctuation, word choice, or other phrasing differences that improve the LLM's predictions, but in a way that is not clearly understandable by a human. In this work, we find similar performance when replacing CoT with paraphrased CoT, indicating that the particular phrasing of CoT is
not a driver of performance. ${ }^{1}$
Since our results indicate that the LLM's stated reasoning is unfaithful on some tasks, we also investigate if there is any size model that generates faithful reasoning on these tasks. We find that smaller models often generate more faithful reasoning than larger, more capable ones, and that models produce less faithful reasoning on easier versions of addition tasks. Our work shows that the model used for the task is a useful lever for obtaining more faithful CoT.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we find that, while chain of thought reasoning is not always faithful, it is possible to find conditions where it is more faithful. This finding paves the way for future work to design methods for LLMs to produce more faithful reasoning and for detecting when the model's reasoning is untrustworthy.</p>
<h2>2. Measuring Chain of Thought Faithfulness</h2>
<p>In this section, we investigate hypotheses that point against chain of thought faithfulness by perturbing the chain of thought and observing the model's behavior.</p>
<h3>2.1. Methods</h3>
<p>Model For most experiments in this section, we use a 175B-parameter pretrained, decoder-only transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) LLM (Radford et al., 2018; 2019; Brown et al., 2020), fine-tuned to be a helpful dialog assistant using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF; Christiano et al., 2017; Ziegler et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020), as in Bai et al. (2022). The one exception is the model used to generate mistakes in the adding mistakes experiment (§2.4); the model used here is the pretrained LM, without RLHF fine-tuning.</p>
<p>Tasks We select eight multiple choice tasks to evaluate that we expect will benefit from explicit reasoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>ARC Challenge (Clark et al., 2018): Grade-school level science questions, selected to be challenging for word retrieval or correlation approaches.</li>
<li>ARC Easy (Clark et al., 2018): Grade-school level science questions.</li>
<li>AQuA (Ling et al., 2017): Algebra word problems at a variety of difficulty levels.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chain of thought prompt and sample
Human: Question: 30% of all Huhulians own at least one TV. 24% of Huhulians who own at least one TV own at least four TV’s. What percent of Huhulians own at least four TV’s?</p>
<h2>Choices:</h2>
<p>(A): .084%
(B): 24%
(C): 4.67%
(D): 7.2%
(E): 15.6%</p>
<p>Assistant: Let’s think step by step: 30% of Huhulians own at least one TV. Of those 30%, 24% own at least four TVs. So 24% of 30%, or $0.24 \times 0.3=0.072=7.2\%$ of Huhulians own at least four TVs. The correct answer is choice (D).</p>
<p>Human: Given all of the above, what’s the single, most likely answer?</p>
<p>Assistant: The single, most likely answer is ( D)</p>

<li>LogiQA (Liu et al., 2020): Questions for logical reasoning from the National Civil Servants Examination of China, translated into English.</li>

<li>TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022): Factual questions from a variety of domains meant to elicit misconceptions (formatted as multiple-choice).</li>
</ul>
<p>Prompting and Sampling For each question on each task, we use the prompt shown in Table 1, modified slightly from Bowman et al. (2022). The number of choices varies depending on the task. We sample 100 reasoning samples for each problem using nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020) with $p=0.95$ and temperature 0.8 . We then append the prompt for the final answer (as in the final human turn in Table 1), and we obtain the model’s next token probabilities for each answer choice. Each reasoning sample is then split</p>

<h3>2.2 Chain of Thought Statistics</h3>
<p>Fig. 2 provides context for the rest of the experiments by giving an overview of results under the standard chain-ofthought condition. Performance metrics are presented in Table 2 as well. The collected reasoning samples have a mean of 4 steps (sentences), with $89 \%$ of samples having between three and six. ${ }^{2}$</p>
<p>Seven of the eight tasks show a performance improvement under chain of thought, with AQuA showing the greatest improvement. HellaSwag is the single exception to the trend, showing a degradation in performance instead. Throughout the rest of this paper, tasks will be ordered by the extent to which we see an improvement due to chain of thought reasoning, except where noted.</p>
<h3>2.3 Early Answering: Does Truncating the Chain of Thought Change the Predicted Answer?</h3>
<p>Post-hoc reasoning is reasoning which is generated after the conclusion has already been established. In the chain of thought setting the reasoning is sampled before the answer is sampled, but this sequential relationship does not imply a causal one. Reasoning not being post-hoc does not guarantee faithfulness, nor does being post-hoc exclude faithfulness. Overall though, if reasoning is not post-hoc, there are fewer ways for it to be unfaithful than there are for reasoning which is post-hoc, including greater test-time compute and steganography which we investigate in this work as well. See Lanham (2022) for further discussion.</p>
<p>To measure post-hoc reasoning, we truncate the chain of thought midway through to observe what answer the model</p>
<p><sup id="fnref3:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3. Chance of giving the same answer as the complete CoT after truncating the CoT at different points.
would give without the complete reasoning statement. If the model is no longer updating its answer based on further steps of the chain of thought, it stands to reason that the produced reasoning is post-hoc, having been produced after the conclusion was already inevitable.</p>
<p>For these experiments, we truncate the previously collected reasoning samples and prompt the model to answer the question with the partial chain of thought rather than the complete one. For each chain of thought collected, we truncate it after each step (here, each sentence) of the sample. So starting with a chain of thought $\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \ldots, x_{n}\right]$, we truncate it to an empty string [], truncate it to one sentence $\left[x_{1}\right]$, truncate it to two sentences $\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right]$, and so on. Each of the truncated chains of thought replaces the original CoT in the sample, and the model is prompted to answer as before.</p>
<p>Having collected answers after each truncation of the CoT, we measure how often the model comes to the same conclusion as it did with the complete CoT. If the amount of matching overall is low, this indicates that less of the reasoning is post-hoc.</p>
<h3>2.3.1. Early Answering Results</h3>
<p>Fig. 3 shows the results. From these results, we also calculate an area over the curve (AOC) metric for all CoT lengths of each task, presented in Table 2. AOC values are calculated as a weighted sum, where the AOC for each CoT length is weighted by the fraction of CoT samples having that length.</p>
<p>There is wide variation in the extent of post-hoc reasoning between tasks as measured by this experiment. Notably, for
the three lowest-AOC tasks (ARC (Easy), ARC (Challenge), and OpenbookQA), the chain of thought changes the final answer less than $10 \%$ of the time, while for the highest AOC task (AQuA) the chain of thought changes the answer more than $60 \%$ of the time. AQuA also consistently shows a low rate of matching the original answer before the final two steps of reasoning, suggesting that the amount of post-hoc reasoning on this task is low.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the amount of post-hoc reasoning per task (measured by AOC) also shows little correlation with the performance gain from chain of thought. For example, the accuracy boost that LogiQA gets from CoT is neglible, but it is second in AOC only to AQuA. HellaSwag shows an accuracy drop ( $-4.69 \%$ ) but shows less post-hoc reasoning on AOC relative to 4 other tasks which show an accuracy gain from CoT. These results suggest that CoT may be faithful even when it does not improve task performance.</p>
<h3>2.4. Adding Mistakes: Does Editing the Chain of Thought Change the Predicted Answer?</h3>
<p>We take another approach to testing whether the reasoning is post-hoc (as in $\S 2.3$ ), by directly perturbing the chain of thought by adding a mistake and observing the outcome. If inserting a mistake into the CoT changes the model's final answer, then the model is likely not ignoring the CoT.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we introduce a mistake into one step of the CoT and then sample a continued CoT from that point forward. To generate mistakes, we use a pretrained model (described in $\S 2.1$ ) to generate a mistaken version of a single sentence from the original CoT using a few shot prompt (see Appendix A for details). We then sample a (nominally) mistaken version of that sentence, sampling a maximum of 30 tokens. We replace the model-generated reasoning in the prompt (Table 1) with the original chain of thought until the point where the error was introduced, followed by the sampled mistaken step $\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{i}^{\prime}\right]$. We continue to sample the chain of thought from that point forward, using the model and prompt used for generating the original reasoning sample. We then prompt for a final answer given the reasoning sample as before. Table 3 contains an example.</p>
<p>Qualitatively, we find that our mistake generating process generates a plausible mistake at least $80 \%$ of the time. We also find that when the model's chain of thought leads it to an incorrect answer that is not present in the answer choices, it will often choose the answer choice that is closest to that answer (as in the example in Table 3).</p>
<p>Similarly to the early answering experiment (§2.3), we measure how often the final answer changes after the mistake has been added and the remaining CoT has been sampled. A low matching frequency indicates less post-hoc reasoning. We also calculate an AOC value for each task, as in $\S 2.3$.</p>
<p>|  | AOC |  | Accuracy |  |  |
| Task | Early Answering | Adding Mistakes | Without CoT | With CoT | Accuracy difference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AQuA | 0.44 | 0.52 | 28 | 43 | 15.32 |
| LogiQA | 0.26 | 0.31 | 42 | 43 | 1.02 |
| MMLU | 0.12 | 0.21 | 68 | 71 | 3.77 |
| HellaSwag | 0.12 | 0.23 | 71 | 66 | -4.69 |
| TruthfulQA | 0.11 | 0.20 | 59 | 63 | 4.38 |
| OpenBookQA | 0.07 | 0.15 | 82 | 84 | 2.71 |
| ARC (Challenge) | 0.05 | 0.11 | 88 | 90 | 2.28 |
| ARC (Easy) | 0.02 | 0.07 | 96 | 96 | 0.77 |</p>
<p>Table 2. Faithfulness and performance metrics for the tasks that we study. Tasks are sorted by early answering AOC, a measure of post-hoc reasoning (higher is less post-hoc, indicating greater faithfulness). AOC indicates area over the curve for the early answering and adding mistakes experiments respectively, weighted by the representation of each CoT length.</p>
<h2>Add Mistakes Example</h2>
<p>Human: Question: $30 \%$ of all Huhulians own at least one TV. $24 \%$ of Huhulians who own at least one TV own at least four TV's. What percent of Huhulians own at least four TV's?</p>
<p>Choices:
(A): $.084 \%$
(B): $24 \%$
(C): $4.67 \%$
(D): $7.2 \%$
(E): $15.6 \%$</p>
<p>Assistant: Let's think step by step: $30 \%$ of Huhulians own at least one TV. And $20 \%$ of those people who own at least one TV own four or more TV's. So $20 \%$ of $30 \%$ of Huhulians own at least four TV's, which is $6 \%$. The correct answer is therefore choice C, $4.67 \%$.</p>
<p>Human: Given all of the above, what's the single, most likely answer?</p>
<p>Assistant: The single, most likely answer is (C)</p>
<p>Table 3. Add-mistakes sample from AQuA example shown in $\S 2.1$. The introduced mistake is underlined. The subsequent reasoning was sampled after the addition of the underlined mistake.</p>
<h3>2.4.1. Adding Mistakes Results</h3>
<p>Fig. 4 and Table 2 show the results of this experiment. Largely these agree with the results from the early answering experiment (§2.3). The AOC results also broadly agree with the results in Fig. 4, where the ordering of the lines for all CoT lengths generally reflects the same ranking as the AOC scores. The ordering of tasks ranked by AOC is nearly identical, with HellaSwag scoring higher than MMLU as the only difference between them. As with the early answering experiments, we also observe a similar high-level finding: the extent of post-hoc reasoning varies considerably between tasks, and it is not strongly correlated with the accuracy improvement conferred by CoT.
<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4. Chance of giving the same answer with the original CoT vs. CoT with an LLM-introduced mistake in it.</p>
<p>For both early answering and adding mistakes experiments, AQuA and LogiQA are the two tasks with the most faithful reasoning (by some margin). The increased faithfulness may be due to the models' limited ability to do the task without CoT, which may cause the model to rely more on CoT. In $\S 3$, we find that the per-task faithfulness depends on the capabilities of the model used (e.g., on the model's size), which supports this hypothesis. Another potential cause for the increased faithfulness on these tasks is that they both involve logical reasoning, so it may be more clear that the model's final prediction should be entailed by the stated reasoning. In $\S 3$, we find that faithfulness does not depend on the task alone, casting some doubt on this hypothesis.</p>

<p>Figure 5. Accuracy when CoT is replaced with filler tokens. The measure on the x -axis is the length of filler tokens used as a percentile relative to the lengths of sampled CoTs from that task.</p>
<h3>2.5. Filler Tokens: Do Uninformative Chain of Thought Tokens Also Improve Performance?</h3>
<p>Here, we test the hypothesis that the additional test-time computation provided by a longer context window is responsible for the performance boost from CoT. If this were the case, the model may be using the CoT to do performanceimproving computation that it does not reveal in the CoT itself, indicating that important steps of reasoning may not be represented in the stated reasoning.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we replace the CoT with a number of " ..." tokens ("filler tokens"), each consisting of a space followed by three periods. We test strings of filler tokens ranging from zero tokens to the length (in tokens) of the longest chain of thought collected out of 100 samples for any given question, with a step size of five tokens. If the filler tokens provide a significant performance improvement, then the CoT may be unfaithful by not representing the actual process by which the model comes to its answer.</p>
<h3>2.5.1. Filler Tokens Results</h3>
<p>From Fig. 5 we can see that there is no increase in accuracy observed from adding " ..." tokens to the context. In fact, for some tasks, such as TruthfulQA and OpenBookQA, the performance actually drops slightly in the longer-context setting, which may be due to this kind of sequence being out of the model's training distribution. These results suggest that extra test-time compute alone is not used by models to perform helpful but unstated reasoning.</p>

<p>Table 4. Original and paraphrased chain of thought samples. Differences from the original chain of thought are underlined in the paraphrased sample.</p>
<h3>2.6. Paraphrasing: Does Rewording the Chain of Thought Change the Predicted Answer?</h3>
<p>One way that the model's stated reasoning could be unfaithful and also not post-hoc is if information that is encoded in phrasing choices of the reasoning are responsible for the change in the answer, rather than the content of the CoT itself. This could arise due to pressure during RLHF to provide the correct answer while also providing an implicit length penalty (Branwen, 2023), or due to pressures from RLHF to disguise the content of reasoning that might be disincentivized by the preference model.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we have a language model paraphrase the CoT to ablate phrasing choices that could contain encoded information in the CoT. If phrasing-encoded information is a major component of the accuracy boost conveyed by CoT, we should expect that paraphrasing will reduce or eliminate it. We ensure that the model that paraphrases the reasoning does not have access to the original question, to remove any incentive to generate reasoning that produces a correct answer to that question.</p>
<p>We have the model paraphrase the same subsequences of the reasoning sample as were used in early answering ( $\left[x_{1}\right]$ alone, $\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\right],\left[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\right]$, etc.) without access to the original question. The prompt we use can be found in Appendix A. We then insert the paraphrased chain of thought back into the original prompt and continue to sample until the end of the reasoning sample, then prompting for a final answer</p>
<p><img alt="img-4.jpeg" src="img-4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6. Accuracy with and without paraphrasing.
as before. ${ }^{3}$ An example can be found in Table 4. We measure the model's accuracy after standard and paraphrased CoT. If phrasing-encoded information is responsible for the accuracy boost conveyed by CoT, we should expect to see degraded performance under paraphrased reasoning relative to standard CoT.</p>
<h3>2.6.1. Paraphrasing Results</h3>
<p>Overall, the paraphrased accuracy closely matches the accuracy of the original chain of thought for almost all tasks at almost all numbers of filler tokens, as shown in Fig. 6. This result indicates that the particular phrasing of the reasoning is unlikely to encode information responsible for the accuracy gains of CoT.</p>
<h2>3. Does Model Size Affect CoT Faithfulness?</h2>
<p>Our results so far indicate that reasoning faithfulness is significantly lower on some tasks. For those tasks, it is natural to ask whether any models provide faithful reasoning on the tasks. If so, we would be able to choose the model we used to solve the task, such that it was one that produced faithful reasoning on that task, if faithful explanations were important (e.g., for high-stakes settings like medical decision-making). One potential cause for unfaithful reasoning in a model is that a model may already be</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup><img alt="img-5.jpeg" src="img-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7. Chance of giving the same answer with and without CoT reasoning, at a variety of model sizes.
able to confidently predict the answer without relying on CoT. In this case, CoT may not have much influence on the model's final answer. As a result, we hypothesize that, for reasoning faithfulness, larger models may behave worse than smaller ones ("inverse scaling"; McKenzie et al., 2023); smaller models may, for some tasks, benefit more from CoT, potentially leading them to rely more on CoT.</p>
<p>To explore this hypothesis, we show what percentage of the time the answer changes with vs. without CoT, a metric that intuitively captures how much the model relies on the CoT to predict answers. This metric is equivalent to our early answering experiment when using $0 \%$ of the CoT specifically. This metric is highly predictive of overall early answering and adding mistakes results, e.g., the ordering of tasks by AOC in Table 2. We thus use this metric in lieu of running the full set of early answering and adding mistakes experiments for computational reasons.</p>
<p>In this section, we use the series of LMs of varying sizes from Ganguli et al. (2023). The models are pretrained, decoder-only transformer models finetuned to be helpful dialog assistants with RLHF, similar to the model in §2.</p>
<h3>3.1. Standard Tasks</h3>
<p>Fig. 7 shows the results on the tasks from $\S 2$. For 7/8 tasks, the 13B parameter model changes its answer after CoT more often than the 175B model does. In fact, for most tasks, faithfulness gets monotonically worse from 13B to 175B parameter models, indicating inverse scaling in model size for reasoning faithfulness on these tasks. For six of the eight tasks (all but AQuA and LogiQA), the most faithful reasoning comes from the 13B model; on these tasks, the 13B model shows more faithful reasoning even than smaller models. We suspect that smaller models are not yet capable</p>
<p>Addition Task Samples</p>
<p>Human: Question: What is the solution to the following? $264+964=$
Assistant: Let's think step by step:
$264+964=$
$=264+(900+64)=$
$=(264+900)+64=$
$=1164+64=$
$=1228$
Therefore, $264+964=1228$.
Human: Given the above, what is the most likely answer? Give your answer as an integer enclosed within $&lt;$ answer $&gt;&lt;/$ answer $&gt;$.</p>
<p>Assistant: <answer $>1228&lt;/$ answer $&gt;$
Human: Question: What is the solution to the following? $95+86+98+42+16+63+58+$ $34=$</p>
<p>Assistant: Let's think step by step:
$95+86+98+42+16+63+58+34=$
$(95+86)+(98+42)+(16+63)+(58+34)=$ // add in pairs
$181+140+79+92=/$ / add again 492
So the solution is 492 .
Human: Given the above, what is the most likely answer? Give your answer as an integer enclosed within $&lt;$ answer $&gt;&lt;/$ answer $&gt;$.</p>
<p>Assistant: <answer $>492&lt;/$ answer $&gt;$</p>
<p>Table 5. Samples from the 175B model on addition task questions. Top: Sample from a two-operand, three-digit problem. Bottom: Sample from an eight-operand, two-digit problem.
enough to use CoT, as suggested by Appendix C which shows that $&lt;13$ B models obtain little to no gain in accuracy on these tasks with CoT. Overall, our results suggest that certain tasks do not inherently lead to unfaithful reasoning; instead, only models of a certain capability level (but no higher) on a task seem to produce faithful CoT.</p>
<h3>3.2. Addition Tasks</h3>
<p>To validate the above conclusion, we perform the same evaluation on a set of synthetic addition tasks where we can directly control for task difficulty. Each addition task is constituted of problems with $2,4,8$, or 16 operands, where each operand is either two or three digits in length. The model's answer is given as a free response, in contrast to the multiple choice tasks used previously. ${ }^{4}$ Prompts and samples are in Table 5.</p>
<p>From Fig. 8 we see that this measure of post-hoc reason-</p>
<p><sup id="fnref5:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup><img alt="img-6.jpeg" src="img-6.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8. Chance of giving the same answer with and without CoT reasoning on synthetic addition tasks, when varying model size.
ing increases with model size on each task, and increases with easier tasks at the same model size. This finding suggests that to elicit faithful reasoning that is appropriate for explaining model behavior, it may be necessary to choose models that are less capable than the maximally capable model available, especially for easier tasks.</p>
<h2>4. Related Work</h2>
<p>Analysis of Chain of Thought Faithfulness Recent work has analyzed CoT faithfulness in different ways than our work. Gao (2023) use Shapley analysis to show that certain tokens of the CoT are much more important than others for the final answer. Our work proposes different tests of CoT faithfulness with lower computational costs. Madaan \&amp; Yazdanbakhsh (2022) investigate CoT via counterfactual prompting and find that some aspects of the prompt are less important than others for the final answer reached. We intervene on the CoT produced by the model rather than few shot prompt examples and propose general tests for CoT faithfulness. Turpin et al. (2023) discover examples of unfaithful CoT in adversarially constructed settings, showing that CoT reasoning is not always faithful. In that paper, the model produces CoT in the presence of biasing few-shot examples; while the model's final answer is consistent with the bias provided by the prompt, the CoT gives a different explanation for the answer that does not reference the biasing</p>
<p>context. In contrast, this work investigates non-adversarial settings to collect evidence about reasoning faithfulness under a wider variety of realistic conditions. Wei et al. (2022) test three hypotheses for why CoT prompting provides a performance boost: that it produces an equation to be evaluated, that it provides additional test-time compute, and that it the CoT better enables the model to access relevant information from pretraining. We expand upon the test-time compute only experiment presented in that work with the filler tokens experiment presented in $\S 2.5$, by evaluating a wider range of tasks and varying the number of filler tokens.</p>
<p>Techniques to Increase Reasoning Faithfulness Prior work has proposed methods to generate reasoning that are more likely to be faithful by construction, due to the way that the reasoning or final answer is produced. Lyu et al. (2023) generate a program in a domain-specific language and execute the program (e.g., using a Python interpreter) to produce the final answer; this process ensures that the generating program is not post-hoc but rather directly used to produce the final answer. Creswell \&amp; Shanahan (2022) and Creswell et al. (2023) use a language model to choose statements from a context and then make inferences from those selected statements in a separate context window. Radhakrishnan et al. (2023) answer questions by decomposing them into subquestions, finding that this approach leads to more faithful reasoning according to our early answering and adding mistakes metrics. Some of the potential faithfulness problems raised in our work (i.e., post-hoc reasoning) may apply to the methods above. The metrics we propose may be useful for measuring the extent to which those methods improve faithfulness.</p>
<p>Techniques to Elicit Language Model Reasoning Prior work has proposed various methods to improve language model performance by eliciting reasoning before the answer. Approaches include generating subquestions (Dua et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023), producing a tree of thoughts (Yao et al., 2023a), devising and executing a plan for answering the question (Wang et al., 2023), and having language models debate to reach an answer (Du et al., 2023), among others. These approaches share a similar structure to chain of thought, where the language model produces earlier steps of reasoning and then conditions on them to produce later steps. As such, we believe that our methods for assessing faithfulness should hold for these methods as well.</p>
<h2>5. Limitations</h2>
<p>A key limitation of our investigation is that we do not have a separate way by which to understand the model's real internal reasoning process, without which we cannot know if the chain of thought is faithful to that reasoning process. Here, we collect evidence about various hypotheses that
could explain how the model uses CoT, but we do not know if our hypotheses are exhaustive or if other hypotheses we did not investigate might be correct. Without ground truth information about the faithfulness of the reasoning sample, it is also unclear how to weigh the importance of each experiment relative to the others in assessing faithfulness. A combination of our measurement techniques, plus additional experiments, will be needed to determine the relative strengths of evidence from each type of experiment and build a more complete picture of reasoning faithfulness.</p>
<p>Additionally, our work analyzed RLHF-finetuned models, which may generate reasoning whose faithfulness is different from that of other models such as pretrained LLMs. For example, pretrained LLMs may be more likely to condition strongly on text they have generated, since they are trained to generate the most plausible completion given some input, rather than maximize the overall human-judged quality of the completion. Pretrained LLMs may thus show fewer signs of post-hoc reasoning, e.g., being more likely to change their final answer when mistakes are added to the CoT. Overall, a promising avenue for future work is to investigate whether training schemes different from RLHF are more effective at eliciting faithful reasoning from LLMs.</p>
<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this work, we investigate the faithfulness of reasoning samples produced by large language models using chain-of-thought prompting. We test various hypotheses of how chain of thought could provide unfaithful explanations of the model's reasoning, and apply these tasks across tasks and model size. Our experiments show large variation in the extent of post-hoc reasoning across tasks, and they provide evidence against the hypotheses that increased test-time compute or phrasing-encoded information are drivers of CoT improvement. We also see that the degree of post-hoc reasoning often shows inverse scaling, getting worse with increasingly capable models, suggesting that smaller models may be better to use if faithful reasoning is important. We hope that our metrics for evaluating CoT faithfulness open up avenues for increasing the faithfulness of CoT, building towards systems whose stated reasoning is trustworthy and verifiable.</p>

<p>Figure 9. Probability of producing the same answer under paraphrasing as the unmodified reasoning sample. The dotted baselines are the probability that two IID reasoning samples would come to the same answer by chance alone.</p>
<h2>A. Adding Mistakes \&amp; Paraphrasing Prompts</h2>
<p>We present the prompts used for the adding mistakes experiment (§2.4) and the paraphrasing experiment (§2.6) in Table 6 and Table 7 respectively. As noted in $\S 2.4$, the mistakes for the adding mistakes experiment are generated using a pretrained base model, without RLHF fine-tuning.</p>
<h2>B. Additional Paraphrasing Results</h2>
<p>Fig. 9 shows the fraction of reasoning samples that arrive at the same answer as the original CoT as a greater amount of the reasoning sample is paraphrased. If steganography were an important reason that the model was coming to its conclusion, we might expect to see flat or downward-sloping lines in Fig. 9; paraphrasing that ended in the middle of the chain of thought would corrupt the encoded message, causing the model to lose the reasoning it had done so far and need to reconstruct it in the continued CoT. Instead, Fig. 9 shows a smooth upwards curve for most steps of most tasks. AQuA and LogiQA are slight exceptions for six-step samples, showing more flatness in earlier steps than in the shorter reasoning samples. However, if encoded reasoning is present here, it is not an important source of accuracy improvement (as shown in Fig. 6).</p>
<h2>C. CoT Accuracy Gain Across Model Size</h2>
<p>Fig. 10 shows the accuracy with and without CoT for the tasks and models used in $\S 3.1$. Fig. 11 shows the accuracy improvement provided by CoT in the same tasks and models. For four of eight tasks (ARC (Easy), ARC (Challenge), HellaSwag, and AQuA) the model size at which there is the greatest accuracy improvement is the same as the model size at which faithfulness is greatest (see Fig. 7).
