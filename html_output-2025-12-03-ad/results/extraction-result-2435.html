                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research. However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions. Recent developments in large language models~(LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas. However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information. Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas~(CoI) agent, an LLM-based agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain. This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers. Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation. Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of \$0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design.</p>

(4) Cost and variability from LLM API usage limit scale (only 50 topics evaluated). (5) Remaining risk of semantic similarity to existing work; needs novelty-checker and iterative refinement.

The paper reports ~70.8% agreement between GPT-4o and human judges and indicates CoI attains the highest automated-method scores (ELOs in the ~1100+ range in reported tables) and performs especially well on Novelty and Significance; for experiment design CoI surpasses RAG by ~70 ELO points in human evaluation. AI-Scientist scored substantially lower (examples in tables show AI-Scientist ELOs in the ~800–890 range), indicating weaker performance for pure idea generation in this benchmark.",

(2) Risk of incoherent mixing of unrelated methods if literature is presented naively (mitigated by CoI chain construction). (3) Limited novelty/diversity from single-pass LLM generation (addressed by proposing evolutionary multi-agent ideas). (4) Cost and variability from LLM API usage limit scale (only 50 topics evaluated). (5) Remaining risk of semantic similarity to existing work; needs novelty-checker and iterative refinement. (6) When CoI construction is omitted or future-trend/entity modules removed, idea quality drops significantly (ablation results).",

In experiment design, CoI led automated methods and beat RAG by ~70 ELO in human evaluation.

<p>CHAIN OF IDEAS: REVOLUTIONIZING RESEARCH VIA NOVEL IDEA DEVELOPMENT WITH LLM AGENTS
30 Oct 2024083E5622302A7B916F2D7C1CEC581814arXiv:2410.13185v5[cs.AI]
Effective research ideation is a critical step for scientific research.However, the exponential increase in scientific literature makes it challenging for researchers to stay current with recent advances and identify meaningful research directions.Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) suggest a promising avenue for automating the generation of novel research ideas.However, existing methods for idea generation either trivially prompt LLMs or directly expose LLMs to extensive literature without indicating useful information.Inspired by the research process of human researchers, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas (CoI) agent, an LLMbased agent that organizes relevant literature in a chain structure to effectively mirror the progressive development in a research domain.This organization facilitates LLMs to capture the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities.Furthermore, we propose Idea Arena, an evaluation protocol that can comprehensively evaluate idea generation methods from different perspectives, aligning closely with the preferences of human researchers.Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and shows comparable quality as humans in research idea generation.Moreover, our CoI agent is budget-friendly, with a minimum cost of $0.50 to generate a candidate idea and its corresponding experimental design 1 .</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Idea generation is a crucial aspect of scientific research for driving technological innovations and breakthroughs.Traditionally, this process has been predominantly human-driven, necessitating expert researchers to review extensive literature, identify limitations in existing solutions, and propose new research directions.However, the complexity and vastness of scientific literature, coupled with rapid technological advancements, have rendered this task increasingly challenging for researchers.</p>
<p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) (Achiam et al., 2023;Dubey et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024a) have enabled these models to exceed human experts in various scientific tasks, including mathematics (Yu et al., 2023), theorem proving (Yang et al., 2023), and coding (Chen et al., 2021).Building on this robust scientific foundation, one may hypothesize that LLMs could support a more abstract and creative research idea-generation task.Notably, Si et al. (2024); Kumar Existing methods seek to address two key challenges to improve the quality of generated ideas: curating pertinent literature for LLMs to gain inspiration and ensuring the novelty of generated ideas.To address the first challenge, previous research enhances traditional academic retrieval systems, which typically depend on textual similarity, with academic knowledge graphs (Baek et al., 2024;Wang et al., 2023).For the second challenge, existing approaches either apply predefined criteria such as novelty to guide the idea generation process (Baek et al., 2024) or iteratively refine ideas until they demonstrate low embedding similarities with existing papers (Wang et al., 2023).</p>
<p>However, in existing attempts, LLMs are presented with an extensive volume of research literature when asked to generate ideas.This makes LLMs vulnerable to the influence of less relevant works, potentially resulting in ideas that lack logical coherence and technological innovation.As shown in the upper part of Figure 1, the LLM borrows an idea from GraphGPT (Tang et al., 2024) and applies it into GoT framework (Besta et al., 2024) to generate what they interpret as a "novel idea".However, the resultant idea conflates two concepts: GoT is a prompting method while GraphGPT is a finetuning method leveraging graph neural network architecture (Zhou et al., 2020).In contrast, human researchers often trace the evolution of a research field by analyzing its progression from foundational works to the most recent advancements.This comprehensive perspective provides valuable insights into the key factors driving developments within the domain.Such an understanding enables researchers to critically assess the limitations of earlier studies while identifying emerging trends.Therefore, they are better grounded in devising innovative and impactful research ideas.</p>
<p>Motivated by the human practices in conducting research, we introduce a novel Chain-of-Ideas (CoI) agent framework to address the previously identified logical inconsistencies in the ideation processes of LLMs.As shown in the bottom part of Figure 1, CoI agent aims to provide a clear landscape of current research topics by systematically selecting and organizing the relevant papers and their ideas in a chain structure.CoI agent offers several distinctive advantages: Firstly, it minimizes the risk of interference from less relevant literature via carefully selecting papers (i.e. from CoT (Wei et al., 2022) to GoT).Second, LLMs are demonstrated with human practice to craft a novel idea.For example, SC (Wang et al., 2022) emerges as a novel idea derived from CoT.This can be viewed as a form of few-shot prompting strategy, which has been proven to enhance the overall LLM's generation capability (Brown et al., 2020).Third, CoI exemplifies a global progression in research development.As a result, LLMs can gain a deep understanding of the motivations behind these developmental trends, facilitating the identification of promising future research directions.Specifically, CoI agent first retrieves an anchor paper of the given research topic.Instead of indiscriminately aggregating all papers within the citation network of the anchor, as done in (Baek et al., 2024), we construct the CoI by selecting relevant and important literature from both the anchor's references and its subsequent works, thereby extending the chain backward and forward from the anchor.We then prompt the constructed CoI to an LLM for idea generation and experiment design.</p>
<p>During idea generation, we require the LLM to predict possible future trends.This prognostic result facilitates the gradual consolidation of the idea, beginning with the motivation for the proposed idea, progressing through an assessment of its potential impact, and culminating in the realization.However, as the evolution of scientific discovery can emerge from multiple perspectives, a single CoI may be insufficient to capture the most promising direction.Additionally, there is no guarantee that the generated ideas will be novel.To address these issues, we construct multiple CoI branches for different perspectives of a research topic.Additionally, a novelty-checker agent iteratively evaluates the draft idea against existing literature and refines it if substantial similarity is identified.</p>
<p>We compare our CoI agent against existing baselines on idea generation in the artificial intelligence (AI) field.Generating novel research ideas requires a profound comprehension of the respective research domain, coupled with a rigorous reasoning process.Previous endeavors (Lu et al., 2024;Baek et al., 2024) have sought to augment LLMs with relevant papers to facilitate the ideation process.However, these methods simply mix these papers into the prompt without effective organization.This scenario is akin to dropping an LLM at a chaotic intersection with no map in sight, leaving it uncertain about which path to take.To address this issue, we propose a Chain-of-Ideas agent framework.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 2, a CoI, represented as
{I −M → • • • → I 0 → • • • → I N }
, is a sequence consisting of M + N + 1 ideas extracted from M + N + 1 research papers respectively, where they together show the evolution progress within a given research field.Specifically, given an initial research topic, we prompt the LLM to generate multiple queries, [q 1 , . . ., q K ], that reflect K different perspectives of this topic.The prompt is given in Table 7 of Appendix.Unless otherwise specified, all prompts of our framework are presented in the Appendix tables.The K queries are used to construct K branches of CoI.This reduces the reliance on a single CoI that may be insufficient to capture the most significant development and direction.For each query q k , we use it to retrieve a top-ranked paper, which we call anchor paper P k 0 .In Figure 2, ToT (Yao et al., 2024) is an illustrative example of an anchor paper.An anchor paper serves as the foundation for constructing a CoI.Specifically, a CoI is constructed by extending from the corresponding anchor paper to related papers in both directions: forward, tracing the progression of ideas, and backward, tracing their origins.</p>
<p>In the forward direction, starting from P k 0 , we identify subsequent papers that directly cite it by leveraging the Semantic Scholar API2 .We use OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large3 to rank these papers based on their cosine similarities to the concatenation of the initial research topic and the abstract of the anchor paper.Subsequently, we select the highest-ranked paper as P k 1 to extend the CoI in the forward direction (e.g.GoT in Figure 2).This process is repeated iteratively from P k i to P k i+1 , until either the length of the CoI reaches a preset value or the LLM finds that there is no valuable follow-up work (Table 8).</p>
<p>In the backward direction, starting from the anchor paper P k 0 , we instruct an LLM to thoroughly review the full paper and to identify candidate references based on the following criteria: 1) references that P k 0 directly built upon, 2) references that serve as baselines in P k 0 , and 3) references that tackle the same topic as P k 0 .With those candidate references, we ask the LLM to determine the most relevant one to the anchor paper (Tables 9 and 10), denoted as P k −1 (e.g.SC in Figure 2), to extend the CoI backward.This backward extension is also carried out iteratively from P k −i to P k −(i+1) to identify preceding papers (e.g.tracing backward from SC to CoT in Figure 2).It terminates when the length of CoI reaches a preset value or we encounter a milestone paper (defined as one with over 1,000 citations), indicating that the idea from the milestone paper could serve as a strong starting point for the CoI.Additionally, we instruct the LLM to terminate the search if no reference relevant to the original research topic is found (Table 8).</p>
<p>After we collect K paper chains, denoted as
{P k −M k → • • • → P k 0 → • • • → P k N k } K k=1
, we ask the LLM to extract ideas from these papers and inherit the progressive relation of the paper chains to form our CoIs 9 and 10).Then for each CoI, we ask the LLM to summarize the existing research trends by analyzing the evolution between any two adjacent ideas (Table 11).For example, the upper part of Figure 2 shows the evolution process from CoT to GoT step-by-step.Additionally, we extract experiment designs and the definition of key entities from these papers (Tables 9 and 10).The above information including CoIs and the derived knowledge will be used in the following idea generation and experiment design stages.
{I k −M k → • • • → I k 0 → • • • → I k N k } K k=1 (Tables</p>
<p>IDEA GENERATION</p>
<p>In this section, we use the above-constructed CoIs and their developing trends to guide the generation of a novel idea.For each generated CoI, the first step is to predict possible future trends.As shown in the lower-left section of Figure 2, we prompt the LLM with the CoI, the developing trends of existing works, and the key entities extracted from existing literature, as described in Sec.2.2 (Tables 12 and 13).These entities comprise relevant datasets and potential baseline models, which are important to clarify the concepts mentioned in the existing literature.After obtaining the future trend, we continue to prompt the LLM to articulate its motivation, novelty, and methodology, finally consolidate the idea (Tables 14 and 15).Through this step-by-step manner, COI can produce a more detailed idea.Following the previous practice (Wang et al., 2023;Lu et al., 2024), we also use a novelty-check agent to evaluate candidate ideas.It retrieves relevant papers and prompts another LLM to assess the similarity between the generated idea and the retrieved papers (Table 16).Based on this assessment, our framework determines if another round of generation is necessary.Finally, we pairwisely compare the generated ideas from all CoI branches and select the one with the highest winning rate as the final idea for the experiment design.This pairwise comparison follows the same method as Idea Arena, refer to Sec. 3.4 for details.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</p>
<p>While our primary goal is to generate novel ideas, it is also useful to develop experimental plans that help users implement these ideas.Thus, we extended the CoI agent to include experiment design.As shown in the lower-right of Figure 2, we prompt the LLM with experiments from existing works obtained from Sec. 2.2 as few-shot examples, along with the proposed idea and key entities, to guide the LLM in designing experiments for our ideas (Table 17).</p>
<p>We also employ a review agent to assess the candidate experiment designs.Its main role is to evaluate the clarity and comprehensiveness of the protocol, ensuring all key elements-such as datasets and models-are clearly specified.Additionally, it checks if the design provides enough detail for practical implementation (Table 18).The review agent provides critical feedback on these aspects, subsequently utilizing this information to conduct further searches for relevant literature (Table 19) to help the LLM refine and enhance its previous experiment design (Table 20).Through this iterative process of review and refinement, we arrive at a final experiment design.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL SETUPS</p>
<p>IMPLEMENTATIONS</p>
<p>In our CoI agent, we primarily use GPT-4o (05-13)4 as our LLM implementation.For some modules that require full-paper understanding, we use  to read the paper and summarize the core contents due to its lower price and good summarization capability.We use Semantic Scholar as our academic search engine.For the main experimental results, the maximum length of the CoI is set to 5 and the number of CoI branches is set to 3, and their analysis results are given later.The iteration number of self-refinement in the experiment design stage is set to 1 for cost saving.</p>
<p>DATA</p>
<p>To evaluate our CoI agent's ability to generate novel ideas, we collect recent research topics from Hugging Face's Daily Papers5 , known for its timely updates on AI research and the high quality of the featured papers.We select papers submitted between August 1 and September 15, 2024, ensuring that the topics are sufficiently new and the time frame is after the data cutoff of the LLM.We ask 10 skilled researchers with diverse interests in AI to identify papers that capture their interests.Subsequently, we prompt GPT-4o to extract research topics, proposed ideas, and their corresponding experiment designs from these selected papers (Tables 21, Table 22 and 23).The extracted topics will then be returned to the researchers for validation, ensuring that the extracted topics are valid and reasonable within their research domains.The extracted ideas and experiment designs will be utilized as our Real Paper baseline, as described in Section 3.3.Due to the substantial costs associated with generating and evaluating ideas and experiment designs, we adhere to the assessment scale of Lu et al. (2024); Wang et al. (2023) to collect 50 research topics in total for evaluation.</p>
<p>Preprint</p>
<p>BASELINES</p>
<p>We compare our CoI agent with recent works on idea generation and experiment design.To ensure a fair comparison, we employ GPT-4o and Semantic Search as the LLM and academic retriever implementations, respectively, across all baseline methods.Furthermore, we unify the output format of the generated ideas and experiment designs to minimize evaluation preference towards more structured outputs (Chiang et al., 2024).We compare with the following baselines:</p>
<p>• RAG: This is a vanilla retrieval augmented generation approach (Lewis et al., 2020), where we directly prompt the LLM with retrieved literature for idea generation and experiment design.• ResearchAgent (Baek et al., 2024): This work leverages additional academic knowledge graph for enhancing the literature retrieval and adopts a multi-agent framework to iteratively refine ideas through peer discussions.We follow the original paper to reproduce this baseline.• GPT-Researcher (Assafelovic, 2023): GPT-Researcher is an agent framework specifically designed for the research domain.The agent is enhanced with plan-and-solve and RAG capabilities.• AI-Scientist (Lu et al., 2024): This work originally aims to generate the entire paper with the idea, methods, and experimental results.We extract the components related to idea generation and experiment design to serve as our baseline.• Real Paper: Note that, in Sec.3.2, we extract topics from existing research papers.Therefore, the ideas and the experiment designs from these papers serve as a natural baseline to quantify the gap between model-generated ideas and genuine human ideas.</p>
<p>EVALUATION: IDEA ARENA</p>
<p>Model-based Evaluation.The open-ended nature of idea generation poses challenges for automatic evaluation.Prior work primarily uses LLM-based Likert scale system to score ideas (Baek et al., 2024;Lu et al., 2024).However, Si et al. (2024) show this method poorly aligns with human preferences.Instead, they show LLMs perform better in ranking ideas.To obtain reliable scores for evaluation, we propose Idea Arena, a pairwise evaluation system using a Round-Robin tournament to compute ELO scores for each idea-generation method.For a given topic, we require the LLM judge to rank the ideas generated by any pair of methods (Table 24).We evaluate each pair twice with order reversed to reduce the position bias.To comprehensively evaluate an idea from multiple perspectives, we incorporate criteria from ICML 2020 review guidelines6 , and those in Si et al. (2024), which consist of Novelty, Significance, Clarity, Feasibility, and Expected Effectiveness.</p>
<p>Finally, the resultant win-loss-tie records are utilized to calculate the ELO scores for each method, following the practices outlined in Zheng et al. (2024); Zhao et al. (2024).We also evaluate the experiment design in the same pairwise way, focusing on Feasibility, Technical Quality, and Clarity.Refer to Definitions for all metrics in Tables 5 and 6 of the Appendix.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation.We also perform human evaluation in a pairwise manner.The 10 researchers who review the extracted topics are asked to rank two ideas and experiment designs using the same criteria.To ensure fairness, we anonymize the source of the ideas by concealing the method identity.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>4  Human-Model Agreements of Idea Arena.To assess the reliability of our model-based evaluation within Idea Arena, we analyze the agreements between the preferences of the human judges and the LLM judges.We follow Zheng et al. (2024) to compute the agreement, which is defined as the probability that two judges agree on the winner of one specific arena match.Figure 5 shows the pairwise agreement between humans and several state-ofthe-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro-Exp-08277, and Claude-3.5-Sonnet8 .We observe an average agreement of 70.8% between GPT-4o and humans.This finding indicates a strong alignment between humanbased and model-based evaluations, thereby highlighting the robustness of Idea Arena in evaluating the quality of generated research ideas.Moreover, GPT-4o demonstrates the highest level of agreement with humans among all tested LLMs.Therefore, we will utilize GPT-4o as the LLM judge for subsequent analytical experiments.Additionally, we present the agreement on individual criteria between GPT-4o and human evaluators in Omits the Future Trend Prediction module, prompting the LLM to consolidate ideas directly based on the provided input information.3) -Entities: Skips inputting entity definitions during idea generation.To ensure fair comparison, each variant is scored against the full CoI Agent, with 2/1/0 points for win/tie/lose in 50 matches, for a maximum of 100 points.</p>
<p>Results in Table 2 show that all variants negatively affect idea quality.Excluding the CoI construction stage has the most significant impact, emphasizing the importance of organizing literature based on progressive relationships to enhance the LLM's understanding of trends.Removing the Future Trend Prediction reduces novelty, as the LLM lacks insight into potential forward-thinking ideas.Although slight improvements in clarity and feasibility are observed, these are not substantial, likely due to evaluation variability.Finally, omitting entity information reduces clarity and effectiveness, as the LLM generates more abstract ideas without grounding in specific concepts.This highlights the value of entity information in enhancing the clarity and practical relevance of ideas.</p>
<p>CASE STUDY</p>
<p>We present an intriguing case study in Table 3 with the same topic of our paper -generating novel research ideas using LLMs.Given the input topic, our CoI agent first constructs the chain of ideas, extending I 0 (Baek et al., 2024) in both forward and backward directions.Then the agent analyzes current research trends for any two adjacent ideas.For instance, it identifies that the core development from I −1 to I 0 is the generation of ideas rather than hypotheses.After digesting the existing trends, the CoI agent realizes that LLMs have great potential in idea generation but are limited in novelty and diversity.Therefore, it proposes an evolutionary algorithm, which specifically models the variations between parents and children, as a possible future trend for novel and diverse idea generation.Finally, the agent consolidates its final idea by drawing on future trends and with practical implementations, such as crossover and mutation, to ensure effective realization.Therefore, the generated idea is viable and novel, deserving further exploration in our future work.As a byproduct of idea generation, we also require these baselines to develop potential experiment designs for realizing their proposed ideas.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENT DESIGN</p>
<p>Future Trend Prediction:</p>
<p>Given the previous research's progression and the identified gaps, a promising direction is to unleash the potential of LLM in ideation.We can develop a multi-agent system that leverages evolutionary algorithms to enhance the diversity and novelty of LLM-generated research ideas . . .</p>
<p>Final Idea: EvoResearchAgent: Enhancing Diversity and Novelty in Idea Generation with Evolution • Motivation: Using LLMs for idea generation has shown promising advancements.However, challenges persist, particularly concerning the diversity and novelty of LLM-generated ideas.Si et al. (2024) show that while LLMs can produce novel ideas, they often lack a broad range of perspectives and diversity.Additionally, Baek et al. (2024) have emphasized the need for a more systematic approach to improving the quality of generated ideas.To address these issues, we propose EvoResearchAgent, a multi-agent system that leverages evolutionary algorithms to enhance the diversity and novelty of generated ideas . . .• Method:</p>
<p>• Idea Initialize: An LLM generates some initial ideas as the start point of the evolutionary process . . .To examine the impact of the CoI length on the quality of generated ideas, we constructed variants with differing maximum chain lengths.Furthermore, we also adopt the "-CoI" variant in Sec.4.2 as a 0-length variant, which uses 5 retrieved papers but does not organize them in a chain structure.Figure 6 presents the idea arena results among these length variants.We observe a substantial improvement of idea-generation quality when we increase the length from 0 to 3.This indicates a clear developmental trend analysis is more pivotal than the quantity of related literature.Furthermore, the quality of generated ideas continues to improve as the length of the CoI increases.Longer CoIs offer more reliable and comprehensive insights into Preprint the evolving trends within the current research domain, thereby enabling the LLM to better capture future development trends.The quality of generated ideas levels off after reaching a maximum length of 5.This saturation point indicates that this length is sufficient to capture relevant trends, with additional literature offering diminishing returns.We also assess the impact of the width of CoI (i.e., the branch number K) on the quality of generated ideas.Figure 7 shows the trend of average ELO scores with varying branch numbers.Generally, increasing the branch numbers shows a positive correlation with idea quality.However, the disparity in ELO scores across different branch numbers is small.This phenomenon can likely be attributed to the fact that generating multiple chains primarily helps reduce the impact of any single CoI performing poorly.Fortunately, such low-quality CoIs are rare.</p>
<p>WIDTH OF COI</p>
<p>RELATED WORKS</p>
<p>Scientific Research Idea Generation.Idea generation is a fundamental step in scientific research.</p>
<p>Due to its innovative nature, idea generation has been primarily a human-driven activity.However, recent studies indicate that LLMs can generate plausibly novel and feasible ideas as those of human researchers (Si et al., 2024;Kumar et al., 2024).To investigate the potential of LLMs in idea generation, prior works begin with the task of scientific hypothesis discovery (Yang et al., 2024b;Qi et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023), which aims to elucidate relationships between two scientific variables.Despite its utility, scientific hypothesis discovery may not fully capture the complexity and multifaceted nature of real-world problems.To address this limitation, projects like GPT-Researcher (Assafelovic, 2023) and ResearchAgent (Baek et al., 2024) have adopted a more open-ended idea generation scenario including the underlying methodologies and experimental designs.They leverage agent-based systems to enhance the quality of idea generation.Beyond ideation, numerous studies also explore the use of LLMs for executing experiments (Huang et al., 2024;Tian et al., 2024) or combining both idea generation and experimental execution (Li et al., 2024;Lu et al., 2024).However, these approaches often make minor modifications to existing ideas for drafting their ideas, which often lack depth and creativity.</p>
<p>Align LLMs with Human Cognitive Patterns.As LLMs are trained with vast amounts of human data (Brown et al., 2020), this may enable them to internalize human cognitive patterns.Firstly, CoT (Wei et al., 2022) indicates that LLMs can enhance their reasoning abilities when provided with step-by-step guidance.Further research supports this notion by showing that simply prompting LLMs to engage in step-by-step reasoning can trigger better reasoning capability (Kojima et al., 2022).Additionally, Fu et al. (2022)  Is there any obvious error or unreasonable part in the idea, and can the experiment be designed normally according to this idea.</p>

reveals that in-depth reasoning of LLMs can be achieved with more elaborate prompts.As a result, a prompting strategy that closely emulates human cognition is likely to elicit more insightful responses from these models.Motivated by this, we propose CoI to better mimic the progressive cognitive patterns of humans when generating new research ideas.Evaluation metrics of ideas.
6 CONCLUSIONSIn this paper, we introduce Chain of Ideas (CoI) agent, a framework designed to enhance the capa-bility of LLMs in generating research ideas. The CoI agent offers a promising and concise solutionby organizing ideas into a chain structure, effectively mirroring the progressive development within
a given research domain.It facilitates LLMs to digest the current advancements in research, thereby enhancing their ideation capabilities.pTo comprehensively evaluate the capability of automated idea generation methods, we also propose Idea Arena, an evaluation system that requires the participant methods to compete in pairs about their generated ideas for the research topics, which demonstrates high agreement with human evaluation.Experimental results indicate that the CoI agent consistently outperforms other methods and is capable of generating ideas comparable to human creativity.</p>
