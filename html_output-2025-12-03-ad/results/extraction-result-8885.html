                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> On the Adequacy of Prototype Theory as a Thmry of Concepts*</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Prototype theory construes membership in a concept's extension as graded, detemzined by similarity to the concept's '3e.W exemplar (or by some other measure of central tendency). The present paper is concerned with the compatibi1it.J of this view of concept membership with two criteria of adequacy for theories of concepts. The first criterion Conrorns ;he relationship between complex concepts and their conceptual con;,&:CSrr The second concerns the truth conditions for thoughts correspo,ldi.T? lo simple inclusions. A novel and ambitious theory has emerged from the last ten ye:rs of psychological research into the concepts that underlie 'kind " terms like " animal " , " tree " , " tool " , and " clothing ". The distinguishing doctrine of the new theory is that entities fall neither sharply in nor sharply out of a concept's extension. Rather, an object instances a concept only to the extent that it is similar to the prototype of the concept; the boundary between membership and nonmembership in a concept's extension is thus fuzzy. We'll call the new theory (really, class of theories) prototype theory. In this paper we consider two aspects of concepts relevant to choosing between pretcltype theory and its more traditional rivals. One concerns conceptual combination, that is, the process whereby relatively complex concepts are</p>

Prototype theory construes membership in a concept's extension as graded, detemzined by similarity to the concept's '3e.W exemplar (or by some other measure of central tendency). The present paper is concerned with the compatibi1it.J of this view of concept membership with two criteria of adequacy for theories of concepts. The first criterion Conrorns ;he relationship between complex concepts and their conceptual con;,&amp;:CSrrThe second concerns the truth conditions for thoughts correspo,ldi.T? lo simple inclusions.</p>
<p>A novel and ambitious theory has emerged from the last ten ye:rs of psychological research into the concepts that underlie 'kind" terms like "animal", "tree", "tool", and "clothing". The distinguishing doctrine of the new theory is that entities fall neither sharply in nor sharply out of a concept's extension. Rather, an object instances a concept only to the extent that it is similar to the prototype of the concept; the boundary between membership and nonmembership in a concept's extension is thus fuzzy. We'll call the new theory (really, class of theories) prototype theory. In this paper we consider two aspects of concepts relevant to choosing between pretcltype theory and its more traditional rivals. One concerns conceptual combination, that is, the process whereby relatively complex concepts are </p>
