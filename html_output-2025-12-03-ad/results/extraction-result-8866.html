                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Graph-to-text generation aims to generate fluent texts from graph-based data. In this paper, we investigate two recent pretrained language models (PLMs) and analyze the impact of different task-adaptive pretraining strategies for PLMs in graph-to-text generation. We present a study across three graph domains: meaning representations, Wikipedia knowledge graphs (KGs) and scientific KGs. We show that approaches based on PLMs BART and T5 achieve new state-of-the-art results and that task-adaptive pretraining strategies improve their performance even further. We report new state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 49.72 on AMR-LDC2017T10, 59.70 on WebNLG, and 25.66 on AGENDA datasets - a relative improvement of 31.8%, 4.5%, and 42.4%, respectively, with our models generating significantly more fluent texts than human references. In an extensive analysis, we identify possible reasons for the PLMs’ success on graph-to-text tasks. Our findings suggest that the PLMs benefit from similar facts seen during pretraining or fine-tuning, such that they perform well even when the input graph is reduced to a simple bag of node and edge labels.</p>

Graph-to-text generation aims to generate fluent texts from graph-based data. In this paper, we investigate two recent pretrained language models (PLMs) and analyze the impact of different task-adaptive pretraining strategies for PLMs in graph-to-text generation. We present a study across three graph domains: meaning representations, Wikipedia knowledge graphs (KGs) and scientific KGs. We show that approaches based on PLMs BART and T5 achieve new state-of-the-art results and that task-adaptive pretraining strategies improve their performance even further. We report new state-of-the-art BLEU scores of 49.72 on AMR-LDC2017T10, 59.70 on WebNLG, and 25.66 on AGENDA datasets -a relative improvement of 31.8%, 4.5%, and 42.4%, respectively, with our models generating significantly more fluent texts than human references. In an extensive analysis, we identify possible reasons for the PLMs' success on graph-totext tasks. Our findings suggest that the PLMs benefit from similar facts seen during pretraining or fine-tuning, such that they perform well even when the input graph is reduced to a simple bag of node and edge labels. 1Zhao et al., 2020a); and investigate the possible reasons for such a good performance.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Graphs are important data structures in NLP as they represent complex relations within a set of objects. For example, semantic and syntactic structures of sentences can be represented using different graph representations (e.g., AMRs, Banarescu et al., 2013;semantic-role labeling, Surdeanu et al., 2008;syntactic and semantic graphs, Belz et al., 2011) and knowledge graphs (KGs) are used to describe factual knowledge in the form of relations between entities (Gardent et al., 2017;Vougiouklis et al., 2018;Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Graph-to-text generation, a subtask of data-totext generation (Gatt and Krahmer, 2018), aims to create fluent natural language text to describe an input graph (see Figure 1). This task is important for NLP applications such as dialogue generation (Moon et al., 2019) and question answering (Duan et al., 2017). Recently, it has been shown that structured meaning representation, such as AMR or KG, can store the internal state of a dialog system, providing core semantic knowledge (Bonial et al., 2020;Bai et al., 2021) or can be the result of a database query for conversational QA (Yu et al., 2019). Moreover, dialog states can be represented as KGs to encode compositionality and can be shared across different domains, slot types and dialog participators (Cheng et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Transfer learning has become ubiquitous in NLP and pretrained Transformer-based architectures (Vaswani et al., 2017) have considerably outperformed prior state of the art in various downstream tasks (Devlin et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2019a;Radford et al., 2019).</p>
<p>In this paper, we analyze the applicability of two recent text-to-text pretrained language models (PLMs), BART  and T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), for graph-to-text generation. We choose these models because of their encoderdecoder architecture, which makes them particularly suitable for conditional text generation. Our study comprises three graph domains (meaning representations, Wikipedia KGs, and scientific KGs). We further introduce task-adaptive graph-to-text pretraining approaches for PLMs and demonstrate that such strategies improve the state of the art by a substantial margin.</p>
<p>While recent works have shown the benefit of explicitly encoding the graph structure in graph-totext generation (Song et al., 2018;Ribeiro et al., 2019Ribeiro et al., , 2020Schmitt et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020a, to name a few), our approaches based on PLMs consistently outperform these models, even though PLMs -as sequence models -do not exhibit any Linearized representation: <H> Apollo 12 <R> backup pilot <T> Alfred Worden <H> Alan Bean <R> was a crew member of <T> Apollo 12 <H> Apollo 12 <R> operator <T> NASA <H> Alan Bean <R> occupation <T> Test pilot <H> Apollo 12 <R> commander <T> David Scott <H> Alan Bean <R> was selected by NASA <T> 1963 <H> Alan Bean <R> alma Mater <T> UT Austin B.S. 1955  Text: Alan Bean graduated from UT Austin in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science degree.

<p>graph-specific structural bias. 2 Simply representing the graph as a linear traversal (see Figure 1) leads to remarkable generation performance in the presence of a strong language model. In our analysis we investigate to what extent fine-tuned PLMs make use of the graph structure represented in the graph linearization. We notably observe that PLMs achieve high performance on two popular KG-totext benchmarks even when the KG is reduced to a mere bag of node and edge labels.</p>
<p>Our contributions are the following:</p>
<p>• We investigate and compare two PLMs, BART and T5, for graph-to-text generation, exploring language model adaptation (LMA) and supervised task adaptation (STA) pretraining, employing additional task-specific data. • Our approaches consistently outperform the state of the art by significant margins, ranging from 2.6 to 12.0 BLEU points, on three established graph-to-text benchmarks from different domains, exceeding specialized graph architectures (e.g., Graph Neural Networks, GNNs, Kipf and Welling, 2017). • In a crowdsourcing experiment, we demonstrate that our methods generate texts with significantly better fluency than existing works and the human references. • We discover that PLMs perform well even when trained on a shuffled linearized graph representation without any information about connectivity (bag of node and edge labels), which is surprising since prior studies showed that explicitly encoding the graph structure improves models trained from scratch (e.g.,</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Graph-to-text Learning. Various neural models have been proposed to generate sentences from graphs from different domains. Konstas et al. (2017) propose the first neural approach for AMRto-text generation that uses a linearized input graph. Prior approaches for KG-to-text generation train text-to-text neural models using sequences of KG triples as input (Trisedya et al., 2018;Moryossef et al., 2019;Castro Ferreira et al., 2019;Ribeiro et al., 2021a). Recent approaches (Marcheggiani and Perez Beltrachini, 2018;Song et al., 2018;Beck et al., 2018;Damonte and Cohen, 2019;Ribeiro et al., 2019;Zhao et al., 2020a;Schmitt et al., 2021;Ribeiro et al., 2021b) propose architectures based on GNNs to directly encode the graph structure, whereas other efforts (Ribeiro et al., 2020;Schmitt et al., 2020;Yao et al., 2020; inject the graph structure information into Transformer-based architectures. The success of those approaches suggests that imposing a strong relational inductive bias into the graph-to-text model can assist the generation.</p>
<p>Pretrained Language Models. Pretrained</p>
<p>Transformer-based models, such as BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019b), or RoBERTa , have established a qualitatively new level of baseline performance for many widely used natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks.</p>
<p>Generative pretrained Transformer-based methods, such as GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), BART T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), are employed in many natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Mager et al. (2020) were the first to employ GPT-2, a decoder-only PLM, for AMR-to-text generation and use cycle consistency to improve the adequacy. In contrast, we are the first to investigate BART and T5 models, which have both a Transformer-based encoder and decoder, in AMRto-text generation. Recently, Harkous et al. (2020) and Kale (2020) demonstrate state-of-the-art results in different data-to-text datasets, employing GPT-2 and T5 models respectively. Radev et al. (2020) propose DART, a new data-to-text dataset, and train a BART model gradually augmenting the WebNLG training data with DART data.</p>
<p>Hoyle et al. (2021) explore scaffolding objectives in PLMs and show gains in low-resource graph-to-text settings. Different from the above works, we focus on a general transfer learning strategies for graph-to-text generation, investigating task-adaptive pretraining approaches, employing additional collected task-specific data for different PLMs (BART and T5) and benchmarks. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis aimed at explaining the good performance of PLMs on KGto-text tasks.</p>
<p>Recently, Gururangan et al. (2020) explored taskadaptive pretraining strategies for text classification. While our LMA (see §3) is related to their DAPT as both use a self-supervised objective on a domainspecific corpus, they notably differ in that DAPT operates on the model input while LMA models the output. We are the first to show the benefits of additional task-specific pretraining in PLMs for graph-to-text tasks.</p>
<p>3 PLMs for Graph-to-Text Generation</p>
<p>Models in this Study</p>
<p>We investigate BART  and T5 (Raffel et al., 2019), two PLMs based on the Transformer encoder-decoder architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), for graph-to-text generation. They mainly differ in how they are pretrained and the input corpora used for pretraining. We experiment with different T5 (small -60M parameters, base -220M, and large -770M) and BART (base -140M and large -400M) capacity models.</p>
<p>We fine-tune both PLMs for a few epochs on the supervised downstream graph-to-text datasets. For T5, in the supervised setup, we add a prefix "translate from Graph to Text:" before the graph input. We add this prefix to imitate the T5 setup, when translating between different languages.</p>
<p>Task-specific Adaptation</p>
<p>Inspired by previous work (Konstas et al., 2017;Gururangan et al., 2020), we investigate whether leveraging additional task-specific data can improve the PLMs' performance on graph-to-text generation. Task-specific data refers to a pretraining corpus that is more task-relevant and usually smaller than the text corpora used for taskindependent pretraining. In order to leverage the task-specific data, we add an intermediate adaptive pretraining step between the original pretraining and fine-tuning phases for graph-to-text generation.</p>
<p>More precisely, we first continue pretraining BART and T5 using language model adaptation (LMA) or supervised task adaptation (STA) training. In the supervised approach, we use pairs of graphs and corresponding texts collected from the same or similar domain as the target task. In the LMA approach, we follow BART and T5 pretraining strategies for language modeling, using the reference texts that describe the graphs. Note that we do not use the graphs in the LMA pretraining, but only the target text of our task-specific data collections. The goal is to adapt the decoder to the domain of the final task (Gururangan et al., 2020). In particular, we randomly mask text spans, replacing 15% of the tokens. 3 Before evaluation, we finally fine-tune the models using the original training set as usual.</p>
<p>Datasets</p>
<p>We evaluate the text-to-text PLMs on three graph-to-text benchmarks: AMR (LDC2017T10), WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017), and AGENDA (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019). We chose those datasets because they comprise different domains and are widely used in prior work. Table 10 in Appendix shows statistics for each dataset.</p>
<p>AMR. Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism that represents the meaning of a sentence as a rooted directed graph expressing "who is doing what to whom" (Banarescu et al., 2013). In an AMR graph, nodes represent concepts and edges represent semantic relations. An instance in LDC2017T10 consists of a sentence annotated with its corresponding AMR graph. Following Mager et al. (2020), we linearize the AMR graphs using the PENMAN notation (see Figure 1a). 4 WebNLG. Each instance of WebNLG contains a KG from DBPedia (Auer et al., 2007) and a target text with one or multiple sentences that describe the graph. The test set is divided into two partitions: seen, which contains only DBPedia categories present in the training set, and unseen, which covers categories never seen during training. Their union is called all. Following previous work (Harkous et al., 2020), we prepend H , R , and T tokens before the head entity, the relation and tail entity of a triple (see Figure 1b).</p>
<p>AGENDA. In this dataset, KGs are paired with scientific abstracts extracted from proceedings of AI conferences. Each sample contains the paper title, a KG, and the corresponding abstract. The KG contains entities corresponding to scientific terms and the edges represent relations between these entities. This dataset has loose alignments between the graph and the corresponding text as the graphs were automatically generated. The input for the models is a text containing the title, a sequence of all KG entities, and the triples. The target text is the paper abstract. We add special tokens into the triples in the same way as for WebNLG.</p>
<p>Additional Task-specific Data</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the proposed task-adaptive pretraining strategies for graph-to-text generation, we collect task-specific data for two graph domains: meaning representations (like AMR) and scientific data (like AGENDA). We did not attempt collecting additional data like WebNLG because the texts in this benchmark do not stem from a corpus but were specifically written by annotators.</p>
<p>AMR Silver Data. In order to generate additional data for AMR, we sample two sentence collections of size 200K and 2M from the Gigaword 5 corpus and use a state-of-the-art AMR parser (Cai and Lam, 2020a) to parse them into AMR graphs. 6 For supervised pretraining, we condition a model on the AMR silver graphs to generate the corresponding sentences before fine-tuning it on gold AMR graphs. For self-supervised pretraining, we only use the sentences. 7 Semantic Scholar AI Data. We collect titles and abstracts of around 190K scientific papers from the Semantic Scholar (Ammar et al., 2018) taken from the proceedings of 36 top Computer Science/AI conferences. We construct KGs from the paper abstracts employing DyGIE++ (Wadden et al., 2019), an information extraction system for scientific texts. Note that the AGENDA dataset was constructed using the older SciIE system (Luan et al., 2018), which also extracts KGs from AI scientific papers. A second difference is that in our new dataset, the domain is broader as we collected data from 36 conferences compared to 12 from AGENDA. Furthermore, to prevent data leakage, all AGENDA samples used for performance evaluation are removed from our dataset. We will call the new dataset KGAIA (KGs from AI Abstracts). 8 Table 11 in Appendix shows relevant dataset statistics.</p>
<p>Model</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>We modify the BART and T5 implementations released by Hugging Face (Wolf et al., 2019) in order to adapt them to graph-to-text generation. For the KG datasets, we add the H , R , and T tokens to the models' vocabulary. We add all edge labels seen in the training set to the vocabulary of the  with an initial learning rate of 3 · 10 −5 . We employ a linearly decreasing learning rate schedule without warm-up. The batch and beam search sizes are chosen from {2,4,8} and {1,3,5}, respectively, based on the respective development set. Dev BLEU is used for model selection.</p>
<p>Following previous works, we evaluate the results with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), ME-TEOR (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014), and chrF++ (Popović, 2015) metrics. We also use Mover-Score (Zhao et al., 2019), BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020), and BLEURT (Sellam et al., 2020) metrics, as they employ contextual and semantic knowledge and thus depend less on the surface symbols. Additionally, we perform a human evaluation (cf. §5.4) quantifying the fluency, semantic adequacy and meaning similarity of the generated texts. Table 1 shows our results for the setting without additional pretraining, with additional self-supervised task-adaptive pretraining solely using the collected Gigaword sentences (LMA), and with additional supervised task adaptation (STA), before fine-tuning. We also report several recent results on the AMR test set. Mager et al. (2020) and Harkous et al.</p>
<p>Results on AMR-to-Text</p>
<p>(2020) employ GPT-2 in their approaches. Note that GPT-2 only consists of a Transformer-based decoder.</p>
<p>Only considering approaches without task adaptation, BART large already achieves a considerable improvement of 5.77 BLEU and 3.98 METEOR scores over the previous state of the art. With a BLEU score of 45.80, T5 large performs best. The other metrics follow similar trends. See Table 13 in Appendix for evaluation with more metrics. The strong performance of both BART and T5 in the AMR dataset suggests that PLMs can infer the AMR structure by a simple linear sequence of the graph, in contrast to GNN-based models that explicitly consider the graph structure using messagepassing between adjacent nodes (Beck et al., 2018).</p>
<p>Task-specific Adaptation. LMA already brings some gains with T5 benefitting more than BART in most metrics. It still helps less than STA even though we only have automatically generated annotations. This suggests that the performance increases with STA do not only come from additional exposure to task-specific target texts and that the models learn how to handle graphs and the graphtext correspondence even with automatically generated AMRs. After STA, T5 achieves 49.72 BLEU points, the new state of the art for AMR-to-text generation. Interestingly, gains from STA with 2M over 200K are larger in BART than in T5, suggesting that large amounts of silver data may not be required for a good performance with T5.</p>
<p>In general, models pretrained on the STA setup converge faster than without task-specific adaptation. For example, T5 large without additional pretraining converges after 5 epochs of fine-tuning whereas T5 large with STA already converges after 2 epochs.  hand, fully end-to-end models (Ribeiro et al., 2020;Schmitt et al., 2020) have strong performance on the seen dataset and usually perform poorly in unseen data. Models that explicitly encode the graph structure (Ribeiro et al., 2020;Zhao et al., 2020a) achieve the best performance among approaches that do not employ PLMs. Note that T5 is also used in Kale (2020). Differences in our T5 setup include a modified model vocabulary, the use of beam search, the learning rate schedule and the prefix before the input graph. Our T5 approach achieves 59.70, 65.05 and 54.69 BLEU points on all, seen and unseen sets, the new state of the art. We conjecture that the performance gap between seen and unseen sets stems from the advantage obtained by a model seeing examples of relation-text pairs during fine-tuning. For example, the relation party (political party) was never seen during training and the model is required to generate a text that verbalizes the tuple: Abdul Taib Mahmud, party, Parti Bumiputera Sarawak . Interestingly, BART performs much worse than T5 on this benchmark, especially in the unseen partition with 9.7 BLEU points lower compared to T5.</p>
<p>Results on WebNLG</p>
<p>For lack of a suitable data source (cf. §4), we did not explore our LMA or STA approaches for WebNLG. However, we additionally discuss crossdomain STA in Appendix B.  dataset. We believe that their capacity to generate fluent text helps when generating paper abstracts, even though they were not pretrained in the scientific domain. BART large shows an impressive performance with a BLEU score of 23.65, which is 5.6 points higher than the previous state of the art.</p>
<p>Results on AGENDA</p>
<p>Task-specific Adaptation. On AGENDA, BART benefits more from our task-adaptive pretraining, achieving the new state of the art of 25.66 BLEU points, a further gain of 2 BLEU points compared to its performance without task adaptation. The improvements from task-adaptive pretraining are not as large as for AMR. We hypothesize that this is due to the fact that the graphs do not completely cover the target text (Koncel-Kedziorski et al., 2019), making this dataset more challenging. See Table 12 in Appendix for more automatic metrics.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation</p>
<p>To further assess the quality of the generated text, we conduct a human evaluation on AMR and WebNLG via crowd sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Arrabbiata sauce can be found in Italy where Sergio Mattarella is the leader and the capital city is Rome. Italians are the people who live there and the language spoken is Italian.</p>

<p>Reference: Arrabbiata sauce is from Italy where the capital is Rome, Italian is the language spoken and Sergio Mattarella is a leader. close in meaning is the generated text to the reference sentence?) for AMR; (ii) Semantic Adequacy (i.e., does the text clearly express the data?) for WebNLG. We randomly select 100 generated texts of each model, which the annotators then rate on a 1-7 Likert scale. For each text, we collect scores from 3 annotators and average them. 10 Table 4 shows the results. Our approaches improve the fluency, meaning similarity, and semantic adequacy on both datasets compared to other stateof-the-art approaches with statistically significant margins (p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, the highest fluency improvement (+0.97) is on AMR, where our approach also has the largest BLEU improvement (+8.10) over Harkous et al. (2020). Finally, our models score higher than the references in fluency with statistically significant margins, highlighting their strong language generation abilities. 11</p>
<p>Limiting the Training Data</p>
<p>In Figure 3, we investigate the PLMs' performance, measured with BLEU score, while varying (from 1% to 100%) the amount of training data used for 10 Inter-annotator agreement for the three criteria ranged from 0.40 to 0.79, with an average Krippendorff's α of 0.56. 11 Examples of fluent generations can be found in the Tables 15 and 16 in Appendix.  fine-tuning. We find that, when fine-tuned with only 40% of the data, both BART and T5 already greatly improve the performance compared to using the entire training data in all three benchmarks. For example, BART fine-tuned on 40% of AMR training data achieves 91% of the BLEU score when fine-tuned on full data. Note that in a low-resource scenario in AMR and WebNLG, T5 considerably outperforms BART. In particular, with only 1% of training examples, the difference between T5 and BART is 7.51 and 5.64 BLEU points for AMR and WebNLG, respectively. This suggests that T5 is more data efficient when adapting to the new task, likewise our findings in AMR-STA (cf. §5.1).</p>
<p>Model AMR WebNLG AGENDA</p>
<p>Influence of the Graph Structure</p>
<p>We conduct further experiments to examine how much the PLMs consider the graph structure. To this end, we remove parentheses in AMRs and replace H , R , and T tokens with neutral separator tokens, denoted •, for KGs, such that the graph structure is only defined by the order of node and edge labels. If we shuffle such a sequence, the graph structure is thus completely obscured and the input effectively becomes a bag of node and edge labels. See Figure 2 for an example of both a correctly ordered and a shuffled triple sequence. Antwerp International Airport serves the city of Antwerp in Belgium where the German language is spoken and Charles Michel is the leader.</p>

<p>vs. shuffled ones (T5 shuf ) for both training and evaluation. We first observe that T5 order only has marginally lower performance (around 2-4%) with the neutral separators than with the H / R / T tags or parentheses. 12 We see that as evidence that the graph structure is similarly well captured by T5 order . Without the graph structure (T5 shuf ), AMR-to-text performance drops significantly. Possible explanations of this drop are: (i) the relative ordering of the AMR graph is known to correlate with the target sentence order (Konstas et al., 2017); (ii) in contrast to WebNLG that contains common knowledge, the AMR dataset contains very specific sentences with higher surprisal; 13 (iii) AMRs are much more complex graph structures than the KGs from WebNLG and AGENDA. 14 On the other hand, KG-to-text performance is not much lower, indicating that most of the PLMs' success in this task stems from their language modeling rather than their graph encoding capabilities. We hypothesize that a PLM can match the entities in a shuffled input with sentences mentioning these entities from the pretraining or fine-tuning phase. It has recently been argued that large PLMs can recall certain common knowledge facts from pretraining (Petroni et al., 2019;Bosselut et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Qualitative Analysis</p>
<p>The example in Figure 2 confirms our impression. T5 shuf produces a text with the same content as 12 See a more fine-grained comparison in Appendix C. 13 Perplexities estimated on the dev sets of AMR and WebNLG datasets, with GPT-2 fine-tuned on the corresponding training set, are 20.9 and 7.8, respectively. 14 In Appendix D, we present the graph properties of the datasets and discuss the differences. T5 order but does not need the correct triple structure to do so. Example (1) in Table 6 shows the output of both models with shuffled input. Interestingly, even T5 order produces a reasonable and truthful text. This suggests that previously seen facts serve as a strong guide during text generation, even for models that were fine-tuned with a clearly marked graph structure, suggesting that T5 order also relies more on language modeling than the graph structure. It does have more difficulties covering the whole input graph though. The fact that Antwerp is located in Belgium is missing from its output.</p>
<p>To further test our hypothesis that PLMs make use of previously seen facts during KG-to-text generation, we generate example true facts, corrupt them in a controlled setting, and feed them to both T5 order and T5 shuf to observe their output (examples (2)-(5) in Table 6). The model trained on correctly ordered input has learned a bit more to rely on the input graph structure. The false fact in example (3) with two triples is reliably transferred to the text by T5 order but not by T5 shuf , which silently corrects it. Also note that, in example (5), both models refuse to generate an incorrect fact. More examples can be found in Table 14 in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Our qualitative analysis illustrates that state-ofthe-art PLMs, despite their fluency capacities (cf. §5.4), bear the risk of parroting back training sentences while ignoring the input structure. This issue can limit the practical usage of those models as, in many cases, it is important for a generation model to stay true to its input (Wiseman et al., 2017;Falke et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We investigated two pretrained language models (PLMs) for graph-to-text generation and show that the pretraining strategies, language model adaptation (LMA) and supervised task adaptation (STA), can lead to notable improvements. Our approaches outperform the state of the art by a substantial margin on three graph-to-text benchmarks. Moreover, in a human evaluation our generated texts are perceived significantly more fluent than human references. Examining the influence of the graph structure on the text generation process, we find that PLMs may not always follow the graph structure and instead use memorized facts to guide the generation. A promising direction for future work is to explore ways of injecting a stronger graphstructural bias into PLMs, thus possibly leveraging their strong language modeling capabilities and keeping the output faithful to the input graph. </p>
<p>Appendices</p>
<p>In this supplementary material, we provide: (i) additional information about the data used in the experiments, and (ii) results that we could not fit into the main body of the paper.</p>
<p>A AMR Input Representation</p>
<p>We test three variants for the representation of the input AMR graph. Following previous work (Konstas et al., 2017;Mager et al., 2020) In this experiment we employ T5 small . Table 7 shows the results on the AMR development set. The PENMAN representation leads to best results. Therefore, this representation is used in the rest of the experiments.  </p>
<p>B Cross-domain Adaptation</p>
<p>For a given task, it is not always possible to collect closely related data -as we saw, e.g., for WebNLG. We therefore report STA in a cross-domain setting for the different KG-to-text benchmarks. Ta  C Input Graph Size Figure 4 visualizes T5 small 's performance with respect to the number of input graph triples in WebNLG dataset. We observe that T5 order and T5 shuf perform similarly for inputs with only one triple but that the gap between the models increases with larger graphs. While it is obviously more difficult to reconstruct a larger graph than a smaller one, this also suggests that the graph structure is more taken into account for graphs with more than 2 triples. For the unseen setting, the performance gap for these graphs is even larger, suggesting that the PLM can make more use of the graph structure when it has to.  </p>
<p>D Graph Statistics</p>
<p>In Table 9, we present the graph properties of the three datasets. All statistics are calculated using      The capital city is London, the currency is the Pound sterling and the leader is Elizabeth II. Boris Johnson is also a leader in the UK.</p>

<p>Model Examples</p>
<p>Reference in this paper, a new array signal processing technique by using particle swarm optimization is proposed to identify multipath channel parameters. the proposed array signal processing technique provides estimates to the channel parameters by finding a global minimum of an optimization problem. since the optimization problem is formulated in the cross-ambiguity function (caf) domain of the transmitted signal and the received array outputs, the proposed array signal processing technique is called as particle swarm optimization. the performance of the particle swarm optimization is compared with the space alternating generalized expectation maximization technique and with another recently proposed pso based technique for various snr values. simulation results indicate the superior performance of the pso based technique over mentioned techniques for all snr values.</p>
<p>T5 this paper, we propose an array signal processing technique based on particle swarm optimization to estimate the multipath channel parameters from the received and the transmitted signal in a cross-ambiguity domain. the proposed array signal processing technique is formulated as an optimization problem and particle swarm optimization is compared with the generalized expectation maximization technique. simulation results show that the proposed particle swarm optimization outperforms the pso based technique for a wide range of snr values. in addition, the proposed particle swarm optimization is computationally more efficient than the gem based technique for small snr values.</p>

Details of the preprocessing procedure of AMRs are provided in Appendix A. 5 https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T056 We filter out sentences that do not yield well-formed AMR graphs.7 Gigaword and AMR datasets share similar data sources.
We will release the collected additional task-specific data.
