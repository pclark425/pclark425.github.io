                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Evaluation of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to a variety of factors – the lack of benchmarks with sufficient linguistic diversity, contamination of popular benchmarks into LLM pre-training data and the lack of local, cultural nuances in translated benchmarks. In this work, we study human and LLM-based evaluation in a multilingual, multi-cultural setting. We evaluate 30 models across 10 Indic languages by conducting 90K human evaluations and 30K LLM-based evaluations and find that models such as GPT-4o and Llama-3 70B consistently perform best for most Indic languages. We build leaderboards for two evaluation settings - pairwise comparison and direct assessment and analyse the agreement between humans and LLMs. We find that humans and LLMs agree fairly well in the pairwise setting but the agreement drops for direct assessment evaluation especially for languages such as Bengali and Odia. We also check for various biases in human and LLM-based evaluation and find evidence of self-bias in the GPT-based evaluator. Our work presents a significant step towards scaling up multilingual evaluation of LLMs.</p>

(2) Position-bias checks (flipped duplicates) show both humans and LLMs are over 90% consistent, so the LLM is not strongly position-biased.

(2) Position-bias checks (flipped duplicates) show both humans and LLMs are over 90% consistent, so the LLM is not strongly position-biased.

<p>PARIKSHA: Large-Scale Investigation of Human-LLM Evaluator Agreement on Multilingual and Multi-Cultural Data
18 Oct 2024A270B7C142D402FC23F99CE08E34B420arXiv:2406.15053v2[cs.CL]Preprint, arXiv:2005.14165
Evaluation of multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to a variety of factors -the lack of benchmarks with sufficient linguistic diversity, contamination of popular benchmarks into LLM pre-training data and the lack of local, cultural nuances in translated benchmarks.In this work, we study human and LLM-based evaluation in a multilingual, multi-cultural setting.We evaluate 30 models across 10 Indic languages by conducting 90K human evaluations and 30K LLMbased evaluations and find that models such as GPT-4o and Llama-3 70B consistently perform best for most Indic languages.We build leaderboards for two evaluation settings -pairwise comparison and direct assessment and analyse the agreement between humans and LLMs.We find that humans and LLMs agree fairly well in the pairwise setting but the agreement drops for direct assessment evaluation especially for languages such as Bengali and Odia.We also check for various biases in human and LLMbased evaluation and find evidence of self-bias in the GPT-based evaluator.Our work presents a significant step towards scaling up multilingual evaluation of LLMs. 1 * Work done during an internship at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have made tremendous progress recently by excelling at several tasks (OpenAI et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2023;Anil and Team, 2024;Reid and Team, 2024, interalia).However, it is not always clear what capabilities these models possess, leading to an increased interest in evaluation.Benchmarking is the defacto standard for evaluating LLMs, with several popular benchmarks used to validate the quality of models when they are released.</p>
<p>However, standard benchmarking suffers from the following issues: many popular benchmarks are (2) We generate responses for the curated prompts from the selected models.(3) We evaluate generated responses in two settings (direct assessment and pairwise comparison) by both humans and an LLM.(4) We construct leaderboards using scores obtained and analyze the agreement between human and LLM evaluators.available on the web and have already been consumed in the training data of LLMs, rendering them unsuitable for fair evaluation.This phenomenon is known as test dataset contamination, and recent works (Ravaut et al., 2024;Golchin and Surdeanu, 2024;Dong et al., 2024;Oren et al., 2024;Deng et al., 2024) have suggested that contamination may occur not only during pre-training, but also during fine-tuning and evaluation (Balloccu et al., 2024).This calls for dynamic benchmarking with the help of humans (Chiang et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2023).Although, human evaluation is considered the gold standard, it can be expensive and time consuming.Due to this, the use of LLM-evaluators, where an LLM itself is used to evaluate the output of another LLM (sometimes the same LLM) has become very popular.</p>
<p>Most studies on LLM training and evaluation focus on English.Recent works have shown that LLMs perform worse on non-English languages, particularly those written in scripts other than the Latin script, and under-resourced languages (Ahuja et al., 2023(Ahuja et al., , 2024;;Asai et al., 2024).Studies on cultural values in LLMs have also shown that frontier models such as GPT-4 align more closely to Western, Rich, and Industrialized norms (Rao et al., 2023).This has led to a proliferation of models being built for specific languages, cultures and regions such as Indic, Arabic, African, Chinese, European, and Indonesian (Gala et al., 2024;Sengupta et al., 2023;Zeng et al., 2023;Bai et al., 2023;Cahyawijaya et al., 2024;Cohere, 2024;Üstün et al., 2024, interalia).Multilingual evaluation is challenging due to the small number of multilingual benchmarks available, the lack of language diversity in them (Ahuja et al., 2022) and the evidence of possible contamination of many of these benchmarks (Ahuja et al., 2024).Additionally, many multilingual benchmarks are translations of benchmarks originally created in English, leading to loss of linguistic and cultural context.</p>
<p>In this work, we perform 90K human evaluations -the largest scale multilingual human evaluation of LLMs as per our knowledge.We perform evaluation on a new set of general and culturally-nuanced prompts created independently by native speakers for each language.We use a setting similar to the LMSys ChatbotArena (Chiang et al., 2024) and ask human evaluators employed by KARYA 2 , an ethical data company, to perform two evaluation tasks: comparative evaluations between models, and individual evaluations or direct assessments of 30 models.KARYA employs workers from all states of India, with a focus on rural and marginalized communities, making our study the first effort as per our knowledge that includes these communities in the evaluation process.In addition to performing human evaluations, we build upon prior work on LLMs as multilingual evaluators (Hada et al., 2024b,a) to perform the same evaluations using LLMs as judges.We also use LLMs to perform a preliminary safety evaluation, for which we do not engage KARYA workers due to ethical concerns.</p>
<p>Our contributions are as follows: (1) We perform 90K human evaluations across 10 Indic languages, comparing 30 Indic and multilingual models using pairwise and direct assessment on a culturallynuanced dataset.(2) We perform the same evaluations using an LLM-based evaluator to analyze the agreement between human and LLM evaluation, making this work the most comprehensive analysis of LLM-based evaluators in the multilingual setting.(3) We create leaderboards based on human and LLM-based evaluators and analyze trends and biases across languages and models.</p>
<p>2 https://karya.in 2 Related Work Multilingual Evaluation Benchmarks Ahuja et al. (2023Ahuja et al. ( , 2024)); Asai et al. (2024) conduct comprehensive multilingual evaluations of open-source and proprietary models on a large scale across various available multilingual benchmarks.Liu et al. (2024) release a Multilingual Generative test set that can assess the capability of LLMs in five different languages.Other popular multilingual NLU benchmarks include XGLUE (Liang et al., 2020), XTREME (Hu et al., 2020), XTREME-R (Ruder et al., 2021).Kakwani et al. (2020) release the first Indic NLU benchmark, In-dicGLUE, for 11 languages.Doddapaneni et al. (2023) build on top of the former and release In-dicXTREME, spanning all 22 languages.On the NLG side, Kumar et al. (2022) offer IndicNL-Gsuite, covering 5 tasks across 11 languages.Gala et al. (2023) release a machine translation benchmark, IN22, for both conversational and general translation evaluation across all 22 languages.Recently, Singh et al. (2024a) put forth IndicGen-Bench, a collection of diverse generation tasks like cross-lingual summarization, machine translation, and cross-lingual question answering.</p>
<p>Indic Evaluation Benchmarks</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Several previous studies have used humans to evaluate LLMs, build leaderboards, or as strong upper-bound baselines (Chiang et al., 2024;Wu and Aji, 2023;Srivastava and Team, 2023;Hada et al., 2024b,a;Chiang and Lee, 2023).Others have employed humans to create gold-standard culturally-nuanced evaluation prompts or to evaluate the corresponding outputs of various LLMs (Singh et al., 2024b;Üstün et al., 2024;Cahyawijaya et al., 2024;Feng et al., 2024) LLM-based Automatic Evaluations LLMs have been shown to be useful as evaluators due to their instruction following abilities, but studies have also shown that they can be biased and may not always agree with human judgments.In prior work (Hada et al. (2024b,a)), we conducted a comprehensive survey of LLMs as an evaluators in the multilingual setting, and also released METAL, a benchmark for LLM-based Summarization evaluation across 10 languages.Other recent works such as Liu et al. (2024); Shen et al. (2023); Kocmi and Federmann (2023) also discuss and use LLMs for evaluations at scale, and Zheng et al. (2023) employ GPT-4 as an evaluator alongside humans to build the MTBench and ChatbotArena leaderboard.Ning et al. (2024) propose an LLM-based peer-review process to automatically evaluate the outputs of an LLM, by other models in the setup.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>Our evaluation setup is summarized in Figure 1.</p>
<p>Prompt Curation</p>
<p>India is a diverse country where the language and cultural nuances change every few kilometers.This diversity necessitates involving native speakers to create and evaluate these prompts.We include the following 10 Indian languages in our evaluation: Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Marathi, Odia, Bengali, Gujarati, and Punjabi.Our prompts comprise of 20 questions per language -5 on health, 5 on finance, and 10 culturallynuanced prompts -that were created by native speakers in the research team and KARYA (Table 1).Although we currently evaluate only on a small set of prompts, we plan to scale the number of prompts by allowing evaluators to create their own prompts similar to ChatbotArena (Yang et al., 2023).</p>
<p>The prompts were created independently for each language following the same guidelines and are not translations.While the finance and health prompts are similar across languages, cultural prompts may differ slightly due to unique nuances of each language.This differentiation is crucial to capture the distinct aspect of each language and evaluate Indic LLMs in context.</p>
<p>Model Selection</p>
<p>We evaluate popular Indic language models in addition to the leading proprietary LLMs.Most of the Indic LLMs are fine-tuned versions of the opensource Llama-2 7B base model (Touvron et al., 2023), Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023) or Gemma 7B (Mesnard and Team, 2024) models, hence we added the instruct versions of these models to our evaluation to determine the gain obtained by finetuning these models with Indic data.We have also included the latest Llama-3 8B and Llama-3 70B (AI@Meta, 2024) models to evaluate their effectiveness for multilingual fine-tuning.We list all models under consideration in Appendix B in Table 5 and Table 6.</p>
<p>We are aware that it is not entirely fair to compare open-source models with API-based systems that may have several other components in place, such as language detectors, more sophisticated safety guardrails etc., however, we treat all models as the same for this study and urge the reader to keep this in mind while interpreting the results.The details for generating model query-response pairs can be found in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>We evaluate the models on open-ended Question Answering on the aforementioned prompts using two different strategies and by two types of evaluators.First, we do a pairwise comparison (battle) between model responses for the same prompt and calculate Elo Ratings (Elo, 1978;Boubdir et al., 2023).Second, we also calculate various direct assessment metrics for each model prompt-response data point.A total of 21690 datapoints (battles) are evaluated by LLMs evaluator for pairwise evaluation whereas 2880 model query-response pairs are evaluated for 3 metrics (hallucinations, task quality and linguistic acceptability) which results to 8640 datapoints.Hence, a total of 21690 + 8640 = 30330 datapoints.We evaluate 12-15 models for each language except Hindi for which we evaluate 20 models.The detailed statistics of the evaluation datapoints can be seen in Table 2.</p>
<p>Each datapoint is evaluated by three human annotators and the majority vote is taken, yielding an overall of 3 × 30330 = 90K annotations.If all three votes are different, we treat it as a tie in case of a battle and take average score in case of direct assessment metrics.In addition to human evaluation, we also use an LLM (GPT-4-32K) for evaluating the battles as well as providing scores using the direct assessment metrics.</p>
<p>Pairwise comparison</p>
<p>We use the Elo Rating systems, which is widely used in chess to measure the relative skills of players.This helps us to convert human preferences into scores, which can predict the win rates between different models.This system is also employed in the LMSys Chatbot Arena setup3 (Chiang et al., 2024).Additionally, we employ the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) Elo rating system to determine rankings, as it remains unaffected by the sequence of comparisons.More information about Elo is available in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Prompt Type Examples</p>
<p>Finance (5)</p>
<p>What is the difference between a debit card and a credit card?</p>
<p>Health (5) How can I improve my posture to prevent back and neck pain?</p>
<p>Cultural (10) (Kannada) Although in the neighboring states movie actors rise to prominence in politics, why is it not seen in Karnataka?(Telugu) In Telugu tradition, why do parents of girls pay for the first birth of a child?In the models column, first number within parenthesis is the number of Indic-only models and the second value is the number of multilingual models under evaluation.Total evaluations: 21690 + 8640 = 30330 for LLM, and 3 × 30330 = 90990 for humans, as each data point was annotated by 3 humans.</p>
<p>Battle Generation We generate N 2 × (number of prompts) pairwise comparisons for each language.To check for annotator and LLM consistency, we added duplicate pairings with responses flipped for 10% of the original pairings.The battles were designed in such a way that each model contributed to Response A and Response B equally.The detailed statistics of datapoints can be seen in Table 2.For pairwise comparisons, we evaluate 21690 datapoints using three human annotators and the LLM-evaluator.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>The annotators perform the evaluation task on a smartphone.The annotators are provided with the query, the two model responses (model names are hidden), and set of three options -A (response 1 is better), B (response 2 is better), and C (tie, equally good/bad).During evaluation, we ask the annotators to provide a spoken justification for the chosen response that is captured as audio by the app.The annotation guidelines and Hindi app screenshots are available in Appendix E.1.</p>
<p>LLM Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>We also evaluate battles using GPT-4-32K as an LLM evaluator.The setting is similar to the one provided to humans with the same rubric and a similar set of instructions provided as a prompt to the LLM.The detailed prompt is provided in Figure 10.</p>
<p>Direct Assessment</p>
<p>In addition to a pairwise comparison, humans as well as the LLM also rate a query-response pair on three metrics -Linguistic Acceptability (LA), Task Quality (TQ), and Hallucination (H) metrics (Hada et al., 2024b,a).We evaluate a total of 8640 datapoints across the 3 metrics and the 10 languages, detailed statistics can be seen in Table 2.We rank each model based on the average scores obtained across all query-response pairs with 5 being the maximum (2LA + 2TQ + 1H) and 0 being the lowest possible score.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>The annotators are shown the query-response pair and a checkbox asking if the output is gibberish.If selected the response is automatically given the lowest score, otherwise, the annotators are asked to label the three metrics.The annotation guidelines and Hindi app screenshots are available in Appendix E.2.</p>
<p>LLM Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>For LLM-based evaluation, we make a single call for each metric using the prompt in Fig 11 resulting in a total of 3 calls per model per query.The detailed description for each metric rubric can be found in Figures 12, 13 and 14.Our metric prompts were sourced from Chiang et al. (2024); Hada et al. (2024b,a) and tailored to our use-case.</p>
<p>Safety Evaluation</p>
<p>We also conduct a preliminary safety evaluation to estimate the efficacy of guardrails in different LLMs.For this, we use the Hindi prompts from RTP-LX4 (de Wynter et al., 2024) which is specifically designed to elicit toxic responses and ask the models under consideration to generate completions.These completions are then evaluated using an LLM evaluator with the same prompt used for individual evaluations (Figure 11).We do not employ humans for the safety evaluation due to ethical concerns.The detailed rubric for Safety is defined in Fig 15 .We also perform an exact match with the Hindi block words from the FLORES Toxicity-2005 (Costa-jussà et al., 2022) to check for toxic words in the output.</p>
<p>Inter-Annotator Agreement</p>
<p>To check for the quality of human annotation, we calculate inter-annotator agreement between the three human annotators using two metrics -Percentage Agreement (PA) and Fleiss Kappa (κ).These metrics are also used to judge the alignment between humans and LLMs for the evaluation tasks, following the same setup as our prior work (Hada et al., 2024b,a).We also calculate the correlation between rankings of the leaderboards obtained from human and LLM evaluations using Kendall's Tau (τ ).</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Leaderboard Analysis</p>
<p>Leaderboard Setup Figure 2 depicts a visualization of the leaderboard based on the MLE Elo rating method discussed in Section 3.3.1.For the Direct Assessment scores, we report the average score across all query-response pairs for a model in Figure 3.We include both human and LLMevaluator leaderboards in these visualizations.For the safety evaluation, the scores depict the fraction of prompts for which models gave problematic content.A detailed description of how each leaderboard is constructed along with the scores is available in Appendix F.</p>
<p>Pairwise Comparison (Elo) Leaderboard</p>
<p>The GPT-4o model consistently perform best across many languages both for human and LLMevaluation and is followed by Llama-3 70B, whereas Llama-3 8B ranks somewhere in the middle.Open-source models that are not specifically fine-tuned on Indic language data like Llama-2 7B, Mistral 7B and Gemma 7B consistently score at the bottom for all languages.Indic LLMs, that are usually built on top of open-source models by fine-tuning on Indic language data comprise the middle portion of the rankings with SamwaadLLM having the best performance.An interesting next step would be to evaluate fine-tuned versions of Llama-3 70B, as and when they are available.</p>
<p>Proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini-Pro 1.06 rank in the upper middle portion of the human evaluations leaderboard, and top most of the LLMevaluator leaderboards, showing evidence of selfbias by GPT-4 (Panickssery et al., 2024;Xu et al., 2024).GPT-3.5-Turbo,however, ranks across the lower-middle half and performs worse than the finetuned Indic LLMs.The LLM evaluator also tends to favour Gemma 7B more than humans, suggesting that there may be some artifacts in some models that the LLM-evaluator picks up on. 7We also notice that Elo ratings by humans tend to be lower than the ones given by LLM overall.This can be attributed to the fact that LLMs pick fewer ties and tend to be more decisive in comparison to humans (Sharma et al., 2024;Hosking et al., 2024;Wu and Aji, 2023).</p>
<p>Direct Assessment Leaderboard</p>
<p>The Direct Assessment leaderboard in Figure 3 shows similar trends as the Elo leaderboard.The Llama-2 7B, Mistral 7B and Gemma 7B models are at the bottom, finetuned Indic models are in the middle while GPT-4o and Llama-3 70B are at the top.The LLM evaluator rates GPT-4 very highly in comparison to humans who rate it somewhere in the middle.Moreover, the LLM evaluator typically gives higher scores to models compared to humans, as observed in Hada et al. (2024b,a).We discuss this in more detail in Section 4.4.</p>
<p>RTP-LX Safety Analysis</p>
<p>We present the preliminary safety analysis of all the Hindi LLMs, for which we evaluate the completions using GPT-4-32K.Following Hada et al. (2024a), we use a temperature of 1.0 to elicit even unexpected generations which might be problematic.API based LLMs, such as GPT and Gemini-Pro usually have guardrails and content moderation services before the actual model, and hence, we find that our prompts are blocked.Figure 4 shows the fraction of toxic/problematic completions for each model, as evaluated by GPT-4 and a heuristic  word match from the Toxicity-200 block list.We find that the heuristic word match fails to identify several cases of toxic completion as the the word list is limited and contains mostly stem forms of the toxic word, and other forms of the word are bypassed.GPT-3.5-Turboproduces the least toxic completions (∼ 10%), followed by GPT-4o and GPT-4.We also note that the Gemma model and its fine tuned variants (Aryabhatta variants and Navarasa) consistently perform the worst.However, since these evaluations are automated, they may contain potential biases.We leave further study with human evaluations as part of future work.</p>
<p>Agreement between LLM and Humans</p>
<p>Next, we analyze the agreement between humans and LLM evaluator across the two types of evaluations.We compute the Percentage Agreement (PA) and Fleiss Kappa (κ) score which are calculated at a per-datapoint level as well as the general agreement between the leaderboards using Kendall's Tau (τ ).The PA score is reported in Appendix G.  Pairwise Battles On average humans have a moderate κ score8 of 0.54 whereas the human- average and LLM have a κ score of 0.49.An ablation on the prompt-type in Table 3 reveals that LLM evaluator agrees comparatively less on the culturally-nuanced prompt.A language-wise breakdown of the κ scores can be seen in Figure 5.For pairwise evaluation, humans tend to have higher agreements among themselves than with the LLM across all languages except for Hindi and Kannada.

The LLM evaluator has very low agreement with humans on Marathi, Bengali and Punjabi.Direct Assessment In this case, humans tend to have a slightly lower but similar agreement to the pairwise scores.However, the agreement between humans and LLMs significantly drops and is the lowest again for the culturally-nuanced set of prompts.Figure 5 shows that for Direct Assessment, humans have similar agreement across all languages but the human-LLM agreement is significantly lower particularly for Bengali and Odia.This indicates that Direct Assessment may be a harder evaluation task for LLMs.</p>
<p>Leaderboard Agreement</p>
<p>We check the agreement between the leaderboards to get a sense of agreement on higher level trends.We report the Kendall Tau (τ ) scores between the rankings of models in both Pairwise (Elo) and Direct Assessment (DA) leaderboards in Table 4. On average we see a high τ score9 of 0.76 for the Elo leaderboards which signifies that the human and LLM-evaluator agree on the general trends.From Figure 2 also we can see that although the absolute rankings are not same, we can still find similar sub-group of models.We see this agreement go down for the DA leaderboard which has an average agreement of 0.65.We also report a detailed language-wise breakdown and find that for Elo leaderboards, Gujarati has the highest correlation while Bengali is the lowest.For the DA leaderboards, the scores drop and it is again the lowest for Bengali.This reinforces our hypothesis that the LLM evaluator is worse at the DA task.</p>
<p>Language</p>
<p>Bias Analysis</p>
<p>Position Bias</p>
<p>To check for position bias, we randomly duplicate 10% of the pairwise comparisons with their options flipped.We calculate consistency as the fraction of duplicate-pairs for which the verdict remains unchanged.We can clearly see in Figure 6 that both humans and LLM evaluator are over 90% consistent on average and, therefore, have very low position bias or bias towards an option name as opposed to the findings of Wu and Aji (2023); Wang et al. (2023).</p>
<p>Option Distribution</p>
<p>Pairwise Battles In Figure 7, we observe that there is no particular bias towards Option A or Option B by both evaluators in pairwise evaluation.However, we can clearly see that the LLMevaluator tends to be more decisive and chooses fewer ties compared to humans which is along the lines of Wu and Aji (2023).On manually checking a few ties, we find that humans tend to have a higher threshold to consider a response good and also are able to detect hallucinations.The LLM evaluator on the other hand tends to pick one response even if both responses are gibberish or contain hallucinations.It is more prone to get misguided by a hallucination presented confidently.Building on this observation, we find that out of all the cases when both responses are hallucinated (as per human annotations), LLMs still pick a response in 87% cases compared to humans who only did so in 53% battles.Direct Assessment In Figure 8, we observe that LLMs fail to detect the hallucinations as well as tend to give higher scores for LA and TQ.This shows the overly optimistic nature of LLMs.On closely looking at few examples we find that LLMevaluator is worse at detecting grammatical mis-takes in Indic languages.Humans are also better at differentiating between the LA and TQ metrics.</p>
<p>Verbosity Bias</p>
<p>We also analyse if there is any bias by humans or LLM evaluator to pick a longer response as the better one.From Figure 9, we observe that both humans and LLMs exhibit a slight bias towards a longer response which increases with the size difference between the responses.For LLMs, the bias remains relatively stable when the difference is 40-100 words, hovering around 0.6.Additionally, we observe that humans are slightly more biased than LLMs.We also note that the bias decreases when the difference becomes too large (over 100 words).We limit our responses to 300 words and hypothesize that such large responses might contain gibberish since LLMs are not very adept in multilingual settings.Hence, we find evidences of bias towards the length of responses by both the evaluators (Wu and Aji, 2023).</p>
<p>Self-Bias</p>
<p>Lastly, we check for self-bias by the GPT evaluator towards its own outputs across both types of evaluation.We calculate the average rank of GPT-4 in the Elo leaderboard given by both the evaluators as well as the rank of all other models which were evaluated for atleast 8-10 languages.We find that of the 11 selected models, the average rank of GPT-4 increases by the highest amount (1.4 places) for evaluations performed by the GPT evaluator (Appendix H).The rationale behind using the Elo leaderboard is that simply checking the win-rate would not account for biases due to GPT evaluator giving lesser ties than humans.This indicates selfbias in GPT evaluator similar to Panickssery et al. (2024).</p>
<p>Human Feedback</p>
<p>This section summarizes the feedback from three annotators per language on their experiences with pairwise comparison and direct assessment tasks.</p>
<p>Q1. Were the annotators able to understand the pairwise evaluation task and what problems did they face?Majority of the annotators were able to understand the guidelines clearly and found the task simple.They also noted that linguistic acceptability played a big role in determining the easiness of the task, languages like Odia and Tamil had many grammatical errors which made it difficult to go through responses.</p>
<p>Q2.</p>
<p>Were the annotators able to understand the metrics in direct assessment?The annotators found this task moderately difficult and some of them found the hallucination concept a bit tricky to understand.This task required the annotators to do online-search to check for hallucinations which made it more time-consuming.</p>
<p>Q3. Which type of evaluation did the annotators find easier?Most annotators found the pairwise comparison task easier in comparison to the direct assessment since it did not require them to evaluate every aspect of a response in detail and was less time-consuming.Overall, all annotators found these tasks interesting since it helped them learn new concepts.Note that most of these annotators had never worked with responses from LLMs before participating in this study.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>RQ1. Are Indic LLMs able to compete with Proprietary models in respective languages?From our evaluations, we find that smaller Indic models perform better than the open-source models they are trained on, and larger frontier models such as GPT-4o perform best on Indic languages.However, newer medium-sized open-source models such as Llama-3 show great potential in our evaluations.</p>
<p>Our evaluation not only provides a ranking of LLMs but also indicates which open source models (like Llama-3) are potentially promising starting points for fine-tuning language specific Indic models.</p>
<p>RQ2. Can LLM evaluators be used as a substitute for human evaluators in the multilingual setting?Which task format shows higher promise?</p>
<p>We find that LLM evaluators agree fairly well with humans on the pairwise evaluation task in comparison to the direct assessment task.The LLM evaluator has low agreement with humans on Marathi, Bengali and Punjabi in the pairwise task and very low agreement for all languages particularly Bengali and Odia in direct assessment task.We also get feedback from the native human annotators and find direct assessment to be a harder task.On manually going through some examples, we find that humans tend to prefer outputs which are more friendly in nature, i.e., have good formatting, use colloquial language and explain with the help of examples.</p>
<p>We find that LLM-evaluators agree less with humans on evaluating responses with culturalnuances, suggesting that they do no possess enough cultural context to do these kinds of evaluations well.However, LLM evaluators are still able to capture general trends at a higher level as seen from the τ scores.This suggests that a human-in-theloop or hybrid evaluation system is necessary for performing multilingual, multi-cultural evaluation.</p>
<p>RQ3.What are the biases that affects the evaluators' judgements?We look for position bias by looking at evaluator behaviour on option flipping and find no such biases.LLM evaluators are not able to detect hallucinations and pick a response even when both are hallucinated in 87% cases compared to 53% by humans.They are also found to be over-optimistic in nature.This leads to LLM evaluators having higher scores in the direct assessment task as well as fewer ties (more decisive) in pairwise evaluations task.We also look for correlations between response length and a winning response and find slight bias towards a longer response by both evaluators.Lastly, we check for any self-bias in the GPT evaluator and find evidence of it preferring its own output.</p>
<p>Language Coverage Our work is subject to some limitations.Our study covers 10 Indic languages, however, there are several other Indic languages that we do not cover yet in this study, which we hope to do in future iterations.Our choice of languages is based on the availability of languagespecific Indic models.</p>
<p>Prompt Diversity</p>
<p>The prompts used for evaluation in our study are limited, and we plan to scale the number of prompts used in future iterations.However, due to the nature of pairwise evaluations, where every model is evaluated in battles with every other model, scaling to hundreds of prompts for human evaluation becomes intractable.We plan to modify our design to have fewer battles per prompt and also source more prompts from native speakers.</p>
<p>Model Coverage</p>
<p>The models we include in our study were limited to the ones we are aware of or able to access during the study.We plan to include more models as they become available.</p>
<p>Ethics Statement</p>
<p>We use the framework by Bender and Friedman (2018) to discuss the ethical considerations for our work.</p>
<p>Institutional Review All aspects of this research were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of our organization and also approved by KARYA.</p>
<p>Data Our study is conducted in collaboration with KARYA, that pays workers several times the minimum wage in India and provides them with dignified digital work.Workers were paid Rs. 10 per datapoint for this study.Each datapoint took approximately 5 minutes to evaluate.</p>
<p>Annotator Demographics All annotators were native speakers of the languages that they were evaluating.Other annotator demographics were not collected for this study.</p>
<p>Annotation Guidelines KARYA provided annotation guidelines and training to all workers.The guidelines and training were modified based on experiences from a Pilot study we conducted before the evaluation round described in this paper.We once again highlight that no human annotators were employed for the safety/toxicity analysis of our work.</p>
<p>Compute/AI Resources All our experiments were conducted on 4 A100 80Gb PCIE GPUs.The API calls to the GPT models were done through the Azure OpenAI service, and the Gemini model was accessed via the Google AI Studio.Finally, we also acknowledge the usage of ChatGPT and GitHub CoPilot for building our codebase.</p>

<p>C Prompt-Response Generation</p>
<p>All evaluated models are prompted with a system instruction followed by the query with no few-shot examples.The prompt template for each opensource model is taken from their HuggingFace model card wherever applicable, else the default Llama2-prompt i.e., [INST]<SYS>, is used.We instruct the models to limit their responses to 300 words and truncate the responses when necessary to make human evaluation easier, as KARYA workers perform the evaluation tasks on a smartphone.</p>
<p>D LLM Evaluator Setup</p>
<p>We use GPT-4-32k model as the LLM evaluator.</p>
<p>The detailed prompts used for each type of evaluation can be found below.</p>
<p>D.1 Pairwise Evaluation</p>
<p>We use the prompt shown in Figure 10 for the pairwise evaluations done in our study.The LLM evaluator is given the query and the responses by two models in this format.It is then asked to pick the better response or give it a tie and provide a justification.</p>
<p>D.2 Direct Assessment</p>
<p>We use the prompt shown in Figure 11 for the direct assessment done in our study.The LLM evaluator is given a query-response pair for a model along with the description of the rubric we are going to assess.We evaluate 3 metrics, namely, hallucinations, task quality and linguistic acceptability, by doing a separate LLM call for each.A detailed description of each rubric can be found in Figures 12, 13 and 14.</p>
<p>D.3 RTP-LX Safety Evaluation</p>
<p>We also conduct a preliminary safety evaluation study for the Hindi models using the RTP-LX (de Wynter et al., 2024) Hindi dataset.Only LLM evaluators were used for this study.We used the same instruction prompt as used in direct assessment above (Figure 11) and calculate the problematic content score in the model output generations.</p>
<p>E Human Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>We employ an ethical data annotation company, KARYA to perform the pairwise evaluations as well as direct assessments.However, we do not engage them to do the safety evaluations due to ethical concerns.All annotators go through a training and screening check to maintain task performance.The task images displayed to the final annotators on smartphone screen are shown below.</p>
<p>E.1 Pairwise</p>
<p>For the pairwise evaluation, the annotators are shown a prompt as well as two responses in a fashion similar to the LLM.The annotation guidelines are given in Figure 16.The app interface for Hindi evaluation can be seen in Figure 17.</p>
<p>E.2 Direct Assessment</p>
<p>For the direct assessment, the annotators are shown the query-response pair.Then a flag is shown asking if the output is gibberish.If selected the response is given an automatic lowest score, otherwise, the annotators are asked to label the three metrics.The annotation guidelines are given in Figure 18.The app interface for Hindi evaluation can be seen in Figure 19.</p>
<p>F Leaderboards</p>
<p>In this section we present the detailed leaderboards constructed by the strategies discussed in Section 3. To calculate the Elo rating, we bootstrap the upsampled data 100 times.This is done due to the lower number of datapoints and to get confidence intervals.-35-turbo (Brown et al., 2020) GPT-35-Turbo Proprietary Meta Models meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023) Llama-2 7B Open-Source meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct (AI@Meta, 2024)</p>

<p>F.1 MLE Elo Leaderboards</p>
<p>We report the MLE Elo leaderboards for all the 10 languages in Tables 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and 16.</p>
<p>F.2 Standard Elo Leaderboards</p>
<p>We report the Standard Elo leaderboards for all the 10 languages in Tables 17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 and 26.</p>
<p>F.3 Direct Assessment Leaderboards</p>
<p>We report the Direct Assessment leaderboards for all the 10 languages in Tables 27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35 and 36.</p>
<p>G Percentage Agreement</p>
<p>In this section we report the Percentage Agreement (PA) scores which gives a raw-interpretable number but does not take class-imbalance into account.The scores are reported in Table 37.</p>
<p>Pairwise Battles On average humans agree on 70% of the samples among themselves whereas the accuracy is similar albeit slightly lower for humanaverage and LLM evaluator.We see both evaluators agree more on the non-cultural subset of queries and follow a similar trend to the Fleiss Kappa correlations reported in Table 3.A language-wise breakdown of PA scores can be seen in Figure 20.We note that humans and LLM evaluator tend to agree less on Marathi, Punjabi and Bengali.</p>
<p>Direct Assessment For this task, we find slightly higher agreement between humans in comparison to the pairwise evaluation and it is similar for both the prompt types.However we see a decline between human and LLM evaluator agreement and it is the worse for culturally-nuanced set of queries.</p>
<p>From Figure 20, we again find the lowest agreement on Odia and Bengali for humans and LLM evaluator, similar to the Fleiss Kappa scores.</p>
<p>H Self-Bias</p>
<p>In this section we present detailed results of the selfbias analysis.We select the 11 models which are evaluated on atleast 8-10 out of the total 10 languages.We see GPT variants rank increase the most.Gemma also shows an increase while the Aryabhatta variants and Llama-3 70B model have a big drop.</p>

<p>• Don't add any extra information or facts about the response or answer, or try to explain the response or answer.</p>
<p>• Use the last option only if necessary: "Both are equal."If you are not able to analyse or both are blunders or garbage and not at all related to the prompt.</p>
<p>• If both answers/responses are good, select the very good answer/response out of the two.</p>
<p>• Out of the two responses, if the first one has 30-40% relevant data and content is repeated or some minor spelling mistakes and the second response is a blunder or garbage, we can select the first one.After selecting the first one, you can also include in the feedback audio that there are some minor spelling mistakes or incomplete data or repetition of the content.This is applicable only if the second response is garbage or blunder or not at all related to prompt in anyway.</p>
<p>Direct Assessment</p>
<p>• Linguistic Acceptability -0 : gibberish or bad sentence structure to native speaker.</p>
<p>-1 : some grammatical mistakes.</p>
<p>-2 : perfect language even if answer is incorrect.This should be irrespective of the answer it gave meaning if its hallucinated.</p>
<p>• Hallucinations</p>
<p>-0 : no stuff that is not factual.</p>
<p>-1 : even if there is one stuff that is not correct, gibberish also gets this.</p>
<p>• Task Quality -0 : if its gibberish or totally hallucinated.</p>
<p>-1 : if it is partially correct like not giving all the details asked and only some, it is fine if there is little hallucination.-2 : perfect answer, most of the things answered and no hallucinations.</p>

Accessed: 2024-05-03.Appendix A Elo CalculationA.1 Standard EloIf player A has a rating of R A and player B a rating of R B , the probability of player A winning is,(1)When calculating a player's rating, recent performances are given more importance than past ones as they are more indicative of their current skills.After each game, the player's rating is updated based on the difference between the expected outcome and the actual outcome, which is then scaled by a factor K. A higher value of K gives more weight to the recent games.A.2 MLE EloIn the context of LLMs, the models have fixed weights and their performance does not change over time unless further training is done.Therefore, the order of battles does not matter.To estimate the log-likelihood of the underlying Elo, we use the Bradley-Terry (BT) model(Bradley and Terry, 1952), which assumes a fixed but unknown pairwise win-rate.Like Elo rating, the BT model also derives ratings of players based on pairwise comparison to estimate win-rate between each other.The main difference between the BT model and the standard Elo system is that the BT model assumes that the player's performance does not change (i.e., game order does not matter).We use a Logistic Regression implementation to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) Elo Ratings.B Model DetailsWe list the details of all the models evaluated by us in our study in Table5and Table6.We conduct evaluations on 20 indic and 10 multilingual models.The models are classified based on the following criteria,
