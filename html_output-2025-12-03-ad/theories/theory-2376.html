                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic Stress and Network Activity Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by the interplay between intrinsic metabolic demand and the pattern of network activity. Neurons with high baseline metabolic rates and sustained excitatory network activity are more susceptible to proteotoxic stress, leading to increased Aβ/tau accumulation, unless they possess adaptive mechanisms for metabolic resilience or synaptic scaling.</p>

                <li>Artificially increasing network activity in metabolically resilient neurons may not increase vulnerability, suggesting a threshold effect.</li>
