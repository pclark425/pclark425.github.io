                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit Connectivity and Local Microenvironment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position within local circuits and the surrounding microenvironment. Neurons with extensive long-range connectivity, high synaptic input, and exposure to pro-inflammatory or oxidative microenvironments are more vulnerable, while those embedded in protective glial networks or with limited connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly connected neurons with high synaptic input that remain resistant despite a pro-inflammatory microenvironment would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing resistant neurons with limited connectivity but high exposure to pro-inflammatory signals would call the theory into question.</li>
