                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Proteostasis and Stress Response Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic capacity for proteostasis and stress response. Populations with robust protein quality control systems (e.g., efficient autophagy, chaperone expression, unfolded protein response) are resistant, while those with limited proteostatic capacity are vulnerable to misfolded protein accumulation and toxicity.</p>
