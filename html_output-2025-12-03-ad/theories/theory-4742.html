                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Gradient-Threshold Theory of Selective Visual Cortex Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by spatial gradients of connectivity and metabolic demand, with pathology emerging when a critical threshold of combined stress is exceeded. The interplay between local circuit properties and global network integration determines whether a neuronal population crosses this threshold.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing local circuit activity in globally integrated regions will induce pathology if the threshold is crossed.</li>
                <li>Altering the spatial gradient of connectivity (e.g., via developmental manipulation) will shift the pattern of vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological interventions that raise the stress threshold will delay pathology onset.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If regions with high combined gradients do not develop pathology, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If reducing connectivity or metabolic demand does not prevent pathology, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If threshold effects are not observed (i.e., pathology increases linearly with stress), the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Molecular or genetic factors that set the threshold independently of network or metabolic gradients. </li>
    <li>Cases where pathology appears in regions with low combined gradients. </li>
