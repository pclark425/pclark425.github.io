                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic patterns of neuronal activity and metabolic demand. Neuronal populations with higher baseline activity, greater synaptic plasticity, and elevated metabolic rates are more susceptible to amyloid-β and tau accumulation due to increased production of pathogenic proteins, oxidative stress, and impaired proteostasis. Conversely, populations with lower activity or specialized homeostatic mechanisms are more resistant.</p>
