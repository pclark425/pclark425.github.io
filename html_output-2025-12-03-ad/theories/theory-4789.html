                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Proteostatic Stress Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the degree of activity-dependent proteostatic stress, which is a function of both synaptic activity (driven by network connectivity) and the efficiency of protein quality control systems (a metabolic phenotype). Neurons with high synaptic throughput and limited proteostatic capacity accumulate misfolded proteins more rapidly, leading to earlier and more severe pathology.</p>

                <li>If neurons with low activity and low proteostatic capacity are equally vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If boosting proteostatic capacity in active neurons does not reduce aggregate formation, the theory would be falsified.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The influence of extracellular factors (e.g., microglial clearance, vascular supply) on vulnerability is not addressed. </li>
    <li>Genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE4) that may modulate vulnerability independently of activity or proteostasis are not incorporated. </li>
