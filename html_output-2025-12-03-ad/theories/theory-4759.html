                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis and Immune Signature Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by cell-intrinsic differences in proteostasis capacity and immune gene expression signatures. Neurons with robust proteostasis machinery and anti-inflammatory immune signatures are more resistant to pathological protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, while those with weaker proteostasis and pro-inflammatory signatures are more vulnerable.</p>
