                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature and Proteostasis Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures, including expression of proteostasis-related genes, chaperones, and clearance pathways. Neurons with robust proteostasis machinery and efficient protein degradation pathways are resistant, while those with weak proteostasis or high expression of amyloidogenic/tau-prone isoforms are vulnerable.</p>
