                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2486</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular expression profiles. Specific combinations of cell-surface receptors, proteostasis machinery, and metabolic enzymes modulate the uptake, aggregation, and clearance of pathological proteins, leading to population-specific outcomes.</p>

    <li>Network-level factors (e.g., connectivity, activity) may modulate vulnerability independently of molecular signatures. </li>
