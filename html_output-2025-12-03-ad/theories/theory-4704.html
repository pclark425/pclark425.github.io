                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Collapse and Early Detection via Peripheral Biomarkers</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by a collapse in cellular proteostasis, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins (amyloid-beta, tau) and subsequent neurodegeneration. This proteostatic failure is systemically reflected in peripheral tissues (e.g., blood, skin fibroblasts), enabling early detection through peripheral biomarkers before CNS symptoms manifest.</p>
