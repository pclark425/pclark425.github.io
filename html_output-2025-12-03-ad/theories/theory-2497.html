                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resilience of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is governed by intrinsic molecular features, such as differential expression of proteostasis regulators, antioxidant systems, and synaptic maintenance genes. Neurons with robust intrinsic molecular defenses are more resistant to toxic protein aggregation and its downstream effects, while those with weaker defenses are selectively vulnerable.</p>
