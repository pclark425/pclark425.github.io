                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Selective Synaptic Vulnerability: The Homeostatic Buffering Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resilience of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is governed by intrinsic molecular homeostatic buffering capacities. Neurons with robust proteostasis, antioxidant, and synaptic repair mechanisms are intrinsically more resilient, while those with lower expression or activity of these systems are selectively vulnerable. The interplay between cell-autonomous molecular defenses and local synaptic network demands determines the fate of each neuronal subtype in the face of dementia-related pathology.</p>

                <li>Artificially increasing synaptic activity in otherwise resilient visual cortex neurons will render them vulnerable only if their homeostatic buffering is simultaneously impaired.</li>
                <li>Selective pharmacological enhancement of autophagy in vulnerable neuron subtypes will prevent their degeneration without affecting already resilient populations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high proteostasis gene expression are equally vulnerable as those with low expression, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If neurons with high synaptic activity but robust homeostatic capacity are still highly vulnerable, the theory is called into question.</li>
