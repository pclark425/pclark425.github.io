                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4716</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Threshold Failure Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises when the brain's proteostatic systems (responsible for protein folding, clearance, and degradation) are overwhelmed by cumulative insults (genetic, metabolic, environmental), leading to a threshold failure. This failure results in the rapid accumulation of misfolded proteins (amyloid, tau, TDP-43, etc.), which then propagate via prion-like mechanisms. Early detection is possible by identifying subtle proteostatic stress responses and misfolded protein seeds in biofluids before overt plaque/tangle formation.</p>
