                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic Metabolic–Neuroinflammatory–Amyloid/Tau Loop in AD with Dyslipidemia</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that systemic metabolic dysfunction (dyslipidemia, insulin resistance) triggers neuroinflammation, which alters microRNA expression and lipid metabolism in the brain, promoting amyloid and tau pathology. Amyloid and tau aggregates further exacerbate neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction, creating a self-reinforcing loop. The loop is detectable via combined metabolic, inflammatory, and microRNA biomarkers in blood, and is especially relevant in AD cases with metabolic syndrome.</p>
