                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Propagation Theory</p>

                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disintegration of large-scale brain networks, initiated by local molecular pathology (amyloid, tau) that propagates via synaptic and connectomic pathways. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level functional and structural disruptions before overt molecular or cognitive symptoms.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Non-invasive brain stimulation targeting network hubs will halt or reverse network disintegration and slow AD progression.</li>
                <li>Network disintegration patterns will allow subtyping of AD with distinct clinical trajectories and treatment responses.</li>
                <li>Network-level interventions (e.g., cognitive training) will be effective even in the presence of significant molecular pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If network disintegration does not precede clinical symptoms, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If AD pathology spreads to unconnected regions, the network propagation law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If network-based biomarkers do not outperform molecular or regional markers, the theory's predictive claims are weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases of AD with minimal network disruption but significant molecular pathology are not fully explained. </li>
    <li>Some individuals with network disintegration do not develop AD, suggesting additional protective factors. </li>
