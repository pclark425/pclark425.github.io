                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disintegration of large-scale brain network hubs, driven by a convergence of molecular pathologies (amyloid, tau, inflammation, vascular dysfunction) that selectively target highly connected neural nodes. This network collapse, rather than any single molecular event, is the primary cause of cognitive decline.</p>

                <li>Individuals with rare genetic variants that enhance network resilience will be protected from AD despite high pathology.</li>
                <li>Artificially enhancing network connectivity in animal models will reduce susceptibility to AD-like pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding individuals with severe network hub disintegration but no cognitive symptoms would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing cognitive decline in individuals with intact network connectivity would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that molecular pathology alone (without network disruption) is sufficient to cause AD symptoms would refute the theory.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases of rapid-onset dementia with minimal network disintegration (e.g., prion disease) are not explained by this theory. </li>
