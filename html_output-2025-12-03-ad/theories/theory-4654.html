                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises when a combination of molecular (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation), vascular, and network-level disruptions collectively cross a pathological threshold, triggering irreversible neurodegeneration. Effective detection requires integrated, multimodal assessment, as no single biomarker or modality is sufficient to predict disease onset or progression.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Many individuals with high amyloid or tau alone do not develop AD; risk increases dramatically when multiple pathologies co-occur. </li>
    <li>Vascular dysfunction and network disruption synergize with molecular pathology to predict conversion to AD. </li>
    <li>Multimodal imaging studies show that combined biomarker positivity is a stronger predictor of AD than any single marker. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The explicit threshold and requirement for convergence is a novel synthesis of existing multimodal evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multimodal biomarker approaches are increasingly used, and the NIA-AA research framework recognizes multiple pathways.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the requirement for a threshold of converging pathologies, not just additive risk.</p>
