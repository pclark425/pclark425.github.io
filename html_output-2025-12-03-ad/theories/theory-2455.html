                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the integration of multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including cell-type-specific gene expression, metabolic state, synaptic connectivity, and local microenvironmental influences. The interplay of these factors creates a gradient of vulnerability across neuronal subtypes, rather than a binary susceptible/resistant classification.</p>
