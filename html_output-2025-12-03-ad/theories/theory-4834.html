                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Delayed Propagation and Synaptic Seeding Theory for V1 Resistance (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective resistance of certain neuronal populations in the primary visual cortex (V1) to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles arises from two interrelated mechanisms: (1) delayed propagation of pathological protein aggregates due to unique circuit connectivity and activity patterns in V1, and (2) the absence or inefficiency of 'synaptic seeding' events—local molecular or synaptic conditions that facilitate the initial nucleation and spread of Aβ and tau pathology. Together, these mechanisms create a microenvironment in V1 that is less permissive to the initiation and propagation of neurodegenerative proteinopathies, despite systemic exposure.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>V1 exhibits distinct laminar organization and lower recurrent excitatory connectivity compared to association cortices, which are more vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Propagation of tau and Aβ pathology is more rapid in highly interconnected association areas than in primary sensory cortices. </li>
    <li>Network-based vulnerability models show that regions with high recurrent connectivity and hub status are more susceptible to early proteinopathy spread. </li>
    <li>V1 receives strong feedforward input and has less extensive long-range association connections, which may limit trans-synaptic propagation of misfolded proteins. </li>

                <li>If V1 is exposed to chronic, high-frequency patterned activity mimicking association cortex, will this override resistance and permit pathology propagation?</li>
                <li>If a new class of seeding factors is discovered in V1, could it confer resistance to other brain regions when overexpressed?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If V1 neurons develop Aβ/tau pathology at the same rate as association cortex when exposed to identical seeding and circuit conditions, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If V1 synapses are found to contain equal or higher levels of known seeding factors compared to vulnerable regions, the synaptic seeding law is called into question.</li>
