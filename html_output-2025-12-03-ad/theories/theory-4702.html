                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4702</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disconnection and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the propagation of pathological protein aggregates (amyloid-beta and tau) along vulnerable neural networks, leading to progressive disconnection of brain regions. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level functional and structural changes, as well as molecular signatures of aggregate propagation in cerebrospinal fluid and blood.</p>
