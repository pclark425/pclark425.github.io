                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Pathogenesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by molecular misfolding events (Aβ, tau) in vulnerable brain regions, which propagate via neural networks, leading to progressive network disintegration. This process is mirrored by functional and structural connectivity changes detectable by advanced imaging and electrophysiology, providing a mechanistic and predictive framework for both causation and detection.</p>
