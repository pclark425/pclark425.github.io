                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Network Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is driven by their participation in highly active, recurrent network motifs. Neurons that are part of frequently co-active ensembles or that experience high synaptic activity are more prone to metabolic stress, increased protein synthesis, and local microenvironmental changes that favor pathological protein aggregation and spread.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuronal activity increases amyloid-β production and release in vivo. </li>
    <li>Regions with high baseline activity are early sites of pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Increased synaptic activity elevates local metabolic demand and oxidative stress, which can promote protein misfolding. </li>
    <li>Visual cortex neurons with higher spontaneous activity show greater vulnerability in some mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Functional imaging in humans shows that highly active cortical regions are more likely to accumulate amyloid-β. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law builds on known activity-dependence but applies it to specific network motifs in the visual cortex, which is a novel extension.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Activity-dependent amyloid-β production and regional vulnerability are established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The link between recurrent network motif participation and selective vulnerability in the visual cortex is new.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Some neurons may be vulnerable due to factors unrelated to activity, such as genetic predisposition or local microglial response. </li>
