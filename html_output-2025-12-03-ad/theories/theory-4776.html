                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Integrated Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the intrinsic molecular signature concept by positing that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the interaction between intrinsic molecular features and the neuron's position and function within cortical microcircuits. Neurons with high synaptic connectivity, metabolic demand, and excitatory drive, combined with a vulnerable molecular signature, are most susceptible, while those with protective signatures and/or less network integration are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Altering network properties alone in neurons with a vulnerable molecular signature may be sufficient to change their vulnerability status.</li>
                <li>Rare neurons with high network integration but a protective molecular signature may show unexpected resistance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly connected, metabolically active neurons with a vulnerable molecular signature that are resistant to pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that network manipulation does not affect vulnerability in the context of a given molecular signature would call the theory into question.</li>
            </ol>
