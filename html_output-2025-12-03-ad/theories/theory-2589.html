                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Projection-Pattern Tau Vulnerability in Visual Cortex</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia while others remain resistant, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Neurons that project long-range corticocortical axons—principally supragranular layer III pyramidal cells in visual association cortex and their molecularly defined homologues (L2/3 intratelencephalic excitatory neurons, Drosophila optic‑lobe excitatory clusters)—are selectively vulnerable to tau neurofibrillary tangles. Their projection phenotype, high expression of non‑phosphorylated neurofilament protein (N‑PNFP) and glutamatergic signaling components, predisposes them to early tau cleavage, aggregation and eventual loss, whereas deeper‑layer pyramidal cells and short‑range projection neurons are comparatively spared.</p>
