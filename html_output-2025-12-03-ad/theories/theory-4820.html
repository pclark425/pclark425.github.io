                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability (General Formulation 1: Core Molecular Signature)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that each neuronal population in the visual cortex possesses a unique, stable 'intrinsic molecular signature'—a composite of gene expression, proteomic, and epigenetic features—that determines its baseline susceptibility or resistance to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles. These signatures encode the cell-autonomous properties that modulate vulnerability, independent of network context.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics reveal distinct gene expression profiles in vulnerable vs. resistant neurons in the visual cortex. </li>
    <li>Proteomic studies show that neurons with high expression of synaptic vesicle proteins or calcium-binding proteins are more resistant to Aβ/tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Epigenetic marks (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications) correlate with neuronal subtype-specific vulnerability. </li>
    <li>Cell-autonomous manipulation of stress response genes alters vulnerability in vitro. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has identified correlates, this law formalizes the concept of a composite, predictive signature as a causal determinant.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cell-type-specific gene expression and proteomic signatures are known to correlate with vulnerability in neurodegeneration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The formalization of a stable, composite 'intrinsic molecular signature' as the primary determinant of baseline vulnerability is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>Longitudinal studies show that neuronal subtype gene expression profiles are stable in adult cortex. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends known stability of neuronal identity to the context of vulnerability signatures.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Stability of neuronal subtype identity is well-established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between signature stability and persistent vulnerability/resistance is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Engineering a synthetic molecular signature in a resistant neuron to match that of a vulnerable population will confer vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Long-term environmental enrichment or deprivation may induce subtle, stable changes in intrinsic signatures, altering vulnerability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with identical intrinsic signatures show divergent vulnerability in the same environment, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If altering the intrinsic signature does not change vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The influence of network context and non-neuronal cells is not addressed. </li>
