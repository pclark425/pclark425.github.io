                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Synaptic Tau Seeding & Metabolic Stress Hypothesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia while others remain resistant, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Synaptic compartments (both excitatory and inhibitory) act as early reservoirs for seed‑competent, phosphorylated tau. Accumulation of tau seeds at synapses, combined with metabolic stressors such as cofilin‑mediated actin destabilization and NH₂‑truncated tau, drives local spine loss and functional impairment before overt NFT formation. Neurons with high synaptic turnover (e.g., supragranular excitatory cells) are therefore more vulnerable, whereas neurons with lower synaptic remodeling rates (e.g., granular layer IV cells) are relatively protected.</p>

    <li>Layer 4 excitatory (Ex5) neurons preserve their proportion and show up‑regulation of calcium‑homeostasis and KCNIP4, correlating with resistance to tau‑associated degeneration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8030.html#e8030.0" class="evidence-link">[e8030.0]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If synaptic turnover is pharmacologically reduced in supragranular excitatory neurons (e.g., via actin‑stabilizing agents), tau seed accumulation and spine loss will be attenuated despite unchanged amyloid burden.</li>
                <li>Overexpression of KCNIP4 specifically in layer II/III excitatory neurons will confer resistance to tau‑induced spine loss and reduce synaptic tau seeding.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Targeted inhibition of cofilin‑1 dephosphorylation in apical dendrites will prevent NH₂‑htau‑mediated spine loss without affecting overall tau pathology, revealing a potential therapeutic axis.</li>
                <li>Selective activation of microglial phagocytosis at synaptic sites will clear seed‑competent tau and restore synaptic function, but may also exacerbate synapse loss if over‑activated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that increasing synaptic turnover in layer IV neurons (e.g., via chronic sensory enrichment) does not increase tau seed accumulation would challenge the metabolic resilience law.</li>
                <li>Showing that KCNIP4 overexpression in layer II/III neurons fails to protect against tau‑induced spine loss would falsify the proposed protective role of calcium‑homeostasis genes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Inhibitory shaft synapses on dendritic shafts show impaired activity‑dependent loss in early amyloidosis (hAPP mice) but are not directly linked to tau seeding, leaving their role in the hypothesis ambiguous. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8048.html#e8048.1" class="evidence-link">[e8048.1]</a> </li>
    <li>VIP interneurons are implicated in glymphatic clearance via gamma‑induced vasomotion, a mechanism not captured by the synaptic tau seeding framework. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8034.html#e8034.1" class="evidence-link">[e8034.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory expands prior synaptic tau observations by adding a metabolic‑turnover dimension and linking transcriptomic resilience signatures to protection.</p>
