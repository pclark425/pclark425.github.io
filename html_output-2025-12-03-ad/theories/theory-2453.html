                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network and Microenvironmental Interaction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position within neural circuits and their interactions with the local microenvironment, including glial cells, vasculature, and synaptic partners. These extrinsic factors modulate the exposure to, and clearance of, pathological proteins, as well as the response to stress.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly connected neurons (network hubs) accumulate more Aβ/tau and degenerate earlier in AD models. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general principle is known, but its application to visual cortex and microenvironmental context is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Network hub vulnerability is recognized in neurodegeneration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies the concept to the visual cortex and links it to local microenvironmental factors.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Enhancing glial activity in specific visual cortex regions will confer resistance to Aβ/tau pathology in adjacent neurons.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network hub status (e.g., by silencing hub neurons) will reduce their vulnerability to Aβ/tau aggregation.</li>
                <li>Regions with both high glial activity and low network hubness will be most resistant to pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially creating new network hubs in resistant populations will render them vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Transplanting glial cells from resistant regions to vulnerable regions will confer protection.</li>
                <li>Altering the microenvironment (e.g., via vascular changes) will modulate the vulnerability of network hubs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If glial activation does not correlate with neuronal resistance in the visual cortex, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If network hub neurons are not more vulnerable than non-hub neurons, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If manipulation of glial activity does not alter vulnerability to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons in glia-rich regions still develop pathology, suggesting incomplete protection. </li>
    <li>Certain visual cortex regions with low network connectivity still show high vulnerability. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
