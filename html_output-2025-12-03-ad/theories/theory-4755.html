                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis and Immune Signature Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in dementia is governed by cell-intrinsic differences in proteostasis capacity and immune signaling signatures. Neurons with robust proteostasis networks and anti-inflammatory immune signatures are resistant, while those with compromised proteostasis and pro-inflammatory signatures are vulnerable.</p>

                <li>Pharmacologically shifting the immune signature of vulnerable neurons to an anti-inflammatory state will prevent or reverse pathology in vivo.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal single-cell profiling in preclinical AD will reveal that proteostasis and immune signatures predict future vulnerability before any pathology is detectable.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high proteostasis capacity still accumulate Aβ and tau pathology at the same rate as low-capacity neurons, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If immune signature manipulation (e.g., anti-inflammatory gene upregulation) does not alter vulnerability, the theory is called into question.</li>
