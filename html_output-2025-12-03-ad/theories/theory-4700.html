                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Connectome Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated and propagated by selective vulnerability of large-scale brain network hubs (the connectome) to metabolic, proteostatic, and inflammatory stress. The breakdown of these hubs leads to a loss of global network efficiency, which can be detected by advanced neuroimaging and network analysis before clinical symptoms arise. The spatial and temporal pattern of hub failure predicts the clinical phenotype and progression.</p>
