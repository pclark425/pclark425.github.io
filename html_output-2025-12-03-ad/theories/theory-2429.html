                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection Type Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the interplay between their network connectivity (including both local and long-range projections) and the type of projections (e.g., excitatory vs. inhibitory, feedforward vs. feedback). Neurons with extensive, long-range, and highly integrated projections—especially those forming part of large-scale cortical networks—are more susceptible to pathology due to increased exposure to trans-synaptic spread, higher synaptic activity, and greater reliance on axonal transport. Conversely, neurons with local, short-range, or inhibitory projections are more resistant, likely due to reduced exposure to pathogenic protein spread and lower metabolic and transport demands.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network connectivity of a local inhibitory neuron (e.g., via optogenetic rewiring) will increase its vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Introducing long-range projections into a normally resistant neuron population will render them susceptible to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that local inhibitory neurons with low connectivity develop pathology at the same rate as long-range projection neurons would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that network connectivity and projection type do not interact to determine vulnerability would contradict the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some local excitatory neurons may show vulnerability despite lacking long-range projections, suggesting additional factors. </li>
