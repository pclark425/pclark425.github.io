                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Connectivity Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by a gradient of metabolic demand and network connectivity. Neurons with higher baseline metabolic rates and greater long-range connectivity are more susceptible to proteopathic stress due to increased production of reactive oxygen species, higher synaptic activity, and greater exposure to trans-synaptic spread of pathological proteins.</p>
