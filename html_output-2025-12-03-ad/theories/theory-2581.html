                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neurovascular Dysfunction as Parallel Pathogenic Axis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease, and how it can be effectively detected, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A model in which age‑related blood‑brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, pericyte loss, and chronic neuroinflammation act as an independent but interacting pathway that accelerates amyloid and tau pathology, leading to neurodegeneration. Biomarkers of BBB permeability (Ktrans), plasma GFAP, and inflammatory cytokines provide early detection of this vascular axis.</p>
