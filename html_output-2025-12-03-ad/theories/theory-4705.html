                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is initiated by a convergence of amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and chronic neuroinflammation, which interact in a self-reinforcing cascade. This cascade leads to synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, and cognitive decline. Early detection is possible by identifying molecular and functional signatures of this cascade in peripheral fluids and neuroimaging, before overt clinical symptoms.</p>

    <li>Animal models demonstrate that amyloid and tau pathology synergistically drive neurodegeneration, especially in the presence of activated microglia. </li>
