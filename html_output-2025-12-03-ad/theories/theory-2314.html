                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2314</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Failure Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where age-related decline in protein quality control systems (e.g., autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system) leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins (amyloid-beta, tau). This proteostatic failure initiates a cascade of cellular stress responses, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying markers of proteostatic stress before overt protein aggregation.</p>
