                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Bottleneck and Proteostatic Shield Theory for V1 Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that V1's resistance to Aβ and tau pathology is due to a 'network bottleneck'—a combination of limited interareal connectivity and strong local proteostatic mechanisms. The bottleneck restricts the influx and spread of pathological seeds, while the proteostatic shield (enhanced degradation, chaperone activity, or autophagy) further suppresses aggregation. This dual mechanism explains both the delayed onset and reduced severity of pathology in V1 compared to more interconnected and metabolically vulnerable cortical regions.</p>
