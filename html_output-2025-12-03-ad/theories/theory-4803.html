                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Vulnerability Gradient Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is not static, but dynamically modulated by changes in metabolic demand and network connectivity over time. Activity-dependent plasticity, environmental enrichment, or sensory deprivation can shift the position of neuronal populations along the connectivity-metabolic gradient, thereby altering their susceptibility or resistance to pathology.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Intermittent or patterned activity changes may produce non-linear or threshold effects on vulnerability, potentially leading to unexpected patterns of pathology.</li>
