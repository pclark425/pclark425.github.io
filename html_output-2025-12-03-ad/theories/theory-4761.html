                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis and Immune Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by cell-intrinsic differences in proteostasis capacity and immune gene expression signatures. Neurons with lower proteostasis capacity and a pro-inflammatory immune signature are more susceptible to pathological aggregation and degeneration, while those with robust proteostasis and anti-inflammatory or immune-suppressive signatures are more resistant.</p>

    <li>Single-cell transcriptomic studies show that neurons with lower expression of chaperones, autophagy, and ubiquitin-proteasome system genes are more likely to accumulate misfolded proteins and develop pathology. </li>

            <ol>

                <li>Longitudinal single-cell profiling will reveal that changes in proteostasis and immune signatures precede the onset of pathology in susceptible neurons.</li>
                <li>Manipulating neuron-intrinsic immune gene expression alone (without affecting glia) will be sufficient to alter vulnerability in vivo.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with low proteostasis and high pro-inflammatory signatures do not develop pathology in models of dementia, the theory is challenged.</li>
