                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Embedded Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and role within cortical and subcortical network architectures. Neuronal populations with high centrality, extensive long-range connectivity, and high metabolic demand are more susceptible to pathological protein aggregation due to increased exposure to toxic species, higher synaptic activity, and greater energetic stress. Conversely, populations with more local connectivity, lower metabolic rates, and robust homeostatic mechanisms are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing network centrality or metabolic demand in resistant populations will render them vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting long-range connectivity in the visual cortex will reduce local aggregate formation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a population with high network centrality and metabolic demand that remains resistant would challenge this theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that reducing connectivity or metabolic demand does not affect vulnerability would call the theory into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some populations with low connectivity and metabolic demand still show vulnerability, suggesting other mechanisms are involved. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
