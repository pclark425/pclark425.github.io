                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Topology-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their position and connectivity within the cortical network. Neurons that serve as network hubs or have high centrality—receiving and integrating diverse long-range inputs—are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation and spread, while neurons with more peripheral, local, or feedforward connectivity are relatively resistant. This is due to increased exposure to trans-synaptic propagation of misfolded proteins and higher metabolic demands in hub neurons.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Altering the network topology to reduce centrality of previously vulnerable populations will confer resistance to pathology.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing the centrality of resistant populations will render them vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If populations with high network centrality and long-range input are found to be resistant to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If altering network topology does not affect vulnerability in experimental models, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some populations with intermediate network centrality show variable vulnerability, suggesting additional factors are involved. </li>
