                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4718</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disconnection and Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the propagation of misfolded protein seeds (amyloid, tau) along vulnerable neural networks, leading to progressive disconnection of functional brain circuits. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level dysfunction (e.g., via functional MRI or EEG) before overt pathology accumulates.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Restoring network connectivity (e.g., via brain stimulation) may reverse or halt AD progression.</li>
                <li>Distinct network disconnection patterns may predict different AD subtypes or symptom profiles.</li>
                <li>Peripheral interventions (e.g., sensory enrichment) may modulate network vulnerability to propagation.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>

                <li>If individuals with network disconnection do not develop AD, the predictive value is challenged.</li>
                <li>If propagation of misfolded proteins does not follow network architecture, the central mechanism is questioned.</li>
