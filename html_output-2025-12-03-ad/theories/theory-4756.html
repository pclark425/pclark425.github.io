                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis and Immune Signature Theory (Network-Integrated General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the cell-intrinsic model by proposing that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by the integration of intrinsic proteostasis and immune signatures with the neurons' network connectivity and activity patterns. Neurons with high proteostasis and anti-inflammatory signatures that are also less synaptically connected or less metabolically active are most resistant, while highly connected, metabolically active neurons with poor proteostasis and pro-inflammatory signatures are most vulnerable.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly connected and metabolically active neurons are more susceptible to neurodegeneration in multiple models. </li>
    <li>Neurons with high synaptic activity have increased protein turnover and stress, exacerbating vulnerability when proteostasis is impaired. </li>
    <li>Single-cell and connectomics studies show that hub neurons in the cortex are more likely to degenerate in AD. </li>
    <li>Pro-inflammatory gene expression in highly active neurons correlates with early pathology. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While each factor has been studied, their combined, conditional effect on vulnerability in the visual cortex is not established.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Network connectivity and metabolic activity have been linked to vulnerability, and proteostasis/immune signatures are known factors.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit integration of network properties with cell-intrinsic proteostasis and immune signatures as a combinatorial determinant of selective vulnerability is novel.</p>
