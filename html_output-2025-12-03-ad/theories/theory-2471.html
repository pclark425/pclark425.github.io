                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and role within large-scale cortical and subcortical networks. Neurons that are highly interconnected, serve as network hubs, or are part of long-range projection circuits are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation due to increased metabolic demand, synaptic activity, and exposure to trans-synaptic spread, while locally connected or less active populations are more resistant.</p>

                <li>Reducing synaptic activity in hub neurons will decrease their vulnerability to pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality of resistant neurons will render them more vulnerable to amyloid/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting long-range projections in early AD will slow the spread of pathology within the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If network hub neurons in the visual cortex do not show increased vulnerability, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If locally connected, low-activity neurons are equally affected by pathology, the theory is called into question.</li>
