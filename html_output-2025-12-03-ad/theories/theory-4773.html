                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Network Integration and Metabolic Coupling</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures governing synaptic integration, metabolic coupling, and calcium homeostasis. Neurons with high synaptic connectivity, elevated metabolic demand, and distinct calcium signaling profiles are predisposed to pathology due to increased exposure to toxic protein species and metabolic stress, while neurons with lower connectivity and robust metabolic support are more resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly connected neurons (e.g., layer 3 pyramidal cells) are more vulnerable in AD, possibly due to increased exposure to toxic species and metabolic stress. </li>
    <li>Neurons with high calcium influx are more prone to tau hyperphosphorylation and degeneration. </li>
    <li>Visual cortex neurons with extensive axonal and dendritic arbors show early signs of amyloid and tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Metabolically demanding neurons are more susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, both implicated in AD. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has linked these factors to vulnerability, this law formalizes their joint role as a predictive rule.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> High connectivity and metabolic demand have been associated with vulnerability in AD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit integration of synaptic, metabolic, and calcium channel molecular signatures as a conditional law for visual cortex vulnerability is novel.</p>
