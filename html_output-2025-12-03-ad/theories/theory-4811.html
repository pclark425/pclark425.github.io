                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature-Driven Selectivity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular signatures, including expression of specific receptors, proteostasis machinery, and stress response genes. These molecular profiles dictate the neurons' ability to internalize, degrade, or buffer toxic protein species, and thus their fate in the context of dementia.</p>
