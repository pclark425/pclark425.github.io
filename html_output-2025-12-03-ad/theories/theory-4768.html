                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Proteostatic Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by the balance between their metabolic demand and proteostatic capacity. Neurons with high energy consumption and low proteostatic reserve are more likely to accumulate misfolded proteins, while those with lower metabolic rates or enhanced proteostasis are resistant.</p>
