                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2409</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Driven Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their connectivity patterns—specifically, their synaptic input/output relationships with upstream and downstream regions already affected by pathology. Neurons with strong connections to early-affected regions are more likely to accumulate pathology via trans-synaptic spread, while those with isolated or local circuits are more resistant.</p>
