                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection Type Vulnerability Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by the network connectivity profile and the projection type (local vs. long-range) of those neurons. Specifically, neurons with extensive long-range projections and high network centrality are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation due to increased metabolic demand, synaptic activity, and exposure to trans-synaptic spread, while locally-projecting or sparsely-connected neurons are more resistant.</p>

    <li>Cortical neurons with long-range projections (e.g., layer 5 pyramidal neurons) are more affected in Alzheimer's disease than local interneurons. </li>

    <li>Network hubs in the brain, which often correspond to neurons with high centrality and long-range projections, are preferentially targeted in neurodegenerative diseases. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality of a normally resistant local neuron (e.g., by optogenetically increasing its connectivity) will render it more vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Selective ablation of long-range projections in early disease will slow the spread of pathology and cognitive decline.</li>
                <li>Altering the projection type of a neuron (e.g., by genetic manipulation) will change its vulnerability profile.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that local circuit neurons with low centrality are equally or more vulnerable than long-range projection neurons would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that network centrality has no correlation with vulnerability to pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing that pathology spreads equally through local and long-range circuits would refute the theory's mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some interneuron subtypes (e.g., chandelier cells) may show selective vulnerability despite local projections. </li>
    <li>Molecular factors (e.g., receptor expression, proteostasis capacity) may also contribute to vulnerability independent of connectivity. </li>
