                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic-Immune Trigger Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by chronic systemic immune activation (e.g., from infections, gut dysbiosis, or autoimmunity), which primes microglia and astrocytes in the brain, leading to a maladaptive neuroinflammatory response that drives amyloid and tau pathology. Early detection is possible by monitoring systemic immune signatures and neuroinflammatory markers.</p>

                <li>Vaccination against specific pathogens or modulation of gut microbiota will prevent AD in high-risk populations.</li>
                <li>Systemic immune profiling will enable population-level AD risk stratification years before symptoms.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with normal systemic immune signatures but abnormal amyloid/tau develop AD at the same rate, the theory is challenged.</li>
