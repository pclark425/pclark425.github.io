                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their patterns of synaptic activity and network integration. Neurons with high baseline activity, extensive synaptic connectivity, or specific firing patterns may experience greater metabolic and calcium stress, leading to increased susceptibility to protein aggregation, while less active or sparsely connected neurons are more resistant.</p>
