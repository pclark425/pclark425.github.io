                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory: Global Network Topology</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their position and role within the cortical network topology. Neurons with high centrality, extensive long-range connectivity, and integrative hub-like properties are more susceptible to the initiation and propagation of pathological protein aggregates, while neurons with low centrality and predominantly local connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality of a normally resistant neuronal population will render it more vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Altering the global network topology (e.g., via developmental manipulation) will shift the pattern of selective vulnerability in the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with high centrality and long-range connections are resistant to pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing that local circuit neurons with low centrality are among the earliest to accumulate pathology would contradict the theory.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Intrinsic molecular or genetic factors that confer vulnerability or resistance independent of network topology are not addressed. </li>
