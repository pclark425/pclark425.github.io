                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their baseline and stimulus-evoked activity levels. Neurons with high sustained activity or frequent bursting are more susceptible to pathology due to increased synaptic release of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, as well as greater metabolic and oxidative stress. Conversely, neurons with lower or more regulated activity are more resistant.</p>
