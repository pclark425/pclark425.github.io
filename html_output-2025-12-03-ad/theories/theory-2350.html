                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that not only does gut dysbiosis drive systemic and neuroinflammation leading to vascular dysfunction and AD, but that neurodegenerative changes in the brain and vascular system can in turn alter gut microbiota composition via neural, hormonal, and immune feedback, creating a self-reinforcing pathological loop.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neurodegeneration and vascular dysfunction can alter autonomic and hormonal signaling to the gut, impacting microbiota composition. </li>
    <li>Stress and neuroinflammation are known to disrupt gut barrier integrity and microbiota balance. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The feedback from neurodegeneration/vascular dysfunction to gut microbiota is less explored in AD, making this a novel extension.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Bidirectional communication in the gut-brain axis is recognized, especially in stress and psychiatric disorders.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law extends the feedback loop to include neurodegeneration and vascular dysfunction as drivers of gut dysbiosis in AD.</p>
