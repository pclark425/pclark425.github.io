                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Microenvironmental Modulation of Pathology Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the interplay between intrinsic neuronal properties and the local microenvironment, including glial support, vascularization, and extracellular matrix composition. Neurons embedded in microenvironments with robust glial support, efficient waste clearance, and anti-inflammatory signaling are more resistant, while those in less supportive or pro-inflammatory niches are more vulnerable.</p>
