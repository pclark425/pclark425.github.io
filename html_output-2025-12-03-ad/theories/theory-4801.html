                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature-Driven Susceptibility Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular signatures, including expression of specific receptors, proteostasis machinery, and stress response genes. Populations expressing high levels of Aβ/tau-binding receptors, low levels of proteostasis components, or deficient stress response pathways are more vulnerable, while those with protective molecular profiles are resistant.</p>
