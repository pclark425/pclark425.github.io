                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease can be detected at its earliest stages by integrating multimodal peripheral biomarkers—specifically, blood-based molecular signatures (proteins, microRNAs, exosomes), digital behavioral phenotyping (speech, gait, sleep), and genetic risk profiles—using advanced machine learning. The combination of these non-invasive measures provides a sensitive and specific early detection method, even before central nervous system pathology is overt.</p>
