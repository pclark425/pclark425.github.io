                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is caused by a cascade beginning with proteostasis failure (impaired clearance of misfolded proteins), which triggers chronic immune activation and metabolic dysfunction, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Effective detection requires multi-modal biomarkers capturing proteostatic, immune, and metabolic changes systemically.</p>

    <li>Proteostasis impairment (e.g., via mutations in APP, PSEN1/2, or tau) precedes amyloid and tau pathology in familial and sporadic AD. </li>
    <li>Microglial activation and neuroinflammation are observed following amyloid/tau accumulation in both human and animal models. </li>

                <li>If proteostasis failure does not precede immune/metabolic changes, the cascade model is undermined.</li>
