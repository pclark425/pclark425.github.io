                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and role within local and global cortical networks. Neurons that serve as network hubs, have high connectivity, or are central to information flow are more exposed to pathological spread and metabolic stress, while peripheral or sparsely connected neurons are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Experimental ablation of hub neurons in the visual cortex will accelerate network dysfunction and increase local amyloid-β/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Neurons with artificially increased connectivity (e.g., via viral synaptic tracing) will become more vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Peripheral neurons will remain resistant even in the presence of high local amyloid-β/tau burden.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Altering network topology (e.g., via optogenetic manipulation of connectivity) will change the spatial pattern of pathology spread.</li>
                <li>Hub neurons in other sensory cortices will show similar vulnerability patterns, suggesting a generalizable principle.</li>
                <li>Blocking trans-synaptic spread of misfolded proteins will preferentially protect hub neurons.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If hub neurons do not show increased vulnerability to amyloid-β/tau pathology, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If peripheral neurons develop pathology at the same rate as hub neurons, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If altering network connectivity does not affect vulnerability, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some highly connected neurons remain resistant, possibly due to intrinsic molecular factors not addressed by this theory. </li>
    <li>Non-synaptic mechanisms of pathology spread (e.g., extracellular diffusion) are not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends known network principles to visual cortex proteinopathy with new predictions.</p>
