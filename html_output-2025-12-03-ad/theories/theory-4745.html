                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology in dementia is governed by a gradient defined by both the degree of network connectivity and the metabolic demand of each population. Neurons with higher connectivity (i.e., more synaptic inputs/outputs and participation in hub-like network positions) and higher metabolic rates are more susceptible to pathological insults, while those with lower connectivity and metabolic rates are more resistant. This gradient operates across cell types, cortical layers, and microcircuits, integrating both structural and functional aspects of neural organization.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly connected hub neurons in cortical networks are more metabolically active and show greater vulnerability in neurodegenerative diseases. </li>
    <li>Regions with high synaptic density and glucose utilization are early sites of amyloid and tau deposition. </li>
    <li>Functional imaging shows that areas with high baseline activity are more affected in Alzheimer's disease. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to the 'network hub vulnerability' hypothesis, this law extends it to a continuous, cell-population-level gradient and explicitly links metabolic and connectivity features.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept that highly connected and metabolically active brain regions are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration is established at the regional level.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation of a continuous gradient integrating both connectivity and metabolism at the population level within the visual cortex is novel.</p>

    <li>Neuronal populations with low synaptic density and metabolic rates are relatively spared in early stages of Alzheimer's pathology. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law generalizes observations of resistance in certain populations into a formal gradient-based framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Relative sparing of less connected, less metabolically active neurons is observed in some studies.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit inverse relationship as a law, and its application to resistance, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity or metabolic rate of resistant populations (e.g., via optogenetic stimulation) will increase their vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau.</li>
                <li>Populations with high connectivity but low metabolic demand (or vice versa) will show intermediate vulnerability, revealing non-linear effects.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If populations with high connectivity and metabolic demand are not more vulnerable than those with low values, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If populations with low connectivity and metabolic demand show early and severe pathology, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Genetic or molecular factors conferring vulnerability independent of connectivity or metabolism. </li>
    <li>Regional differences in vascular supply or glial support that may modulate vulnerability. </li>
