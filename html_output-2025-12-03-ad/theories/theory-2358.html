                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic-Inflammatory Threshold Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is triggered when the combined burden of proteostatic stress (misfolded/aggregated proteins such as amyloid-beta and tau) and chronic neuroinflammation surpasses a critical, individual-specific threshold, overwhelming cellular clearance and repair mechanisms. The disease remains latent until this threshold is crossed, after which neurodegeneration accelerates. Detection methods should focus on quantifying the combined proteostatic and inflammatory load, and identifying individuals approaching the threshold.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Proteostatic stress (amyloid-beta, tau) and neuroinflammation are both elevated in AD brains; their interaction accelerates pathology. </li>
    <li>Some individuals with high amyloid or tau do not develop AD unless neuroinflammation is also present. </li>
    <li>Animal models show that reducing either amyloid or inflammation alone is less effective than reducing both. </li>
    <li>Threshold concepts are used in other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., prion diseases) to explain sudden onset after a latent period. </li>
    <li>Longitudinal biomarker studies show that both amyloid/tau and inflammatory markers rise before clinical symptoms. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While both mechanisms are recognized, their explicit quantitative integration as a threshold for disease onset is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Proteostatic and inflammatory mechanisms are both implicated in AD, and threshold concepts are used in other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes a quantitative, additive threshold model for AD onset, integrating proteostatic and inflammatory loads.</p>

                <li>If therapies that reduce both loads do not delay onset, the threshold model is called into question.</li>
