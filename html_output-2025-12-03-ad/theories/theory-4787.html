                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Metabolic Phenotype Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by the interplay between their network connectivity profiles (e.g., hubness, local clustering, long-range projections) and their intrinsic metabolic phenotypes (e.g., mitochondrial density, oxidative stress resilience, glucose utilization). Neurons with high network centrality and high metabolic demand are more susceptible to pathological protein aggregation due to increased synaptic activity, energy requirements, and exposure to toxic byproducts, while neurons with lower connectivity or more robust metabolic adaptations are more resistant.</p>

    <li>Highly connected hub neurons in the cortex show greater metabolic activity and are more frequently affected in early Alzheimer's pathology. </li>

    <li>Functional MRI and PET studies show that default mode network hubs, which overlap with visual association areas, are early targets of amyloid and tau. </li>
