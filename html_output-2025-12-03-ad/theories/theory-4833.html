                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their patterns of electrical activity and synaptic plasticity. Neurons with high baseline activity, frequent synaptic remodeling, or specific firing patterns are more susceptible to pathological protein aggregation due to increased metabolic demand, calcium influx, and local protein turnover.</p>
