                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the context of dyslipidemia arises from a systems-level regulatory loop in which microRNAs (miRNAs) modulate lipid metabolism, which in turn influences amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology, and these proteinopathies feed back to alter both miRNA expression and lipid homeostasis. The loop is self-reinforcing, leading to progressive neurodegeneration and providing a mechanistic basis for both disease causation and early detection via circulating miRNA and lipidomic signatures.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>miRNAs such as miR-33, miR-29, and miR-132 regulate cholesterol efflux, APP processing, and tau phosphorylation; dyslipidemia is associated with increased Aβ and tau pathology; Aβ and tau aggregates alter miRNA expression and lipid metabolism in neurons and glia. </li>
    <li>Experimental models show that altering miRNA levels (e.g., miR-33 inhibition) modifies both lipid profiles and amyloid/tau accumulation. </li>
    <li>Human studies demonstrate that AD patients with dyslipidemia have more severe amyloid and tau pathology, and altered miRNA and lipidomic profiles. </li>
    <li>Aβ and tau aggregates disrupt neuronal lipid rafts, which are regulated by miRNA-controlled lipid metabolism genes. </li>

                <li>If manipulation of miRNAs does not affect lipid metabolism or Aβ/tau pathology in model systems, the feedback loop is not supported.</li>
