                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2345</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the convergence of multiple pathological processes—amyloid accumulation, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction—that interact to disrupt large-scale brain network connectivity. The breakdown of these networks underlies the clinical symptoms, and early detection is possible by identifying network-level changes through advanced neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers.</p>
