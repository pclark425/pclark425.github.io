                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is fundamentally determined by their network connectivity patterns. Neurons with extensive, long-range, and highly integrated connections are more susceptible to trans-synaptic spread of pathological proteins and metabolic stress, while neurons with local, modular, or isolated connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially rewiring visual cortex neurons to increase long-range connectivity will increase their vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with extensive long-range connectivity do not show increased vulnerability, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If local circuit neurons are equally or more vulnerable than long-range projection neurons, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with local connectivity may be vulnerable due to intrinsic factors unrelated to network architecture (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic risk factors). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
