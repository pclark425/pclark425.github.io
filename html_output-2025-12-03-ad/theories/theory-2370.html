                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral Platelet Tau/Aβ Signature as a Surrogate for Central Neurodegeneration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the molecular signature of tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) in peripheral platelets reflects, and is mechanistically linked to, the pathological processes occurring in the central nervous system (CNS) during Alzheimer's disease (AD). Platelets, sharing key processing enzymes and precursor proteins with neurons, mirror central amyloidogenic and tauopathic changes, making their tau/Aβ profile a reliable, minimally invasive surrogate marker for early detection and monitoring of AD.</p>

                <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature will distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative diseases with high specificity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may predict subtypes of AD or rate of progression.</li>
                <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may be modifiable by lifestyle or pharmacological interventions targeting peripheral metabolism.</li>
                <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may reflect preclinical AD decades before symptom onset.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with high platelet tau/Aβ signature do not develop CNS pathology or cognitive decline, the predictive law is invalid.</li>
                <li>If platelet tau/Aβ signature does not correlate with central biomarkers in longitudinal studies, the surrogate law is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If platelet tau/Aβ signature is not specific to AD (e.g., also elevated in other dementias), the specificity is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Other peripheral sources (e.g., megakaryocytes, leukocytes) may contribute to circulating tau/Aβ. </li>
    <li>Platelet tau/Aβ levels may be influenced by systemic inflammation or unrelated hematological conditions. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
