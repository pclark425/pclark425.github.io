                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular expression profiles, including differential expression of receptors, proteostasis machinery, and stress response genes. Populations expressing higher levels of Aβ/tau-binding receptors, or with reduced proteostasis capacity, are more vulnerable, while those with protective molecular signatures are resistant.</p>

                <li>If increasing proteostasis capacity does not confer resistance, the theory would be undermined.</li>
