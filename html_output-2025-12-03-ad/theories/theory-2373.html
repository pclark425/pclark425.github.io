                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Proteostatic Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each neuronal population in the visual cortex has a dynamic proteostatic threshold, determined by the balance between activity-driven protein production (including APP and tau) and the capacity for protein clearance. Selective vulnerability arises when activity or stress exceeds this threshold, leading to local amyloid-β and tau accumulation, while populations with lower activity or higher clearance capacity remain resistant.</p>

                <li>If boosting proteostasis does not protect high-activity neurons, the threshold model is called into question.</li>
