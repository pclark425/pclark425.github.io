                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that air pollution exposure triggers systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn induce epigenetic changes in both peripheral and central tissues. These epigenetic modifications amplify neuroinflammatory responses and promote amyloid-beta and tau pathology, creating a feed-forward loop that accelerates Alzheimer's disease progression.</p>
