                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Homeostatic Protection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that neuronal populations in the visual cortex that maintain robust homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in response to activity fluctuations are selectively resistant to amyloid-β and tau pathology. Conversely, populations with impaired or rigid homeostatic responses are more vulnerable, as they cannot adapt to early synaptic dysfunction or excitotoxic stress induced by Aβ/tau accumulation.</p>

                <li>Chronic visual deprivation (reducing activity fluctuations) will increase vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to pathology.</li>
                <li>Artificially inducing homeostatic plasticity in non-neuronal cells (e.g., glia) will confer resistance to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If populations with robust homeostatic plasticity are found to be highly vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If enhancing homeostatic plasticity does not confer resistance in experimental models, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If populations with impaired homeostatic plasticity remain resistant to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be undermined.</li>
