                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Projection‑Connectivity Vulnerability Hypothesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia while others remain resistant, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Neuronal populations that possess extensive long‑range corticocortical projection axons (e.g., supragranular layer III pyramidal cells, deep layer V projection neurons, and homologous excitatory neurons in Drosophila visual circuits) are selectively vulnerable to tau pathology. Their high metabolic demand, reliance on axonal transport, and position at network hubs facilitate trans‑synaptic spread of seed‑competent tau, leading to early neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) accumulation and cell loss.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If long‑range projection neurons in a mouse model are genetically engineered to reduce axonal transport efficiency, NFT accumulation in their downstream targets will be delayed compared with wild‑type controls.</li>
                <li>Selective chemogenetic silencing of layer III corticocortical neurons in early AD mice will reduce seed‑competent tau levels in synaptosomal fractions of downstream visual areas.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introducing a dominant‑negative form of the motor protein kinesin‑1 specifically in projection neurons will prevent tau spread but may cause unexpected neurodegeneration due to transport deficits, revealing a trade‑off between tau propagation and neuronal health.</li>
                <li>Enhancing retrograde transport of tau seeds via overexpression of dynein adaptor proteins could paradoxically accelerate NFT formation in distal cortical regions, providing insight into directionality of tau spread.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If long‑range projection neurons are ablated but NFT burden in downstream areas remains unchanged, the projection‑vulnerability hypothesis would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If synaptosomal tau seeding is absent despite high levels of axonal tau in projection neurons, the trans‑synaptic seeding law would be refuted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Layer IV spiny stellate neurons exhibit high amyloid plaque density yet low NFT burden, which is not explained by projection‑based vulnerability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8030.html#e8030.1" class="evidence-link">[e8030.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8116.html#e8116.1" class="evidence-link">[e8116.1]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
