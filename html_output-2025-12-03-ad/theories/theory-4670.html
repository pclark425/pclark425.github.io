                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is caused by a cascade of interacting molecular and cellular events (amyloid deposition, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction), which can be detected and staged using a combination of fluid, imaging, and functional biomarkers. The temporal sequence and interaction of these biomarkers, rather than any single marker, best predicts disease onset and progression.</p>
