                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4667</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Progression</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from a dynamic, multifactorial cascade involving genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, metabolic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and network-level brain vulnerability. Rather than a single initiating event, the model proposes that the convergence and temporal sequence of these factors trigger a self-amplifying cascade, leading to synaptic dysfunction, proteinopathy (amyloid and tau), and ultimately neurodegeneration. The model further asserts that the relative contribution and temporal order of these factors vary between individuals, accounting for clinical heterogeneity and variable biomarker trajectories.</p>

    <li>APOE4 and other genetic variants increase AD risk but are neither necessary nor sufficient for disease onset. </li>
    <li>Vascular, metabolic, and lifestyle factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, sleep disruption) modulate AD risk and progression. </li>
    <li>Neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunction are observed early in preclinical AD and can precede amyloid/tau pathology. </li>

                <li>Some individuals may develop AD in the absence of amyloid pathology if other cascade components (e.g., tau, inflammation) are sufficiently strong.</li>
                <li>Novel biomarkers reflecting cascade convergence (e.g., multi-omic signatures) will outperform single-modality biomarkers for early detection.</li>

                <li>If interventions targeting multiple cascade components are not more effective than single-target interventions, the model is called into question.</li>
                <li>If all individuals follow the same biomarker trajectory regardless of risk profile, the individualized trajectory law is invalid.</li>
