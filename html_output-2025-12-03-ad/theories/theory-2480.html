                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Network Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their participation in highly active, recurrent network motifs. Neurons that are central to recurrent excitatory loops or are frequently co-active with other vulnerable populations experience greater metabolic and synaptic stress, facilitating pathological protein aggregation and spread. Conversely, neurons with sparse activity or those embedded in feedforward, non-recurrent circuits are more resistant.</p>
