                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Connectivity Interaction Theory of Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the interaction between their network connectivity (especially projection patterns) and their metabolic demand. Neurons with high metabolic rates due to integrative or long-range connectivity are more susceptible to proteostatic stress and toxic protein accumulation, while those with low metabolic demand and local connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Reducing metabolic demand in hub or projection neurons (e.g., via pharmacological intervention) will decrease their vulnerability to amyloid/tau pathology.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If high-metabolic, long-range projection neurons are not more vulnerable than low-metabolic, local neurons, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If metabolic interventions do not alter vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>

    <li>Genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE4) may modulate vulnerability independently of metabolic or connectivity factors. </li>
