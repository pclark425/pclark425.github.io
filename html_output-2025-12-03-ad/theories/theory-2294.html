                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Proteostasis-Immunity Interaction Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of dynamic proteostasis (protein homeostasis) and neuroimmune interaction. The accumulation of misfolded proteins (amyloid-beta, tau) is not solely due to overproduction or impaired clearance, but results from a failure of adaptive proteostasis networks in the context of chronic, low-grade neuroinflammation. The interplay between proteostasis collapse and maladaptive immune responses creates a self-reinforcing cycle, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying dynamic shifts in proteostasis and immune markers, rather than static levels of amyloid or tau.</p>
