                <p><strong>Name:</strong> MicroRNA–Lipid Metabolism–Amyloid/Tau Regulatory Loop in AD with Dyslipidemia: Evolutionary Mismatch Hypothesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the regulatory loop between microRNAs (miRNAs), lipid metabolism, and amyloid/tau homeostasis in the brain evolved as a protective mechanism against infection and metabolic stress in ancestral environments. In modern contexts characterized by chronic dyslipidemia and high dietary fat intake, this loop becomes maladaptive, resulting in persistent miRNA and lipid dysregulation, chronic neuroinflammation, and the emergence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>

                <li>If high-fat diets do not alter miRNA or lipid profiles, or do not promote Aβ/tau pathology, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If populations with high dyslipidemia but low AD rates do not show the predicted miRNA-lipid-amyloid/tau changes, the evolutionary mismatch hypothesis is weakened.</li>
