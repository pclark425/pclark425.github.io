                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disruption of large-scale brain network integrity, driven by the interaction of amyloid-beta, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation. This network disruption precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and can be detected by multimodal imaging and network-based biomarkers.</p>
