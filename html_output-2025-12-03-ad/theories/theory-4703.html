                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the breakdown of large-scale brain network connectivity, driven by the convergence of multiple pathophysiological processes (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic stress). This network failure precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and can be detected by advanced neuroimaging and network analysis before overt neurodegeneration.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Multimodal imaging studies show that amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammation co-localize in brain network hubs and precede atrophy. </li>
    <li>Functional MRI and PET studies reveal early network dysfunction in preclinical AD, even before significant neuronal loss. </li>
