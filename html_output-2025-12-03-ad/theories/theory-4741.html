                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Interaction Theory of Connectivity-Metabolic Gradients in Visual Cortex Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from dynamic interactions between their evolving network connectivity and metabolic state over the lifespan. Neuronal populations that experience age-related increases in connectivity or metabolic demand, or that are positioned at the intersection of multiple functional networks, are at heightened risk due to cumulative stress and impaired proteostasis.</p>
