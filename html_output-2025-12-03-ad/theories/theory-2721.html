                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis and Immune Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined primarily by cell-intrinsic molecular programs governing proteostasis (protein homeostasis), lysosomal degradation, and innate immune signaling (notably NF-κB/Rel pathways). Neurons with lower expression of protein degradation machinery, higher basal innate immune activation, or specific synaptic/ion-transport gene signatures are more vulnerable, while those with robust proteostasis, efficient lysosomal degradation, and low innate immune activation are more resistant. This theory accounts for cell-type, laminar, and species differences, and explains exceptions to connectivity/metabolic models.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Enhancing proteostasis or lysosomal degradation in vulnerable neurons will reduce tau aggregation and neurodegeneration.</li>
                <li>Neuronal subtypes with high basal NF-κB/Rel activity in other brain regions will be more vulnerable to tau-induced degeneration.</li>
                <li>Knockdown of synaptic/ion-transport gene expression in SST+ CTIP2+ interneurons will reduce their vulnerability to tau aggregation.</li>
                <li>hiPSC-derived neurons from donors with higher expression of proteostasis genes will show lower tau aggregation after seeding.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating innate immune signaling (e.g., NF-κB inhibition) in human cortical neurons will alter their vulnerability to tau pathology in vivo.</li>
                <li>Engineering neurons to express a 'resistant' proteostasis signature will confer resistance to both amyloid-β and tau pathology in animal models.</li>
                <li>If a neuron subtype with high synaptic/ion-transport gene expression but robust proteostasis is found, its vulnerability will clarify the interplay of these factors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that neurons with low proteostasis gene expression are resistant to tau aggregation would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Finding that increasing lysosomal degradation does not reduce tau aggregation in vulnerable neurons would contradict the lysosomal law.</li>
                <li>Observing that NF-κB/Rel activity does not correlate with vulnerability in neuronal subtypes would challenge the immune signature law.</li>
                <li>Knockdown of synaptic/ion-transport genes in vulnerable interneurons does not alter tau aggregation.</li>
