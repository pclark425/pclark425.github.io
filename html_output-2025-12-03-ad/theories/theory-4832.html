                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by the unique composition and properties of their local cellular microenvironment. Factors such as glial cell density, extracellular matrix composition, vascularization, and local metabolic activity modulate the exposure and response of neurons to pathological protein aggregates.</p>

                <li>Artificially engineering the microenvironment (e.g., via biomaterials or gene therapy) will confer resistance to Aβ/tau pathology in otherwise vulnerable neurons.</li>
