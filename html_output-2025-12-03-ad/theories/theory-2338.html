                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2338</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Synergistic Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease results from the synergistic breakdown of neural network integrity due to the convergence of multiple pathological processes (amyloid, tau, vascular, metabolic, inflammatory, and synaptic dysfunction). The loss of network resilience, rather than any single pathology, is the proximate cause of cognitive decline. Detection should focus on network-level biomarkers (e.g., functional connectivity, network entropy) in combination with multi-domain molecular markers.</p>
