                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Collapse and Early Systemic Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where the brain's ability to maintain protein homeostasis collapses due to age, genetic, and environmental factors. This collapse leads to the accumulation of misfolded proteins (amyloid, tau, TDP-43, etc.), which can be detected systemically by identifying early proteostatic stress signatures in blood, CSF, or peripheral tissues, before overt brain pathology.</p>
