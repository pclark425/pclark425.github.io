                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disintegration of large-scale brain network connectivity, driven by the combined effects of amyloid deposition, tau pathology, vascular dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. The breakdown of network integrity precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and can be detected by advanced network-level biomarkers (e.g., functional connectivity MRI, EEG synchrony, connectomics).</p>
