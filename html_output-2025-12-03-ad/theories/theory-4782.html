                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular and genetic profiles. Neurons expressing higher levels of protective genes (e.g., those involved in proteostasis, antioxidant defense, or synaptic stability) are resistant, while those with higher expression of susceptibility genes (e.g., those promoting amyloid precursor protein processing, tau phosphorylation, or pro-apoptotic pathways) are vulnerable.</p>
