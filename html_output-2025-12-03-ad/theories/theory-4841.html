                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Topology and Local Homeostasis Theory for V1 Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance of V1 to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from its unique network topology—characterized by high local clustering, low long-range connectivity, and robust homeostatic plasticity mechanisms—which together limit the spread and amplification of pathological seeds and maintain synaptic integrity.</p>

                <li>If V1 is transplanted into a highly interconnected network, will it lose its resistance?</li>
                <li>Are there subpopulations within V1 with distinct network properties that show differential vulnerability?</li>
                <li>Can artificial enhancement of homeostatic plasticity in association cortex confer resistance similar to V1?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If V1 remains resistant despite disruption of network topology or homeostatic mechanisms, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If regions with similar topology and homeostasis do not show resistance, the theory is called into question.</li>
