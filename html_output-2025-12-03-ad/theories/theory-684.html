                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is primarily determined by their network connectivity patterns—specifically, the presence of long-range corticocortical projections, synaptic density, and integration within large-scale cortical networks. Neurons with extensive long-range projections and high synaptic integration are more susceptible to tau aggregation and subsequent degeneration, while neurons with predominantly local connectivity or lower synaptic integration are relatively resistant, especially in early disease stages. The spread of pathology is facilitated by trans-synaptic propagation of seed-competent tau and amyloid-β, with synaptic compartments serving as critical loci for early pathological seeding.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Neurons in other primary sensory cortices (e.g., primary auditory cortex) with predominantly local connectivity will show similar resistance to early tau and amyloid-β pathology as V1.</li>
                <li>Experimental induction of long-range projections in otherwise local neurons will increase their vulnerability to tau pathology in transgenic models.</li>
                <li>Regions with higher densities of long-range projection neurons will show earlier and more severe NFT accumulation in AD progression.</li>
                <li>Synaptic compartments in late-involved regions will show tau seeding activity before overt somatic pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially reducing synaptic density in visual association cortex neurons will delay or reduce tau seeding and NFT formation.</li>
                <li>Disrupting trans-synaptic signaling (e.g., via synaptic vesicle release inhibitors) will slow the spread of tau pathology into V1 in animal models.</li>
                <li>In individuals with congenital callosal agenesis (lacking major long-range projections), the progression of tau pathology into visual cortex will be delayed or altered.</li>
                <li>Enhancing local connectivity in association cortex neurons will confer resistance to tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with exclusively local connectivity develop NFTs and amyloid plaques as early or earlier than long-range projection neurons would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that synaptic tau seeding does not precede somatic tau pathology in V1 would challenge the synaptic seeding law.</li>
                <li>Observing that regions with high long-range connectivity are resistant to tau pathology would refute the projection vulnerability law.</li>
                <li>If primary visual cortex neurons with local connectivity show early and severe degeneration in the absence of long-range projections, the theory would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Compartment-specific vulnerability within single neurons (e.g., apical vs basal dendrites in L2/3 pyramidal neurons) is not fully explained by network connectivity alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6296.html#e6296.0" class="evidence-link">[e6296.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of molecular gene-expression programs (e.g., Wnt signaling) in resistance is not directly addressed by this theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6302.html#e6302.0" class="evidence-link">[e6302.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Functional impairment (e.g., reduced Arc induction) can occur in V1 neurons before overt cell loss, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond connectivity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6296.html#e6296.1" class="evidence-link">[e6296.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Occipital cortex resistance in some non-demented high-ADNC cases may relate to lower overall pathology burden and comorbidities, not just connectivity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6327.html#e6327.1" class="evidence-link">[e6327.1]</a> </li>
