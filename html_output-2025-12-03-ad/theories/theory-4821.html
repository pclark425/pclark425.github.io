                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability (General Formulation 2: Network-Integrated Signature)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the molecular signature concept by integrating the influence of a neuron's network context—its synaptic partners, activity patterns, and local circuit environment—into the definition of its 'intrinsic' signature. The theory posits that the combination of cell-intrinsic molecular features and network-derived molecular adaptations determines selective vulnerability or resistance to Aβ and tau pathology.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuronal activity and synaptic input modulate gene expression and proteostasis pathways relevant to Aβ/tau vulnerability. </li>
    <li>Neurons in highly interconnected hubs are more vulnerable to pathology, even with similar baseline molecular profiles. </li>
    <li>Activity-dependent transcriptional programs can alter stress response and protein homeostasis genes. </li>

                <li>If changes in network activity do not lead to changes in molecular signatures relevant to pathology, the theory would be called into question.</li>
