                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures—specifically, the expression profiles of genes and proteins related to synaptic function, stress response, and proteostasis. Populations with high expression of protective chaperones, antioxidant enzymes, and low expression of Aβ/tau receptors or aggregation-prone isoforms are resistant, while those with the opposite profile are vulnerable.</p>
