                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the integration of cell-intrinsic stress response capacity, network connectivity patterns, and local microenvironmental factors (e.g., glial state, vascularization). Neurons at the intersection of high synaptic input, low proteostatic capacity, and pro-inflammatory microenvironments are most vulnerable, while those with robust stress responses, sparse connectivity, and supportive glial/vascular niches are resistant.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially enhancing proteostatic capacity or anti-inflammatory glial states in highly connected neurons will confer resistance to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network connectivity in resistant populations will increase their vulnerability, even if intrinsic stress responses are intact.</li>
                <li>Selective ablation of pro-inflammatory glia in vulnerable regions will reduce local pathology.</li>
                <li>Overexpression of synaptic activity genes in resistant neurons will increase their vulnerability only if proteostatic and microenvironmental factors are also compromised.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly connected neurons with low proteostatic capacity in pro-inflammatory environments that remain resistant would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing vulnerable neurons in anti-inflammatory, well-vascularized microenvironments with robust stress responses would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that manipulation of only one factor (e.g., synaptic input) is sufficient to confer vulnerability or resistance, regardless of the other factors, would challenge the integration law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some deep-layer projection neurons are vulnerable despite moderate connectivity and stress response gene expression. </li>
    <li>Rare subtypes of interneurons show pathology in some AD models despite high chaperone expression. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior theory has formalized the multi-factorial integration as a conditional law for selective vulnerability.</p>
