                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Visual Cortex Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by a combination of their network connectivity (especially the presence of long-range corticocortical projections) and their regional/layer-specific metabolic phenotype (notably, reliance on aerobic glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation). Neurons with extensive long-range associative connectivity and high aerobic glycolysis are more vulnerable, while those with local connectivity and high oxidative metabolism are more resistant.</p>
