                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Threshold and Synergy Theory of Alzheimer's Disease Causation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that Alzheimer's disease is initiated when the cumulative burden of diverse risk factors—genetic, environmental, vascular, metabolic, and neuroinflammatory—crosses a critical threshold, at which point synergistic interactions among these factors drive the transition from preclinical to clinical disease. The model emphasizes the importance of both the number and the interaction strength of risk factors, and proposes that early detection should focus on identifying individuals nearing this threshold using composite risk and biomarker indices.</p>

    <li>Studies show that composite indices (e.g., combining APOE genotype, vascular risk, and lifestyle factors) predict AD conversion better than single risk factors. </li>
