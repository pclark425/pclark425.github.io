                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that a constellation of minimally invasive blood-based biomarkers—including plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau isoforms (p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231), neurofilament light (NfL), GFAP, and exosomal neuronal proteins—can collectively detect the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease with high sensitivity and specificity, rivaling or surpassing CSF and PET-based methods. The theory further proposes that the temporal sequence of changes in these markers reflects the underlying pathophysiological cascade, and that their combined use enables both early detection and staging of disease progression.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Blood biomarker panels will identify subtypes of AD with distinct biomarker trajectories (e.g., Aβ-first, tau-first, NfL-first), each with different clinical outcomes.</li>
                <li>Blood-based detection will enable population-level screening and early intervention, reducing the incidence of clinical AD.</li>

                <li>If the predicted temporal sequence of biomarker changes is not observed in longitudinal studies, the staging model would be undermined.</li>
