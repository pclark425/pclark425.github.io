                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Systemic Inflammation Theory of Alzheimer's Causation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the convergence of brain network disintegration (due to synaptic loss and connectivity breakdown) and chronic systemic inflammation, which together drive neurodegeneration. The interplay between peripheral immune activation and central neural network vulnerability explains both the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the variable progression of AD.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Synaptic loss and network disintegration precede overt neurodegeneration in AD. </li>
    <li>Chronic systemic inflammation (e.g., elevated CRP, cytokines) is associated with increased AD risk and faster progression. </li>
    <li>APOE4 carriers show greater vulnerability to network breakdown under inflammatory stress. </li>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows early loss of functional connectivity in AD-prone networks. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with high systemic inflammation do not show increased AD risk or network breakdown, the theory would be challenged.</li>
