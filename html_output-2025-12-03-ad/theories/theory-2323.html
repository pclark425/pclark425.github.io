                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and detection are fundamentally governed by the dynamic, bidirectional flux of molecular biomarkers—including proteins, metabolites, and immune mediators—between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral compartments (e.g., blood, lymph). The magnitude, directionality, and temporal patterns of this flux reflect underlying disease processes (such as amyloid/tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity) and can be leveraged for early, sensitive, and specific detection of AD through peripheral sampling, especially when measured dynamically or in response to physiological perturbations.</p>
