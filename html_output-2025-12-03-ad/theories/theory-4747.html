                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network-Environment Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the intersection of intrinsic neuronal properties, network connectivity (hubness, input/output balance), and the local microenvironment (glial, vascular, and immune factors). Neurons that are highly interconnected, metabolically active, and embedded in pro-inflammatory or poorly supported microenvironments are more vulnerable, while those with lower connectivity, robust stress responses, and supportive glial/vascular niches are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
