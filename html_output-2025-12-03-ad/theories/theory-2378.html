                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Selective Connectivity and Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their unique patterns of synaptic connectivity and activity-dependent metabolic demand. Neurons with high synaptic input/output, strong recurrent connectivity, or elevated baseline activity are more susceptible to Aβ/tau pathology due to increased metabolic stress, calcium influx, and local production of pathogenic proteins, while sparsely connected or less active neurons are more resistant.</p>
