                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit-Proteostasis Coupling Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the interplay between local circuit architecture (e.g., patterns of recurrent excitation and inhibition) and the intrinsic capacity of neurons to manage proteostatic stress. Neurons embedded in highly recurrent, metabolically demanding circuits are more likely to experience proteostatic overload, leading to increased aggregation of misfolded proteins.</p>
