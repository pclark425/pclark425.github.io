                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration Cascade Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of progressive large-scale brain network disintegration, triggered by the convergence of multiple molecular pathologies (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, etc.). The earliest and most sensitive marker of disease is the breakdown of functional and structural connectivity, which can be detected before overt molecular pathology or cognitive symptoms.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Network disintegration patterns may allow subtyping of AD into distinct progression trajectories, independent of amyloid/tau burden.</li>
                <li>Non-invasive network-based biomarkers (e.g., EEG-derived metrics) may outperform current molecular biomarkers in predicting AD onset in diverse populations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with clear network disintegration do not progress to AD or cognitive decline, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If AD can develop in the absence of any measurable network disintegration, the theory would be called into question.</li>
