                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their position and connectivity within large-scale neural networks. Neurons that are highly interconnected with other vulnerable regions or serve as network hubs are more likely to accumulate pathology due to trans-synaptic spread and increased exposure to pathogenic factors, while isolated or peripherally connected neurons are more resistant.</p>
