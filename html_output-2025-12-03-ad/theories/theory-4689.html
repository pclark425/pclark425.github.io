                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4689</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Vulnerability and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the selective vulnerability of specific brain networks to molecular insults (amyloid, tau, inflammation), with disease progression governed by the topology of these networks and the efficiency of pathological propagation along their connections. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level dysfunctions and molecular signatures before overt neurodegeneration.</p>
