                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease (AD) is driven by a self-amplifying feedback loop between impaired proteostasis (misfolded amyloid and tau) and chronic innate immune activation (microglia/astrocytes). The tipping point of this loop determines disease onset and progression. Effective detection is achieved by measuring dynamic markers of this loop in blood or CSF, rather than static levels of amyloid or tau.</p>

                <li>If AD can progress in the absence of any measurable loop activity, the theory would be called into question.</li>
