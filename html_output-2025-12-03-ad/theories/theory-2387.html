                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory: Activity-Dependent Propagation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is driven by their network connectivity in combination with their activity-dependent synaptic dynamics. Neurons with high synaptic activity and strong participation in recurrent excitatory loops are more likely to facilitate the trans-synaptic propagation of pathological proteins, while neurons with low activity and weak recurrent connectivity are more resistant.</p>
