                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Network-Activity Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability in the visual cortex arises from a hierarchical organization of network connectivity and activity gradients, where neurons at higher hierarchical levels (e.g., integrative hub neurons, layer 3/5 pyramidal cells) are more vulnerable due to their central role in information processing and higher metabolic burden. Lower-level, more peripheral neurons (e.g., local circuit interneurons, layer 4 spiny stellate cells) are more resistant. The theory integrates anatomical, functional, and metabolic hierarchies to explain the spatial and cell-type-specific patterns of pathology.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neurons at higher hierarchical levels (e.g., layer 3/5 pyramidal cells) will show earlier and more severe pathology than those at lower levels (e.g., layer 4 cells).</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality or activity of peripheral neurons will increase their vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Intermediate hierarchical levels will show intermediate vulnerability, potentially revealing non-linear effects.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons at high hierarchical levels and activity are not more vulnerable than those at low levels, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If peripheral, low-activity neurons show early pathology, the theory is called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Molecular or genetic factors conferring vulnerability independent of network hierarchy or activity. </li>
    <li>Influence of local microenvironment (e.g., glial cells, vasculature) not accounted for. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
