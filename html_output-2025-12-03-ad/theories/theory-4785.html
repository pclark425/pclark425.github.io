                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Vulnerability Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and connectivity within large-scale cortical and subcortical networks. Neurons that are highly interconnected, metabolically active, and serve as network hubs are more susceptible to proteopathic stress, while those with sparse connectivity and lower activity are more resistant.</p>

    <li>Highly connected hub neurons in the default mode network and visual cortex show early and severe pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual cortical neurons with the highest degree of network centrality will show the earliest and most severe amyloid and tau pathology in human and animal models.</li>
                <li>Reducing synaptic activity in hub neurons will decrease their vulnerability to amyloid and tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality of resistant neurons will render them more vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network connectivity in early disease may slow the spread of amyloid and tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly connected, active neurons do not show increased vulnerability, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If sparsely connected, low-activity neurons are equally or more vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with high connectivity remain resistant, suggesting additional molecular or local factors are involved. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
