                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: General Framework</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by each population's intrinsic molecular signature. This signature encompasses the baseline expression levels of genes and proteins involved in proteostasis, synaptic function, stress response, and metabolic regulation, which together modulate the cell's ability to cope with proteopathic stress.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Distinct neuronal subtypes in the cortex show unique transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, correlating with their susceptibility to neurodegeneration. </li>
    <li>Single-cell RNA-seq studies reveal that vulnerable neurons express lower levels of stress response and proteostasis genes compared to resistant neurons. </li>
    <li>Proteomic analyses of AD brains show that neurons with certain molecular signatures accumulate more Aβ and tau pathology. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has described subtype-specific vulnerability, this law formalizes the molecular signature as the central, predictive determinant.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that neuronal subtypes have distinct molecular profiles and that some are more vulnerable in AD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation that a cell's intrinsic molecular signature is the primary determinant of its vulnerability or resistance to Aβ/tau pathology is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neurons with robust proteostasis machinery (e.g., chaperones, ubiquitin-proteasome system) are less likely to accumulate misfolded proteins. </li>
    <li>Experimental upregulation of proteostasis genes in neurons reduces Aβ/tau-induced toxicity. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends known proteostasis concepts to a predictive, population-level framework for selective vulnerability.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Proteostasis impairment is implicated in neurodegeneration, and boosting proteostasis can be protective.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law that baseline proteostasis gene expression predicts resistance at the population level in the visual cortex is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual cortex neuronal populations with high baseline proteostasis gene expression will show less Aβ/tau pathology in AD models.</li>
                <li>Manipulating the molecular signature of a vulnerable neuronal population to resemble that of a resistant one will confer resistance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially engineering a novel molecular signature in neurons may create populations with unprecedented resistance or vulnerability to Aβ/tau.</li>
                <li>Some molecular signatures may confer resistance to Aβ but not tau, or vice versa, revealing dissociable mechanisms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with a 'resistant' molecular signature still develop Aβ/tau pathology at the same rate as 'vulnerable' ones, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If altering the molecular signature does not change vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The influence of extrinsic factors (e.g., microglial activity, vascular changes) is not directly addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory synthesizes and formalizes disparate findings into a predictive, testable model.</p>
