                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia while others remain resistant, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Neuronal subpopulations that express a coordinated set of protective genes (e.g., KCNIP4, canonical Wnt signaling, TGF‑β receptor pathways) and/or belong to calcium‑binding interneuron classes (Calbindin+, Calretinin+, GAD65/67+) maintain structural integrity and avoid NFT accumulation despite exposure to amyloid‑β plaques and soluble tau species.</p>
