                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Network-Metabolic Cascade Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the hierarchical organization of the visual cortex, combined with metabolic gradients, creates a cascade of vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology. Higher-order visual areas, which integrate information from multiple lower-order regions and have higher metabolic rates, are more vulnerable. Pathology propagates preferentially along hierarchical and metabolic gradients, explaining the spatial-temporal pattern of neurodegeneration.</p>
