                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Visual Cortex Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the intersection of their position along a gradient of network connectivity (from highly connected hub/bottleneck neurons to peripheral neurons) and their metabolic demand (from high to low). Neurons that are both highly connected and metabolically demanding are most susceptible to neurodegenerative pathology, while those with low connectivity and metabolic demand are most resistant. This framework integrates network neuroscience and cellular bioenergetics to explain regional and cell-type-specific patterns of pathology in dementia.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing metabolic demand in low-connectivity neurons will not increase vulnerability unless network connectivity is also increased.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network connectivity in high-metabolic neurons will reduce their vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If high-connectivity, high-metabolic neurons are not more vulnerable than other populations, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If low-connectivity, low-metabolic neurons show early pathology, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Non-neuronal cell types (e.g., astrocytes, microglia) that may influence vulnerability independently of neuronal connectivity or metabolism. </li>
    <li>Genetic factors (e.g., APOE genotype) that modulate vulnerability independently of network or metabolic status. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior theory has formalized the intersection of connectivity and metabolism as a gradient determining vulnerability.</p>
