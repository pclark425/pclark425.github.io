                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic Platelet-Neurodegeneration Feedback Loop</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that not only do platelet tau/Aβ signatures reflect CNS pathology, but that platelets themselves may participate in a feedback loop influencing neurodegeneration. Platelet-derived Aβ and tau, released into circulation, may cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or modulate neuroinflammation, thereby exacerbating or modulating central pathology. Thus, peripheral platelet activity is both a marker and a potential modulator of Alzheimer's disease progression.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Platelets are a major source of circulating Aβ, and can release tau under certain conditions. </li>
    <li>BBB permeability is increased in AD and aging, allowing peripheral proteins to access the CNS. </li>
    <li>Peripheral Aβ can seed amyloid deposition in the brain in animal models. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While peripheral-to-central protein transfer is known, the feedback loop involving platelets as both marker and modulator is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Peripheral Aβ can cross the BBB and seed amyloid in animal models; platelet activation is increased in AD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit feedback loop where platelet-derived tau/Aβ modulate CNS pathology is novel.</p>
