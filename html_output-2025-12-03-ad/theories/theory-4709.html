                <p><strong>Name:</strong> The Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis as a Driver of Regional and Temporal Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the spatial and temporal heterogeneity observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression is explained by region-specific air pollution exposure, which induces distinct epigenetic landscapes in different brain regions and at different life stages. These regionally and temporally patterned epigenetic changes modulate local vulnerability to amyloid and tau pathology, resulting in the observed diversity of clinical and neuropathological AD phenotypes.</p>
