                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2300</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of large-scale brain network disintegration, initiated by local molecular pathology (e.g., amyloid, tau) that propagates through synaptically connected networks. The spread of pathology follows the brain's functional and structural connectivity, leading to progressive cognitive and behavioral deficits. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level changes (e.g., via functional MRI, EEG, or digital cognitive mapping) that precede overt atrophy or clinical symptoms.</p>
