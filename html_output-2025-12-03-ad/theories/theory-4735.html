                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Cellular Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is primarily determined by intrinsic cellular properties, including proteostasis capacity, antioxidant defenses, and expression of specific molecular chaperones. Neurons with robust proteostatic and antioxidant systems are more resistant to toxic protein aggregation, while those with weaker intrinsic defenses are more vulnerable.</p>

            <ol>

            <ol>
