                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Stress Threshold Theory of Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each neuronal population in the visual cortex has a unique threshold for tolerating proteotoxic and inflammatory stress, determined by the balance of cell-intrinsic proteostasis and immune gene expression. Neurons with higher thresholds (due to robust proteostasis and anti-inflammatory signatures) are resistant to Aβ and tau pathology, while those with lower thresholds succumb earlier in dementia.</p>
