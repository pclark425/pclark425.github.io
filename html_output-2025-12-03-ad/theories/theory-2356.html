                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2356</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple, interacting disruptions in neural, vascular, immune, and metabolic networks, rather than from a single pathological trigger. The interplay between amyloid-beta, tau, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic impairment leads to a self-reinforcing cascade that ultimately results in neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Effective detection must therefore target network-level biomarkers and multi-modal signatures rather than single-molecule markers.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>AD brains show co-occurrence of amyloid plaques, tau tangles, neuroinflammation, vascular pathology, and metabolic dysfunction. </li>
    <li>Longitudinal studies show that these pathologies interact and accelerate each other's progression. </li>
    <li>Network-based analyses reveal that disruptions in one domain (e.g., vascular) can exacerbate others (e.g., amyloid accumulation, neuroinflammation). </li>
    <li>Therapeutic interventions targeting only one domain (e.g., anti-amyloid) have limited efficacy, suggesting multi-domain involvement. </li>
    <li>Metabolic impairment (e.g., glucose hypometabolism) is observed early and correlates with other pathologies. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While multi-factorial models exist, this law's explicit requirement for network-level, self-reinforcing interactions is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Existing theories recognize the roles of amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammation, and some acknowledge vascular and metabolic contributions.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the necessity of concurrent, interacting disruptions across multiple systems as the primary driver, rather than any single pathology.</p>
