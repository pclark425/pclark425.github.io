                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Defense Capacity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective resistance or vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the intrinsic capacity of each neuronal population to mount cellular defense responses, including proteostasis, autophagy, and antioxidant mechanisms. Neurons with robust defense systems are resistant, while those with impaired or overwhelmed systems are vulnerable.</p>
