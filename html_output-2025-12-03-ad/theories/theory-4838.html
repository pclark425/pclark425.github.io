                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Delayed Propagation and Synaptic Seeding Theory for V1 Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective resistance of certain neuronal populations in the primary visual cortex (V1) to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in dementia arises from two interrelated mechanisms: (1) delayed propagation of pathological protein aggregates due to unique network connectivity (notably, sparse recurrent excitation and dominant feedforward thalamic input), and (2) reduced synaptic seeding efficiency owing to a local molecular environment with low expression of aggregation-prone proteins and/or enhanced proteostatic mechanisms. Together, these features create a microenvironment in V1 that impedes both the spread and initial nucleation of Aβ and tau pathology, explaining the relative sparing of V1 in early and mid-stage dementia.</p>
