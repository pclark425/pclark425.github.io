                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration Cascade and Multimodal Early Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by a cascade of disruptions in large-scale brain network connectivity, triggered by subtle synaptic dysfunction and metabolic stress, which precede and drive classical protein aggregation. Early detection is possible by integrating multimodal measures of network disintegration (EEG, fMRI, MEG) with metabolic and synaptic biomarkers, providing a sensitive window before irreversible pathology.</p>
