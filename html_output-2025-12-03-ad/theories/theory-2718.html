                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis in Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that chronic exposure to fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5, NOx) induces specific epigenetic modifications (including DNA methylation, histone marks, RNA modifications, and non-coding RNAs) in both peripheral and central tissues. These epigenetic changes upregulate amyloidogenic and tau-phosphorylation pathways, promote neuroinflammation, and accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The axis is modulated by genetic susceptibility (e.g., APOE4) and is detectable via blood-based epigenetic and proteomic signatures. This mechanistic pathway provides a direct link between environmental exposure and molecular drivers of AD, and suggests new avenues for early detection and intervention.</p>

                <li>APOE4 carriers in high-pollution environments will show greater epigenetic dysregulation and higher rates of amyloid/tau pathology than non-carriers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Epigenetic editing (e.g., CRISPR-dCas9-Dnmt3a) targeting pollution-induced marks at APP or tau genes will prevent or reverse amyloid/tau pathology in exposed animal models and possibly in humans.</li>
                <li>Blood-based epigenetic signatures will serve as early, non-invasive predictors of AD risk in populations with high environmental exposure, independent of traditional genetic risk.</li>
                <li>Interventions targeting epigenetic modifications (e.g., histone deacetylase inhibitors) will reduce AD biomarker progression in pollution-exposed individuals.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with high pollution exposure do not show AD-relevant epigenetic changes or increased amyloid/tau pathology, the axis is falsified.</li>
                <li>If epigenetic editing does not alter amyloid/tau pathology in pollution-exposed models, the mechanistic link is challenged.</li>
                <li>If APOE4 carriers do not show increased susceptibility to pollution-induced epigenetic and pathological changes, the gene–environment interaction component is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AD cases in low-pollution environments with similar epigenetic changes, suggesting other sources of epigenetic dysregulation. </li>
    <li>Cases where AD develops in the absence of detectable epigenetic changes or pollution exposure, indicating alternative or parallel pathways. </li>
