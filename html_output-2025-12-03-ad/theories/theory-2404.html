                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles arises from intrinsic differences in molecular machinery governing proteostasis, stress response, and metabolic regulation. Neurons with more robust chaperone systems, autophagy, antioxidant defenses, and efficient protein turnover are more resistant to pathological aggregation, while those with weaker systems are more vulnerable.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially boosting antioxidant and proteostasis pathways in already resistant visual cortex neurons will further increase their resistance, possibly to a level where pathology is undetectable.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If visual cortex neurons with low proteostasis gene expression are found to be resistant to pathology, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If boosting chaperone expression in vulnerable neurons does not confer resistance in animal models, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If antioxidant gene expression does not correlate with resistance to amyloid-β and tau pathology in visual cortex neurons, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations with high proteostasis gene expression may still be vulnerable due to other factors (e.g., network activity, connectivity). </li>
    <li>Developmental or age-related changes in gene expression may alter vulnerability over time, which is not fully explained by intrinsic molecular resilience. </li>
