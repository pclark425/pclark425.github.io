                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Topology and Metabolic Stress Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and role within the cortical network, specifically their connectivity, metabolic demand, and access to neurovascular support. Highly connected hub neurons and those with high metabolic rates are more susceptible to proteopathic stress due to increased exposure to toxic species and greater energetic demands, while sparsely connected or metabolically efficient neurons are more resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neurons with strong neurovascular coupling and efficient energy use are less likely to accumulate amyloid-β and tau pathology. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law applies general neuroprotection principles to the specific context of visual cortex and proteopathic stress.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Neurovascular coupling and metabolic efficiency are known to protect against neurodegeneration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit conditional linking of these factors to resistance in visual cortex is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual cortical neurons with the highest degree of network connectivity and metabolic demand will show the earliest and most severe amyloid-β and tau pathology in animal models.</li>
                <li>Enhancing neurovascular support in vulnerable visual cortical regions will reduce the accumulation of amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the metabolic efficiency of hub neurons will confer resistance to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting neurovascular coupling in resistant neurons will render them vulnerable to proteopathic stress.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly connected, high-metabolic neurons do not develop pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If enhancing neurovascular support does not reduce pathology, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some sparsely connected or low-metabolic neurons still develop pathology, suggesting additional factors are involved. </li>
