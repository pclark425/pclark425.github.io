                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Vulnerability Shift Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is not static, but dynamically shifts along a connectivity-metabolic gradient in response to age, disease progression, and environmental factors. The gradient itself is plastic, and neurons may move along it, altering their risk profile over time.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Aging increases metabolic stress and alters network connectivity, correlating with increased AD pathology. </li>

    <li>Age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, and age-related changes in metabolism and connectivity are well documented. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The explicit mapping of age effects onto a dynamic gradient is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Aging is a risk factor for AD, and both metabolism and connectivity change with age.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law frames age-related changes as a shift along a specific vulnerability gradient, not just as independent risk factors.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Interventions that induce plasticity (e.g., optogenetic stimulation) in resistant neurons may inadvertently increase their vulnerability if they move up the gradient.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal imaging will reveal that the same neuronal population can change its vulnerability status over time in response to life events or interventions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If vulnerability remains fixed regardless of changes in metabolic demand or connectivity, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If age-related changes do not correlate with shifts in vulnerability or pathology, the theory would be called into question.</li>
