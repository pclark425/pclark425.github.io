                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (Specific 2: Synaptic-Activity-Linked Resilience)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This specific theory proposes that the selective resistance of certain visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is due to their ability to maintain synaptic activity-linked resilience programs. Neurons that sustain activity-dependent expression of neuroprotective genes (e.g., BDNF, Arc, synaptic scaffolding proteins) and maintain cohesive synaptic signaling networks are less susceptible to pathology, while those with impaired activity-dependent gene regulation are more vulnerable.</p>
