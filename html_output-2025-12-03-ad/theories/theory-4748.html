                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Load and Clearance Capacity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the balance between local proteostatic load (the rate of misfolded protein production and import) and the capacity for protein clearance (autophagy, proteasome activity, glymphatic flow). Neurons or regions with high proteostatic load and/or impaired clearance mechanisms are more vulnerable, while those with low load and efficient clearance are resistant.</p>
