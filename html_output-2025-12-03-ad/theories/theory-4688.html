                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Metabolic-Inflammatory Hypothesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is primarily driven by chronic metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation in the brain, which synergistically impair neuronal function, promote protein aggregation, and disrupt homeostatic clearance mechanisms. Early detection is possible by identifying metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers in blood, CSF, and advanced imaging, which precede classical amyloid/tau pathology.</p>
