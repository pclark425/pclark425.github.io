                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic-Peripheral Feedback Loop Theory in Alzheimer's Pathogenesis and Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is not solely a CNS disorder but involves a dynamic feedback loop between the brain and peripheral systems (immune, metabolic, vascular). Pathological changes in the brain induce peripheral responses (e.g., immune activation, metabolic shifts), which in turn modulate CNS pathology via circulating factors, creating a bidirectional loop. This loop is detectable through convergent peripheral biomarkers, which both reflect and influence disease progression.</p>
