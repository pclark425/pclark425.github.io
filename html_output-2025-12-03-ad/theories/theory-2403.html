                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Neuronal Subtype-Specific Stress Response and Metabolic Adaptation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective resistance of certain visual cortex neurons to Aβ/tau pathology is due to intrinsic differences in stress response pathways (e.g., antioxidant defenses, unfolded protein response) and metabolic adaptation (e.g., mitochondrial efficiency, glucose utilization). Neurons with robust stress responses and adaptive metabolism are less susceptible to Aβ/tau-induced dysfunction.</p>
