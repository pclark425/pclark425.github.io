                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature and Intrinsic Defense Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic molecular signatures, including expression of proteostasis-related genes, antioxidant defenses, and cell-surface receptors for Aβ/tau. Neurons with robust proteostasis, high antioxidant capacity, or low expression of Aβ/tau-binding receptors are resistant, while those lacking these features are vulnerable.</p>
