                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral-Accessible Biomarker Convergence Theory for Early Alzheimer's Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis involves a systemic convergence of molecular, cellular, and vascular changes that are reflected not only in the central nervous system (CNS) but also in peripheral tissues accessible for non-invasive biomarker detection. The convergence of these peripheral biomarkers—spanning blood, retina, olfactory epithelium, and other tissues—mirrors the underlying CNS pathology, enabling early, accurate, and scalable detection of AD before clinical symptoms manifest.</p>
