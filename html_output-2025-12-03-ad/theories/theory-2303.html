                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Progression (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from a dynamic, multifactorial cascade involving genetic, molecular, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The interplay of these factors initiates a sequence of pathophysiological events—amyloid and tau pathology, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and network disintegration—that evolve over time and interact with individual-specific modifiers (e.g., cognitive reserve, vascular health). The model asserts that the temporal evolution and interaction of these cascades produce unique, time-varying biomarker signatures, and that effective detection and intervention require adaptive, multi-modal, and temporally-resolved approaches.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Novel combinations of risk factors (e.g., specific gene-environment interactions) will define previously unrecognized AD subtypes with distinct biomarker and clinical profiles.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with high genetic and environmental risk do not develop early molecular pathology, the multifactorial initiation law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If modifying factors do not influence the rate or pattern of progression, the cascade amplification/divergence law is falsified.</li>
