                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Combining plasma protein panels (including lysosomal, inflammatory, and tau-related markers), plasma p‑tau217, amyloid PET, and structural MRI yields higher predictive accuracy for preclinical AD than any single modality, reflecting complementary pathophysiological processes (amyloid accumulation, tau propagation, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration).</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Targeted reduction of lysosomal protein release (e.g., via autophagy enhancers) will lower exosomal cathepsin D levels and delay amyloid PET conversion, but the magnitude of delay is uncertain.</li>
                <li>In individuals with primary tauopathies (e.g., PSP) without amyloid pathology, the lysosomal exosome panel will remain normal, providing a differential diagnostic tool.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a large, well‑powered cohort shows no improvement in AUC when adding the lysosomal exosome panel to plasma p‑tau217 and MRI, the multimodal integration claim is falsified.</li>
                <li>If plasma IL‑12p70 and IFN‑γ levels do not predict faster tau PET progression after adjusting for age, APOE4, and baseline amyloid, the inflammation‑tau link is weakened.</li>
