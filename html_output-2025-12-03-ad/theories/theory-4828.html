                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Microenvironmental Modulation of Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the local microenvironment, including glial cell states, vascular features, and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. These factors create spatially heterogeneous microdomains that modulate neuronal stress responses, proteostasis, and exposure to pathological proteins.</p>
