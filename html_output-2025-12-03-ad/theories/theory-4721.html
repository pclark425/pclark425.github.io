                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4721</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the failure of interconnected neural, vascular, and immune networks, where disruptions in one system propagate dysfunction across others, leading to progressive neurodegeneration. Detection is most effective when multi-modal network-level biomarkers are assessed, capturing early breakdowns in connectivity, perfusion, and immune regulation.</p>

                <li>Restoring immune regulation alone (e.g., via microglial modulation) may be sufficient to halt network failure and prevent AD, even if neural or vascular dysfunction is present.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with multi-system network dysfunction do not develop AD, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If AD can develop in the absence of any detectable network-level dysfunction, the theory would be called into question.</li>
