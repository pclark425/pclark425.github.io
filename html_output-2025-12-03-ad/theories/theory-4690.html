                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by a convergence of molecular insults (amyloid, tau, vascular dysfunction) that trigger a self-amplifying inflammatory cascade, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying molecular and inflammatory biomarkers in blood, CSF, and advanced imaging before clinical symptoms.</p>
