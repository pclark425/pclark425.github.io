                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature-Driven Selective Vulnerability Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular expression profiles, including cell-surface receptors, proteostasis-related genes, and synaptic protein composition. Neurons expressing higher levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau, or specific receptors facilitating Aβ/tau uptake, and with lower expression of protective chaperones or autophagy genes, are more susceptible to pathology. Conversely, populations with molecular signatures favoring efficient clearance and reduced aggregation are resistant.</p>
