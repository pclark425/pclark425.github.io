                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral-Accessible Biomarker Convergence Theory for Early Alzheimer's Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis involves a convergence of central and peripheral pathological processes, such that early molecular and cellular changes in the brain are mirrored by specific, detectable alterations in peripheral tissues and fluids. These peripheral-accessible biomarkers (PABs) arise from bidirectional signaling between the CNS and peripheral systems (immune, metabolic, vascular), and their convergence across multiple biological axes (e.g., proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic) enables sensitive and specific early detection of Alzheimer's disease before overt clinical symptoms or advanced neuropathology.</p>
