                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is determined by their network connectivity patterns—specifically, the nature and extent of their projections (local vs. long-range, feedforward vs. feedback)—and the resulting exposure to pathological protein spread and metabolic stress. Neurons with extensive, integrative, or hub-like connectivity, especially those forming long-range projections, are more susceptible to proteopathic stress due to increased exposure to trans-synaptic propagation of amyloid and tau, as well as higher metabolic demands. Conversely, neurons with local, restricted connectivity are more resistant due to limited exposure and lower metabolic burden.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Amyloid-β and tau can propagate trans-synaptically along axonal projections, with hub neurons showing greater pathology in both animal models and human postmortem studies. </li>
    <li>Layer 5 pyramidal neurons, which have long-range projections, are more vulnerable to tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
