                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Stress-Response Thresholds Dictate Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by intrinsic differences in their cellular stress-response thresholds. Neurons with lower thresholds for oxidative, proteostatic, or metabolic stress succumb earlier to pathological protein accumulation, while those with robust stress-response machinery (e.g., high expression of chaperones, antioxidants, or autophagy genes) resist pathology even in the presence of Aβ and tau.</p>
