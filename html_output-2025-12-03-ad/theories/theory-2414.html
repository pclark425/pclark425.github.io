                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (General Formulation 1: Integrated Molecular Defense Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is determined by the intrinsic molecular resilience of each population, defined by the cohesiveness and integration of their proteostasis, stress response, and synaptic maintenance pathways. Neurons with highly integrated and cross-communicating molecular defense networks can more effectively buffer and adapt to proteotoxic insults, while those with fragmented or weakly connected pathways are more susceptible to collapse and degeneration.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pharmacological or genetic interventions that enhance pathway cohesiveness will confer resistance to Aβ and tau pathology in human neurons.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing cross-talk between defense pathways in vulnerable neurons will reverse or halt degeneration.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with highly cohesive defense networks are not more resistant to Aβ and tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing pathway fragmentation does not increase vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>

    <li>The role of cell-extrinsic factors (e.g., glial support, vascular supply) is not directly addressed. </li>
