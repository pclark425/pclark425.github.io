                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit-Activity-Driven Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that neuronal populations within the visual cortex that participate in highly recurrent excitatory circuits, especially those with strong local and long-range connectivity, are selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology. The vulnerability arises from activity-dependent uptake and propagation of pathological proteins, as well as increased metabolic and proteostatic stress. The theory integrates circuit-level motifs and connectivity patterns as predictive factors for selective vulnerability.</p>
