                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their network connectivity and patterns of activity-dependent signaling. Highly interconnected and metabolically active populations are more susceptible to Aβ/tau pathology due to increased synaptic activity, excitatory neurotransmission, and associated metabolic stress, while sparsely connected or less active populations are relatively resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing connectivity or activity in resistant populations will render them vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If highly connected or active populations are found to be resistant to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If reducing activity does not reduce pathology in vulnerable populations, the theory would be called into question.</li>
