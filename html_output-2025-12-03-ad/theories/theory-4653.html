                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of progressive large-scale brain network disintegration, where molecular pathologies (amyloid, tau, inflammation) are secondary to, or amplified by, the breakdown of functional and structural connectivity. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level disruptions before overt molecular or cognitive symptoms.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>Longitudinal fMRI and DTI studies show network disruption (e.g., default mode network) precedes amyloid/tau accumulation and cognitive decline. </li>

                <li>Network-based digital biomarkers (e.g., from wearable EEG) will outperform all current fluid or imaging biomarkers in predicting AD conversion.</li>
                <li>Network disintegration patterns will predict specific cognitive symptom profiles before clinical onset.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with normal network connectivity but high amyloid/tau burden develop AD at the same rate as those with network disruption, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If network disruption is not detectable before molecular pathology, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If interventions that restore network connectivity do not alter AD risk or progression, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases of familial AD with early, aggressive molecular pathology may not fit the network-first model. </li>
    <li>Some individuals with network disruption do not progress to AD, suggesting additional factors are involved. </li>
