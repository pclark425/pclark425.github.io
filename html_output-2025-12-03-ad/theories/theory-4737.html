                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit-Activity-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their intrinsic and network-level activity patterns. Neuronal populations with high baseline activity, synchronous firing, or specific oscillatory dynamics are more prone to pathological protein aggregation due to increased metabolic demand, calcium influx, and local microenvironmental changes, while populations with lower or more asynchronous activity are more resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuronal populations with high firing rates show increased metabolic stress and are more likely to accumulate Aβ and tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Regions with high activity (e.g., default mode network) are early sites of pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Increased calcium influx and oxidative stress in active neurons promote protein misfolding and aggregation. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to known observations, the explicit conditional law at the population level is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> High activity regions are known to be early sites of pathology, but the direct link to selective vulnerability at the population level is not formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the conditional relationship between intrinsic activity and vulnerability at the neuronal population level.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The explicit conditional relationship is not formalized in prior theories.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Oscillatory synchrony is implicated in network dysfunction in dementia.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes synchrony as a determinant of selective vulnerability.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Reducing baseline activity in vulnerable neuronal populations will decrease their susceptibility to Aβ and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing activity in resistant populations will render them more vulnerable to pathology.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Modulating oscillatory synchrony without changing mean firing rates will alter vulnerability profiles.</li>
                <li>Interventions that desynchronize network activity will confer resistance to otherwise vulnerable populations.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly active neuronal populations that remain resistant to pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing vulnerable populations with low activity or low synchrony would contradict the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations are vulnerable despite low activity, possibly due to extrinsic factors such as local glial environment or molecular expression profiles. </li>
