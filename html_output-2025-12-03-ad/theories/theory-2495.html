                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Selective Synaptic Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resilience of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology in dementia is governed by intrinsic molecular programs that regulate cellular stress responses, synaptic maintenance, and proteostasis. Neurons with robust expression of genes involved in antioxidant defense, protein quality control, and synaptic plasticity are intrinsically more resilient, while those with lower expression of these protective factors are selectively vulnerable to Aβ/tau-induced degeneration.</p>
