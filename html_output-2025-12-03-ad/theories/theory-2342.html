                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2342</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Threshold Theory of Alzheimer's Disease Onset</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease develops when the cumulative burden of multiple risk factors (genetic, molecular, metabolic, environmental) surpasses a critical threshold, triggering a self-reinforcing cascade of neurodegeneration. The threshold is modulated by individual resilience factors (cognitive reserve, neuroplasticity, lifestyle), and detection is optimized by integrating multi-modal biomarker panels that reflect the total risk burden.</p>
