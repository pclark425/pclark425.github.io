                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bidirectional Feedback Model of Gut Microbiota–Neuroinflammation–Vascular Axis in AD</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the gut microbiota, neuroinflammation, and vascular integrity form a dynamic, bidirectional feedback loop in Alzheimer's disease. Perturbations in any one component (e.g., gut dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, or vascular dysfunction) can propagate through the axis, amplifying pathological changes and accelerating disease progression. The model predicts that interventions at any node can modulate the entire axis, offering multiple points for detection and therapeutic intervention.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Gut dysbiosis is associated with increased neuroinflammation in animal models and human studies. </li>
    <li>Altered gut microbiota composition leads to increased peripheral and central immune activation, as shown by elevated cytokines and microglial activation in AD models. </li>
