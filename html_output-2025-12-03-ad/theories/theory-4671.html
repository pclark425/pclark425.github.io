                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Effective detection of Alzheimer's disease requires integrating peripheral (blood, exosome, immune) and central (CSF, imaging) biomarkers, as early pathological changes are reflected in both compartments. The dynamic interplay between peripheral and central signals enables earlier, more accurate, and less invasive detection than central markers alone.</p>
