                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the breakdown of large-scale neural network homeostasis, driven by the convergence of multiple stressors (genetic, metabolic, inflammatory, and proteostatic) that disrupt synaptic connectivity and information flow. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level dysfunction through advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological biomarkers.</p>
