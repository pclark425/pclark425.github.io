                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory (Metabolic-Stress Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is mediated by the metabolic demands imposed by their network connectivity. Neurons with extensive, energetically costly connections (e.g., long-range projections, high synaptic throughput) are more susceptible to metabolic stress, which synergizes with Aβ and tau toxicity to drive degeneration.</p>
