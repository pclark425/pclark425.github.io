                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: General Framework</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures. These signatures encompass the expression levels of genes and proteins related to proteostasis, calcium buffering, oxidative stress response, synaptic activity, and the baseline abundance of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau (MAPT). The interplay of these molecular features dictates each population's susceptibility to protein aggregation, metabolic stress, and neurodegeneration.</p>
