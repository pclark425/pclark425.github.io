                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Proteostatic Stress Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their baseline and stimulus-driven activity levels, which modulate proteostatic load, synaptic turnover, and metabolic stress. Neuronal populations with high sustained activity or plasticity are more prone to proteostatic failure and subsequent pathology, while those with lower activity or robust homeostatic mechanisms are more resistant.</p>
