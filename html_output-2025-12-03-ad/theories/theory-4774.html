                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Proteostatic and Lipidomic Determinants</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic molecular signatures related to proteostasis (protein homeostasis) and lipid composition. Neurons with limited proteostatic capacity (e.g., low chaperone expression, impaired autophagy) and specific lipidomic profiles (e.g., high cholesterol, unsaturated fatty acids) are more susceptible to protein aggregation and membrane disruption, while neurons with robust proteostatic machinery and protective lipid environments are resistant.</p>
