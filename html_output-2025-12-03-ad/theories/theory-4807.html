                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is primarily driven by the degree to which their network connectivity imposes chronic metabolic stress, leading to increased susceptibility to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration.</p>
