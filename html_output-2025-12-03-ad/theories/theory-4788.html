                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Metabolic Phenotype Theory (Homeostatic Stress Integration)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the integration of network-driven synaptic stress and the capacity for metabolic homeostasis. Neurons that are both highly interconnected (serving as information relays or integrators) and have limited ability to buffer metabolic stress (e.g., low mitochondrial reserve, poor calcium handling) are most susceptible to protein aggregation and degeneration. Conversely, neurons with either low network stress or robust homeostatic mechanisms are relatively protected.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual cortex neurons with high synaptic input and low metabolic homeostasis will show early amyloid and tau pathology in both human and animal models.</li>
                <li>Enhancing metabolic homeostasis in highly interconnected neurons will delay or prevent the onset of protein aggregation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing synaptic input to metabolically robust neurons will not increase their vulnerability unless homeostatic capacity is simultaneously reduced.</li>
                <li>Selective knockdown of homeostatic genes in low-input neurons will not increase their vulnerability unless synaptic input is also increased.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high synaptic input and low homeostatic capacity are not more vulnerable to amyloid and tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If neurons with high homeostatic capacity are not protected despite high synaptic input, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The influence of non-neuronal cells (astrocytes, microglia) and their metabolic support is not directly addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
