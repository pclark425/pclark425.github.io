                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Progression</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is initiated and progresses through a multifactorial cascade involving the interplay of genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, vascular/metabolic dysfunction, and age-related proteostatic decline. The model asserts that these factors interact nonlinearly to trigger a self-amplifying cascade of molecular, cellular, and network-level dysfunction, ultimately leading to clinical dementia. The cascade is characterized by threshold effects, feedback loops, and temporal heterogeneity, and predicts that effective detection and intervention require multi-modal, longitudinal biomarker integration.</p>

    <li>APOE4 and TREM2 variants increase AD risk; environmental and vascular risk factors independently and synergistically increase AD incidence; proteostasis declines with age, increasing protein aggregation. </li>
    <li>Epidemiological studies show that combinations of genetic and lifestyle risk factors have multiplicative effects on AD risk. </li>
