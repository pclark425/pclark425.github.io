                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by each population's intrinsic molecular signature. This signature encompasses the expression levels of genes and proteins involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, tau phosphorylation, proteostasis (autophagy, chaperones), calcium homeostasis, and synaptic receptor composition. Neurons with a molecular profile favoring high production/aggregation and low clearance of toxic proteins, and with heightened susceptibility to calcium-mediated toxicity, are more vulnerable, while those with protective molecular features are more resistant.</p>

    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics and proteomics reveal that vulnerable neurons express higher levels of APP, BACE1, and tau, and lower levels of autophagy and chaperone genes. </li>
    <li>Vulnerable neurons show increased calcium-permeable AMPA/NMDA receptor expression, predisposing to excitotoxicity and tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Resistant neurons (e.g., certain interneurons) have low APP/tau and high proteostasis gene expression. </li>
