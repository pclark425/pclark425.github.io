                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Metabolic-Connectivity Vulnerability Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the intersection of high intrinsic metabolic demand, dense synaptic connectivity (especially as network hubs), and insufficient local support from glia, vasculature, and proteostatic mechanisms. Neurons that are highly active, densely connected, and metabolically demanding, but lack robust local support, are most susceptible to Aβ/tau-induced dysfunction and degeneration.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly active, densely connected neurons (e.g., layer II/III pyramidal cells) show early degeneration in Alzheimer's models. </li>
    <li>Neurons with high metabolic rates are more susceptible to oxidative stress and proteostatic failure. </li>
    <li>Regions with less robust glial/vascular support show greater pathology in postmortem studies. </li>
    <li>Visual cortex neurons with high firing rates and extensive dendritic arbors are more likely to accumulate amyloid-β and tau. </li>
    <li>Proteostatic mechanisms (e.g., autophagy, chaperone expression) are less active in certain visual cortical layers, correlating with increased pathology. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While each factor has been studied individually, their explicit intersection as a necessary condition for vulnerability is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Previous work has linked metabolic demand and synaptic activity to vulnerability, and some studies have noted the importance of glial/vascular support.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law integrates these factors into a multi-dimensional conditional, emphasizing their intersection as the key determinant of vulnerability.</p>
