                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Metabolic Phenotype Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their network connectivity (especially long-range corticocortical projections) and regional metabolic phenotype (notably, reliance on aerobic glycolysis versus oxidative phosphorylation). Neurons with extensive long-range connections and high aerobic glycolysis are more vulnerable, while those with local connectivity and high oxidative metabolism are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neurons with more extensive long-range corticocortical projections in other cortical regions will be more vulnerable to tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Regions with higher aerobic glycolysis (e.g., DMN) will show greater amyloid-β accumulation than regions with high oxidative metabolism (e.g., V1).</li>
                <li>Regions downstream in the Braak pathway will develop tau pathology later than upstream regions, even if their intrinsic molecular signatures are similar.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing aerobic glycolysis in V1 will increase its vulnerability to amyloid-β deposition.</li>
                <li>Forcing long-range projections from V1 neurons will render them more vulnerable to tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network connectivity (e.g., via lesions) will alter the regional sequence of tau pathology propagation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with extensive long-range projections are resistant to tau pathology would challenge the connectivity law.</li>
                <li>Observing high amyloid-β accumulation in regions with low aerobic glycolysis would contradict the metabolic phenotype law.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that V1 develops tau pathology before upstream visual association cortex would challenge the network propagation law.</li>
