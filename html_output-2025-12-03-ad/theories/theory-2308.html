                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Systemic Vulnerability Model of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disintegration of large-scale brain networks due to the convergence of molecular pathology (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation), systemic metabolic/vascular stress, and impaired neural resilience. The model asserts that network-level dysfunction precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and that systemic factors (e.g., peripheral inflammation, metabolic syndrome) modulate both vulnerability and progression. Detection is optimized by integrating network-level neuroimaging, systemic biomarkers, and digital phenotyping.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Novel systemic biomarkers (e.g., gut microbiome metabolites) will predict network vulnerability and AD progression.</li>
                <li>Restoring network integrity via neuromodulation will delay or reverse clinical symptoms in some individuals.</li>
                <li>Digital phenotyping of network-level dysfunction (e.g., speech, gait, sleep) will enable remote, preclinical detection.</li>

                <li>If network disruption does not precede clinical symptoms, the network vulnerability law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If interventions targeting systemic factors do not slow network degeneration, the model is challenged.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
