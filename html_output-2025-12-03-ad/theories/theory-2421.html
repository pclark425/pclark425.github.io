                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their patterns of synaptic activity, network connectivity, and exposure to excitatory/inhibitory balance. Neurons with high synaptic activity, extensive long-range connectivity, or high metabolic demand are more exposed to toxic species and stress, increasing vulnerability, while neurons with lower activity or more local, inhibitory connections are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly active excitatory neurons do not accumulate more Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If inhibitory neurons with high local connectivity become vulnerable without increased activity, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If reducing synaptic activity in vulnerable neurons does not reduce pathology, the theory would be undermined.</li>
