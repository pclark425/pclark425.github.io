                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Selective Synaptic Vulnerability Network Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their synaptic connectivity patterns and network integration. Neurons with high synaptic activity, extensive long-range connections, or specific input/output motifs are more susceptible to toxic protein spread and synaptic dysfunction, while neurons with more isolated or resilient network positions are protected.</p>
