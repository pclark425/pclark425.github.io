                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Collapse and Cellular Senescence Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is driven by a collapse in proteostasis (the cellular machinery for protein folding, degradation, and clearance), which triggers cellular senescence and a pro-inflammatory environment. Early detection is possible by identifying proteostatic stress markers and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors in peripheral fluids and CNS.</p>
