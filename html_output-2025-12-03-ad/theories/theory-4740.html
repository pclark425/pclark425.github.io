                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Connectivity-Metabolic Interaction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is not static, but dynamically modulated by changes in connectivity and metabolic demand over time. Activity-dependent plasticity, experience, and disease progression can shift the connectivity-metabolic landscape, altering which neuronal populations become vulnerable or resistant at different disease stages.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially inducing plasticity in resistant regions may render them vulnerable, and vice versa.</li>
                <li>The effect of transient versus chronic changes in activity on long-term vulnerability is unknown.</li>
                <li>Interactions between plasticity, inflammation, and protein aggregation may produce unexpected patterns of vulnerability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If activity or metabolic changes do not alter vulnerability in visual cortex, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If regions with stable connectivity/metabolism show shifting vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Genetic or molecular factors that fix vulnerability independent of activity or metabolism. </li>
    <li>Non-neuronal cell types (e.g., astrocytes, microglia) may modulate vulnerability independently. </li>
