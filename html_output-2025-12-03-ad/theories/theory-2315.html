                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2315</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the convergence of multiple, interacting network disruptions—genetic, metabolic, vascular, and immune—leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and proteinopathy. The disease is not caused by a single factor (e.g., amyloid or tau), but by the breakdown of homeostatic resilience in neural networks, with different initiating events in different individuals. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level dysfunctions through multimodal biomarkers.</p>
