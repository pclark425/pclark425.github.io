                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Detection (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that effective detection of Alzheimer's disease requires a multi-modal, temporally-resolved approach that integrates genetic, molecular, imaging, and digital phenotyping data. The model posits that the dynamic interplay of risk factors and pathologies produces unique, time-varying biomarker signatures that can be detected before clinical symptoms arise. It further proposes that the optimal detection strategy is adaptive, leveraging machine learning to identify individual-specific trajectories and inflection points in the cascade.</p>
