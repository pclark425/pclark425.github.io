                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from a cascade of disruptions in large-scale brain network connectivity, initiated by multifactorial insults (genetic, metabolic, vascular, inflammatory), which precede and drive classical proteinopathies (amyloid, tau). Early detection is possible by identifying network-level dysfunction via advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological biomarkers, which manifest before overt molecular pathology.</p>
