                <p><strong>Name:</strong> IDPD-AD: Digital Gait Variability as an Early Marker of Network-Pathobiological Interaction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that increased digital gait variability (e.g., stride-to-stride fluctuations, turning irregularities) is an early, quantifiable marker of Alzheimer's disease, reflecting the interaction between pathobiological changes (especially in the medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia) and large-scale motor-cognitive networks. Digital gait analysis, when combined with pathobiological markers, enables detection and staging of AD before overt cognitive symptoms.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Gait variability is increased in early AD and correlates with medial temporal lobe atrophy. </li>
    <li>Wearable sensor studies show digital gait metrics can detect preclinical AD. </li>
    <li>Gait variability is associated with cognitive decline and AD risk. </li>
    <li>Gait phenotype changes from mild cognitive impairment to moderate dementia, with increased variability and irregularity. </li>
    <li>Digital gait analysis enables quantification of subtle motor-cognitive network dysfunction before overt symptoms. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While gait analysis and digital biomarkers are used, the explicit, quantitative law integrating digital gait variability and biological data for early AD prediction is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Gait variability is associated with cognitive decline and AD risk, and digital gait analysis is being explored for early detection.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law that digital gait variability, when combined with specific pathobiological changes, quantitatively predicts progression risk to MCI/AD is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Individuals with increased digital gait variability and early pathobiological changes will progress to MCI/AD at higher rates than those with only one abnormality.</li>
                <li>Gait variability metrics will correlate with medial temporal lobe and basal ganglia atrophy on imaging.</li>
                <li>Digital gait analysis will enable earlier detection of AD than traditional clinical assessments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel gait features (e.g., micro-turning, dual-task gait) will further improve prediction of AD risk.</li>
                <li>Some individuals with abnormal gait but negative biomarkers may represent a new AD subtype or a different neurodegenerative process.</li>
                <li>Interventions targeting gait variability (e.g., physical therapy, neuromodulation) may delay progression to AD.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If digital gait variability does not predict progression to AD, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If gait metrics do not correlate with pathobiological changes, the law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If combining gait and biomarker data does not improve prediction, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gait variability may be influenced by non-AD factors (e.g., musculoskeletal disease, medications). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory formalizes a specific, quantitative relationship not previously established.</p>
