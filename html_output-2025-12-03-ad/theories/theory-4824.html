                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Transcriptional and Proteomic Landscape</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures—specifically, their unique transcriptional and proteomic profiles. These signatures encompass the expression of genes and proteins involved in synaptic function, proteostasis, stress response, and metabolic regulation, which collectively modulate susceptibility to proteopathic stress.</p>
