                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Collapse Cascade Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by a collapse in neuronal proteostasis, leading to a self-amplifying cascade of amyloid-beta and tau misfolding, which propagates through prion-like mechanisms and triggers secondary neuroinflammatory and synaptic dysfunction. Early detection is possible by identifying molecular signatures of proteostatic stress and misfolded protein spread.</p>
