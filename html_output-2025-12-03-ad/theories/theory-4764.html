                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Excitotoxicity Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by a gradient of metabolic demand and excitotoxic stress. Neurons with high baseline metabolic rates and glutamatergic signaling are more susceptible to oxidative damage and calcium dysregulation, which synergize with amyloid-β and tau to drive degeneration. Conversely, neurons with lower metabolic rates or enhanced antioxidant defenses are more resistant.</p>

    <li>Some resistant neuronal populations may not express high antioxidant or calcium buffering genes, suggesting other protective mechanisms. </li>
