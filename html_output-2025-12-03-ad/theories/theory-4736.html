                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4736</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their position and connectivity within large-scale cortical networks. Highly interconnected hub neurons or populations with extensive long-range connections are more susceptible to the spread and accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, while sparsely connected or peripherally located populations are more resistant.</p>
