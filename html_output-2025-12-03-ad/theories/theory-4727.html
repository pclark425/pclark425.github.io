                <p><strong>Name:</strong> MicroRNA–Lipid Metabolism–Amyloid/Tau Regulatory Loop in AD with Dyslipidemia</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that a regulatory loop involving microRNAs (notably miR-33, miR-34a, and miR-132), lipid metabolism (especially cholesterol and ceramide homeostasis), and amyloid/tau pathology underlies the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in individuals with dyslipidemia. Dysregulated lipid metabolism alters microRNA expression, which in turn modulates key lipid transporters and enzymes, shifting APP processing toward amyloidogenic pathways and promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Amyloid and tau pathology further disrupt microRNA and lipid homeostasis, creating a self-reinforcing pathogenic cycle. This loop is hypothesized to be both a cause and a biomarker source for AD, especially in the context of metabolic syndrome or dyslipidemia.</p>
