                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis in Alzheimer's Disease: Environmental-Epigenetic Cascade Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that chronic exposure to air pollution initiates a cascade of epigenetic modifications in the central nervous system and periphery, which dysregulate gene expression related to amyloid and tau metabolism, neuroinflammation, and synaptic function. These epigenetic changes act as a mechanistic bridge between environmental insults and the molecular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), leading to increased amyloid-beta and tau pathology, and ultimately neurodegeneration.</p>
