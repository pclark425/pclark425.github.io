                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Activity-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their patterns of network activity. Neurons with high baseline activity, frequent bursting, or strong synaptic drive are more prone to Aβ/tau aggregation due to increased metabolic demand, calcium influx, and activity-dependent release/uptake of pathological proteins. Conversely, populations with lower or more regulated activity are more resistant.</p>
