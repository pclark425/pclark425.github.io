                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Proteostatic Coupling Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the interplay between their network connectivity properties (e.g., hubness, synaptic input/output, activity synchrony) and their intrinsic proteostatic capacity (e.g., chaperone expression, autophagy efficiency). Neurons that are highly connected or serve as network hubs, but have limited proteostatic resources, are more vulnerable to proteopathic stress, while less connected or more proteostatically robust neurons are more resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly connected neurons (network hubs) in the cortex are more metabolically active and show greater vulnerability in Alzheimer's models. </li>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics reveal that hub neurons often have lower expression of proteostasis-related genes. </li>
    <li>Functional imaging and connectomics studies show that hub neurons are preferentially affected in early Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Proteostatic stress (e.g., impaired autophagy or chaperone function) exacerbates vulnerability in highly connected neurons. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neuronal populations in the visual cortex with both high network connectivity and low expression of proteostasis genes will show early and severe amyloid-β/tau pathology in transgenic mouse models.</li>
                <li>Enhancing proteostatic capacity (e.g., via overexpression of Hsp70 or autophagy genes) in network hub neurons will reduce their vulnerability to amyloid-β/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Network hub neurons with high proteostatic gene expression will be spared in early-stage Alzheimer's disease, as shown by single-cell RNA-seq and connectomics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network hubness of a previously resistant neuronal population (e.g., via optogenetic stimulation) will render it vulnerable only if proteostatic capacity is not simultaneously increased.</li>
                <li>In human patients with rare genetic variants that enhance neuronal proteostasis, network hub neurons in the visual cortex will remain resistant even in advanced Alzheimer's disease.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological enhancement of proteostasis in hub neurons will delay the onset of visual cortex pathology in animal models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a neuronal population with high hubness and low proteostatic capacity is found to be resistant to amyloid-β/tau pathology, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If increasing proteostatic capacity in hub neurons does not confer resistance, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If low-hubness neurons with low proteostatic capacity are not vulnerable, the theory's sufficiency claim is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations with low hubness and low proteostatic capacity are still vulnerable, suggesting other factors may be involved. </li>
