                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis in Alzheimer's Disease: The Environmental-Epigenetic Cascade Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that chronic exposure to airborne pollutants (especially fine particulate matter and traffic-related air pollution) initiates a cascade of epigenetic modifications in the brain and peripheral tissues. These modifications alter the expression of genes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation, thereby accelerating the accumulation of amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau. The resulting neuropathology leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and progression. The theory further proposes that specific epigenetic signatures can serve as early, non-invasive biomarkers for AD risk and detection.</p>
