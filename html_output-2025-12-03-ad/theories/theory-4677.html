                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Digital-Pathobiological Detection Theory of Alzheimer's Disease (IDPD-AD): Multimodal Convergence Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of molecular, cellular, and network-level pathobiological processes, which manifest as distinct digital biomarkers detectable through advanced computational analysis of multimodal data (e.g., neuroimaging, digital cognitive assessments, speech, and wearable sensor data). The theory asserts that integrating digital phenotyping with pathobiological signatures enables earlier, more accurate detection and staging of AD than either approach alone.</p>

    <li>Amyloid and tau PET imaging, CSF biomarkers, and neuroinflammation are established pathobiological hallmarks of AD. </li>
    <li>Digital cognitive assessments, speech analysis, and gait monitoring have shown sensitivity to early AD-related changes. </li>
    <li>Recent studies demonstrate that combining digital and biological markers improves diagnostic accuracy. </li>
    <li>Machine learning models integrating multimodal data outperform single-modality models in AD detection. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While multimodal approaches are emerging, the formalization of a law requiring both digital and pathobiological signatures for optimal early detection is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Pathobiological markers (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration) and digital biomarkers (speech, cognition, gait) are each individually associated with AD risk and progression.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law that the convergence of both pathobiological and digital behavioral anomalies is necessary and sufficient for early, high-confidence detection of AD is novel.</p>

                <li>If digital anomalies do not precede or co-occur with pathobiological changes, the temporal precedence law is falsified.</li>
