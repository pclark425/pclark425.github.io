                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Microenvironmental Feedback Loop Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles is determined by local feedback loops between neuronal activity, glial responses (astrocytes, microglia), and proteostatic mechanisms. In vulnerable populations, maladaptive feedback (e.g., chronic inflammation, impaired proteostasis) amplifies pathology, while in resistant populations, adaptive feedback (e.g., efficient clearance, anti-inflammatory signaling) maintains homeostasis.</p>
