                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2479</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is fundamentally determined by their network connectivity profiles. Neurons with extensive long-range, high-degree, or hub-like connectivity are more susceptible to pathological protein spread and accumulation, while neurons with predominantly local, low-degree, or isolated connectivity are more resistant. The theory posits that the architecture of the cortical network, including both anatomical and functional connectivity, governs the likelihood of pathological seeding, propagation, and cellular stress responses.</p>

                <li>Regions with higher functional connectivity to other cortical areas will show earlier pathological changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network degree of resistant neurons (e.g., by viral overexpression of synaptic adhesion molecules) will increase their vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Selective ablation of hub neurons will alter the spatial pattern of pathology spread in the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with low connectivity degree show equal or greater vulnerability than high-degree neurons, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If pathology spreads independently of network connectivity patterns, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some molecularly defined neuron subtypes may show vulnerability or resistance independent of their connectivity profile. </li>
    <li>Non-neuronal factors (e.g., glial responses, vascular changes) may modulate vulnerability in ways not captured by connectivity alone. </li>
