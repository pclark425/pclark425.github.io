                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Connectivity Synergy Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from a synergistic interaction between their metabolic load and their network connectivity. Neurons with both high metabolic demand (due to firing rate, axonal length, and synaptic density) and high connectivity (especially as network hubs or with long-range projections) are at greatest risk, as these factors amplify susceptibility to protein misfolding, impaired proteostasis, and trans-synaptic propagation of pathology.</p>

                <li>Neurons with low metabolic demand but high connectivity, or vice versa, will show intermediate vulnerability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing metabolic demand in a low-connectivity neuron will only modestly increase vulnerability unless connectivity is also increased.</li>
                <li>Simultaneous reduction of both metabolic demand and connectivity in a vulnerable neuron will confer resistance.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological enhancement of proteostasis in high-demand, high-connectivity neurons will selectively protect them from pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with low metabolic demand and low connectivity are highly vulnerable would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that metabolic demand and connectivity do not interact to determine vulnerability would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing that reducing either metabolic demand or connectivity alone is sufficient for full protection would refute the synergy hypothesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with high metabolic demand but low connectivity, or vice versa, may not fit the predicted vulnerability profile. </li>
    <li>Genetic or molecular factors (e.g., expression of specific receptors or chaperones) may override the predicted effects. </li>
