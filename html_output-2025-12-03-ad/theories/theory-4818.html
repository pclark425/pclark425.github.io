                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability (General Formulation 1)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by each population's unique intrinsic molecular signature. This signature encompasses the transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic profiles that modulate susceptibility to proteopathic stress, including expression of receptors, chaperones, degradation machinery, and synaptic proteins.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics reveal distinct gene expression patterns in vulnerable vs. resistant neurons in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Proteomic studies show differential abundance of synaptic, metabolic, and stress-response proteins in neurons with varying vulnerability. </li>
    <li>Metabolic profiling demonstrates that neurons with higher oxidative phosphorylation capacity are more resistant to proteopathic stress. </li>
    <li>Neurons expressing higher levels of chaperones and proteasome components are less likely to accumulate misfolded proteins. </li>
    <li>Comparative studies across brain regions show that neurons with similar molecular signatures share similar vulnerability profiles. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has identified gene expression differences, the holistic, multi-omic signature as a predictive and causal determinant is a new synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that certain neuronal populations are more vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathology, and that gene expression differences exist between these populations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit linking of a comprehensive, multi-omic 'intrinsic molecular signature' as the primary determinant of vulnerability, rather than single genes or pathways, is novel.</p>

                <li>Transplanting neurons with a resistant signature into a vulnerable region will confer local resistance to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Engineering a synthetic molecular signature not found in nature may confer super-resistance or super-susceptibility to proteopathic stress.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If neuronal populations with identical molecular signatures show different vulnerability to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If altering the molecular signature of a neuron does not change its susceptibility to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If environmental or extrinsic factors alone can override the effect of the intrinsic molecular signature, the theory would be incomplete.</li>
