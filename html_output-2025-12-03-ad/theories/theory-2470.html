                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic Stress and Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their metabolic demand and activity patterns. Neurons with high baseline firing rates, elevated synaptic activity, or high metabolic rates are more susceptible to proteostatic stress, oxidative damage, and impaired clearance of misfolded proteins, predisposing them to pathology. Neurons with low activity and metabolic demand are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing activity in resistant neurons (e.g., interneurons) will shift their vulnerability profile.</li>
                <li>Chronic reduction of activity in vulnerable neurons will confer resistance, even in the presence of amyloid-β/tau.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If high-activity neurons are not more vulnerable than low-activity neurons, the theory is challenged.</li>
