                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Proteostatic Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic patterns of electrical activity and associated proteostatic stress. Neurons with high baseline or stimulus-driven activity experience increased protein synthesis, trafficking, and turnover, which can overload proteostasis mechanisms and promote aggregation of misfolded proteins. Conversely, neurons with lower or more regulated activity maintain proteostasis and are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing activity in resistant neuronal populations will induce local vulnerability only if proteostatic capacity is insufficient.</li>
                <li>Simultaneous upregulation of activity and proteostasis in the same neurons will maintain resistance to aggregation.</li>
                <li>Chronic visual stimulation in animal models will accelerate pathology in specific visual cortical layers.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly active neuronal populations that remain resistant to Aβ/tau aggregation despite low proteostatic capacity would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that reducing activity does not affect local pathology would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>Observing no correlation between activity patterns and vulnerability in the visual cortex would contradict the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Some low-activity neuronal populations are still vulnerable, suggesting additional factors may be involved. </li>
