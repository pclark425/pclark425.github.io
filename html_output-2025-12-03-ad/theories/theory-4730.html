                <p><strong>Name:</strong> MicroRNA–Lipid Metabolism–Amyloid/Tau Regulatory Loop in AD with Dyslipidemia (Network Disruption Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the interplay between microRNAs, lipid metabolism, and amyloid/tau pathology forms a regulatory network whose disruption is both necessary and sufficient for the development of Alzheimer's disease in the context of dyslipidemia. The network is characterized by mutual regulation: microRNAs control lipid metabolism genes, lipid status modulates APP/tau processing, and amyloid/tau pathology feeds back to alter microRNA expression. The breakdown of this network leads to a self-amplifying cycle of neurodegeneration, and its disruption can be detected by network-based analysis of circulating microRNAs and lipid metabolites.</p>
