                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4817</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Stress-Response Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by intrinsic differences in their cellular stress-response thresholds. Neurons with lower thresholds for activating protective responses (e.g., autophagy, unfolded protein response, antioxidant defenses) are more resistant, while those with higher thresholds or impaired stress responses are more vulnerable. These thresholds are determined by gene expression profiles, metabolic rates, and prior exposure to sublethal stressors.</p>
