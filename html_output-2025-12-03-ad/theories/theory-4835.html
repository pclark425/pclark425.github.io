                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Delayed Propagation and Synaptic Seeding Theory for V1 Resistance (Network-Activity Generalization)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that the resistance of V1 neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is due to a combination of (1) delayed propagation of misfolded proteins resulting from V1's unique network topology and low intrinsic activity, and (2) a high threshold for synaptic seeding events, determined by both molecular composition and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. The interplay between these factors creates a robust barrier to the initiation and spread of neurodegenerative proteinopathies in V1.</p>

                <li>Regions with similar network topology and activity profiles to V1 in other sensory systems will also show resistance.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If V1 is artificially converted into a network hub (e.g., via rewiring), will it become vulnerable to early pathology?</li>
                <li>If activity is chronically suppressed in association cortex, will it acquire V1-like resistance?</li>
                <li>Are there unique molecular signatures in V1 that are induced by low activity and confer resistance?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing activity in V1 does not increase vulnerability to pathology, the activity-dependent law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If V1 is found to have high levels of activity-induced molecular changes despite low vulnerability, the theory is called into question.</li>
