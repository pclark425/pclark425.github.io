                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Network-Integrated Molecular Determinants</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the integration of their intrinsic molecular signatures with their network context. Specifically, the combination of cell-autonomous molecular profiles (e.g., expression of amyloid/tau processing genes, proteostasis regulators) and network-dependent factors (e.g., synaptic connectivity, activity-dependent gene expression) creates a unique vulnerability landscape for each neuronal subtype.</p>
