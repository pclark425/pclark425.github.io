                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Cell Surface and Extracellular Matrix Interactome</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic cell surface and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecular signatures. These signatures, including specific cell adhesion molecules, ECM receptors, and glycoproteins, modulate the interaction of neurons with pathological aggregates and glial cells, influencing the uptake, clearance, or propagation of Aβ and tau.</p>
