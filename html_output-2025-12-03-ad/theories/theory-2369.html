                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2369</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic-Peripheral Feedback Loop in Alzheimer's Pathogenesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that there is a bidirectional feedback loop between central neurodegeneration and peripheral platelet tau/Aβ dynamics. CNS pathology influences peripheral platelet protein signatures, while peripheral changes in platelet tau/Aβ may, in turn, modulate neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, potentially accelerating or modulating AD progression.</p>

                <li>Genetic or pharmacological manipulation of platelet tau/Aβ will alter AD risk in animal models.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If altering platelet tau/Aβ signature does not affect CNS pathology or neuroinflammation, the feedback law is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If CNS pathology does not induce changes in platelet tau/Aβ, the central-to-peripheral law is invalid.</li>
                <li>If platelet tau/Aβ signature is not associated with neuroinflammatory markers, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some individuals with altered platelet tau/Aβ signature do not show changes in neuroinflammation or BBB integrity. </li>
    <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may be influenced by non-AD systemic diseases. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
