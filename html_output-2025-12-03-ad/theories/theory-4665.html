                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Progression</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple interacting biological cascades—including amyloid, tau, vascular, metabolic, immune, and synaptic dysfunctions—rather than a single linear pathway. The model asserts that the interplay and feedback among these factors, modulated by genetic and environmental risk, determines both the initiation and the rate of progression of AD. Detection is most effective when it targets the dynamic signatures of these interacting cascades, rather than any single biomarker.</p>
