                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic molecular signatures, including gene expression profiles, proteostasis capacity, and receptor composition. These intrinsic properties determine the neurons' ability to handle misfolded proteins, respond to stress, and interact with pathological aggregates.</p>

<ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Neuronal populations with high proteostasis capacity that still develop pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Populations with low receptor expression that are still vulnerable would call the theory into question.</li>
