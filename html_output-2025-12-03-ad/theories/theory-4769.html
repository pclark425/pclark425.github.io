                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures. These include expression levels of genes and proteins involved in proteostasis, synaptic activity, calcium buffering, and cell-surface receptors that mediate Aβ/tau uptake or toxicity. Neuronal populations with high expression of protective chaperones, efficient protein degradation machinery, and low expression of Aβ/tau-binding receptors are more resistant, while those with the opposite profile are more vulnerable.</p>
