                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Proteostasis and Metabolic Reserve Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic proteostatic capacity and metabolic reserve. Neurons with robust protein quality control systems, efficient autophagy, and high mitochondrial function are resistant, while those with limited proteostatic and metabolic capacity are vulnerable, regardless of their circuit position.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Boosting both proteostasis and metabolic reserve in highly connected, high-activity neurons will confer full resistance to pathology.</li>
                <li>Visual cortex neurons with artificially increased metabolic demand but high proteostatic capacity may remain resistant.</li>
                <li>Genetic variants that enhance proteostasis will correlate with reduced visual cortex pathology in human dementia cohorts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high proteostatic capacity still accumulate pathology at rates similar to low-capacity neurons, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If metabolic reserve does not correlate with resistance to pathology in visual cortex populations, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If boosting proteostasis fails to protect vulnerable neurons, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some highly resistant neurons have only moderate proteostatic or metabolic capacity, suggesting additional factors. </li>
    <li>Certain visual cortex regions with low metabolic reserve remain relatively spared in some dementia subtypes. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
