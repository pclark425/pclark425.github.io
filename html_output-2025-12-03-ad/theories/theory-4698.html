                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4698</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic Pathophysiological Synchronization Theory for Early Alzheimer's Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a temporally synchronized cascade of pathophysiological events—amyloid deposition, tauopathy, neuroinflammation, and microvascular dysfunction—that occur in both the CNS and select peripheral tissues. The temporal synchronization of these events enables the use of peripheral biomarkers as real-time proxies for CNS pathology, providing a window for early detection and intervention.</p>
