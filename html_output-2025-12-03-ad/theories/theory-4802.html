                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Visual Cortex Vulnerability (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by a gradient formed by the intersection of intrinsic metabolic demand and extrinsic network connectivity. Neurons with high metabolic rates and central positions in cortical connectivity networks are more susceptible to pathological protein aggregation, while those with lower metabolic rates and peripheral connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly active, metabolically demanding neurons (e.g., layer 3 pyramidal cells) are more prone to oxidative stress and protein misfolding. </li>
    <li>Hub regions in cortical networks show early amyloid and tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Functional MRI and PET studies show that regions with high baseline activity and connectivity (e.g., default mode network hubs) are early sites of amyloid and tau accumulation. </li>
    <li>Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are prominent in neurons with high synaptic activity, which correlates with increased vulnerability to proteinopathies. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While both metabolic and connectivity factors have been individually implicated, their explicit interaction as a gradient determining vulnerability is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Previous work has shown that metabolic stress and network hubness are associated with vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly combines metabolic demand and network centrality as a joint gradient, rather than treating them as independent risk factors.</p>
