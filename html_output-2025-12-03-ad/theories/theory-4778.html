                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Proteostasis Threshold Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each neuronal population in the visual cortex has a unique proteostasis threshold, determined by its intrinsic molecular signature. When the burden of misfolded proteins (amyloid-β, tau) exceeds this threshold, the neuron becomes vulnerable to degeneration. The threshold is set by the expression of chaperones, autophagy-lysosomal genes, and related stress response pathways.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Proteostasis capacity varies between neuronal populations and correlates with vulnerability. </li>
    <li>Experimental overload of misfolded proteins leads to degeneration when proteostasis is insufficient. </li>
    <li>Upregulation of chaperones or autophagy genes increases the proteostasis threshold and confers resistance. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law introduces a quantitative, testable model for population-specific vulnerability.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Proteostasis failure is implicated in neurodegeneration, but a quantitative threshold model for population vulnerability is not standard.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit threshold law relating molecular signature to a quantitative vulnerability threshold is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Populations with higher proteostasis capacity will tolerate greater misfolded protein burden before showing pathology.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological enhancement of proteostasis will raise the threshold and delay pathology onset.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be populations with extremely high thresholds that never develop pathology, even in severe AD.</li>
                <li>Chronic, sub-threshold misfolded protein burden may induce compensatory upregulation of proteostasis genes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding populations with low proteostasis capacity that remain resistant despite high misfolded protein burden would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that increasing proteostasis capacity does not alter the threshold for pathology would call the theory into question.</li>
