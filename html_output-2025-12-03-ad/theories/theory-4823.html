                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their intrinsic molecular signature related to synaptic activity and calcium homeostasis. Neurons with high baseline synaptic activity and low expression of calcium-buffering proteins are more susceptible to proteopathic stress due to increased calcium influx and excitotoxicity.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neurons with high synaptic activity are more prone to Aβ-induced calcium dysregulation and excitotoxicity. </li>
    <li>Low expression of calcium-buffering proteins (e.g., parvalbumin) correlates with increased vulnerability to neurodegeneration. </li>
    <li>Experimental reduction of synaptic activity or enhancement of calcium buffering reduces Aβ/tau toxicity. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law integrates known mechanisms into a predictive, population-level framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Synaptic activity and calcium dysregulation are implicated in AD pathogenesis.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between intrinsic synaptic/calcium molecular signature and selective vulnerability in the visual cortex is novel.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Altering synaptic activity patterns in resistant neurons may render them vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>
