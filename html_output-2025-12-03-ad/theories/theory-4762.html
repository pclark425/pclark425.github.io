                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostasis-Immune Axis Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that a gradient of proteostasis capacity and immune gene expression exists across neuronal populations in the visual cortex, and that the position of a neuron along this axis determines its vulnerability or resistance to Aβ and tau pathology. Neurons at the low-proteostasis, high-pro-inflammatory end are most vulnerable, while those at the high-proteostasis, low-pro-inflammatory end are most resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially creating a bimodal distribution along the axis (e.g., by genetic engineering) will result in sharply segregated vulnerable and resistant populations.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal single-cell profiling will show that neurons shift along the axis prior to developing pathology.</li>
                <li>Axis position will predict not only vulnerability to Aβ and tau, but also to other proteinopathies.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If axis position does not correlate with vulnerability in independent datasets, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If shifting axis position experimentally does not alter vulnerability, the theory is called into question.</li>
