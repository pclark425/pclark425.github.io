                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Microenvironmental Buffering Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the local microenvironment, including glial cell activity (astrocytes, microglia), vascular support, and extracellular matrix composition. Neuronal populations surrounded by a 'buffering' microenvironment—characterized by efficient glial clearance, anti-inflammatory signaling, and robust vascular/metabolic support—are resistant, while those in a 'permissive' or 'toxic' microenvironment are vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Transplanting glial cells with enhanced clearance capacity into a vulnerable region will confer resistance to local neurons.</li>
                <li>Artificially modifying the extracellular matrix to favor anti-inflammatory signaling will reduce vulnerability, even in genetically susceptible neurons.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons in a region with high glial clearance and robust vascular support are still highly vulnerable, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If reducing glial clearance does not increase vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations remain resistant despite low glial activity, suggesting intrinsic factors may also play a role. </li>
