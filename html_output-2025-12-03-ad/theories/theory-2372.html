                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Multiscale Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the integration of cell-intrinsic molecular features, circuit-level connectivity and activity, and local microenvironmental factors (including glial and vascular states). The convergence of these factors determines a neuron's proteostatic resilience, exposure to toxic species, and capacity for repair.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Highly connected, metabolically active neurons (e.g., layer II/III pyramidal cells) are more vulnerable in AD; pro-inflammatory glial states exacerbate pathology. </li>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics show vulnerable neurons express genes for high energy demand and synaptic activity. </li>
    <li>Microglial activation correlates with local plaque/tangle burden. </li>
    <li>Regions with high neuronal activity and metabolic demand show early amyloid and tau deposition in both human and animal models. </li>
