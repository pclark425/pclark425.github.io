                <p><strong>Name:</strong> MicroRNA–Lipid Metabolism–Amyloid/Tau Regulatory Loop in AD with Dyslipidemia: Systems Homeostasis Breakdown Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the miRNA–lipid metabolism–amyloid/tau axis forms a tightly regulated homeostatic loop in the healthy brain. Chronic dyslipidemia and metabolic stress disrupt this loop, leading to a feed-forward cycle of miRNA dysregulation, lipid imbalance, and amyloid/tau accumulation, which together drive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in AD.</p>
