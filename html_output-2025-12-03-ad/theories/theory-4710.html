                <p><strong>Name:</strong> The Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis as a Unified Pathogenic Cascade in Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that chronic exposure to air pollution initiates a cascade of epigenetic modifications in the brain, which in turn dysregulate the expression of genes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation. This cascade leads to the accumulation of amyloid-beta and hyperphosphorylated tau, ultimately resulting in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.</p>
