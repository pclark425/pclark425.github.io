                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Homeostasis Disruption Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability in the visual cortex is determined by the degree to which neuronal populations participate in homeostatic network oscillations. Neurons that are critical for maintaining network homeostasis (e.g., those involved in gamma oscillations) are more susceptible to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau-induced dysfunction, as pathology disrupts their activity, leading to a feed-forward loop of network instability and further pathology.</p>
