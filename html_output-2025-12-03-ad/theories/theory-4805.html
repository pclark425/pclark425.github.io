                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Visual Cortex Vulnerability (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position along a gradient defined by both their network connectivity (e.g., hubness, integration, synaptic density) and their metabolic demand (e.g., glucose utilization, mitochondrial load). Neurons with high connectivity and high metabolic demand are most vulnerable, while those with low connectivity and low metabolic demand are most resistant.</p>

    <li>Highly connected hub neurons in the cortex are more likely to accumulate AD pathology. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity or metabolic demand of resistant neurons will increase their vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Mapping the gradient across the visual cortex will predict the spatial pattern of pathology in preclinical AD.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly connected, high-metabolic neurons do not show increased pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If low-connectivity, low-metabolic neurons are equally vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>

    <li>Genetic or molecular factors that confer vulnerability or resistance independent of connectivity or metabolism. </li>
