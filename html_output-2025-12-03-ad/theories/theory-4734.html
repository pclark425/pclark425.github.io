                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature and Connectivity Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by a combination of their molecular expression profiles (e.g., receptor types, proteostasis machinery, synaptic proteins) and their position within large-scale connectivity gradients (e.g., feedforward vs. feedback, hubness). Neurons with high expression of vulnerable molecular signatures and centrality in connectivity gradients are more likely to accumulate pathology.</p>

                <li>Altering molecular signatures in resistant populations will render them vulnerable, even if their connectivity is low.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly connected neurons with resistant molecular signatures that remain resistant would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing selective vulnerability in neurons with neither high-risk molecular signatures nor high connectivity would contradict the theory.</li>
