                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4699</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Failure Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from a convergence of proteinopathy (amyloid-beta and tau), vascular dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, which together disrupt neural network homeostasis. This disruption initiates a self-amplifying cascade of synaptic failure, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, leading to progressive cognitive decline. Detection is most effective by identifying early network dysfunction and multi-modal biomarker signatures.</p>
