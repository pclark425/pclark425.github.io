                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature and Proteostasis Capacity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular signatures, including expression of proteostasis-related genes, chaperones, and protein degradation machinery. Populations with robust proteostasis capacity efficiently clear misfolded proteins and resist pathology, while those with limited capacity accumulate toxic aggregates and degenerate.</p>
