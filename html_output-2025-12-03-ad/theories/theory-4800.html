                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Activity-Driven Vulnerability Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their intrinsic and extrinsic patterns of network activity. Neuronal populations with high baseline activity, synchronous firing, or strong excitatory input are more susceptible to Aβ/tau pathology due to increased metabolic demand, calcium influx, and synaptic stress, whereas populations with lower or more regulated activity are more resistant.</p>
