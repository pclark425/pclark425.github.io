                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Delayed Propagation and Synaptic Seeding Theory for V1 Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the primary visual cortex (V1) exhibits resistance to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology due to a combination of delayed pathological propagation from upstream regions and intrinsic synaptic/molecular features that reduce the efficiency of initial seeding and spread of aggregates. The theory integrates circuit-level connectivity, molecular composition, and local network dynamics to explain selective vulnerability and resistance.</p>

    <li>V1 is typically affected later in Alzheimer's disease progression than association cortices. </li>

                <li>Are there rare cases where V1 is an early site of pathology due to atypical connectivity or molecular changes?</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If V1 develops pathology as early as association cortex despite its connectivity, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If V1 synapses are equally efficient at seeding as association cortex in controlled experiments, the theory is called into question.</li>
