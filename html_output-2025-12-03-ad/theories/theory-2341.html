                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the breakdown of large-scale neural network integrity, driven by a convergence of molecular pathologies (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction) that disrupt inter-regional brain communication. The resulting network disintegration precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and can be detected by advanced functional and structural neuroimaging before overt neurodegeneration.</p>
