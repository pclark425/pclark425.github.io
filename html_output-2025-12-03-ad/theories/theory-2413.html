                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (General Formulation 2: Dynamic Network Adaptation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed not only by static molecular resilience and pathway cohesiveness, but also by the dynamic adaptability of these networks in response to stress. Neurons capable of rapidly upregulating protective pathways and reorganizing their signaling networks in response to early pathological insults are more resistant, while those with rigid or maladaptive network responses are more vulnerable.</p>
