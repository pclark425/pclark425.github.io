                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Digital-Pathobiological Detection Theory of Alzheimer's Disease (IDPD-AD): Network Disintegration Cascade Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is fundamentally a disorder of progressive brain network disintegration, initiated by molecular pathobiological insults (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation) and propagated through large-scale neural circuits. These network disruptions manifest as quantifiable digital behavioral changes, which can be detected through advanced digital phenotyping and computational modeling. The theory asserts that digital biomarkers are direct proxies for underlying network dysfunction, and that their integration with pathobiological data enables precise staging and subtyping of AD.</p>
