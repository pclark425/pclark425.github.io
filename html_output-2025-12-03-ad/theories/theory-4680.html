                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Digital-Pathobiological Detection Theory of Alzheimer's Disease (IDPD-AD): Multimodal Convergence Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease arises from the convergence of multiple pathobiological processes (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction) that interact to disrupt neural circuits. The resulting changes are reflected in both molecular biomarkers and digital phenotypes. The theory asserts that only by integrating digital behavioral data with molecular, imaging, and genetic information can the full spectrum of AD be detected and subtyped, enabling earlier and more precise diagnosis.</p>
