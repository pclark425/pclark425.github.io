                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2319</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory (Integrated Network Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the breakdown of a homeostatic network regulating the flux of multiple interacting biomarkers (proteins, metabolites, immune mediators) between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral systems. The network is governed by transporters, barrier integrity (e.g., blood-brain barrier), and feedback loops. Dysregulation leads to both pathological accumulation in the brain and altered peripheral biomarker signatures. Effective detection and intervention require modeling and targeting this networked flux, rather than single-molecule measurements.</p>
