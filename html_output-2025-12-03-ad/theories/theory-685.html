                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by intrinsic molecular and gene-expression programs. Neurons that maintain robust expression of neuroprotective pathways (e.g., canonical Wnt signaling, metabolic/oxidative phosphorylation stability, cytoskeletal regulation) are resistant to early AD pathology, while those with less cohesive or disrupted protective networks are more vulnerable. The resilience is not solely determined by anatomical connectivity, but by the ability of neurons to sustain homeostatic and anti-aggregation mechanisms in the face of pathological insults.</p>
