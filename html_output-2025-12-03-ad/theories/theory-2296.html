                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disconnection and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disconnection of large-scale brain networks, initiated by focal molecular pathology (amyloid, tau) that propagates along vulnerable neural circuits. The spread of pathology is governed by network topology, synaptic activity, and regional vulnerability. Early detection is possible by identifying subtle network dysfunction using advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques, even before overt atrophy or cognitive symptoms.</p>
