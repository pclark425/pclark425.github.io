                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis in Alzheimer's Disease: The Multi-Stage Environmental Vulnerability Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease are determined by a multi-stage process in which environmental air pollution acts as a primary trigger for epigenetic reprogramming in susceptible individuals. This reprogramming alters the expression of genes involved in amyloid and tau metabolism, but the manifestation of AD pathology depends on the cumulative burden of pollution, genetic susceptibility, and the presence of secondary environmental or lifestyle stressors. The model predicts that only when a threshold of epigenetic dysregulation is reached—modulated by both pollution and other risk factors—does the amyloid/tau cascade become pathologically self-sustaining, leading to clinical AD.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Therapeutic reversal of epigenetic changes after the threshold is reached will halt or reverse amyloid/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Individuals with high pollution exposure but strong epigenetic resilience mechanisms will not develop AD, even with other risk factors.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with high cumulative risk do not show accelerated epigenetic changes or earlier AD onset, the model is challenged.</li>
                <li>If amyloid/tau pathology can be reversed without modifying epigenetic marks, the necessity of the epigenetic threshold is questioned.</li>
            </ol>
