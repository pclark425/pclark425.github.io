                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral-Accessible Biomarker Convergence Theory for Early Alzheimer's Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS) is mirrored by a convergence of molecular changes in peripheral biofluids (e.g., blood, saliva, urine), accessible through minimally invasive sampling. The convergence of multiple classes of biomarkers—proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites, and extracellular vesicle cargo—reflects the underlying CNS pathology and enables early, preclinical detection of AD. The theory further asserts that the integration of these peripheral signals, rather than reliance on single markers, provides superior sensitivity and specificity for early AD diagnosis.</p>
