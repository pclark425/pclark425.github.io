                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Delayed Propagation and Synaptic Seeding Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance of V1 neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is governed by the interplay between (1) activity-dependent delayed propagation—where the unique sensory-driven, low baseline activity of V1 reduces opportunities for trans-synaptic spread of aggregates—and (2) a lack of synaptic seeding events due to the absence of activity-induced molecular changes (e.g., phosphorylation, local protein synthesis) that facilitate aggregation. Thus, V1's functional specialization for stimulus-driven, low spontaneous activity creates both a physical and molecular barrier to the initiation and spread of neurodegenerative proteinopathies.</p>
