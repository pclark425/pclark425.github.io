                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular expression profiles, including cell-surface receptors, proteostasis machinery, and synaptic protein composition. These molecular signatures dictate the propensity for aggregate uptake, seeding, and propagation.</p>
