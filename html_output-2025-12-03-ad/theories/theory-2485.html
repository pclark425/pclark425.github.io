                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2485</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and role within cortical networks. Highly connected and active populations are more exposed to trans-synaptic spread of pathological proteins and activity-dependent stress, making them more susceptible to aggregate formation and degeneration.</p>

                <li>Chronic reduction of neuronal activity in visual cortex will reduce local amyloid and tau pathology.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network connectivity of normally resistant populations will render them vulnerable to trans-synaptic pathology.</li>
                <li>Chronic silencing of highly active populations will prevent or delay aggregate formation and neurodegeneration.</li>
                <li>Selective optogenetic stimulation of visual cortex populations will accelerate local pathology in a connectivity-dependent manner.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly connected or active populations that remain resistant to pathology would challenge this theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that reducing activity or connectivity does not alter vulnerability would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>Observing early pathology in populations with low connectivity and low activity would contradict the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some populations with low connectivity or activity still show vulnerability, suggesting other factors are involved. </li>
    <li>Molecular or genetic factors (e.g., expression of specific receptors or chaperones) may modulate vulnerability independently of network properties. </li>
