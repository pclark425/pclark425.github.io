                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Proteostatic Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective resistance of certain neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is due to their enhanced intrinsic proteostatic mechanisms, including higher expression of molecular chaperones, more efficient ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems, and robust stress response pathways, which enable them to clear or neutralize toxic protein species more effectively.</p>

                <li>If neurons with high proteostatic gene expression still accumulate Aβ and tau pathology at rates similar to vulnerable neurons, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If enhancing proteostasis in vulnerable neurons does not confer resistance, the theory would be called into question.</li>

    <li>Some resistant neurons do not show high proteostasis gene expression, suggesting other mechanisms may contribute. </li>
