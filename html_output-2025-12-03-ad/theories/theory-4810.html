                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Vulnerability-Resilience Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the integration of cell-intrinsic molecular profiles, local circuit connectivity, and microenvironmental factors, which together establish a continuous gradient of susceptibility. The theory predicts that vulnerability is not binary but distributed, and that the interplay between high metabolic demand, excitatory synaptic drive, and insufficient local glial support determines the position of each neuronal population along this gradient.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Layer II/III pyramidal neurons, which have high metabolic demand and receive dense excitatory input, are more vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Neuronal populations with robust astrocytic and microglial support show relative resistance to pathology. </li>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics reveal that neurons with high expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes and low expression of neuroprotective glial factors are more susceptible to degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Visual cortex regions with high synaptic activity and low glial density show earlier and more severe amyloid and tau accumulation. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the individual factors are known, their integration into a gradient model with explicit predictions for population-level vulnerability is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Previous work has separately implicated metabolic demand, excitatory input, and glial support in neuronal vulnerability.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law integrates these factors into a continuous, predictive gradient and posits their interaction as the determinant of vulnerability, rather than treating them as independent contributors.</p>
