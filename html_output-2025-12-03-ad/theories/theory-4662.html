                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease: Network Vulnerability and Systemic Resilience</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the multifactorial cascade model by positing that the vulnerability of specific neural networks and the systemic resilience of the brain-body axis determine both the initiation and trajectory of Alzheimer's disease. The model asserts that AD is most likely to initiate in individuals whose neural networks (e.g., default mode network) are both highly interconnected and metabolically demanding, and whose systemic resilience (e.g., neurovascular health, immune regulation, metabolic flexibility) is compromised. The interplay between network vulnerability and systemic resilience modulates the threshold for cascade initiation and the rate of progression, and can be detected by multimodal imaging and systemic biomarker profiling.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Lifestyle interventions (exercise, diet, cognitive engagement) are associated with increased cognitive reserve and delayed AD onset. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law reframes resilience from a background factor to a direct determinant of cascade initiation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cognitive reserve and lifestyle modification are known to affect AD risk, but not as explicit modulators of the cascade threshold.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes resilience as a quantifiable modulator of the threshold for disease initiation.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Individuals with high network vulnerability but high systemic resilience will show delayed or absent AD onset despite risk factors.</li>
                <li>Enhancing systemic resilience in midlife will raise the threshold for AD cascade initiation, reducing incidence.</li>
                <li>Multimodal imaging and systemic biomarker profiles will predict AD risk more accurately than either alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing network connectivity/metabolic demand in the absence of resilience loss may not lower the threshold for AD.</li>
                <li>Interventions that specifically target network vulnerability (e.g., neuromodulation) may delay or prevent AD even in high-risk individuals.</li>
                <li>Some individuals may possess unique network architectures that confer resistance to AD despite low systemic resilience.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding individuals with high network vulnerability and low resilience who do not develop AD would challenge the model.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that resilience interventions do not alter AD risk or onset would contradict the resilience modulation law.</li>
                <li>Observing AD initiation in networks with low connectivity/metabolic demand would challenge the network vulnerability law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases of AD with atypical network involvement (e.g., primary visual cortex) are not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory unifies two previously parallel lines of research into a single threshold-based model.</p>
