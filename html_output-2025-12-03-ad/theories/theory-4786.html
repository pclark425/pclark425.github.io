                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4786</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular expression profiles, including genes related to calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress response, and synaptic plasticity. Neurons expressing protective molecular signatures are resistant, while those lacking these signatures are vulnerable.</p>
