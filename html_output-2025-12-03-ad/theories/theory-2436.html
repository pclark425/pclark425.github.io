                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Proteostatic Capacity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic proteostatic capacity—i.e., the efficiency of their protein quality control systems, including autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome activity, and chaperone expression. Neurons with robust proteostatic mechanisms are resistant to toxic protein accumulation, while those with limited capacity are more susceptible, regardless of their connectivity or metabolic demand.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Transplanting high-proteostatic-capacity neurons into a vulnerable region will confer local resistance to pathology.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological enhancement of proteostasis in resistant neurons will have minimal effect on pathology progression.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high proteostatic capacity still accumulate Aβ and tau at the same rate as low-capacity neurons, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If proteostatic enhancement does not reduce pathology in vulnerable populations, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Some neurons with robust proteostatic signatures are affected in late-stage AD, suggesting additional factors contribute to vulnerability. </li>
