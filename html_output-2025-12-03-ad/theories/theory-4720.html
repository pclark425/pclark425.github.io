                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Threshold Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated when a combination of genetic, metabolic, vascular, and environmental risk factors collectively exceed a threshold, triggering a cascade of molecular and cellular events (amyloid, tau, inflammation, synaptic dysfunction). Early detection is possible by integrating multi-modal risk and biomarker profiles, rather than relying on single markers.</p>
