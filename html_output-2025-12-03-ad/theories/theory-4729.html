                <p><strong>Name:</strong> MicroRNA–Lipid Metabolism–Amyloid/Tau Regulatory Loop in AD with Dyslipidemia (General Loop Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that a regulatory loop exists between microRNAs (notably miR-132, miR-33, and others), lipid metabolism (especially cholesterol homeostasis), and amyloid/tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with dyslipidemia. Dysregulation of microRNAs alters lipid metabolism, which in turn modulates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and tau phosphorylation. Amyloid and tau pathology further disrupt microRNA expression, perpetuating a pathogenic feedback loop. This loop is hypothesized to underlie both the cause and progression of AD in individuals with dyslipidemia, and to provide a basis for early detection via circulating microRNA and lipidomic signatures.</p>
