                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Formulation 1)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is governed by the intrinsic cohesiveness of molecular networks and signaling pathways within each neuronal subtype. Neurons with highly cohesive, redundant, and robust molecular interaction networks—particularly those governing proteostasis, synaptic maintenance, and stress response—are more resistant to pathological aggregation, while those with fragmented or less integrated pathways are more vulnerable.</p>
