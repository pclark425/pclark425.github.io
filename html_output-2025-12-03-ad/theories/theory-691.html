                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Selective Synaptic Vulnerability in Visual Cortex Neurons</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance or vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by intrinsic molecular programs, including the expression of neuroprotective pathways (e.g., canonical Wnt signaling, metabolic stability), and the compartment-specific accumulation of toxic protein species (e.g., soluble truncated tau, Aβ oligomers) at synapses. Neurons with robust neuroprotective gene expression and stable metabolic/oxidative phosphorylation programs are resistant to degeneration, while those with disrupted synaptic actin dynamics or impaired activity-dependent gene induction (e.g., Arc/Arg3.1) are selectively vulnerable at the synaptic level, even in the absence of overt cell death.</p>
