                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disconnection and Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive disconnection of large-scale brain networks, initiated by focal pathology (amyloid, tau, or inflammation) that propagates trans-synaptically. This network breakdown precedes and predicts clinical symptoms. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level changes via advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiology, even before molecular biomarkers become abnormal.</p>
