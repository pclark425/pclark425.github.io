                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Network Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their participation in highly active, recurrent network motifs. Neurons that are part of frequently reactivated ensembles or that experience high synaptic activity are more prone to metabolic stress, increased protein synthesis, and local accumulation of misfolded proteins, thereby increasing their susceptibility to neurodegenerative pathology.</p>

                <li>Regions of the visual cortex with lower baseline activity will show delayed or reduced pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially inducing recurrent activity in previously resistant visual cortex neurons will increase their susceptibility to amyloid-β and tau accumulation.</li>
                <li>Disrupting recurrent network motifs without altering overall activity will reduce selective vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Enhancing proteostasis mechanisms in highly active neurons will mitigate their vulnerability despite high activity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly active, recurrently engaged neurons in the visual cortex do not show increased vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If reducing activity in these neurons does not decrease pathology, the theory would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If metabolic stress does not correlate with protein aggregation in visual cortex neurons, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Neuronal vulnerability may also depend on molecular identity, such as expression of specific receptors or chaperones, independent of activity. </li>
    <li>Non-neuronal factors, such as local inflammation or vascular changes, may influence vulnerability. </li>
