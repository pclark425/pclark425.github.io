                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis in Alzheimer's Disease: The Environmental-Epigenetic Cascade Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that chronic exposure to air pollution, particularly ultrafine particulate matter, initiates a cascade of epigenetic modifications in the brain, which in turn dysregulate genes involved in amyloid-beta and tau metabolism. This environmental-epigenetic axis accelerates the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, and provides a mechanistic link between environmental risk and molecular hallmarks of AD.</p>
