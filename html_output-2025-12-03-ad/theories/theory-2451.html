                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Cellular State Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is primarily determined by intrinsic cellular properties, such as gene expression profiles, metabolic state, and proteostasis capacity. These intrinsic factors set a baseline for how neurons respond to pathological insults, independent of their network context.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics show that vulnerable neurons express lower levels of chaperones and autophagy-related genes. </li>
    <li>Experimental upregulation of proteostasis genes in neurons confers resistance to Aβ/tau toxicity in vitro. </li>
    <li>Proteostasis impairment is a hallmark of neurodegeneration, and cell-type-specific differences in proteostasis gene expression have been observed in the visual cortex. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While proteostasis is a known factor in neurodegeneration, its role in cell-type-specific vulnerability in the visual cortex is less established.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Proteostasis impairment is implicated in neurodegeneration, and some studies link chaperone expression to neuronal survival.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law directly links cell-type-specific proteostasis gene expression to selective vulnerability within the visual cortex.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general principle is known, but its application to selective vulnerability in the visual cortex is less explored.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> High metabolic demand is associated with vulnerability in several neurodegenerative diseases.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies the concept specifically to visual cortex neuronal subtypes and links it to Aβ/tau pathology.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neuronal populations in the visual cortex with experimentally increased proteostasis gene expression will show reduced Aβ/tau pathology in animal models.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing metabolic demand in resistant neuronal populations will render them vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Gene editing to enhance proteostasis in already resistant neurons will not further increase their resistance, suggesting a ceiling effect.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with low proteostasis gene expression are not more vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If high metabolic demand does not correlate with vulnerability in the visual cortex, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some resistant neuronal populations have high metabolic demand but remain unaffected, suggesting additional protective mechanisms. </li>
