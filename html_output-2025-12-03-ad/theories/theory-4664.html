                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Detection (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that effective detection of Alzheimer's disease requires a systems-level approach that integrates multi-domain biomarkers—genetic, proteomic, metabolic, vascular, neuroimaging, and digital phenotyping—reflecting the multifactorial cascade. The model asserts that early, preclinical detection is possible by identifying convergent changes across these domains, and that the temporal sequence and pattern of biomarker changes can be used to stratify risk, predict progression, and personalize interventions.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Individuals with convergent changes in at least three biomarker domains will develop clinical AD within five years at higher rates than those with single-domain changes.</li>
                <li>Temporal patterns where amyloid changes precede tau and neurodegeneration will predict faster progression than other sequences.</li>
                <li>Digital phenotyping will identify at-risk individuals before traditional biomarkers become abnormal.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel combinations of biomarker changes (e.g., metabolic + digital, without amyloid) may define new AD subtypes.</li>
                <li>Temporal patterns of biomarker change may differ in non-amyloid, non-tau driven dementias, allowing differential diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Machine learning models integrating multidomain, longitudinal data will outperform current clinical risk scores.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with convergent multidomain biomarker changes do not develop AD, the convergence law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If temporal patterns do not predict progression rates, the stratification law is invalid.</li>
                <li>If digital phenotyping does not add predictive value, the multidomain approach is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some individuals with abnormal biomarkers never develop clinical AD, possibly due to cognitive reserve or resilience factors. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory closely relates to existing frameworks but formalizes and extends them.</p>
