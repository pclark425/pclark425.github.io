                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Microenvironmental Susceptibility Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is determined by the unique microenvironmental features of each neuronal subtype, including local glial support, vascularization, metabolic demand, and extracellular matrix composition. These factors modulate the exposure, clearance, and cellular response to pathological proteins, thereby dictating the degree of neurodegeneration.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The integration of metabolic and clearance factors as a conditional law is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> High metabolic demand and impaired clearance are individually linked to vulnerability.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law's conditional structure, requiring both high demand and low clearance, is a novel synthesis.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Enhancing glial support or vascularization in vulnerable visual cortex regions will reduce amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Neuronal populations in regions with both high metabolic demand and poor clearance will show the earliest and most severe pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially altering the extracellular matrix composition in resistant regions may render them vulnerable.</li>
                <li>Long-term upregulation of glial support may have unintended consequences, such as gliosis or altered synaptic function.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding highly vascularized, glia-rich regions with severe pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing low-metabolic, low-clearance regions that remain resistant would call the theory into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations with high glial support still develop pathology, suggesting additional intrinsic factors. </li>
