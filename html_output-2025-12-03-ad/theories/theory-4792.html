                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Network Stress Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is primarily driven by the degree of activity-dependent network stress. Neurons that are highly active, participate in recurrent excitatory circuits, and are central to information flow experience greater calcium influx, oxidative stress, and protein turnover, predisposing them to pathological aggregation. In contrast, neurons with lower activity and peripheral network roles are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Reducing activity in central network neurons will decrease their vulnerability to amyloid and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Enhancing activity in peripheral network neurons will increase their vulnerability if they become more central to network function.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially shifting the network role of a neuron from peripheral to central (e.g., via optogenetic manipulation) will increase its vulnerability only if activity is also increased.</li>
                <li>Inhibiting calcium influx in highly active, central neurons will reduce their vulnerability even if activity remains high.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly active, central neurons are resistant to pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If peripheral, low-activity neurons are found to be highly vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The influence of non-neuronal cells (astrocytes, microglia) on network stress is not addressed. </li>
    <li>Genetic or molecular factors that modulate vulnerability independently of activity/network role are not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends activity-dependent stress models to a network-centric framework for selective vulnerability.</p>
