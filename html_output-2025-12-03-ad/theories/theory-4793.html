                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mitochondrial-Network Coupling Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that there exists a critical threshold of mitochondrial function relative to network connectivity, beyond which neurons in the visual cortex become selectively vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology. Neurons with high connectivity but sub-threshold mitochondrial function cannot meet energy demands, leading to proteostatic failure and aggregation, while those above the threshold remain resistant. The theory integrates quantitative relationships between connectivity and metabolic capacity, and predicts that the ratio of connectivity to mitochondrial function (C/M) determines vulnerability.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with C/M ratios above the threshold are not more vulnerable, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If neurons with C/M ratios below the threshold are still highly vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
