                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability in Visual Cortex</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined primarily by their network connectivity patterns, especially the presence of long-range corticocortical projections, synaptic density, and integration within large-scale cortical circuits. Neurons with extensive long-range projections (e.g., large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V) are more susceptible to tau pathology and neurodegeneration, while neurons with predominantly local connectivity (e.g., primary visual cortex pyramidal neurons) are relatively resistant, especially in early disease stages. The spread of tau pathology follows synaptic and axonal pathways, with synaptic compartments serving as loci for early tau seeding and propagation.</p>
