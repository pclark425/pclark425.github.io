                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Failure Model of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive breakdown of large-scale brain network connectivity, driven by a convergence of molecular, cellular, and vascular insults. The earliest detectable changes are functional network disruptions, which precede classical amyloid and tau pathology. Effective detection is possible by monitoring network-level biomarkers using advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques.</p>
