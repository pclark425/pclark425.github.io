                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral Platelet Tau/Aβ Signature as a Surrogate Biomarker for Central Neurodegeneration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the tau and Aβ protein signatures in circulating platelets mirror the molecular pathology occurring in the CNS during Alzheimer's disease. Platelets, which share key processing enzymes and precursor proteins with neurons, accumulate and process tau and Aβ in a manner that reflects central disease state, making them a minimally invasive, accessible surrogate for early detection and monitoring of neurodegeneration.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If platelet tau/Aβ signatures do not correlate with CNS pathology on imaging or postmortem, the surrogate model is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If platelet signatures are not altered in preclinical AD, the early detection claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If platelet signatures are equally abnormal in non-AD dementias, specificity is challenged.</li>

    <li>Some individuals with AD pathology may have normal platelet signatures. </li>
    <li>Platelet signatures may be altered by non-AD factors (e.g., medications, comorbidities). </li>
