                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory (Metabolic-Stress Extension)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the network-connectivity framework by positing that the metabolic demands imposed by network connectivity patterns mediate selective vulnerability in the visual cortex. Neuronal populations with high centrality or long-range connectivity experience greater metabolic stress, leading to increased susceptibility to amyloid-β and tau pathology, while locally connected populations maintain metabolic homeostasis and are more resistant.</p>

                <li>Artificially increasing metabolic demand in a resistant, locally connected population will render it vulnerable to Aβ and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Genetic or pharmacological interventions that decouple network centrality from metabolic stress will alter the pattern of selective vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Long-term reduction of network activity in hub neurons will delay the onset of pathology.</li>

                <li>Finding that reducing metabolic stress in hub neurons does not alter their susceptibility to pathology would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing that locally connected, low-metabolic-rate populations are highly vulnerable would falsify the theory.</li>

    <li>The influence of glial support and local microenvironment is not incorporated. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
