                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Digital-Pathobiological Detection Theory of Alzheimer's Disease (IDPD-AD): Network Vulnerability and Digital Phenotype Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is initiated by selective vulnerability of specific brain networks (e.g., default mode, limbic, and language networks) to molecular pathologies (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation), and that these network disruptions manifest as quantifiable digital phenotypes in behavior, cognition, and sensorimotor function. The integration of network-level pathobiology with digital phenotyping enables precise mapping of disease onset, subtype, and progression.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Previously unrecognized digital phenotypes (e.g., micro-motor signatures) will be linked to specific network pathologies.</li>
                <li>Some individuals may show digital phenotype progression without detectable network pathology, suggesting alternative mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Network-based digital phenotyping will identify preclinical AD in individuals with atypical presentations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If digital phenotypes do not map to network pathology, the mapping law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If digital phenotype progression does not mirror network pathology progression, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If network-based digital phenotyping does not improve subtyping or prediction, the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Individuals with mixed or atypical pathology (e.g., vascular, Lewy body) may not fit network-digital mapping. </li>
    <li>High cognitive reserve may mask digital phenotypes despite network pathology. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
