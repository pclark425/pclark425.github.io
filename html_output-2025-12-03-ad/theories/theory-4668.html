                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4668</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Vulnerability and Propagation Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is initiated and propagated through selective vulnerability of large-scale brain networks, particularly those with high metabolic demand and connectivity (e.g., the default mode network). The model asserts that pathological processes (amyloid, tau, inflammation) preferentially target these networks, and that disease spreads via network-based mechanisms (e.g., trans-synaptic propagation, activity-dependent vulnerability). Early detection is possible by identifying network dysfunction before overt pathology or clinical symptoms.</p>
