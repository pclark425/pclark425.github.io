                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Selective Vulnerability (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by a gradient of both connectivity (especially long-range synaptic integration) and metabolic demand. Neurons with higher connectivity and metabolic rates are more susceptible to neurodegenerative insults, while those with lower connectivity and metabolic rates are more resistant. This gradient operates across cell types, laminae, and microcircuits, and is modulated by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.</p>

    <li>Neuronal populations with extensive synaptic integration and high firing rates (e.g., associative pyramidal neurons) show early and severe pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Regions and cell types with high metabolic rates (e.g., as measured by cytochrome oxidase or glucose uptake) are more prone to neurodegeneration. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to the 'hub vulnerability' hypothesis, this law extends the concept to a graded, rather than categorical, model and applies it specifically to the visual cortex.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The association between high connectivity/metabolic demand and vulnerability is recognized in the context of network hub vulnerability in neurodegeneration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law generalizes the principle to a continuous gradient across all neuronal populations, not just hubs, and explicitly links both connectivity and metabolism as co-determinants.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity or metabolic demand of typically resistant neurons (e.g., via optogenetic stimulation or genetic manipulation) will render them more vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Selective enhancement of metabolic efficiency in highly connected neurons will confer resistance to pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If low-connectivity, low-metabolic neurons show equal or greater vulnerability than high-connectivity, high-metabolic neurons, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If interventions that reduce metabolic demand in vulnerable neurons do not alter their susceptibility to pathology, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cell-type specific molecular factors (e.g., receptor expression, proteostasis mechanisms) that may confer vulnerability independent of connectivity or metabolism. </li>
    <li>Regional differences in vascular supply or blood-brain barrier integrity that may modulate vulnerability. </li>
