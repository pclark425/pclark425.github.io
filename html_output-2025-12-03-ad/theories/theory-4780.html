                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Excitotoxicity Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the gradient of metabolic demand and excitatory synaptic input. Neurons with high metabolic rates and sustained excitatory drive are more susceptible to proteopathic stress due to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium dysregulation, and impaired energy homeostasis, which synergize with amyloid-β and tau toxicity. Conversely, neurons with lower metabolic rates or predominantly inhibitory input are more resistant.</p>

                <li>Inhibitory interneurons will remain largely unaffected in early stages of Alzheimer's disease in the visual cortex.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing metabolic rate or excitatory input in resistant neurons will render them vulnerable to amyloid-β/tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Genetic variants that lower neuronal metabolic rates will protect against visual cortex pathology in Alzheimer's models.</li>
                <li>Chronic metabolic stress in the absence of amyloid-β/tau will not be sufficient to induce pathology, suggesting a synergistic effect.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high metabolic rate and excitatory input are not vulnerable to amyloid-β/tau pathology, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If inhibitory neurons with low metabolic rate and excitatory input become vulnerable, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If reducing metabolic rate or excitatory input does not confer resistance, the theory's sufficiency claim is undermined.</li>
