                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4658</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Threshold Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is triggered when a combination of genetic, metabolic, inflammatory, and environmental risk factors collectively surpass a threshold, leading to a cascade of neurodegenerative processes. Detection is most effective by integrating multi-modal risk profiling, including polygenic risk, metabolic markers, and inflammatory signatures, rather than relying on single biomarkers.</p>
