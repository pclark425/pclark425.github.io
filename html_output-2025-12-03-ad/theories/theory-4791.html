                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Metabolic Phenotype Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology in dementia is governed by the interplay between their network connectivity patterns and intrinsic metabolic phenotypes. Neurons with extensive, energetically demanding connectivity (e.g., long-range projections, high synaptic density) and high metabolic rates are more susceptible to pathological insults, while those with local connectivity and lower metabolic demand are more resistant. This framework integrates structural, functional, and metabolic properties to explain the spatial and cell-type-specific patterns of neurodegeneration.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the metabolic rate of locally connected neurons will not increase their vulnerability unless their connectivity is also altered.</li>
                <li>Transplanting highly connected, high-metabolism neurons into a region of local connectivity and low metabolism will transfer their vulnerability profile only if both properties are maintained.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high connectivity and high metabolism are found to be resistant to amyloid and tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If locally connected, low-metabolism neurons are found to be highly vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of glial cells and their metabolic interactions with neurons is not addressed. </li>
    <li>Genetic factors that may override connectivity/metabolic effects are not considered. </li>
