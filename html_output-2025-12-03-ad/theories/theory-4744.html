                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Resource Allocation Theory of Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability in the visual cortex arises from the interplay between network-level resource allocation (i.e., the distribution of synaptic, metabolic, and proteostatic resources) and the demands imposed by connectivity. Neurons that are central to information flow (network hubs) and have high resource demands are more likely to experience resource exhaustion, leading to increased susceptibility to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Redistributing network load (e.g., via targeted synaptic pruning or stimulation) will shift the pattern of vulnerability within the visual cortex.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing the resource demand of peripheral neurons will increase their vulnerability to pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If network hubs do not show greater vulnerability than peripheral nodes, the theory is challenged.</li>
