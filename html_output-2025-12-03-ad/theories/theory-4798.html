                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their network connectivity and patterns of activity-dependent signaling. Highly interconnected and metabolically active populations are more susceptible to Aβ/tau pathology due to increased synaptic activity, higher metabolic demand, and greater exposure to trans-synaptic spread of pathological proteins. Conversely, sparsely connected or less active populations are more resistant.</p>
