                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic-Peripheral Trigger Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease is initiated by chronic peripheral (systemic) factors—such as inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, or microbiome-derived signals—that prime the brain's immune system. This priming leads to maladaptive microglial responses to amyloid and tau, resulting in synaptic loss and neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying peripheral biomarkers that reflect this priming state.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Epidemiological studies link chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome to increased Alzheimer's risk. </li>

    <li>Peripheral infections and chronic inflammatory diseases are associated with higher incidence of Alzheimer's. </li>
    <li>Metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are risk factors for Alzheimer's, possibly via systemic inflammation. </li>
    <li>Microglial priming is observed in aged and systemically inflamed animals, leading to increased neuroinflammation upon secondary insult. </li>
