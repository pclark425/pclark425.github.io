                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4696</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic-Peripheral Feedback Loop Theory for Alzheimer's Pathogenesis and Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is not solely a CNS disorder, but involves a dynamic feedback loop between the brain and peripheral systems (immune, metabolic, vascular). Early CNS pathology triggers peripheral immune and metabolic responses, which in turn modulate CNS disease progression. Peripheral biomarkers thus reflect both CNS pathology and systemic feedback, enabling early detection and providing insight into disease-modifying mechanisms.</p>
