                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4692</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic Pathophysiological Synchronization Theory for Early Alzheimer's Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is characterized by a synchronized onset of pathophysiological processes—such as proteostasis failure, chronic inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation—across both the CNS and peripheral organs. This synchronization is driven by bidirectional signaling (e.g., via exosomes, cytokines, metabolic intermediates) and results in temporally aligned biomarker changes in accessible peripheral tissues, enabling early detection and staging of AD.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>If bidirectional signaling blockade (e.g., exosome inhibition) does not disrupt peripheral-CNS biomarker synchronization, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
