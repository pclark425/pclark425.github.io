                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease, and how it can be effectively detected, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In amyloid‑positive individuals, crossing a defined plasma P‑tau217 concentration threshold predicts conversion from tau‑negative to tau‑positive status on PET within a bounded time window (approximately 24 months). The model specifies a quantitative threshold and a temporal horizon for conversion, integrating amyloid status as a prerequisite.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Baseline plasma P‑tau217 was the single strongest predictor of 240‑week PACC decline in the A4/LEARN cohort; higher tertiles showed graded risk of progression to CDR‑GS ≥ 0.5 (over 50% incidence by 240 weeks). <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.1" class="evidence-link">[e7955.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Plasma P‑tau217 predicted amyloid PET positivity (global Centiloid > 33) with AUC = 0.89, and contributed the largest unique R² to cognitive decline models, indicating its prognostic power beyond imaging biomarkers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.1" class="evidence-link">[e7955.1]</a> </li>
    <li>P‑tau217 tertiles showed a dose‑response relationship with cognitive and functional decline; the highest tertile had markedly higher risk of conversion to dementia. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.1" class="evidence-link">[e7955.1]</a> </li>
    <li>In multivariable commonality analyses, plasma P‑tau217 explained the largest unique variance for 240‑week PACC change, outperforming other fluid and imaging markers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.1" class="evidence-link">[e7955.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Contradictory evidence: in autosomal‑dominant AD, plasma and CSF P‑tau217 may rise before PET‑detectable amyloid, suggesting that P‑tau217 can precede amyloid PET thresholds and may not strictly follow the amyloid‑first ordering. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7922.html#e7922.2" class="evidence-link">[e7922.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Plasma P‑tau181 (a closely related phosphorylated tau species) predicted tau PET positivity across Braak regions with AUCs 0.86–0.90, and added unique predictive variance beyond amyloid PET, supporting the principle that plasma phosphorylated tau reflects emerging tau pathology detectable by PET. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.8" class="evidence-link">[e7955.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Plasma P‑tau181 showed strong correlations with tau PET SUVR in temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices (r ≈ 0.70), and predicted conversion to tau‑positive PET status with high accuracy (AUC > 0.85). <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.8" class="evidence-link">[e7955.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Both plasma P‑tau217 and P‑tau181 contributed unique variance to models of cognitive decline, indicating that peripheral phosphorylated tau captures aspects of tau pathology not fully captured by PET alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.1" class="evidence-link">[e7955.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7955.html#e7955.8" class="evidence-link">[e7955.8]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The rule refines existing correlational findings into a specific predictive threshold with a temporal horizon, enabling prospective identification of individuals on the cusp of tau pathology emergence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Plasma phosphorylated tau (P‑tau181/217) correlates with tau PET burden and predicts cognitive decline; amyloid positivity generally precedes tau positivity in AD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> A concrete, quantitative plasma P‑tau217 threshold that, when crossed in amyloid‑positive individuals, predicts tau PET conversion within a defined 24‑month window, providing a clinically actionable rule for early intervention.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a prospective amyloid‑positive cohort, individuals whose plasma P‑tau217 rises above the defined threshold will show tau PET conversion (from negative to positive) within 12–18 months in >80 % of cases.</li>
                <li>Applying the threshold rule to a new sample will yield sensitivity > 80 % and specificity > 70 % for predicting tau PET conversion within 24 months, outperforming models based on amyloid PET alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If anti‑tau monoclonal antibodies are administered to amyloid‑positive, P‑tau217‑high individuals, the threshold crossing may be delayed, testing whether peripheral P‑tau217 is causally linked to tau aggregation.</li>
                <li>In carriers of familial APP mutations, the plasma P‑tau217 threshold may be crossed several years earlier than in sporadic cases, potentially redefining the temporal dynamics of tau PET conversion in this subgroup.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If >30 % of amyloid‑positive participants with plasma P‑tau217 above the threshold fail to convert to tau‑positive PET within 24 months, the threshold rule would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If longitudinal plasma P‑tau217 measurements show large intra‑individual fluctuations without corresponding changes in tau PET status, the stability and predictive utility of the threshold would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A‑T+ PET participants (amyloid‑negative, tau‑positive) challenge the amyloid‑first ordering and are not explained by a model that requires amyloid positivity before tau conversion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7924.html#e7924.1" class="evidence-link">[e7924.1]</a> </li>
