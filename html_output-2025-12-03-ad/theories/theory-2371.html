                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic Platelet-CNS Crosstalk in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that platelets are not merely passive reporters of CNS pathology, but actively participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease through bidirectional molecular exchange with the brain. Platelet-derived tau and Aβ can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under pathological conditions, contributing to central amyloid and tau deposition, while CNS-derived factors modulate platelet phenotype, creating a feed-forward loop that accelerates neurodegeneration.</p>
