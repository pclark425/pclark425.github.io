                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple, interacting disruptions in neural network homeostasis, including proteinopathy (amyloid and tau), neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation. These disruptions collectively destabilize large-scale brain networks, leading to progressive cognitive decline. Detection is most effective when targeting early, network-level changes rather than single biomarkers.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Amyloid and tau pathologies are necessary but not sufficient for AD; neuroinflammation and vascular dysfunction are also implicated in disease progression. </li>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows early network-level changes before overt atrophy or clinical symptoms. </li>
    <li>Multimodal biomarker studies indicate that individuals with both amyloid and tau pathology plus evidence of neuroinflammation or vascular dysfunction have higher rates of cognitive decline. </li>
    <li>Postmortem studies reveal that AD brains often show a combination of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, microglial activation, and microvascular pathology. </li>
    <li>Longitudinal studies show that the presence of multiple pathologies predicts faster progression to dementia. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While each component has been studied, the integrated, convergent model emphasizing network-level effects is a new synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Amyloid and tau pathologies, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction have each been individually implicated in AD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit requirement of their convergence and the focus on network-level disruption as the primary driver of disease progression is novel.</p>
