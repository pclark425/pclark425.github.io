                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined primarily by their network connectivity and projection patterns. Neurons with long-range corticocortical projections (especially large pyramidal neurons in layers III and V) are disproportionately vulnerable to tau pathology (neurofibrillary tangles), while neurons with predominantly local or short-range connections (such as those in primary visual cortex, area 17/V1) are relatively resistant, especially in early and mid-stages of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β plaque deposition, in contrast, is less selective and accumulates at the termini of diverse neuronal and glial processes, leading to a more heterogeneous and regionally variable pattern of vulnerability. The interplay between projection architecture, synaptic connectivity, and the anatomical progression of pathology underlies the observed patterns of selective neuronal degeneration.</p>

                <li>Neurons with long-range projections in other cortical regions will also show increased tau pathology compared to local circuit neurons.</li>
                <li>Regions with a higher density of long-range projection neurons will develop tau pathology earlier than regions dominated by local circuits.</li>
                <li>Amyloid plaques in V1 will contain neurites from multiple sources, including subcortical afferents, even in the absence of local NFT.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the proportion of long-range projection neurons in V1 will increase its vulnerability to tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting long-range connectivity in association cortex will delay the onset of tau pathology in those regions.</li>
                <li>Selective ablation of subcortical afferents will alter the composition but not the overall burden of amyloid plaques in V1.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that local circuit neurons in V1 develop tau pathology as early or earlier than long-range projection neurons would refute the projection-dependence law.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that amyloid plaques in V1 are derived exclusively from a single neuronal population would contradict the plaque heterogeneity law.</li>
                <li>Observing that regions with few long-range projections develop tau pathology at the same rate as those with many would challenge the theory.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Compartment-specific synaptic vulnerability within individual neurons (e.g., apical vs basal dendrites) is not explained by this theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6296.html#e6296.0" class="evidence-link">[e6296.0]</a> </li>
