                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Collapse and Clearance Failure Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where the brain's ability to clear misfolded proteins (amyloid-beta, tau, and others) collapses due to age, genetic, and environmental factors. This collapse leads to toxic protein accumulation, which in turn impairs cellular clearance mechanisms (e.g., autophagy, glymphatic system), creating a vicious cycle. Early detection is best achieved by measuring proteostatic stress markers and clearance efficiency, rather than static protein levels.</p>
