                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Selective Vulnerability (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the interplay between their network connectivity (both local and long-range) and their intrinsic metabolic demand. Neurons with high connectivity and high metabolic rates are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation due to increased synaptic activity, greater exposure to extracellular factors, and higher oxidative/metabolic stress, whereas neurons with lower connectivity and metabolic rates are more resistant.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Highly connected hub neurons in the cortex show greater amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>
    <li>Neurons with high metabolic rates are more prone to oxidative stress and protein aggregation. </li>
    <li>Regions with high synaptic activity accumulate more amyloid-β in both human and animal models. </li>
    <li>Functional MRI studies show that default mode network hubs, which are highly connected and metabolically active, are early sites of amyloid deposition. </li>
    <li>Visual association areas with higher connectivity are more affected in posterior cortical atrophy, a visual variant of Alzheimer's disease. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing hub vulnerability and metabolic stress theories, the explicit integration of both factors as a gradient is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Previous work has shown that highly connected brain regions (hubs) are more vulnerable to neurodegeneration, and that metabolic stress is linked to protein aggregation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly combines connectivity and metabolic demand as a joint determinant of selective vulnerability, rather than considering them in isolation.</p>
