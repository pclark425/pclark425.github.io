                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Connectivity Synergy Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the synergistic interaction between their network connectivity and metabolic demand. Neurons with high connectivity (especially long-range) have elevated metabolic requirements, making them more susceptible to proteostatic stress and pathological protein accumulation.</p>

            <ol>
