                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Activity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their network connectivity and activity patterns. Neurons that are highly interconnected, receive dense excitatory input, or participate in recurrent activity loops are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation due to increased synaptic stress, local inflammation, and activity-dependent protein trafficking.</p>
