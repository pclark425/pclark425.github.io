                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Topology-Metabolic Coupling Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the interplay between their position in the cortical network (network topology, e.g., hubness, centrality) and their metabolic phenotype (e.g., mitochondrial efficiency, glycolytic capacity). Neurons that are network hubs with high centrality and low metabolic reserve are most susceptible to proteopathic stress, while peripheral or metabolically robust neurons are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Reducing network centrality (e.g., by synaptic pruning) in metabolically vulnerable neurons will decrease their susceptibility to amyloid and tau pathology.</li>

                <li>Network hubs with low metabolic reserve will show the earliest pathology in the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing network centrality in metabolically robust neurons will not increase their vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network topology without altering metabolic reserve will not induce pathology.</li>
                <li>Boosting metabolic reserve in network hubs will delay, but not fully prevent, pathology if amyloid burden is high.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If network hub neurons with high metabolic reserve are still highly vulnerable, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If peripheral neurons with low metabolic reserve are equally vulnerable, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If altering network topology does not affect vulnerability, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of local microenvironmental factors (e.g., glial support, vascularization) is not addressed. </li>
    <li>Genetic and epigenetic modifiers of metabolic reserve are not incorporated. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
