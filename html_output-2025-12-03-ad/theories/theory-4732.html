                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4732</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Propagation and Local Defense Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the interplay between large-scale network-driven propagation of misfolded proteins and the local defense mechanisms (e.g., autophagy, antioxidant response, glial support) of each neuronal population. Neurons that are highly embedded in long-range, high-traffic network hubs are more likely to receive and propagate pathology, but only succumb if their local defense mechanisms are insufficient.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing network traffic to a resistant population will only induce vulnerability if local defense mechanisms are simultaneously impaired.</li>
                <li>Selective enhancement of local defense in non-hub neurons will not significantly alter their already low vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Blocking trans-synaptic spread in the visual cortex will prevent pathology even in populations with weak local defense.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding network hub neurons with high pathology traffic and weak local defense that remain resistant would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing rapid pathology accumulation in non-hub, low-traffic neurons with strong local defense would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that local defense enhancement does not protect high-traffic neurons would challenge the threshold law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Some non-hub neurons accumulate pathology in late-stage disease, possibly due to secondary mechanisms. </li>
