                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Embedded Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their position and role within cortical and subcortical neural networks. Neurons with high centrality, extensive long-range connectivity, or high synaptic activity are more exposed to pathological protein spread and metabolic stress, making them more vulnerable, while neurons with more local, modular, or less active network roles are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality of resistant neurons will render them vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high network centrality are not more vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
