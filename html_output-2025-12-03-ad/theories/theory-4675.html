                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-4675</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from a systems-level breakdown in neural network homeostasis, driven by the convergence of proteostatic failure (amyloid and tau misfolding), chronic neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction. This network failure precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and can be detected by multi-modal biomarkers reflecting these converging pathologies.</p>

                <li>Interventions targeting all four pathologies simultaneously will be more effective at preventing AD than those targeting only amyloid or tau.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with all four pathologies do not develop network failure or AD, the theory is challenged.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some individuals with significant amyloid and tau pathology remain cognitively normal for life. </li>
    <li>Rare genetic forms of AD may not follow the same multi-factorial convergence. </li>
