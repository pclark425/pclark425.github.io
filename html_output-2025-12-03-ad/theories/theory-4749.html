                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Proteostatic Stress Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the interplay between neuronal activity patterns and the capacity for proteostatic maintenance. Neurons with high, sustained synaptic activity and limited proteostatic capacity (e.g., autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system) accumulate misfolded proteins and are more susceptible to pathology, while neurons with lower activity or enhanced proteostatic mechanisms are resistant.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Neurons with high firing rates and metabolic demand are early sites of pathology in Alzheimer's disease, including in the visual cortex. </li>
    <li>Impaired autophagy and proteasome function are linked to increased protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. </li>
    <li>Visual cortical neurons with high activity show greater amyloid-β and tau accumulation in both human and animal models. </li>
