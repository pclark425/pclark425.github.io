                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit-Contextual Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their unique circuit context—specifically, their patterns of connectivity, input-output relationships, and integration within local and long-range networks. Neurons with high convergence of excitatory input, strong recurrent connectivity, and integration into high-frequency oscillatory circuits are more susceptible to proteopathic stress, while those embedded in inhibitory-dominated or sparsely connected circuits are more resistant.</p>
