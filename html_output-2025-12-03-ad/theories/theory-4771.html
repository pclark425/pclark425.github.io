                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability: Transcriptional and Proteomic Determinants</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is governed by their intrinsic molecular signatures—specifically, their unique transcriptional and proteomic profiles. These signatures determine the expression of key genes and proteins involved in amyloid and tau processing, synaptic maintenance, stress response, and proteostasis, thereby predisposing certain neuronal subtypes to degeneration while conferring resilience to others.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Single-cell RNA-seq studies show that vulnerable neurons in Alzheimer's disease express higher levels of APP and tau, and lower levels of chaperones and autophagy genes. </li>
    <li>Proteomic analyses reveal that neurons with reduced stress response proteins are more prone to degeneration in AD. </li>
    <li>Cell-type-specific transcriptomic profiling in the visual cortex reveals that neurons with high expression of amyloidogenic and tau-related genes are more likely to accumulate pathology. </li>
    <li>Experimental overexpression of APP or tau in neurons increases their susceptibility to amyloid and tau pathology. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has identified some molecular correlates of vulnerability, this law formalizes the relationship as a conditional, predictive rule and integrates both amyloid and tau pathways.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that certain neurons express higher levels of APP and tau, and that proteostasis genes are neuroprotective.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit conditional linking of transcriptional/proteomic signatures to selective vulnerability in the visual cortex, and the integration of both amyloid and tau pathways, is novel.</p>
