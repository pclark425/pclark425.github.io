                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined primarily by their intrinsic molecular signatures, including expression of proteostasis-related genes, synaptic and cytoskeletal remodeling programs, and innate immune signaling pathways. These cell-intrinsic factors, rather than solely regional or network context, dictate the propensity for pathological aggregation and degeneration.</p>
