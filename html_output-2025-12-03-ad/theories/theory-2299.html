                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Multifactorial Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple interacting biological, environmental, and lifestyle factors, which together trigger a cascade of molecular and cellular events leading to neurodegeneration. Rather than a single causative agent, the theory emphasizes the dynamic interplay between genetic predisposition, metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, vascular compromise, and environmental exposures, with the disease process initiated and accelerated by the cumulative burden of these factors. Early detection is possible by identifying the unique signature of this multifactorial cascade through a combination of molecular, imaging, and digital biomarkers.</p>
