                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Gut Microbiota–Neuroinflammation–Vascular Axis in AD Pathogenesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alterations in gut microbiota composition and function lead to increased production of metabolites such as trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), which cross or signal through the blood-brain barrier to promote neuroinflammation, microglial/astrocyte activation, and small-vessel disease. This axis accelerates amyloid and tau pathology and cognitive decline, representing a modifiable, non-CNS driver of AD pathogenesis. The theory integrates evidence from animal models, human studies, and mechanistic links between TMAO, neuroinflammation, vascular injury, and AD core pathologies.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Elevated TMAO in 3×Tg-AD mouse serum; TMAO upregulated in AD mouse models and reported in human plasma, CSF, and brain of AD subjects; TMAO promotes neuroinflammation, white matter degeneration, and cognitive decline. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6192.html#e6192.3" class="evidence-link">[e6192.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Cited human and animal studies report elevated TMAO in plasma, CSF, or brain of AD subjects and correlations between peripheral and central TMAO levels, plus experimental evidence that TMAO promotes neuroinflammation and synaptic deficits. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6192.html#e6192.3" class="evidence-link">[e6192.3]</a> </li>
    <li>TMAO is a gut microbial metabolite of dietary choline/carnitine, linking intestinal dysbiosis to AD pathogenesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6192.html#e6192.3" class="evidence-link">[e6192.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Peripheral TMAO may cross/affect the blood–brain barrier or signal via immune activation to promote neuroinflammation, white matter degeneration and cognitive decline. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6192.html#e6192.3" class="evidence-link">[e6192.3]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The gut-brain axis is an emerging area in AD research; this law is a novel, specific formalization for AD, integrating TMAO, neuroinflammation, vascular injury, and amyloid/tau pathology.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The gut-brain axis and TMAO's role in vascular disease are recognized; its direct role in AD pathogenesis is emerging.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the causal chain from gut microbiota to neuroinflammation and vascular injury as a driver of AD, integrating it with core pathologies and proposing a modifiable, non-CNS driver of AD.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Interventions that reduce TMAO production (e.g., dietary modification, microbiota-targeted therapies, antibiotics, or TMAO synthesis inhibitors) will decrease neuroinflammation and slow cognitive decline in at-risk individuals or AD mouse models.</li>
                <li>Individuals with high TMAO and evidence of microvascular injury (e.g., MRI white matter hyperintensities) will show faster progression from MCI to AD compared to those with low TMAO.</li>
                <li>Fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy donors to AD mouse models will reduce TMAO, neuroinflammation, and slow or reverse cognitive decline.</li>
                <li>Dietary choline/carnitine restriction in AD mouse models will reduce TMAO, neuroinflammation, and amyloid/tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy donors to AD patients will reduce TMAO, neuroinflammation, and slow or reverse cognitive decline.</li>
                <li>Novel small-molecule inhibitors of TMAO synthesis will prevent or delay onset of AD in high-risk human populations.</li>
                <li>Long-term dietary interventions targeting TMAO precursors will reduce AD incidence in prospective human cohorts.</li>
                <li>Manipulation of gut microbiota composition (e.g., via probiotics or engineered bacteria) will reduce TMAO and AD biomarker progression in preclinical AD.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that TMAO reduction (by any means) has no effect on neuroinflammation, amyloid/tau pathology, or AD progression in animal models or humans would refute the causal role of this axis.</li>
                <li>Finding that individuals with high TMAO but no neuroinflammation, microvascular injury, or cognitive decline exist in large numbers would challenge the law.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that TMAO elevation is a consequence, not a cause, of neuroinflammation or AD pathology would call the directionality of the law into question.</li>
                <li>Showing that TMAO-lowering interventions do not alter AD biomarkers or clinical progression in randomized controlled trials would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
