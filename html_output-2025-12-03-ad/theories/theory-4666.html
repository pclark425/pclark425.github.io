                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration Threshold Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is initiated and progresses when the cumulative burden of multiple pathological cascades (amyloid, tau, vascular, metabolic, immune) causes the brain's functional and structural networks to cross a critical threshold of disintegration. This threshold is modulated by genetic, environmental, and resilience factors. Detection is most effective by identifying early network-level changes, which precede overt clinical symptoms.</p>
