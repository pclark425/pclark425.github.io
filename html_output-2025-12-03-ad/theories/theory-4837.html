                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Topology and Synaptic Seeding Threshold Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective resistance of V1 to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from a combination of (1) its network topology—characterized by fewer long-range, high-degree hub connections compared to association cortex—and (2) a higher synaptic seeding threshold, requiring more intense or sustained activity to initiate aggregation. The sparse, modular connectivity of V1 limits the efficiency of aggregate propagation, while the higher threshold for synaptic seeding events further impedes the initiation of pathology.</p>
