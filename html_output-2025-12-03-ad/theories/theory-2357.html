                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2357</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Homeostatic Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease results from a progressive failure of the brain's homeostatic mechanisms to maintain synaptic, proteostatic, and metabolic balance in the face of age-related and environmental stressors. The breakdown of these adaptive systems leads to the accumulation of pathological proteins, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately neurodegeneration. Detection should focus on early markers of homeostatic stress and compensatory failure, such as synaptic activity changes, proteostasis network collapse, and metabolic inflexibility.</p>

                <li>Restoring homeostatic function in aged brains will reverse early AD pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with robust homeostatic markers still develop AD at the same rate as those with impaired markers, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If amyloid/tau pathology develops in the absence of any detectable homeostatic stress, the theory is called into question.</li>
