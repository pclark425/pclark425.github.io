            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a cohort of cognitively normal adults, individuals with plasma IL‑12p70 and IFN‑γ above the identified thresholds will exhibit a >30% faster increase in tau PET SUVR over 3 years compared to low‑inflammation peers.</li>
                <li>Therapeutic anti‑inflammatory treatment (e.g., NSAIDs) reducing plasma IL‑12p70 by 20% will correspondingly slow tau PET progression by ~15%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If peripheral cytokine blockade (e.g., anti‑IL‑12 antibodies) is initiated in preclinical AD, it may prevent conversion to amyloid positivity, a hypothesis with uncertain outcome.</li>
                <li>In individuals with chronic systemic infections, elevated cytokines may mimic AD‑related tau acceleration, potentially leading to false‑positive tau PET predictions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If plasma IL‑12p70 and IFN‑γ levels do not correlate with tau PET progression after adjusting for age, APOE4, and baseline amyloid, the proposed causal link is invalid.</li>
                <li>If CHI3L1 and CHIT1 levels are not associated with neurodegeneration markers in an independent cohort, their utility as plasma tau‑dependent markers is refuted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>APOE4 carriers have lower soluble plasma Aβ42 and Aβ42/40 ratio, which may confound inflammation‑related predictions (e7957.2). <a href="../results/extraction-result-7957.html#e7957.2" class="evidence-link">[e7957.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
