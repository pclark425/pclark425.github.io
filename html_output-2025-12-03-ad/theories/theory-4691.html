                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral-Accessible Biomarker Convergence Theory for Early Alzheimer's Detection (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is reflected by a convergence of molecular, cellular, and systemic biomarkers in peripheral tissues (e.g., blood, saliva, retina) that mirror early central nervous system (CNS) pathology. The convergence arises from shared pathophysiological processes—such as proteostasis disruption, neuroinflammation, and metabolic dysregulation—that manifest in both the brain and periphery, enabling early, non-invasive detection of AD risk and onset.</p>
