                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Microenvironmental Modulation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the local microenvironment, including glial cell support, neurovascular integrity, and immune milieu. Neurons embedded in regions with robust glial support, efficient waste clearance, and anti-inflammatory signaling are resistant, while those in compromised microenvironments are vulnerable.</p>

                <li>Disruption of neurovascular integrity in previously resistant visual cortical regions will increase amyloid-β accumulation and vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Regions with high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines will show lower pathology compared to pro-inflammatory regions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Modulating the immune milieu (e.g., anti-inflammatory cytokines) in resistant visual cortex will confer vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Enhancing perivascular clearance in vulnerable regions will reverse or prevent pathology.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing glial support in already resistant regions will further decrease pathology, possibly below detectable levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If enhancing glial support or neurovascular integrity does not confer resistance, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If resistant regions develop pathology despite robust microenvironmental support, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If vulnerable populations are found in microenvironments with high glial and vascular support, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some vulnerable populations are found in regions with apparently intact glial and vascular support, suggesting additional factors are involved. </li>
