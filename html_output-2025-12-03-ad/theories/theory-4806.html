                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Metabolic Gradient Theory of Visual Cortex Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by a gradient of both intrinsic metabolic demand and network connectivity centrality. Neurons with high metabolic rates and central positions in cortical connectivity are more susceptible to neurodegenerative pathology, while those with lower metabolic demands and peripheral connectivity are more resistant.</p>
