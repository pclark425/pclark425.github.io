                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory (Adaptive Feedback Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease is driven by maladaptive feedback loops between the CNS and peripheral systems, where changes in one compartment (e.g., CNS amyloid accumulation) trigger compensatory or pathological responses in the periphery (e.g., immune activation, metabolic shifts), which in turn feed back to exacerbate CNS pathology. The flux of biomarkers is dynamically regulated by these feedbacks, and breakdown of adaptive feedback leads to runaway pathology. Detection and intervention should focus on identifying and modulating these feedback loops.</p>
