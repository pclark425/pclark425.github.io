                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis-Immune Coupling Gradient Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective vulnerability in the visual cortex arises from a gradient of cell-intrinsic coupling between proteostasis and immune signaling pathways. Neurons with tightly coupled, adaptive proteostasis-immune responses are resistant, while those with decoupled or maladaptive responses are vulnerable to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Recent studies show that proteostasis stress can trigger adaptive immune responses in some neurons, leading to increased resilience. </li>
    <li>Single-cell data reveal that some neurons upregulate both chaperones and anti-inflammatory genes in response to early pathology. </li>
    <li>Neurons with robust unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and anti-inflammatory gene expression are less likely to accumulate Aβ and tau aggregates. </li>
    <li>Transcriptomic analyses of resistant neurons show co-expression of proteostasis and immune regulatory genes. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior theory frames selective vulnerability as a function of a cell-intrinsic proteostasis-immune coupling gradient; this is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Proteostasis and immune signaling are known to interact, and some studies have shown that immune responses can be neuroprotective.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit prediction that the degree of cell-intrinsic coupling between these pathways forms a gradient that determines selective vulnerability is new.</p>
