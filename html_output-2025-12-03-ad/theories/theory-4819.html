                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability (General Formulation 2: Dynamic Signature Modulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the static molecular signature model by proposing that neuronal vulnerability or resistance to Aβ and tau pathology in the visual cortex is determined by the dynamic modulation of intrinsic molecular signatures in response to environmental, developmental, and activity-dependent cues. The ability of a neuronal population to adapt its molecular signature over time (plasticity) is a key determinant of its long-term susceptibility or resilience.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Neuronal gene expression profiles change in response to synaptic activity, stress, and aging. </li>
    <li>Epigenetic modifications and activity-dependent transcriptional programs can alter vulnerability to neurodegeneration. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While plasticity of gene expression is established, its direct role in modulating proteopathic vulnerability as a unifying principle is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that neuronal gene expression is plastic and can be modulated by activity and environment.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between dynamic modulation of the molecular signature and changes in vulnerability to Aβ/tau pathology is novel.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends the concept of plasticity to a predictive determinant of vulnerability in the context of Aβ/tau pathology.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Plasticity is known to be neuroprotective in some contexts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the relationship between molecular signature plasticity and resistance to proteopathic stress.</p>

                <li>Environmental enrichment will delay or reduce Aβ/tau pathology in the visual cortex by promoting adaptive molecular changes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial induction of signature plasticity in otherwise vulnerable neurons may confer long-term resistance to proteopathic stress.</li>
                <li>Transient environmental or pharmacological interventions that boost plasticity during critical periods may have lasting protective effects.</li>
                <li>There may exist a threshold of plasticity below which neurons cannot adapt and become irreversibly vulnerable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing molecular signature plasticity does not alter vulnerability to Aβ/tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If neurons with high plasticity are equally or more vulnerable than those with low plasticity, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If dynamic changes in molecular signature do not correlate with changes in pathology, the theory would be incomplete.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not directly address the role of non-neuronal cells (e.g., glia) or systemic factors in modulating vulnerability. </li>
