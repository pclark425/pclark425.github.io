                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Failure Model of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Alzheimer's disease arises from the progressive breakdown of large-scale brain network connectivity, driven by the interplay of molecular pathologies (amyloid-beta, tau, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction) that disrupt synaptic and neuronal communication. This network disintegration precedes and predicts clinical symptoms, and can be detected by advanced neuroimaging and network-based biomarkers before overt neurodegeneration.</p>
