                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Microenvironmental Gradient Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles is determined by fine-scale gradients in the local microenvironment, including oxygenation, metabolic substrate availability, glial support, and vascular proximity. Neurons located in microdomains with suboptimal support are more susceptible to proteopathic stress and aggregate formation, while those in microdomains with robust support are more resistant.</p>
