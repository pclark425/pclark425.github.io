                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Air Pollution–Epigenetic–Amyloid/Tau Axis in Alzheimer's Disease: Systemic-Inflammatory Amplification Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the cause of Alzheimer's disease and how it can be effectively detected.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that air pollution exposure induces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn drive epigenetic reprogramming in both peripheral immune cells and the brain. This reprogramming amplifies neuroinflammatory responses and disrupts amyloid/tau homeostasis, accelerating Alzheimer's disease onset and progression.</p>
