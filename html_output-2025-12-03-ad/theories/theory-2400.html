                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Cell-Intrinsic Proteostatic Capacity Determines Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is governed by their intrinsic molecular proteostatic capacity. Neurons with robust proteostasis—encompassing protein quality control, degradation, and stress response systems—are more resilient to misfolded protein accumulation, while those with weaker proteostatic networks are more susceptible to pathology.</p>
