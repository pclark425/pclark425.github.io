                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cell-Intrinsic Proteostasis-Immune Signature Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that each neuronal population in the visual cortex possesses a unique cell-intrinsic proteostasis-immune signature, defined by the expression levels and responsiveness of key proteostasis and immune genes. Selective vulnerability or resistance to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by whether this signature crosses a critical threshold for adaptive response.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Small molecule drugs that boost the signature above threshold will prevent pathology in vivo.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal tracking of signature dynamics will predict conversion from resistance to vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Signature manipulation in vivo will alter disease progression in animal models.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If raising the signature above threshold does not confer resistance, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If neurons with below-threshold signatures are not vulnerable, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
