                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory of Neuronal Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations within the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined primarily by their intrinsic molecular signatures. These include proteostasis capacity, innate immune signaling (e.g., NF-κB/Rel regulon activity), synaptic/ion channel gene expression, and cytoskeletal protein content (e.g., N-PNFP). These cell-intrinsic properties, rather than solely regional or connectivity-based factors, dictate the propensity for pathological aggregation and degeneration.</p>

                <li>Neuronal populations in the visual cortex with experimentally increased proteostasis capacity (e.g., via upregulation of protein degradation genes) will show reduced tau aggregation after seeding.</li>
                <li>Inhibiting NF-κB/Rel activity in vulnerable excitatory neurons will reduce tau-induced transcriptional perturbation and cell loss.</li>
                <li>Neurons with high synaptic/ion channel gene expression in other cortical regions will also be more vulnerable to tau aggregation.</li>
                <li>Reducing N-PNFP content in vulnerable projection neurons will decrease their susceptibility to tau tangle formation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing N-PNFP content in resistant neurons will render them vulnerable to tau tangle formation.</li>
                <li>Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of human visual cortex in early AD will reveal previously unrecognized subpopulations with unique molecular signatures that predict vulnerability or resistance.</li>
                <li>Manipulating innate immune signaling in neurons (without affecting glia) will alter the regional pattern of tau pathology in vivo.</li>
                <li>Enhancing synaptic/ion channel gene expression in resistant neurons will increase their vulnerability to tau aggregation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that neurons with low proteostasis capacity are resistant to tau aggregation would challenge the proteostasis law.</li>
                <li>Finding that high NF-κB/Rel activity does not correlate with vulnerability in single-cell datasets would call the innate immune law into question.</li>
                <li>Observing that neurons with high synaptic/ion channel gene expression are resistant to tau aggregation would contradict the synaptic enrichment law.</li>
                <li>Finding that N-PNFP-rich neurons are resistant to tau tangle formation would challenge the cytoskeletal protein content law.</li>
