                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their patterns of synaptic activity and metabolic demand. Neurons with high baseline activity, frequent synaptic firing, and elevated metabolic rates are more susceptible to proteostatic stress and aggregation of amyloid-β and tau, while less active or more energy-efficient neurons are relatively resistant.</p>
