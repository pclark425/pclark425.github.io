                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective resistance or vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by the intrinsic cohesiveness and integration of their molecular maintenance pathways. Neurons with highly interconnected and robust homeostatic networks—spanning proteostasis, mitochondrial quality control, antioxidant defense, and synaptic regulation—are more resistant to Aβ and tau-induced stress, while those with fragmented or weakly integrated pathways are more vulnerable.</p>
