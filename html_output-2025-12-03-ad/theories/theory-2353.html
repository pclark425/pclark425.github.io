                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis is driven by a dynamic interplay between gut microbiota dysbiosis, systemic and neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction. Dysbiotic gut microbiota produce metabolites and immune signals that disrupt blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and promote peripheral immune activation. This, in turn, facilitates the trafficking of proinflammatory cells and molecules into the CNS, amplifying neuroinflammation and accelerating amyloid and tau pathology. The theory predicts that early detection of AD can be achieved by monitoring gut microbiota composition, systemic inflammatory markers, and vascular integrity.</p>

    <li>Gut dysbiosis is associated with increased systemic inflammation and BBB disruption in animal models and human studies. </li>
