                <p><strong>Extraction Query:</strong> Extract any mentions of proposed causes of Alzheimer's disease, supporting or refuting evidence for each cause, methods for detecting Alzheimer's disease (including biomarkers, imaging, cognitive tests, etc.), and the effectiveness of these detection methods (such as sensitivity, specificity, and stage of detection). Also extract any controversies, limitations, or counter-evidence related to causes or detection methods.</p>
