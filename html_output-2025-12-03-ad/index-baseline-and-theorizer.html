Dendritic compartments, particularly apical dendrites, are more vulnerable to spine loss and structural damage from local amyloid plaques, while somatic compartments can remain structurally preserved even when in direct contact with plaques. Axonal compartments show complex patterns with proximal segments accumulating tau while distal segments may show depletion. Synaptic compartments are early sites of tau seeding and show enrichment of seed-competent phosphorylated tau before overt pathology develops. This compartment-specific vulnerability explains why neurons can show partial dysfunction and selective loss of specific processes while maintaining overall viability.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection2-nov13-2025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Female-specific protective mechanisms can confer resistance to tau aggregation in specific neuronal populations and compartments (particularly axons and synapses) even in the presence of molecular AD signatures, while males show greater vulnerability. This protection involves modulation of inflammatory signaling, preservation of synaptic vesicle architecture, and regulation of tau phosphorylation and aggregation. However, in humans, females may show paradoxically greater cortical tau accumulation at advanced ages despite equivalent amyloid burdens, suggesting complex, age-dependent sex differences in vulnerability that may involve amplification mechanisms in specific contexts.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection2-nov13-2025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Molecular Identity and Proteostasis Capacity Theory<br><b>Description:</b> Selective neuronal vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology is fundamentally determined by cell-intrinsic molecular identity, including transcriptional programs governing synaptic function, ion channel expression, calcium handling, APP processing, and proteostasis capacity. Neurons with high expression of synaptic/ion transport genes (particularly calcium channels and calcium-handling machinery), elevated Aβ42:40 secretion ratios, and reduced proteostasis machinery (low BAG3, impaired autophagy/lysosomal function) are intrinsically vulnerable regardless of their anatomical location. Conversely, neurons with enhanced chaperone function, efficient protein degradation, and molecular programs favoring shorter Aβ species show resistance. This molecular identity interacts with neuronal projection patterns (long-range corticocortical projections increase vulnerability), compartment-specific properties (apical dendrites more vulnerable than basal), and can be modulated by sex-dependent factors and neuroprotective transcription factors (MEF2C). The theory explains why specific neuronal subtypes (e.g., CTIP2+ SST+ cortical interneurons, RORB+ excitatory neurons, layer III/V long-projection pyramidal neurons) are selectively vulnerable while others (e.g., certain inhibitory subtypes, caudal/spinal neurons, primary sensory cortex neurons with strong Wnt signaling) are resistant, even when exposed to the same pathological environment.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection2-nov13-2025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Vulnerability follows a hierarchical gradient from higher-order association cortex (early affected) to primary sensory cortex (late affected), driven by sequential spread of tau through anatomically connected networks. However, this connectivity-based vulnerability is modulated by cell-intrinsic molecular factors including proteostasis capacity, transcriptional programs (e.g., synaptic and ion-transport gene expression), and sex-dependent regulatory mechanisms. Amyloid-β deposition occurs more uniformly across cortex but exerts differential local effects based on neuronal subtype, compartment, and proximity to plaques.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection2-nov13-2025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

The sequence of biomarker changes follows a stereotyped but variable order: Aβ accumulation (detected by PET/CSF/plasma) occurs first, followed by tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation (CSF/PET), then neurodegeneration (atrophy, hypometabolism, synaptic/axonal loss), and finally clinical symptoms. Detection is optimized by using a staged, multimodal biomarker approach (ATN framework), with blood-based markers emerging as scalable early screening tools. The theory also posits that non-amyloid, non-tau mechanisms (mitochondrial, vascular, inflammatory) can modulate the cascade and explain heterogeneity in clinical presentation and progression.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection2-nov13-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>
