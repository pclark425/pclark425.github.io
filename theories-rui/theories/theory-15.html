                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the main factors determining the organization of tissues from single cells, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Regional proliferation, spatial organization, and tissue morphology in fibroblastic tissues are determined by the co-assembly of fibronectin and collagen type I into anchored fibrillar bundles that resist cell-generated contractile forces. This theory proposes a multi-step mechanism: (1) cells polymerize soluble fibronectin into fibrillar matrix, (2) fibronectin binds to and co-assembles with collagen I fibrils, forming anchoring structures that tether to the substrate, (3) cell-generated actomyosin contractility generates isometric tension on these anchored fibrils, (4) mechanical tension extends and unfolds fibronectin modules, exposing normally buried matricryptic binding sites (particularly the FNIII-1 heparin-binding domain), (5) exposed cryptic sites promote growth factor signaling and proliferation. Regions with anchored, extended fibrils (typically at aggregate peripheries with actin stress fibers) show active proliferation, while regions with pericellular, relaxed fibronectin (central compact cores with cortical actin) maintain cell-cell cohesion but remain quiescent. The concentration of soluble fibronectin, collagen organization, cell contractility, and temporal dynamics together determine whether sheet-like or 3D spheroid morphologies emerge, with characteristic spatial patterns of proliferation.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Fibronectin-Collagen Co-Assembly Requirement for Regional Proliferation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Cell proliferation induced by fibronectin matrix assembly requires direct fibronectin-collagen type I binding and co-assembly into anchored fibrillar bundles. Blocking this specific interaction (e.g., with R1R2 peptide that competes for fibronectin's collagen-binding domain) completely abolishes fibronectin-induced proliferation (p<0.001) while maintaining cell-cell cohesion through pericellular fibronectin fibrils. Co-assembly produces visible collagen-fibronectin bundles that serve as mechanical anchors.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to mesenchymal and fibroblastic cells (MEFs tested, likely extends to fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells) cultured on or within collagen type I matrices (polymerized gels tested, likely applies to collagen-rich 3D environments) with exogenous fibronectin concentrations in the physiological range (25-100 nM tested). Relevant to wound healing, fibrosis, stromal tissue formation, and connective tissue development. Requires cells capable of assembling fibronectin matrix (integrin α5β1-mediated), generating contractile forces (actomyosin machinery), and remodeling collagen. Time scale: hours to days (effects observed at 2-6 days). Spatial scale: cell sheet to aggregate level (100s of microns). Does not apply to non-collagenous matrices, cells lacking fibronectin assembly machinery, or contexts with extremely low or extremely high ECM stiffness that prevent effective tension generation.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cells lacking fibronectin assembly machinery (e.g., integrin α5β1 knockout) cannot form fibrils regardless of binding capability.</li>
                <li>Non-collagenous matrices (pure Matrigel, laminin-only matrices, synthetic hydrogels without collagen) lack the required anchoring partner and do not support this mechanism.</li>
                <li>Very low fibronectin concentrations (<10 nM estimated) may not support sufficient fibril density for effective co-assembly and anchoring.</li>
                <li>Very high fibronectin concentrations (>100 nM) may saturate the system and alter spatial patterns by forming dense fibrillar networks throughout rather than regionally.</li>
                <li>Extremely soft matrices may not provide sufficient resistance for tension generation.</li>
                <li>Extremely stiff matrices may prevent cell-mediated collagen remodeling required for co-assembly.</li>
                <li>Cells with impaired contractility (myosin II inhibition, ROCK inhibition) cannot generate sufficient tension even with proper anchoring.</li>
                <li>Temporal window: early time points (0-24h) show initial assembly; effects on proliferation become apparent 24-96h after fibronectin addition.</li>
                <li>2D culture on collagen gels vs 3D encapsulation may show different kinetics and spatial patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Blocking fibronectin-collagen binding with R1R2 peptide (62.5 nM for 25 nM FN; 2.5 μM for 100 nM FN) completely inhibited fibronectin-induced cell proliferation (statistically significant, p<0.001) while cells maintained cohesion and formed spheroids. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Disrupting fibronectin-collagen binding after tissue formation (R1R2 added at day 3) caused transition from sheet-like to spheroid morphology and reduced cell number increases, demonstrating requirement for continuous binding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Extended fibronectin fibrils co-localized with collagen bundles specifically at cell sheet periphery where proliferation occurred (92% peripheral vs 8% central BrdU incorporation at 25 nM FN, day 4); central regions with pericellular fibronectin showed no proliferation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Regional co-localization of collagen and fibronectin fibrils observed at edges of cell sheets as early as day 2, prior to spatial segregation of proliferation observed at day 4. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Fibronectin matrix assembly drives self-assembly: 25 nM fibronectin caused FN-null cells to form multicellular structures with specific morphology (dome-shaped 3D aggregates), while absence of fibronectin left cells dispersed and non-proliferative. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Fibronectin directly binds collagen I and mediates deposition and remodeling of collagen fibrils into co-assembled bundles that anchor extended fibronectin fibrils to substrate. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Cell-mediated collagen fibril remodeling and bundling forms long thick bundles that co-localize with extended fibronectin at periphery of cell sheets; R1R2 reduced or prevented this collagen remodeling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.6" class="evidence-link">[e67.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Blocking fibronectin-collagen binding with R1R2 produced disorganized/shorter fibronectin fibrils and reduced collagen fibril remodeling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.6" class="evidence-link">[e67.6]</a> </li>
    <li>R1R2-treated cells still formed spheroids held by pericellular fibronectin, demonstrating that fibronectin-mediated cell-cell cohesion does not require collagen binding, while proliferation does. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While individual molecular steps are established (binding, assembly, cryptic sites), the integrated mechanistic model specifically connecting these steps into a causal chain that explains regional tissue organization (peripheral proliferation, morphological outcomes) represents a significant novel synthesis with specific testable predictions about spatial organization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Fibronectin-collagen binding is well-established (McDonald et al. 1987); fibronectin matrix assembly and its general role in cell behavior are known (Singh et al. 2010, 2012); the existence of matricryptic sites in fibronectin is recognized (Zhong et al. 1998); collagen remodeling by cells is documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit mechanistic model linking the complete causal chain: fibronectin-collagen binding→co-assembly→anchoring→enabling tension generation→fibril extension→cryptic site exposure→regional proliferation as an integrated system with specific spatial predictions (periphery vs center) represents a novel framework. The functional dissection showing that blocking binding abolishes proliferation but preserves cohesion is a new demonstration that these are separable functions requiring different structural states of fibronectin.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Fibronectin Concentration-Dependent Morphological Bistability</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The concentration of soluble fibronectin determines microtissue morphology through a concentration-dependent switch in fibronectin-collagen co-assembly patterns: lower concentrations (25 nM) produce dome-shaped 3D aggregates with peripheral proliferation zones, tall vertical structures (~50 μm height at day 5), and spatially segregated proliferation (92% peripheral vs 8% central BrdU incorporation); higher concentrations (100 nM) produce dense sheet-like structures with more uniform proliferation distribution (69% peripheral vs 30% central), shorter profiles (~20 μm height), and fibrillar fibronectin distributed throughout rather than concentrated at periphery. The concentration affects both the density of fibronectin matrix and the spatial pattern of fibronectin-collagen co-assembly, with intermediate concentrations potentially producing intermediate morphologies.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies specifically to fibronectin-null cells (or contexts where endogenous fibronectin production is controlled/absent) cultured on polymerized collagen I substrates with defined exogenous fibronectin concentrations. Specific numerical thresholds (25 vs 100 nM) established for MEF system; principle may generalize to other fibroblastic cells with potentially different concentration thresholds. Requires: (1) cells capable of fibronectin assembly, (2) collagen I substrate for co-assembly, (3) ability to generate contractile forces, (4) culture duration of at least 4-5 days for morphological differences to manifest. Time scale: morphological divergence apparent by day 2-4, mature patterns by day 5-6. Spatial scale: aggregates 100s of microns in diameter. Does not apply to cells producing high endogenous fibronectin (local concentrations uncontrollable), or to matrices with other dominant adhesive proteins that may alter assembly dynamics.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cells producing endogenous fibronectin have less controllable and spatially heterogeneous local concentrations that may override exogenous fibronectin effects.</li>
                <li>Other matrix proteins (laminins, vitronectin) may modulate the concentration-response relationship and shift thresholds.</li>
                <li>Different cell types (e.g., epithelial vs mesenchymal) may have different assembly efficiencies and respond to different concentration ranges.</li>
                <li>Very low concentrations (<10 nM estimated) may not support any multicellular structure formation.</li>
                <li>Extremely high concentrations (>200 nM, not tested) might produce qualitatively different patterns.</li>
                <li>Matrix stiffness may interact with concentration: on very soft or very stiff matrices, the concentration thresholds may shift.</li>
                <li>Cell density at plating affects how quickly local fibronectin concentrations are modified by cell assembly.</li>
                <li>Temporal dynamics: at 25 nM, sheet morphology observed at day 2 converts to 3D aggregates by day 4; at 100 nM, sheet persists.</li>
                <li>Initial 2D vs 3D culture configuration may affect how concentration-dependent patterns emerge.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>25 nM fibronectin produced dome-shaped 3D aggregates with ~50 μm height at day 5, compact collagen-poor core, extended peripheral fibronectin, and 92% peripheral/8% central BrdU incorporation (day 4). <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>100 nM fibronectin produced dense sheet-like structures with ~20 μm height, fibrillar fibronectin throughout, and 69% peripheral/30% central BrdU incorporation (day 4), representing more uniform proliferation distribution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>At both concentrations, discontinuous cell sheets formed by day 2; by day 4, 25 nM aggregates reorganized into dome-shaped 3D structures while 100 nM maintained dense sheet morphology. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Fibronectin concentration determines morphology: 25 nM leads to aggregates with compact cores and extended peripheral fibronectin; 100 nM produces sheets with dense fibrillar fibronectin throughout. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Different fibronectin concentrations alter the density and spatial pattern of fibronectin matrix assembled by cells and the extent of collagen co-assembly. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Addition of fibronectin at either concentration was necessary and sufficient to induce tissue self-assembly: without fibronectin, FN-null cells remained dispersed and non-proliferative. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Temporal dynamics: sheet morphology at day 2 for both concentrations, divergence by day 4 with 25 nM reorganizing into 3D aggregates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While concentration-dependent responses are general phenomena, the specific characterization of this bistable morphological switch with precise thresholds, quantitative morphological parameters, and mechanistic connection to fibronectin-collagen co-assembly patterns represents genuinely new insight.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Dose-dependent effects of ECM proteins on cell behavior are well-established; morphological plasticity of cell aggregates in response to matrix conditions is known; fibronectin's role in tissue organization is documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific quantitative concentration thresholds (25 nM vs 100 nM) producing discrete bistable morphological outcomes (3D aggregate vs sheet) with characteristic sizes (50 vs 20 μm), distinct spatial proliferation distributions (92%/8% vs 69%/30%), and specific temporal dynamics represents a novel detailed characterization. The identification of this as a concentration-dependent morphological switch controlled by fibronectin-collagen co-assembly patterns is new for this system.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Mechanical Tension-Dependent Matricryptic Site Exposure for Proliferation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Mechanical tension on anchored fibronectin fibrils extends and unfolds fibronectin modules, exposing normally buried (matricryptic) binding sites including the FNIII-1 heparin-binding growth-promoting domain. This conformational change is necessary for proliferation signaling and occurs specifically in regions where fibrils are anchored (via collagen co-assembly) and under sustained isometric tension from actomyosin contractility (cell periphery with actin stress fibers). Regions with relaxed pericellular fibronectin (central cores with cortical actin) do not expose these sites and remain quiescent despite having fibronectin present. The extended fibril state is identified by radial alignment, co-localization with collagen bundles and actin stress fibers, and correlation with BrdU incorporation.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to situations where fibronectin fibrils are under mechanical tension from cell contractility in the range sufficient to unfold fibronectin type III domains (estimated several pN to nN based on literature, not measured here). Requires: (1) fibronectin fibrils anchored to resist tension (e.g., via collagen), (2) active actomyosin contractility generating sustained force, (3) appropriate time for force application and signaling (hours to days). Most relevant in 3D contexts, at tissue interfaces, or on deformable substrates where cells can generate sustained isometric tension on ECM. Spatial scale: individual fibril (nm-μm) to regional tissue patterns (10-100s of μm). Time scale: fibril extension likely rapid (seconds-minutes) once tension applied, but proliferative response develops over hours to days. May apply broadly to wound healing, fibrosis, vascular remodeling, and stromal tissues where fibroblastic cells generate tension on fibronectin-rich matrices.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very low tension (relaxed pericellular fibrils) may not expose cryptic sites sufficiently for proliferation signaling.</li>
                <li>Some cryptic sites may be accessible by alternative mechanisms (proteolytic cleavage) independent of tension.</li>
                <li>Different fibronectin isoforms (plasma vs cellular) or splice variants may have different force-sensitivity of their type III domains.</li>
                <li>Different cryptic sites within fibronectin (FNIII-1 studied here; others exist) may require different force thresholds or have different functional consequences.</li>
                <li>Cells with impaired force generation (myosin inhibition, disrupted focal adhesions) cannot expose cryptic sites even with proper anchoring.</li>
                <li>On rigid non-deformable substrates, cells may not generate sufficient isometric tension despite having contractile machinery.</li>
                <li>Extremely rapid force application or removal may not allow time for unfolding-refolding dynamics.</li>
                <li>Temperature and ionic conditions may affect fibronectin domain stability and force requirements.</li>
                <li>Other ECM proteins (laminins, vitronectin) may have their own tension-sensitive sites operating by similar or different mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Temporal sequence: anchoring must precede tension generation; exposure must precede proliferative response (lag of hours to days).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cell-generated mechanical tension via actin stress fibers on anchored fibronectin-collagen fibrils extends fibrils; cells generate isometric tension when fibrils are anchored, enabling conformational changes proposed to expose matricryptic FNIII-1 growth-promoting sites. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.3" class="evidence-link">[e67.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>

    <li>Extended fibronectin fibrils (radially aligned, long) observed at cell sheet periphery co-localize with actin stress fibers and regions of active proliferation (92% peripheral BrdU at 25 nM); contrast with pericellular/relaxed fibrils in compact cores (8% central BrdU) which show cortical rather than stress fiber actin. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.3" class="evidence-link">[e67.3]</a> </li>

    <li>Pericellular fibronectin appears as dense local fibrils around cells associated with cortical actin and supports cell-cell cohesion; extended fibronectin fibrils are radially aligned, long, associated with stress fibers and collagen anchors, and proposed to expose matricryptic domains when stretched. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Disrupting fibronectin-collagen anchoring with R1R2 reduced fibril extension, led to predominantly pericellular-relaxed fibril morphology, and completely abolished proliferation while preserving cohesion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Blocking fibronectin-collagen binding prevents fibril extension and anchorage that would permit tension development, thereby preventing cryptic site exposure and proliferation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying molecular mechanism (force-induced cryptic site exposure) is established from prior work, but the application to explain specific regional proliferation patterns in tissue self-organization, and the integration with the anchorage mechanism, represents a novel functional and organizational insight not previously demonstrated.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Mechanically-induced protein unfolding is well-established; force-induced cryptic site exposure in fibronectin was pioneered by Vogel and colleagues (Zhong et al. 1998; Vogel 2006); fibronectin type III domains are known to unfold under force; the FNIII-1 heparin-binding domain is characterized; mechanical regulation of cell behavior is recognized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific application of the tension-cryptic site mechanism to explain regional tissue organization (peripheral proliferation vs central quiescence), the explicit connection between anchorage state, tension generation, fibril conformation, and spatial behavioral patterns in tissue formation represents a novel functional integration. The demonstration that identical fibronectin in different conformational states (extended vs pericellular) produces different functional outcomes in the same tissue is a new insight.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Spatial Integration Principle: Co-localization of Anchoring, Tension, and Proliferation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Regional tissue organization emerges from the spatial integration of three coupled processes: (1) fibronectin-collagen co-assembly determines where anchors form, (2) actomyosin contractility generates tension specifically on anchored fibrils, (3) tension-dependent cryptic site exposure promotes proliferation. These processes are spatially coupled such that only regions with all three components show active proliferation. In the microtissue system: periphery exhibits co-assembled bundles, actin stress fibers, extended fibrils, and high proliferation (92% of BrdU+ cells); central cores exhibit pericellular fibronectin, cortical actin, relaxed fibrils, and minimal proliferation (8% of BrdU+ cells). This spatial coupling occurs at time scales of days (2-4 days to establish patterns) and length scales of 10-100s of microns.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to self-organizing mesenchymal/fibroblastic tissues forming from single cells in collagen-fibronectin matrices. Describes emergent spatial patterns arising from cell-ECM mechanical interactions. Relevant to: wound healing organization, fibrotic tissue patterning, stromal compartment organization, in vitro tissue engineering. Requires: cells with both contractile (actomyosin) and matrix assembly capabilities, appropriate matrix composition (collagen I + fibronectin), sufficient time for pattern establishment (days), and culture conditions permitting cell-mediated matrix remodeling. Spatial scale: cellular (individual fibrils, stress fibers) to tissue (regional patterns over 100s of microns). Temporal scale: pattern establishment over 2-6 days; individual molecular events (binding, tension, signaling) faster.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If any one component is blocked (no anchoring via R1R2, no tension via myosin inhibition, no fibronectin), the entire spatial pattern collapses.</li>
                <li>Very homogeneous matrix conditions (uniform stiffness, composition) may reduce spatial patterning.</li>
                <li>Very heterogeneous initial conditions (pre-existing matrix gradients) may override or modulate self-organized patterns.</li>
                <li>Different cell types may establish different characteristic length scales or patterns based on their contractility and assembly efficiency.</li>
                <li>3D spheroid formation (high cohesion at high density) may establish different spatial patterns than 2D spreading.</li>
                <li>External mechanical constraints (rigid boundaries, applied stretch) may orient or disrupt self-organized patterns.</li>
                <li>Scale-dependence: very small aggregates (<50 μm) may not establish distinct regional patterns; very large tissues (>mm) may develop additional length scales.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Spatial co-localization at periphery: collagen-fibronectin co-assembled bundles, actin stress fibers, extended radial fibronectin fibrils, and 92% of BrdU+ proliferating cells (25 nM, day 4). <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.3" class="evidence-link">[e67.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Spatial segregation at center: pericellular fibronectin, cortical actin (not stress fibers), compact collagen-poor core, and only 8% of BrdU+ cells (25 nM, day 4). <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.3" class="evidence-link">[e67.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Regional co-localization of collagen and fibronectin fibrils at edges of cell sheets observed as early as day 2, preceding spatial segregation of proliferation by day 4, suggesting temporal sequence: co-assembly→pattern establishment→proliferation response. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Blocking any one component disrupts the entire pattern: R1R2 (blocking anchoring) converts aggregates to spheroids and abolishes proliferation everywhere; absence of fibronectin prevents any organization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>At 100 nM fibronectin, dense fibrillar network throughout produces more spatially distributed proliferation (69% peripheral, 30% central) with less dramatic spatial segregation, suggesting that breaking spatial coupling (via dense uniform matrix) reduces regional patterning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Temporal dynamics: by day 2 discontinuous sheets form; by day 4 spatial reorganization into 3D aggregates with distinct regional patterns evident; pattern maturation by day 5-6. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Characteristic length scales: peripheral proliferation zone extends ~10-50 μm from aggregate edge; central quiescent core dimensions depend on aggregate size and fibronectin concentration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.2" class="evidence-link">[e67.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This represents a novel synthetic principle integrating known components into a specific mechanistic framework that explains emergent spatial organization. While the individual steps are established, the integrated spatial coupling principle with quantitative characterization is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cell-ECM mechanical interactions are well-studied; regional patterns in tissues are recognized; the importance of spatial organization of ECM and mechanical forces is established; individual components (fibronectin assembly, contractility, proliferation) are well-characterized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit identification of spatial co-localization of all three components (anchoring, tension, proliferation) as a mechanistic principle generating tissue-level regional organization represents a novel integration. The quantitative characterization of the spatial pattern (92%/8% peripheral/central) with specific length scales (10-50 μm zones) and temporal dynamics (2-4 day pattern establishment) provides new predictive power.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adding collagen-binding peptides that compete with fibronectin for collagen binding sites (similar to R1R2 but from different sources) should reduce proliferation in a dose-dependent manner.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological inhibition of myosin II (e.g., blebbistatin) should reduce peripheral proliferation and shift aggregates toward more spheroid-like morphology by preventing tension generation.</li>
                <li>ROCK inhibition (Y-27632) should phenocopy myosin inhibition by reducing contractility, decreasing fibril extension, and reducing proliferation.</li>
                <li>Expressing constitutively active RhoA in cells should increase contractility, potentially enhance fibril extension, and increase proliferation rates or extend the proliferation zone peripherally.</li>
                <li>On collagen matrices with pre-aligned fibrils (e.g., via magnetic alignment or flow), proliferation should preferentially occur along the alignment axis where tension can be efficiently generated.</li>
                <li>Using fibronectin concentrations intermediate between 25 and 100 nM (e.g., 50 nM, 75 nM) should produce intermediate morphologies and proliferation distributions.</li>
                <li>Cells cultured on very compliant collagen matrices (lower crosslinking) should show reduced proliferation due to inability to generate sufficient isometric tension.</li>
                <li>Cells on very stiff collagen matrices (high crosslinking or chemical fixation) should show altered patterns due to reduced cell-mediated collagen remodeling, potentially preventing proper co-assembly.</li>
                <li>Time-lapse imaging of individual cells should show fibril extension preceding proliferation onset (BrdU incorporation or EdU incorporation) by several hours.</li>
                <li>Increasing cell seeding density should accelerate pattern formation and potentially shift the peripheral/central proliferation ratio.</li>
                <li>Removing R1R2 after pattern establishment (e.g., extensive washing at day 4) should allow gradual recovery of proliferation as new fibronectin-collagen bonds form.</li>
                <li>3D encapsulation of cells in collagen-fibronectin matrices (rather than on top) should produce spherical patterns of proliferation (shell of proliferation around quiescent core) rather than dome-shaped.</li>
                <li>Adding exogenous heparin (which binds FNIII-1 domain) might partially rescue proliferation in R1R2-treated cultures if cryptic site exposure is the limiting step.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Can we engineer synthetic matrices with chemically-crosslinked tension-sensitive modules (cryptic site analogs) to spatially control proliferation without using native fibronectin? This would test if the principle generalizes beyond fibronectin.</li>
                <li>What is the precise force threshold (in pN) required to expose FNIII-1 cryptic sites in living tissues, and can we measure this in real-time using FRET-based force sensors?</li>
                <li>Do other matricryptic sites in fibronectin (beyond FNIII-1) or in other ECM proteins (collagen, laminins, elastin) regulate different cellular behaviors (migration, differentiation, apoptosis) through similar tension-dependent mechanisms?</li>
                <li>Can we create purely biochemical gradients of soluble factors that mimic cryptic site signals to produce equivalent regional organization without mechanical tension?</li>
                <li>Is the fibronectin-collagen anchoring mechanism universal across tissue types (epithelial, neural, etc.) or specific to mesenchymal/fibroblastic tissues? Do epithelia use similar mechanisms with different ECM partners?</li>
                <li>Can we develop optogenetic or chemogenetic tools to spatiotemporally control contractility with high precision, and thereby write arbitrary spatial proliferation patterns in tissues?</li>
                <li>In complex 3D tissues or organoids with multiple cell types, does this mechanism create distinct proliferative niches that influence lineage decisions or stem cell behavior?</li>
                <li>Does the tension-dependent mechanism operate in vivo during wound healing, and can disrupting it therapeutically reduce fibrosis?</li>
                <li>Can we measure the lifetime of the extended fibril state, and is there active maintenance of tension or dynamic on-off cycling?</li>
                <li>Are there specific growth factors or cytokines whose signaling is specifically enhanced by FNIII-1 exposure, and can we identify the complete signaling cascade?</li>
                <li>In cancer-associated fibroblasts, is enhanced fibronectin-collagen co-assembly and tension generation responsible for creating proliferative niches for tumor cells?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If cells proliferate equally well with R1R2-blocked fibronectin-collagen binding when growth factors (FGF, PDGF) are added exogenously at saturating concentrations, it would suggest cryptic site exposure is not necessary and that growth factor limitation is the mechanism.</li>
                <li>If fibronectin with mutated or deleted FNIII-1 domain (removing the cryptic site) supports equivalent proliferation, it would refute the specific cryptic site hypothesis and suggest other mechanisms or sites are responsible.</li>
                <li>If proliferation occurs in cells on non-collagenous matrices (pure synthetic PEG hydrogels with RGD peptides but no collagen) when given equivalent fibronectin concentrations, it would challenge the anchoring requirement.</li>
                <li>If reducing cell contractility pharmacologically (blebbistatin, Y-27632) does not significantly reduce proliferation or alter spatial patterns, it would challenge the tension requirement.</li>
                <li>If pericellular fibronectin regions in aggregate centers can be induced to promote proliferation by some manipulation (altered growth factor delivery, optogenetic activation), it would suggest fibril state is not deterministic.</li>
                <li>If collagen matrices chemically crosslinked to prevent cell-mediated remodeling (e.g., glutaraldehyde treatment) show enhanced rather than reduced proliferation, it would challenge the requirement for dynamic co-assembly.</li>
                <li>If cells can generate the same spatial proliferation patterns in the absence of fibronectin when other ECM proteins are substituted, it would indicate the mechanism is not fibronectin-specific.</li>
                <li>If real-time force measurements show that fibrils at the periphery are not under higher tension than central fibrils, it would undermine the tension-dependent mechanism.</li>
                <li>If blocking integrin α5β1 (primary fibronectin receptor) does not affect proliferation patterns despite blocking fibronectin assembly, it would suggest alternative receptors or mechanisms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
