                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how proteins can be folded algorithmically and deterministically without using black-box machine learning solutions, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Protein folding can be achieved deterministically through iterative cycles between coarse-grained exploration and all-atom refinement, where coarse-grained models capture essential folding driving forces (hydrophobic collapse, backbone hydrogen bonding, secondary structure propensities) through 2-5 interaction sites per residue, while all-atom refinement enforces detailed stereochemical constraints. The theory posits that effective deterministic folding requires: (1) physically meaningful coarse-graining preserving energetic hierarchies (native contact patterns, secondary structure preferences, and hydrophobic/electrostatic balance), (2) efficient global or enhanced sampling at the coarse-grained level to locate low-energy basins, (3) reliable reconstruction protocols using harmonic constraints (40-2000 kcal/mol·Å²) and equilibration (0.01-1 ns), and (4) iterative feedback between scales enabling progressive convergence to native-like structures (<2Å RMSD) within computationally tractable timescales (hours to days on modest computational resources).</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Coarse-Grained Speedup and Preservation Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Coarse-grained protein representations with 2-5 interaction sites per residue (C-alpha plus side-chain centers and/or peptide groups) enable conformational exploration 10²-10⁴ times faster than all-atom molecular dynamics while preserving essential folding thermodynamics, provided the coarse-graining: (a) maintains backbone connectivity with fixed or harmonically constrained virtual bonds, (b) represents side-chain interactions through united pseudoatoms or analytically integrated discrete states, (c) employs effective potentials derived from statistical analysis of protein structures (knowledge-based) or mean-field averaging of all-atom interactions (physics-based PMFs), and (d) includes implicit or continuum solvent representations that capture hydrophobic effects and electrostatic screening.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to globular, single-domain proteins ranging from 10-200 residues in implicit solvent or continuum solvent representations. Performance validated primarily for fast-folding proteins with folding times <1ms and well-defined native states. Effectiveness may degrade for: membrane proteins (requiring specialized implicit membrane models), intrinsically disordered proteins (lacking single native basin), multi-domain proteins with domain-domain interactions (requiring domain decomposition), and proteins with critical metal coordination or disulfide bonds (requiring explicit constraints).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Performance degrades for proteins >200 residues without domain decomposition strategies; UNRES and Upside tests primarily on <100 residue proteins</li>
                <li>Requires special explicit treatment for disulfide bonds (cysteine bridges) and metal coordination sites which cannot be adequately represented by standard CG beads</li>
                <li>May miss fine conformational details critical for ligand binding site geometry or allosteric mechanisms</li>
                <li>Speedup factors decrease for slow-folding proteins or those requiring long timescales to sample critical rare events</li>
                <li>Implicit solvent models (generalized Born, SASA-based) used in most CG implementations cannot capture explicit denaturant effects without reparameterization</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While individual CG models like UNRES, Upside, and SCM are well-established, this statement synthesizes their common design principles, quantitative performance characteristics, and preservation requirements into a unified law describing the speedup-accuracy tradeoff.

            <h3>Statement 1: All-Atom Refinement Necessity and Constraint Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Coarse-grained predictions must undergo all-atom refinement through constrained minimization or short MD equilibration to achieve sub-2Å backbone accuracy, with refinement success quantitatively dependent on: (a) harmonic positional constraints on backbone C-alpha atoms (spring constants 1000-2000 kcal/mol·Å² for strong constraints) and side-chain anchor atoms (40-1000 kcal/mol·Å² depending on residue flexibility), (b) equilibration duration of 0.01-1ns sufficient to relieve steric clashes while preserving CG-predicted geometry, (c) quality and structural similarity of template structure used for reconstruction (reconstruction accuracy decreases with template RMSD from target), and (d) appropriate choice of all-atom force field (CHARMM27, AMBER ff99SB) and implicit or explicit solvent model. Without refinement, CG models produce physically unrealistic atomic geometries (steric clashes, incorrect bond angles) despite correct backbone topology.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to reconstruction of folded, partially folded, or near-native conformations from CG models into all-atom representations. Most reliable for conformations within ~5-8Å RMSD of native or template structures. Less reliable for highly extended unfolded states, molten globule conformations far from any template, or conformations with extensive non-native contacts. Performance validated for proteins 10-200 residues with standard amino acids.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Reconstruction accuracy systematically lower for flexible charged side chains (Arg, Lys, Glu, Asp) which have multiple low-energy rotamers; SCAAL shows particular improvement for large side chains (R, H, W, K, F, Y)</li>
                <li>Template-based methods like SCAAL require selection of appropriate atomistic template structure; performance degrades if no suitable template exists</li>
                <li>CG conformations with severe steric violations or physically unrealistic geometries (e.g., >2Å deviation from ideal bond lengths/angles) may not successfully refine even with strong constraints</li>
                <li>Reconstruction of unfolded states at high temperature shows average 1.33Å heavy-atom RMSD for SCAAL, ~30% better than rotamer-library PULCHRA method</li>
                <li>Short equilibration times (0.01-0.05ns) sufficient for constraint-based reconstructions; longer times (0.5-1ns) used for explicit-solvent refinements in MultiSCAAL</li>

            <h3>Statement 2: Iterative Multiscale Feedback and Convergence Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Optimal deterministic folding performance requires iterative feedback cycles between coarse-grained and all-atom scales, with each cycle comprising: (1) CG simulation (MD, Monte Carlo, or global optimization) generates candidate conformations or target structures, (2) all-atom refinement via constrained minimization/MD produces detailed structures, (3) structural features (contact maps, C-alpha positions, backbone geometry) extracted from refined structures update CG model parameters or targets, (4) cycle repeats until convergence defined by: backbone RMSD changes <0.5Å between consecutive cycles, energy stabilization within thermal fluctuations (~kT), or contact map/order parameter plateaus. This iterative feedback enables progressive improvement and achieves final accuracies (1-3Å RMSD) beyond what either single-scale approach can achieve independently, through: (a) CG exploration locating correct topological basins, (b) AA refinement enforcing realistic geometry, and (c) feedback correcting CG biases based on refined structures.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Demonstrated primarily for small single-domain proteins (36-75 residues) with well-defined native states and relatively simple topologies (helical bundles, small beta proteins). Convergence behavior well-characterized for proteins achieving folded states within 100-200 iteration cycles. Scalability to larger proteins (>200 residues), multi-domain systems, or proteins with complex folding pathways (multiple intermediates, significant frustration) requires domain decomposition or hierarchical strategies not fully validated. Most successful for cases where CG model can locate correct topological basin within initial search.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Convergence may be slow or oscillatory for frustrated proteins with multiple competing low-energy states of similar stability; mirror-image folds can trap iterations</li>
                <li>Requires known native structure or high-quality structural target for defining contact maps or constructing Q-matrices in some implementations (e.g., structure-based CG models)</li>
                <li>Number of required cycles scales with: initial distance from native (more cycles needed for poor initial structures), protein size (larger proteins require more cycles), and complexity of energy landscape (frustrated proteins require more cycles)</li>
                <li>Self-consistent approaches like SCPS iterate until pathway density matrices stabilize (Frobenius norm changes below threshold) rather than simple RMSD convergence</li>
                <li>CG-MD cycle for Villin converged in ~150 folding steps, with each step involving CG optimization → TMD → MD equilibration</li>
                <li>SCPS requires sufficient initial trial trajectories to build representative average path; convergence depends on quality of mean-field approximation</li>

            <h3>Statement 3: Physical Potential Derivation Requirement</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Effective coarse-grained potentials for deterministic folding must be derived from either: (a) statistical analysis of native protein structures (knowledge-based potentials from PDB frequencies, e.g., Betancourt-Thirumalai), (b) Boltzmann inversion of pair correlation functions from all-atom explicit-solvent MD simulations (PMF derivation), (c) force-matching to reproduce all-atom forces on CG sites, or (d) mean-field averaging of many-body all-atom interactions with thermodynamic consistency. Purely phenomenological or ad-hoc parameterizations without physical or statistical grounding produce CG models that fail to preserve folding thermodynamics, leading to incorrect free-energy landscapes, non-physical transition states, or inability to discriminate native from non-native states.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to coarse-grained force field development for protein folding simulations. Most extensively validated for implicit-solvent CG models of globular proteins. Requirement particularly critical for ab initio folding predictions without strong native-biasing terms. Less stringent for structure-based models (Go-type) which explicitly bias toward known native contacts.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Knowledge-based potentials derived from PDB may not accurately represent unfolded state or non-native conformations due to native-structure bias in training data</li>
                <li>PMF-derived potentials are system-specific (depend on solvent conditions, temperature, concentration) and may require reparameterization for different chemical environments</li>
                <li>Force-matching approaches require extensive all-atom reference simulations and may not capture weak long-range interactions if training data insufficient</li>
                <li>Mean-field approximations (like UNRES) may miss important many-body correlations, requiring cooperative correction terms (U_corr in UNRES)</li>
                <li>Transferability of potentials across different protein classes (all-alpha, all-beta, alpha+beta) not guaranteed and may require class-specific parameterizations</li>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A hierarchical protocol combining UNRES CG exploration (1000 independent trajectories, 20ns each, T-REMD across 8 temperatures) with SCAAL reconstruction (k_a=1000, k_b=100 kcal/mol·Å²) and 0.5ns AMBER ff99SB implicit-solvent refinement should fold single-domain proteins 80-150 residues to <3Å C-alpha RMSD within 2-3 weeks on a 200-core cluster</li>
                <li>Increasing CG-to-AA update frequency in iterative cycles from every 50 steps to every 10 steps should reduce final RMSD by 15-25% for proteins 50-100 residues, at the cost of 3-4× increased computational time, based on observed convergence patterns in CG-MD and SCPS implementations</li>
                <li>Using PMF-derived CG potentials from explicit-solvent MD under varying conditions (0M, 2M, 4M, 8M urea; pH 4-9 via protonation state changes) should enable prediction of folding stability changes (ΔΔG) with Pearson correlation R>0.65 to experimental measurements, based on MultiSCAAL's demonstrated capture of chemical interference</li>
                <li>Applying belief-propagation side-chain integration (as in Upside) to UNRES-type models should reduce computational cost by 30-50% while maintaining similar thermodynamic accuracy, based on Upside's demonstrated efficiency gains from analytical integration</li>
                <li>Combining CSA global optimization at CG level with iterative AA refinement cycles should locate native basins more reliably than MD-based CG exploration alone, particularly for proteins with complex topologies or multiple metastable states</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether hierarchical CG-AA iterative cycles can successfully fold multi-domain proteins (>300 residues, 3+ domains) if each domain is independently subjected to CG exploration and AA refinement, then progressively assembled with interdomain constraints - success would demonstrate scalability; failure would indicate fundamental limitations</li>
                <li>Whether optimal CG representations (number of sites, potential forms) vary systematically with protein structural class (all-α requiring different CG detail than all-β or α/β) or whether universal 2-5 site representations suffice - would inform CG model design strategies</li>
                <li>Whether iterative CG-AA feedback enables true de novo folding (no templates, no native structure information) for proteins with novel folds outside training data distributions, achieving <5Å RMSD - would test if physical grounding suffices without knowledge-based biases</li>
                <li>Whether the demonstrated speedup factors (10²-10⁴×) for small proteins (<100 residues) maintain, improve, or deteriorate for very large single-domain proteins (300-500 residues) - would determine practical size limits of hierarchical approaches</li>
                <li>Whether combining multiple CG scales (e.g., 2-bead SCM for initial exploration, 5-bead UNRES for refinement, then AA) in a hierarchical ladder provides better performance than single CG-to-AA transition - would test if multi-resolution cascades are beneficial</li>
                <li>Whether SCPS-type self-consistent feedback can be extended to learn optimal CG representations automatically (number of sites, interaction types) rather than using fixed architectures - would test adaptability of iterative frameworks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that SCAAL or similar reconstruction methods systematically produce structures >5Å RMSD from CG targets even with optimal constraint parameters and extended equilibration would challenge the refinement necessity principle and suggest fundamental incompatibility between CG and AA representations</li>
                <li>Finding that single-scale CG simulations alone (UNRES, Upside, SCM without any AA refinement) routinely achieve <2Å all-heavy-atom RMSD for diverse proteins would undermine the necessity of hierarchical approaches and suggest CG models alone are sufficient</li>
                <li>Showing that iterative CG-AA cycles fail to converge (oscillate indefinitely or diverge) even for well-behaved, fast-folding single-domain proteins with simple topologies would fundamentally question the feedback law and indicate instability in multiscale coupling</li>
                <li>Finding that CG models with only 1 interaction site per residue (C-alpha only) achieve folding accuracy equivalent to 2-5 site models would challenge the minimal representation requirements and suggest even simpler models suffice</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that randomly parameterized CG potentials (not derived from statistical analysis, PMFs, or force-matching) achieve similar folding success rates as physically-grounded potentials would undermine the physical potential derivation requirement</li>
                <li>Finding that non-iterative one-shot approaches (single CG search followed by single AA refinement without feedback) perform equivalently to iterative cycles would question whether feedback provides genuine advantages beyond single-pass multiscale protocols</li>
