                <p><strong>Name:</strong> PV-Interneuron Regional Proteomic Profile Dictates Vulnerability to Amyloid Stress</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of which cell types are most susceptible and most resilient in Alzheimer’s disease, and why, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the acute vulnerability or resilience of parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory interneurons to amyloidogenic insults (e.g., APP/Aβ overexpression) is determined by their region-specific baseline proteomic composition. PV interneurons in the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), which possess relatively low abundance of tau/MAPT and specific tau interactors, chaperones, cytoskeletal, and metabolic proteins, are highly susceptible to rapid suppression of intrinsic excitability, leading to local network disinhibition and hyperexcitability. In contrast, PV interneurons in the somatosensory cortex (SS Ctx), which are enriched in tau/MAPT, tau interactors, chaperones, cytoskeletal, and metabolic proteins, are markedly resilient, maintaining physiological firing and circuit inhibition under the same amyloid stress. The regional proteomic signature thus directly governs cell-type– and region-specific physiological responses to acute amyloid exposure, independently of baseline amyloid plaque load. The theory further predicts that manipulation of these proteomic features can confer resilience or vulnerability upon manipulation.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Distinct Basal Proteomic Profiles Predict Regional PV-Inhibitory Neuron Resilience or Vulnerability</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> PV interneurons in brain regions with higher baseline abundance of MAPT, tau interactors, cytoskeletal, chaperone, and metabolic proteins (e.g., SS Ctx) exhibit intrinsic resilience to acute hAPP/amyloidogenic stress (preserving excitability and circuit inhibition), while those with lower levels (e.g., LEC) exhibit marked suppression of firing, decreased input resistance, impaired inhibitory output, and resultant circuit hyperexcitability.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to parvalbumin-expressing (PV) inhibitory interneurons in adult mouse or human brain, specifically contrasting the LEC and SS Ctx under conditions of acute (2–3 week) overexpression of human APP or amyloid insults, prior to overt plaque deposition or late-stage neurodegeneration. The law describes short-term, cell-autonomous, and region-specific responses and may not extrapolate to chronic or developmental APP/Aβ exposure.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Other PV-IN subtypes or regions (e.g., hippocampal CA1, neocortical laminae, or aged animals) may show intermediate or alternative proteomic signatures and correspondingly variable vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Prolonged/chronic APP, tau, or Aβ exposure, or combined pathologies, may override baseline resilience.</li>
                <li>Developmental expression of APP/Aβ or presence of other disease mutations could modify susceptibility independent of baseline proteome.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Acute (2–3 week) hAPP overexpression in LEC produces marked reduction in PV-IN firing rate and input resistance, coupled with network hyperexcitability and impaired peri-somatic inhibition; no such changes are observed in SS Ctx PV-INs under identical conditions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.0" class="evidence-link">[e171.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.1" class="evidence-link">[e171.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.0" class="evidence-link">[e169.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.1" class="evidence-link">[e169.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.0" class="evidence-link">[e173.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.1" class="evidence-link">[e173.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LEC PV-INs display a native proteomic signature depleted for MAPT (tau), tau interactors, and enriched synaptic ion channels compared to SS PV-INs, which show higher MAPT, tau interactors, heat-shock proteins, cytoskeletal, and metabolic (glycolytic, fatty acid oxidation) proteins. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.1" class="evidence-link">[e171.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.1" class="evidence-link">[e169.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.1" class="evidence-link">[e173.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LEC PV CIBOP proteome is specifically enriched for resilience-associated proteins (from the human AD interactome) in wild-type conditions, but these pro-resilience proteins are lost in human EC from AD brains, supporting a relationship between proteome composition and vulnerability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.0" class="evidence-link">[e171.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.0" class="evidence-link">[e173.0]</a> </li>
    <li>hAPP (human sequence) and mAPP/hAβ chimera, but not full-length murine APP, induce PV-IN dysfunction in LEC, demonstrating species- and sequence-specific vulnerability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.0" class="evidence-link">[e171.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.0" class="evidence-link">[e169.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SS PV-INs remain physiologically normal and maintain local circuit inhibition despite hAPP overexpression, aligned with proteomic enrichment for tau/MAPT and cytoskeletal/heat-shock proteins. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.1" class="evidence-link">[e171.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.1" class="evidence-link">[e169.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.1" class="evidence-link">[e173.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Functional differences are not due to gross differences in local circuit synaptic activity (as spontaneous IPSCs/EPSCs unchanged in SS after hAPP), indicating a specific, cell-autonomous protective effect. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.1" class="evidence-link">[e171.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.1" class="evidence-link">[e169.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.1" class="evidence-link">[e173.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Proteomic differences are not mirrored by baseline differences in amyloid plaque load, supporting a causal relationship to intrinsic proteomics rather than differences in extrinsic pathology. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.1" class="evidence-link">[e171.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.1" class="evidence-link">[e173.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Region-specific baseline biophysical properties (LEC PV-INs lower firing, broader APs; SS PV-INs higher firing, narrower APs) provide a functional manifestation of the proteomic landscape. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.0" class="evidence-link">[e171.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.1" class="evidence-link">[e171.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.0" class="evidence-link">[e169.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.1" class="evidence-link">[e169.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Loss of pro-resilience proteins in human EC PV proteome with advancing AD confirms proteomic changes occur with disease progression. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.0" class="evidence-link">[e171.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.0" class="evidence-link">[e173.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Existing work described PV dysfunction in disease, but did not link acute vulnerability or resistance to differences in cell-intrinsic baseline proteomic landscape within genetically identical animals or directly relate to tau/MAPT, cytoskeletal and stress–adaptation proteins.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> PV interneuron vulnerability and circuit dysfunction are established features in AD models; the general association of heat-shock/cytoskeletal proteins with neuronal protection is recognized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit, cell-type- and region-specific mapping of baseline proteomic composition (especially MAPT/tau interactors, chaperones, metabolic proteins) as a determinant of acute, cell-autonomous vulnerability or resilience to amyloid insult is new. This includes direct experimental demonstration of the causal relationship.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial overexpression of MAPT, tau interactors, or heat-shock/cytoskeletal proteins in LEC PV-INs will preserve firing and resistance to acute hAPP-induced dysfunction.</li>
                <li>Selective knockdown of these same proteins in SS Ctx PV-INs will confer vulnerability (reduced firing, decreased input resistance, circuit hyperexcitability) upon hAPP or Aβ exposure.</li>
                <li>Direct ex vivo application of hAβ to SS PV-INs with reduced tau/chaperone/cytoskeletal protein levels will induce acute physiological deficits matching those seen in LEC PV-INs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying this regional proteomic manipulation to PV-INs in other brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, prefrontal cortex) will modulate local vulnerability in predictable fashion, but unknown if all regions respond identically.</li>
                <li>In human organoid models, introduction of the SS PV proteomic program into limbic circuit interneurons will confer resistance to both amyloid and tau pathologies.</li>
                <li>Chronic overexpression of pro-resilience proteins in LEC PV-INs may prevent downstream loss of entorhinal projection neurons and ultimately slow cognitive decline in vivo.</li>
                <li>In AD patients with high limbic PV pro-resilience protein levels, PV-IN dysfunction and early circuit hyperexcitability will be blunted or absent.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If overexpression of tau interactors or chaperones in LEC PV-INs fails to protect against hAPP-induced dysfunction, the theory's core proteomic sufficiency is falsified.</li>
                <li>If knockdown of these proteins in SS Ctx PV-INs does not induce new vulnerability to amyloid stress, proteomic determinants are insufficient to explain resilience.</li>
                <li>Finding that long-term APP/Aβ challenge or developmental exposure overrides baseline proteomic signatures, resulting in universal PV-IN vulnerability, would limit the theory's scope.</li>
                <li>If regional differences in PV-IN vulnerability persist despite normalization of proteomic landscape, other non-proteomic mechanisms may predominate.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Possible influence of regional microenvironment, such as glial–neuronal or vascular interactions, on PV-IN resilience or vulnerability is not explained by this theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-166.html#e166.0" class="evidence-link">[e166.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-166.html#e166.1" class="evidence-link">[e166.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-167.html#e167.0" class="evidence-link">[e167.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-167.html#e167.1" class="evidence-link">[e167.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-174.html#e174.2" class="evidence-link">[e174.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Do not account for longer-term adaptive changes or post-translational modifications that may alter PV-IN vulnerability over longer timescales or in later disease. </li>
    <li>Does not explain PV or other interneuron dysfunction reported in developmental models, which may rely on separate mechanisms. </li>
