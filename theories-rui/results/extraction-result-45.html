                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Recent and sometimes as yet incomplete genetic discoveries that highlight the overlap of molecular pathways implicated in cancer and neurodegeneration are discussed.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Cancer and neurodegeneration are often thought of as disease mechanisms at opposite ends of a spectrum; one due to enhanced resistance to cell death and the other due to premature cell death. There is now accumulating evidence to link these two disparate processes. An increasing number of genetic studies add weight to epidemiological evidence suggesting that sufferers of a neurodegenerative disorder have a reduced incidence for most cancers, but an increased risk for other cancers. Many of the genes associated with either cancer and/or neurodegeneration play a central role in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and kinase signalling. However, the links between these two families of diseases remain to be proven. In this review, we discuss recent and sometimes as yet incomplete genetic discoveries that highlight the overlap of molecular pathways implicated in cancer and neurodegeneration.</p>

Specific molecular candidates include p53 activation (promotes neuronal apoptosis but suppresses tumors), dysfunction in DNA repair (e.g., ATM) affecting both neuronal survival and genomic stability, dysregulation of ubiquitin ligases (parkin/PARK2) that when lost can promote tumor growth (somatic PARK2 loss) yet cause neuronal degeneration when mutated germline, and kinase signaling (PINK1, LRRK2, CDK5) that differentially affects dividing vs post-mitotic cells. Autophagy-lysosome dysfunction, proteasomal impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and altered PTEN/PI3K/mTOR signaling are also proposed as shared mechanisms.</td>
