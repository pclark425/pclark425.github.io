                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The dependence of learning success on entrainment time, system size, and presence of noise is investigated and a mechanism based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of synapses to store, retrieve and predict temporal sequences is suggested.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We suggest a mechanism based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) of synapses to store, retrieve and predict temporal sequences. The mechanism is demonstrated in a model system of simplified integrate-and-fire type neurons densely connected by STDP synapses. All synapses are modified according to the so-called normal STDP rule observed in various real biological synapses. After conditioning through repeated input of a limited number of temporal sequences, the system is able to complete the temporal sequence upon receiving the input of a fraction of them. This is an example of effective unsupervised learning in a biologically realistic system. We investigate the dependence of learning success on entrainment time, system size, and presence of noise. Possible applications include learning of motor sequences, recognition and prediction of temporal sensory information in the visual as well as the auditory system, and late processing in the olfactory system of insects.</p>

The paper highlights the necessity of interactions across timescales: the STDP time window sets what temporal sequences can be learned (entrainment Δt must fall within tens of ms), accumulation over many repeats produces long-lived changes in the model, and an explicit slow stabilization/consolidation mechanism (biologically hours–days) would be required for permanent memory — something the authors did not implement but discuss.</td>
