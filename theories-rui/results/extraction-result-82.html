The rule is expressed as a timing-dependent curve (potentiation for Δt in one sign, depression for the other), and in the experiments discussed the net effect on subthreshold responses is biphasic (responses preceding the spike strengthened, those following weakened).</td>

Computational modelling in the cited work indicates that presynaptic spike-time jitter / ongoing network activity (noise) broadens the effective window, so fast spike-timing mechanisms can produce changes manifested over longer millisecond ranges in the intact brain.</td>

Subthreshold membrane responses preceding the induced spike were strengthened while those following were weakened (biphasic change). Crucially, the effective timing window for these changes in vivo was ~250 ms (≈5× longer) than typical in vitro STDP windows (≈50 ms), and modelling showed that input spike-time noise in the intact brain can account for this temporal rescaling.</td>
