                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> In a departure from the conventional successive kinetostatic fold compliance framework, the proposed SGD-based iterative algorithm results in convergence to the local minima of the free energy of protein molecules corresponding to their final folded conformations in a faster and more robust manner.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This paper proposes a sign gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for predicting the three-dimensional folded protein molecule structures under the kinetostatic compliance method (KCM). In the KCM framework, which can be used to simulate the range of motion of peptide-based nanorobots/nanomachines, protein molecules are modeled as a large number of rigid nano-linkages that form a kinematic mechanism under motion constraints imposed by chemical bonds while folding under the kinetostatic effect of nonlinear interatomic force fields. In a departure from the conventional successive kinetostatic fold compliance framework, the proposed SGD-based iterative algorithm in this paper results in convergence to the local minima of the free energy of protein molecules corresponding to their final folded conformations in a faster and more robust manner. KCM-based folding dynamics simulations of the backbone chains of protein molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p>
