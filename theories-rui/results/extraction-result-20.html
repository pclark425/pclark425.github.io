                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4 is identified and KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, is identified as a key factor linked to resilience.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Single-cell omics is advancing our understanding of selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), revealing specific subtypes that are either susceptible or resilient to neurodegeneration. Using single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to compare neocortical regions affected early (prefrontal cortex and precuneus) or late (primary visual cortex) in AD, we identified a resilient excitatory population in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex expressing RORB, CUX2, and EYA4. Layer 4 neurons in association neocortex also remained relatively preserved as AD progressed and shared overlapping molecular signatures of resilience. Early in the disease, resilient neurons upregulated genes associated with synapse maintenance, synaptic plasticity, calcium homeostasis, and neuroprotective factors, including GRIN2A, RORA, NRXN1, NLGN1, NCAM2, FGF14, NRG3, NEGR1, and CSMD1. We also identified KCNIP4, which encodes a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel-interacting protein that interacts with Kv4.2 channels and presenilins, as a key factor linked to resilience. KCNIP4 was consistently upregulated in the early stages of pathology. Furthermore, AAV-mediated overexpression of Kcnip4 in a humanized AD mouse model reduced the expression of the activity-dependent genes Arc and c-Fos, suggesting compensatory mechanisms against neuronal hyperexcitability. Our dataset provides a valuable resource for investigating mechanisms underlying resilience to neurodegeneration.</p>
