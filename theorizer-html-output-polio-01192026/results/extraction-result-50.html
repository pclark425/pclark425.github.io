                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background After being polio free for more than 10 years, an outbreak following importation of wild poliovirus (WPV) was confirmed in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, in 2011. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted prior to supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), immediately after the confirmation of the WPV outbreak. In selected prefectures, participants aged ≤60 years old who visited hospitals at county-level or above to have their blood drawn for reasons not related to the study, were invited to participate in our study. Antibody titers ≥8 were considered positive. Results Among the 2,611 participants enrolled, 2,253 (86.3%), 2,283 (87.4%), and 1,989 (76.2%) were seropositive to P1, P2 and P3 respectively, and 1744 (66.8%) participants were seropositive to all the three serotypes. Lower antibody seropositivities and geometric mean titers were observed in children <1 year of age and in adults aged 15–39 years. Conclusion Serosurveys to estimate population immunity in districts at high risk of polio importation might be useful to gauge underlying population immunity gaps to polio and possibly to guide preparedness and response planning. Consideration should be given to older children and adults during polio risk assessment planning and outbreak response.</p>

                            <td>- Of 21 confirmed WPV type 1 cases in southern Xinjiang, 11 occurred in adults (age 15–53). The paper states that adults aged 15–39 years accounted for 47.6% (10/21) of WPV cases and 60.9% (14/23) of clinically compatible polio cases.  
- Serosurvey overall: 86.3% seropositive to P1, 87.4% to P2, and 76.2% to P3; only 66.8% were positive to all three serotypes.  
- The lowest seroprevalence was in <1 year olds and the secondary-lowest in adults 15–39 years; ‘‘Seropositivity for P1&P2&P3 was less than 60% in adults aged 15–39 years’’ (text).  
- Geometric mean titres (GMTs) for P1, P2 and P3 were lower in the 15–39 group compared with school-age children (5–14).  
(Exact age-stratified seroprevalence and GMTs are presented in Table 2 by prefecture; the paper emphasizes the consistent pattern of lower immunity in 15–39-year-olds.)</td>

The paper notes the last paralytic case had onset Oct 9, 2011, and suggests interruption of transmission may have been achieved after the first round of SIAs, supporting the decision to include adults.</td>
