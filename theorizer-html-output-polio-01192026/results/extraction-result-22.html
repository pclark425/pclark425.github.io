                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Pakistan is among the two polio-endemic countries in the world and is still struggling to eradicate the poliovirus. Keeping in view the virus circulation the new communication strategy is specifically designed for the purpose to address all social values that cause refusing vaccination. It stresses the role of communication in building trust and strong bonds between the community and health workers. Communication is thought to be the basic pillar of the successful implementation of polio campaigns. This study is designed to review and analyze the sources of information regarding polio campaigns in district Dera Ismail Khan and the effectiveness of interpersonal communication in changing attitudes towards polio vaccination. A sample of 20 years and above was selected through a convenient sampling technique. The researcher used a closed-ended questionnaire to collect data. The result of the study suggests health workers/polio workers remain the main source of information regarding polio campaigns and local leaders shape a more positive attitude towards polio vaccination as compared to mass media.</p>
