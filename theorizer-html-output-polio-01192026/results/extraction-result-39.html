                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> In 2019, the Public Health Agency of Barcelona, Spain, was notified of a vaccine-derived poliovirus infection. The patient had an underlying common variable immunodeficiency and no signs of acute flaccid paralysis. We describe the ongoing coordinated response to contain the infection, which included compassionate-use treatment with pocapavir.</p>

The patient's partner reported an OPV dose in Feb 2017 before leaving Pakistan; this timeline and sequence divergence support secondary exposure from OPV recipients (likely adults) as the probable source. Stool samples from four household members were negative; no onward transmission detected; community vaccination coverage >95% and environmental surveillance negative. A total of 59 exposed persons were vaccinated with IPV as part of the response.</td>

Community environmental surveillance showed no circulation. The inference that adults vaccinated in Pakistan were the source is circumstantial (based on vaccination history and molecular clock estimates of divergence) and limited by being a single-case report without systematic age-stratified transmission data.
