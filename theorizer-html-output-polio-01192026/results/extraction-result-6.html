                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Introduction After trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV) cessation, Pakistan has maintained immunity to type 2 poliovirus by administering inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in routine immunization, alongside monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) and IPV in supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). This study assesses the change in poliovirus type 2 immunity after tOPV withdrawal and due to SIAs with mOPV2 and IPV among children aged 6–11 months. Methods Three cross-sectional sequential serological surveys were conducted in 12 polio high-risk areas of Pakistan. 25 clusters from each geographical stratum were selected utilizing probability proportional to size. Results Seroprevalence of type 2 poliovirus was 49%, with significant variation observed among surveyed areas; <30% in Pishin, >80% in Killa Abdullah, Mardan & Swabi, and Rawalpindi. SIAs with IPV improved immunity from 38 to 57% in Karachi and 60 to 88% in Khyber. SIAs with IPV following mOPV2 improved immunity from 62 to 65% in Killa Abdullah, and combined mOPV2 and IPV SIAs in Pishin improved immunity from 28 to 89%. Results also reflected that immunity rates for serotypes 1 and 3 were consistently above 90% during all three phases and across all geographical areas. Conclusion The study findings highlight the importance of implementing effective vaccination strategies to prevent the re-emergence of poliovirus. Moreover, the results provide crucial information for policymakers working toward achieving global polio eradication.</p>
