                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The stigma associated with this vaccine is a major challenge for the Government, National and International Health Organizations and various established misconceptions should be effectively encountered if the goal of GPEI is ever going to be achieved.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Poliomyelitis is debilitating illnesses which chiefly affect children and can be efficiently prevented by Poliovirus vaccine. Although once appeared possible, but till now health authorities failed to eradicate the poliovirus. Countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria topped the list in harboring poliomyelitis. Our objective is to address the possible factors impeding to achieve the goal of Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). Methods: During a period of six months, a cross-sectional study was conducted in three provinces of Pakistan. Before participation, verbal and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. This study included all citizens of Pakistan above 18 years. Results: Of the 3000 initially recruited, 86.6% of the participants were aware of polio vaccination. In contrast, only 79% were willing to vaccinate their children. 3.6% of participants asserted that the polio vaccination programs were against the sovereignty. 0.5% of the graduates and 2.7% of uneducated perceived that the polio vaccine contained ingredients which are forbidden in their religion, such as pork since Pakistan is predominantly the Muslim country. Conclusion: The stigma associated with this vaccine is a major challenge for the Government, National and International Health Organizations. Various established misconceptions should be effectively encountered if the goal of GPEI is ever going to be achieved.</p>
