                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> As the primary source for reinfection in adults are first-time infected infants and children, additional doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine for children will help to interrupt all transmission chains and accelerate polio eradication.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We draw attention to a neglected aspect of poliovirus transmission—the likely role of adults in sustaining transmission—which has important policy and practical implications for addressing the perplexing phenomenon of continued virus circulation. Key Messages Adults who are immune and protected from polio nevertheless can, and do, get reinfected with wild polioviruses and become part of transmission chains. Circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses are wild-like, and adults may get infected and continue transmitting them to children. As the primary source for reinfection in adults are first-time infected infants and children, additional doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine for children will help to interrupt all transmission chains and accelerate polio eradication.</p>
