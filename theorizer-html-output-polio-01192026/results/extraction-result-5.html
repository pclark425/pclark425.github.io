                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Humanity has faced numerous calamities, natural disasters, and even the outbreaks of numerous communicable diseases since the dawn of time, and poliomyelitis is one of these diseases. The first cases of the disease occurred in the 1940s, alerting the health authorities and experts to create a vaccine to improve children's immunity to the virus. Since then, polio workers all across the globe are trying their best to create awareness about the importance of polio vaccination which is especially needed in the tribal areas of Pakistan because the people living there are mostly backward and illiterate who do not vaccinate their children due to safety concerns as well as religious and general misbeliefs about the vaccine. The focus of these campaigns is to make sure that every child in Pakistan and Afghanistan is properly vaccinated to stop the transmission of the virus by the year 2022.</p>
