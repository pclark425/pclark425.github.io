                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> This report presents 2017-2018 poliovirus surveillance data, focusing on 31 countries* identified as high-priority countries because of a "high risk of poliov virus transmission and limited capacity to adequately address those risks" (4).</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> When the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) began in 1988, cases of poliomyelitis were reported from 125 countries. Since then, only Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan have experienced uninterrupted transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV). The primary means of detecting poliovirus is through surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among children aged <15 years with testing of stool specimens for WPV and vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) in World Health Organization (WHO)-accredited laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network (GPLN) (1,2). AFP surveillance is supplemented by environmental surveillance for polioviruses in sewage at selected locations. Analysis of genomic sequences of isolated polioviruses enables assessment of transmission by time and place, potential gaps in surveillance, and emergence of VDPVs (3). This report presents 2017-2018 poliovirus surveillance data, focusing on 31 countries* identified as high-priority countries because of a "high risk of poliovirus transmission and limited capacity to adequately address those risks" (4). Some of these countries are located within WHO regions with endemic polio, and others are in regions that are polio-free. In 2018, 26 (84%) of the 31 countries met AFP surveillance indicators nationally; however, subnational variation in surveillance performance was substantial. Surveillance systems need continued strengthening through monitoring, supervision, and improvements in specimen collection and transport to provide sufficient evidence for interruption of poliovirus circulation.</p>

Genomic sequencing showed continued circulation of multiple lineages in reservoir areas with frequent cross-border transmission with Afghanistan. The report notes environmental surveillance documented continued circulation despite low-level WPV1 case confirmation, but provides no age-stratified quantitative data (no seroprevalence, shedding durations, secondary attack rates, or proportions of cases by older age groups).</td>

                            <td>The report explicitly limits AFP surveillance to children aged <15 years, so it cannot provide evidence about paralytic cases or directly measured transmission among persons ≥15 years; this is a major limitation for assessing the role of older age groups. The authors note general surveillance limitations (security, hard-to-reach populations, delayed detection affecting stool adequacy) and caution that environmental surveillance can detect poliovirus circulation in the absence of AFP cases, but do not ascribe that circulation to any particular age group. The report also notes that high NPAFP rates do not necessarily imply highly sensitive surveillance and that identified isolates' genetic relatedness suggests surveillance gaps had been closing, but none of these points provide direct evidence for or against older-age transmission in Pakistan.</td>
