                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched at the World Health Assembly in 1988 and signaled an international push for a polio-free world by the year 2000 and has contributed to the difficulties encountered.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Eradicable infectious agents are those where the chain of transmission can be broken by an intervention and where there is no reservoir such as a chronic or persistent carrier state, chronic infection, or a non-human host. The only disease eradicated globally is small pox, with the last case recorded in Somalia in 1977. Despite two highly effective vaccines and a disease restricted to humans with very rare cases of chronic persistent infections, the eradication of polio has been elusive. The less favorable geopolitical climate during the polio eradication effort, characterized by multiple global conflicts, as compared to the Cold War smallpox eradication era has contributed to the difficulties encountered [1]. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) was launched at the World Health Assembly (WHA) in 1988 and signaled an international push for a polio-free world by the year 2000.</p>
