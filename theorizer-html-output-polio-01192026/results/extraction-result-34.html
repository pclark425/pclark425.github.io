                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background and objective Polio continues to be endemic in Pakistan despite substantial international efforts to combat it, which presents a serious public health concern. Strategies for eradicating polio depend on understanding the dynamics of pediatric polio transmission and the efficacy of surveillance. This research study aimed to critically evaluate the public health surveillance system for pediatric polio in Pakistan and propose recommendations for improvement. Methodology This study was conducted from June 2020 to July 2023 in three well-known hospitals in different areas of Pakistan and involved 26 patients. Reviews of medical records, interviews, and surveillance report analysis were all part of the data collection process. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis were performed using SPSS Statistics version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) with the statistical significance set at p<0.05. Results The highest incidence of polio was observed in children aged 13-24 months (nine patients, 34.62%), with males accounting for 14 cases (53.85%) and urban residents 16 cases (61.54%). Vaccination status significantly influences disease incidence (p<0.001), with two patients (7.69%) unvaccinated, 10 patients (38.46%) partially vaccinated, and 14 patients (53.85%) fully vaccinated. Paralysis was the predominant symptom in 16 patients (61.54%). Recovery outcomes varied, with eight patients (31%) fully recovering, 12 patients (46%) showing partial improvement, and six patients (23%) experiencing chronic motor impairments. Effective surveillance depends on timely reporting [odds ratio (OR): 2.15, p<0.001] and healthcare worker training (OR: 1.67, p<0.001), highlighting crucial aspects of polio management strategies. Conclusions Based on our findings, vaccination status significantly impacts polio occurrence, with a notable proportion found in partially vaccinated or unvaccinated children. Paralysis remains the primary symptom, with varied recovery outcomes, including chronic motor impairments in some cases. This study underscores Pakistan's ongoing challenges with pediatric polio, highlighting the crucial need for improved vaccination, surveillance, and rehabilitation efforts.</p>
