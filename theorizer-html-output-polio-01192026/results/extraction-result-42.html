                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Despite the attenuation and apparently limited geographic scope of poliovirus circulation in Pakistan, the isolation of WPV1 from an ES site in Karachi is cause for concern about the actual geographic limits of transmission.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Since the establishment of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988, Pakistan remains one of only two countries (along with Afghanistan) with continued endemic transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV). This report describes Pakistan's progress toward polio eradication during January 2022-June 2023. During 2022, Pakistan reported 20 WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases, all of which occurred within a small geographic area encompassing three districts in south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. As of June 23, only a single WPV1 case from Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been reported in 2023, compared with 13 cases during the same period in 2022. In addition, 11 WPV1 isolates have been reported from various environmental surveillance (ES) sewage sampling sites to date in 2023, including in Karachi, the capital of the southern province of Sindh. Substantial gaps remain in the quality of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), especially in poliovirus reservoir areas. Despite the attenuation and apparently limited geographic scope of poliovirus circulation in Pakistan, the isolation of WPV1 from an ES site in Karachi is cause for concern about the actual geographic limits of transmission. Interrupting WPV1 transmission will require meticulous tracking and sustained innovative efforts to vaccinate children who are regularly missed during SIAs and rapidly responding to any new WPV1 isolations.</p>

Environmental surveillance detected WPV1 in multiple districts including an 'orphan' isolate in Karachi that differed by 5.3% in VP1 from its closest prior Karachi relative, indicating long-term undetected circulation. Most paralytic cases clustered in south Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; only one WPV1 case was reported in 2023 (Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). The presence of a case aged 16 years demonstrates that paralytic illness can occur outside the <5 SIA target age group, but quantitatively most cases were young children (median 15 months).</td>

The authors note surveillance gaps (e.g., orphan ES isolate implying long-term undetected transmission) and explicitly cite limitations in surveillance and vaccination coverage estimates (including recall bias and fake finger‑marking), which constrain inference about the role of older age groups. No seroprevalence, viral shedding, contact tracing, or age-stratified transmission modeling data are provided to confirm or refute substantial transmission by older persons.</td>
