These adults may expose immunologically vulnerable contacts abroad (notably, immunodeficient adults or unvaccinated children), forming a 'mobility bridge' for VDPV export. However, evidence from Pakistan indicates that sustained adult-driven VDPV transmission within the Pakistani population is exceptionally rare or absent, and such events only result in onward chains if the recipient population is also susceptible.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

This phenomenon is conditional on the coincidence of importation and adult immunity gaps created by prolonged lack of natural boosting and low vaccine uptake in adults.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

Systematic surveillance and intervention narrowly constrain detection and interruption efforts to young children, and while adults and older children are largely excluded from routine activities, their involvement in poliovirus transmission is only recognized and targeted reactively (e.g., during outbreaks, importations, or at transit points). Routine, large-scale sustained transmission among older ages is not observed or supported by the available evidence from Pakistan, except under unique circumstances such as serological gaps or international importation, where temporary age-expansion interventions are deployed.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

However, all available evidence from environmental, clinical, and molecular sources indicates that if such transmission occurs, it is infrequent, subordinate to child-based transmission, and insufficient to maintain endemicity. When immunity gaps are present (e.g., in mobile populations or cross-border movement), older age groups may play a role as transient carriers or importers.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

Although older age groups (older children, adolescents, adults) are occasionally involved as spillover cases, importers, or transient shedders (notably in the context of population movements or immunodeficient hosts), there is no evidence for a sustained, silent reservoir in these populations sufficient to maintain endemic transmission independently of under-five child cycles.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> School-Age Silent Reservoir Hypothesis<br><b>Description:</b> School-age children (approximately 5-14 years) in Pakistan may constitute an under-recognized transmission reservoir that bridges the gap between highly-vaccinated young children (<5 years, who receive many OPV doses through routine and campaign efforts) and partially-immune adults (who may have waning immunity but also benefit from any past natural exposure or childhood vaccination). This age group experiences a convergence of risk factors: (1) systematic exclusion from SIAs which target <5 years, (2) potential waning of immunity from early-childhood vaccination without natural boosting in areas transitioning to lower endemicity, (3) high contact rates both with young children (siblings, relatives) and with the broader community through school attendance, (4) high probability of asymptomatic infection making them invisible to AFP surveillance which focuses on <15 years but is most sensitive for detecting young children, and (5) sufficient intestinal viral replication to serve as transmission links despite lower shedding than primary infections in young children. School-age children may be particularly important in sustaining transmission in areas transitioning from high to low endemicity, in districts with suboptimal routine immunization coverage where their childhood vaccination was incomplete, and in areas where programmatic quality issues result in chronically missed children who age into this bracket without adequate immunity.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Endemic Natural Boosting Limits Older-Age Immunity Gaps<br><b>Description:</b> In Pakistan's persistently endemic areas with sustained high-intensity WPV1 circulation (particularly southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and historically active districts), older children, adolescents, and young adults experience frequent subclinical re-exposure to wild poliovirus through environmental contamination and community circulation. This ongoing natural boosting of immunity maintains relatively high protection levels in older age groups despite their exclusion from vaccination campaigns, effectively limiting immunity gaps in these ages. Consequently, in the most endemic areas, the transmission reservoir and immunity gaps remain concentrated in the youngest children (<5 years) who have had insufficient time to accumulate natural boosting exposures, rather than shifting to older ages as might occur in lower-transmission or newly-affected settings. As transmission intensity declines during the eradication end-game, this natural boosting diminishes, potentially unmasking immunity gaps in older age groups who were previously protected by repeated environmental exposure but are not targeted by routine immunization or supplementary campaigns.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Adult-Mediated Long-Distance Dissemination Theory<br><b>Description:</b> Adults and older adolescents play a specific and under-recognized role in the long-distance geographic dissemination of poliovirus from Pakistan's endemic reservoirs through asymptomatic carriage during travel, migration, and trade activities. While local transmission and paralytic cases are concentrated in young children (<5 years) with limited mobility in specific high-risk areas (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan, Karachi), older age groups with greater geographic mobility can acquire subclinical infections in endemic areas and transport virus over long distances (>100 km, including internationally), seeding environmental detections and potentially initiating transmission chains in previously uninfected areas. This mechanism is particularly important for explaining: (1) environmental surveillance detections in areas distant from case clusters, (2) orphan virus detections indicating undetected transmission, (3) international importation events to polio-free regions, and (4) cross-border transmission between Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, this theory operates within the context that most sustained transmission occurs through local chains in high-risk areas among young children, and that in endemic settings older cohorts are frequently boosted by natural exposure, limiting the extent of their susceptibility to reinfection.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Age-Stratified Surveillance Gap Theory of Poliovirus Transmission<br><b>Description:</b> Poliovirus transmission in Pakistan is incompletely characterized due to systematic surveillance gaps in older age groups (≥5 years, adolescents, and adults). While paralytic cases concentrate in young children due to age-dependent disease risk, actual transmission chains may involve contributions from older age groups who experience predominantly asymptomatic or subclinical infections. The programmatic focus on children <5 years for vaccination campaigns and <15 years for AFP surveillance creates a structural blind spot that systematically underestimates the role of older ages in maintaining circulation and enabling geographic spread. However, in endemic settings with sustained high transmission (such as core reservoir areas in Pakistan), natural boosting through ongoing environmental exposure may maintain immunity in older age groups and limit their transmission reservoir role compared to lower-transmission or previously polio-free settings.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> theorizer-literature-supported-accuracy-focused-12102025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>
