                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In Pakistan's persistently endemic areas with sustained high-intensity WPV1 circulation (particularly southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and historically active districts), older children, adolescents, and young adults experience frequent subclinical re-exposure to wild poliovirus through environmental contamination and community circulation. This ongoing natural boosting of immunity maintains relatively high protection levels in older age groups despite their exclusion from vaccination campaigns, effectively limiting immunity gaps in these ages. Consequently, in the most endemic areas, the transmission reservoir and immunity gaps remain concentrated in the youngest children (<5 years) who have had insufficient time to accumulate natural boosting exposures, rather than shifting to older ages as might occur in lower-transmission or newly-affected settings. As transmission intensity declines during the eradication end-game, this natural boosting diminishes, potentially unmasking immunity gaps in older age groups who were previously protected by repeated environmental exposure but are not targeted by routine immunization or supplementary campaigns.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Endemic Circulation-Maintained Older-Age Immunity</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In geographic areas with sustained high-intensity WPV1 circulation (operationally defined as areas with ≥2 paralytic cases per year and ≥20% environmental surveillance sample positivity, or districts classified as 'core reservoirs' by national programs), older children (5-14 years), adolescents (15-19 years), and adults maintain high levels of poliovirus-specific immunity (estimated >80% protection against paralysis and >60% mucosal immunity) through repeated subclinical natural exposures. This results in low susceptibility to infection and limited contribution to onward transmission despite lack of targeted vaccination in these age groups. The immunity maintenance effect is inversely proportional to circulation intensity: as WPV1 environmental detection rates decline below 5%, natural boosting decreases and immunity gaps in older ages may emerge within 1-3 years.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies specifically to hyperendemic poliovirus circulation settings in Pakistan, particularly core WPV1 reservoir districts (North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan, parts of Bannu) during periods of sustained high transmission (2010-2022, with environmental positivity rates >20% and multiple annual cases). Also applicable to Quetta block (Balochistan) and specific union councils in Peshawar and Karachi during their high-transmission periods. Less applicable in areas with sporadic transmission (environmental positivity <5%), recently introduced virus, or areas that have experienced transmission interruption for >2 years where older populations lack recent accumulated exposure history.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Newly arrived migrants or internally displaced persons entering endemic areas from virus-free regions (e.g., moving from Punjab to North Waziristan) may lack natural immunity regardless of age, creating pockets of susceptible older individuals.</li>
                <li>During temporary interruptions of circulation (e.g., due to intensive campaigns or seasonal factors), immunity may wane in older ages if the interruption is prolonged (>1-2 years), particularly mucosal immunity which wanes faster than systemic immunity.</li>
                <li>The natural boosting effect applies to both mucosal and systemic immunity; however, immunity to paralysis (systemic) may be maintained even better than mucosal immunity in older ages, so older individuals may still shed virus transiently even if protected from disease.</li>
                <li>Immunocompromised individuals of any age may not develop or maintain immunity from natural exposure and can become chronic shedders regardless of exposure frequency.</li>
                <li>Individuals born during temporary periods of interrupted transmission (e.g., 2019 when cases dropped to very low levels in some areas) may lack natural boosting exposure despite living in endemic areas, creating 'birth cohort gaps'.</li>
                <li>Urban versus rural differences in exposure intensity (e.g., Karachi urban slums vs. rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) may create heterogeneity in natural boosting within the same district, with urban areas potentially having more intense exposure due to higher population density and environmental contamination.</li>
                <li>Areas with extremely poor sanitation may provide more intense environmental exposure, enhancing natural boosting effects beyond what would be predicted by case rates alone.</li>
                <li>Mobile populations (nomads, seasonal migrants, cross-border populations) may have irregular exposure patterns that don't fit the endemic boosting model, despite living in endemic regions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Paper explicitly states that in endemic settings (including Pakistan) ongoing WPV circulation provides frequent boosting of immunity in older children, concentrating transmission and paralytic cases in younger children (mean age ~2 years). <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Modeling conclusion: in endemic settings vaccinating older children/adolescents offers little incremental benefit for eradication because ongoing WPV circulation keeps older cohorts boosted, by contrast to previously polio-free areas where older children can be important in transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>In endemic countries the mean age of WPV infection is ~2 years and the majority of confirmed type-1 paralytic cases are in children under five, indicating limited sustained immunity gaps in older children due to frequent boosting from ongoing WPV circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Expanded-age-group campaigns mostly boost already-high antibody titers in older children (diminishing returns), reducing only a very small fraction (<1% change) of individuals with low mucosal titers in 5-9 year olds in endemic settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Model result indicates that immunity gaps in older children are minimal in endemic settings because of natural boosting from ongoing transmission, so expanded-age campaigns provide little additional benefit compared to focusing on reaching chronically missed younger children. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Quantitative comparison from modeling: baseline elimination probability ~24%; expanding three annual SIAs to 5-14y increased elimination probability by only ~8%, while adding two targeted outreach SIAs focusing on hard-to-reach groups produced a much larger improvement (~55% increase), demonstrating limited benefit of vaccinating older children in endemic settings versus reaching missed younger children. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Historical pattern in pre-eradication LMICs showed paralytic disease began at 4-5 months and median 12-13 months, with disease largely confined to children by age 5 during endemic periods, consistent with older ages being protected by accumulated exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>WPV1 case data from Pakistan Jan 2020-Jul 2021 showed 85 cases with ages 3 months-13 years (median 18 months), with no cases reported in persons >13 years despite ongoing high transmission, suggesting older ages were protected. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> </li>
    <li>WPV1 cases during Jan 2021-Jul 2022 ranged 7-28 months (median 15 months) with no cases in older children/adolescents/adults reported, consistent with endemic boosting protecting older ages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> </li>
    <li>WPV1 case series Jan 2022-Jun 2023 showed 21 cases with ages 3-197 months (median 15 months), with 20 of 21 cases in very young children and only one outlier at age 16 years, demonstrating continued concentration in youngest ages during endemic transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> </li>
    <li>AFP surveillance focuses on <15 years, but actual paralytic WPV1 cases were concentrated in infants/toddlers (7-28 months) with no paralytic cases in older children/adolescents reported in 2021-2022 period, suggesting older children were not susceptible. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.3" class="evidence-link">[e31.3]</a> </li>
    <li>cVDPV2 cases (Jul 2019-Jul 2021) showed age range 2 months-12 years (median 18 months), again concentrated in youngest children with no older adolescent/adult cases despite widespread circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.3" class="evidence-link">[e30.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance showing high positivity rates (53% WPV1-positive in 2020, 18% cVDPV2-positive in 2020) indicating intense community circulation, yet paralytic cases remained concentrated in young children, suggesting older ages were protected despite high environmental exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Serotype-2 immunity modeling for Pakistan showed that in endemic areas (FATA, southern KPK) during high transmission periods, immunity gaps were concentrated in children <36 months, not in older children, consistent with older children being boosted by circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper notes that mass polio vaccination campaigns aim to protect children under age 5, with this programmatic focus leaving older age groups unvaccinated; yet in endemic areas, disease burden remains in young children despite lack of older-age vaccination. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Model calibrated to endemic settings found that among unvaccinated 5-9 year-olds, the proportion with low mucosal immunity changed only from 69% to 62% after expanded-age campaigns, suggesting many already had immunity from natural exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying concept is established in historical and modeling literature, but its specific application to Pakistan's endemic districts with operational thresholds and programmatic implications (prioritizing hard-to-reach young children over expanded-age campaigns in endemic areas) is a contextualized extension that synthesizes existing theory with Pakistan-specific epidemiological patterns.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept that endemic circulation provides natural boosting and that paralytic cases concentrate in young children in endemic areas is recognized in historical polio epidemiology literature (Paul 1971, Nathanson and Martin 1979) and explicitly modeled by Grassly et al. (2014).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit application of this principle to argue that older-age immunity gaps are limited specifically in Pakistan's core endemic areas (with quantitative thresholds for defining endemic intensity), and the mechanistic linking of transmission intensity to the magnitude of natural boosting with operational implications (that expanded-age campaigns have low priority in high-endemic areas), represents a Pakistan-specific refinement with direct programmatic implications for interpreting why older-age contributions may be less important than surveillance gaps alone would suggest.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Transmission Intensity-Dependent Age Shift</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> As WPV1 transmission intensity declines in Pakistan (measured by decreasing incidence of paralytic cases from peaks of >20 cases/year to <5 cases/year, and environmental detection rates declining from >20% to <5% of samples positive), the average age of both paralytic cases and asymptomatic infections increases, reflecting the emergence of immunity gaps in progressively older cohorts as natural boosting frequency decreases. This age shift manifests as an increase in median case age (from ~15 months during high transmission to potentially >24-36 months during low transmission) and may include emergence of cases in school-age children (5-9 years) not seen during endemic periods. The age shift is accelerated if vaccination campaigns continue to target only young children (<5 years), as declining natural exposure unmasks the programmatic immunity gap in older ages. The rate of age shift is proportional to the rate of transmission decline: rapid interruption may show minimal age shift due to insufficient time, while gradual decline over 3-5 years enables detectable shifts in case age distribution.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to Pakistan districts transitioning from high to low endemic transmission during the period 2015-2023, particularly applicable to areas experiencing sustained declines in transmission intensity (e.g., >50% reduction in environmental positivity maintained over 2-3 years). Most relevant for interpreting age distribution changes in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts (North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan) as they transition from core reservoirs to low-transmission areas. Predictions strongest for districts with substantial but gradual transmission reduction allowing time for age-shift to manifest. Less applicable to areas with very rapid transmission interruption (<1 year from high to zero transmission) where age shifts may not have time to appear in case data.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very rapid transmission interruption (e.g., through intensive campaigns achieving >95% coverage in <6 months) may not allow sufficient time for age shifts to become apparent in paralytic case data due to the rarity of cases and short time window.</li>
                <li>Age shifts may be more readily detectable in environmental surveillance or serosurvey data than in paralytic case data due to small case numbers and stochastic variation in rare paralytic events.</li>
                <li>If expanded-age campaigns or changes in routine immunization coverage affect older age groups during the decline phase, this could mask or counteract the natural age shift by vaccinating older children.</li>
                <li>Birth cohorts born during the transition period may show complex immunity patterns: too young to have benefited from endemic boosting but born when natural exposure was declining, creating a 'transition cohort' with unpredictable susceptibility.</li>
                <li>Importation events during the declining phase may show different age distributions than indigenous cases, as imported virus encounters populations with different immunity profiles than those shaped by local endemic transmission.</li>
                <li>Seasonal variation in transmission may complicate detection of secular age trends if seasonal peaks involve different age groups than low-transmission seasons.</li>
                <li>Surveillance sensitivity changes during transmission decline (e.g., enhanced surveillance in response to low case numbers) may create artifacts in apparent age distributions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Comparison between endemic countries (Pakistan, with mean age ~2 years) and previously polio-free countries with importations (mean age much higher) demonstrates that transmission status affects age distribution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Model result that expanded-age campaigns have larger impact in previously polio-free areas than endemic areas implies that immunity gaps in older ages emerge when circulation declines or is absent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Historical pattern in pre-eradication LMICs showed paralytic disease began at 4-5 months and median 12-13 months, concentrated in young ages during endemic period; this age concentration is predicted to shift as transmission declines based on historical transitions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance showing decline in WPV1 positivity from 53% (2020) to 12% (2021) to <5% (2022-2023) provides evidence of declining transmission intensity in Pakistan, setting the stage for potential age shifts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental WPV1 detections declined from 65 WPV1-positive samples (7.3%) in 2021 to 37 (3.0%) in 2022 to 11 (1%) in Jan-Mar 2023, documenting sustained transmission decline. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance 2020: 407/768 samples (53%) WPV1-positive; 2021: 65/833 (8%); 2022 Jan-Jul: 13/748 (2%), showing marked sustained decline in transmission intensity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Detection of a case at age 197 months (~16 years) in 2022-2023 case series, an outlier from the typical median of 15 months and the oldest case in recent years, may represent an early signal of age shift as transmission declines. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> </li>
    <li>AFP surveillance detected a case at age 197 months (~16 years), outside the standard <15 year surveillance age group and representing potential surveillance coverage limits for older adolescents during transmission decline. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> </li>
    <li>One adult case (age 22 years) from Pakistan importation to Australia in 2007 illustrates that adults can develop paralytic disease, suggesting potential for older-age cases when immunity gaps exist. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper emphasizes that clinical poliomyelitis is rare relative to infections (<1% of first infections lead to paralysis), so age shifts may manifest more readily in infection/serosurvey data than in paralytic cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Model of endemic settings found that immunity gaps in older children tend not to persist when WPV circulation is high because repeated exposure boosts older cohorts, implying gaps emerge when circulation declines. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Pakistan WPV1 cases declined from 20 in 2022 to 1 in 2023 (through May), marking the lowest transmission levels in years and potentially sufficient decline to unmask older-age immunity gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Narrow band of indigenous WPV1 transmission in security-challenged districts of southern KPK with evidence of declining transmission provides a natural laboratory for observing age shifts during eradication end-game. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Review notes that risk of paralytic disease increases with age (paralysis in ~1/1000 infections in infants vs ~1/75 in adults), so as immunity gaps shift to older ages, case:infection ratio may increase, making case-based age shifts more detectable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.1" class="evidence-link">[e11.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Serotype-2 modeling shows that after OPV2 withdrawal, immunity declined in children <36 months in areas without mOPV2 campaigns, demonstrating how cessation of exposure (whether from vaccine or natural circulation) leads to immunity gaps in target ages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Type-2 immunity dropped to <30% in some areas (North Waziristan, Killa Abdullah) during periods of low circulation before mOPV2 campaigns, showing how rapidly immunity gaps can emerge when transmission/exposure ceases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The age-shift phenomenon is established historically and in models for other settings, but its specific prediction for Pakistan's ongoing transition phase (2022-2023) with quantitative predictions (median age increase from 15 months to 24-36 months) and the mechanistic explanation linking it to the interplay of declining natural boosting and child-only vaccination represents a novel synthesis applicable to current programmatic decisions.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Age shifts with declining transmission are documented in historical polio eradication contexts (e.g., USA mid-20th century, Western Europe) and in modeling studies comparing endemic and elimination settings (Grassly et al. 2014). The general principle that immunity gaps shift to older ages when transmission declines is established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific prediction that Pakistan is currently experiencing or will soon experience a detectable age shift as transmission intensity declines below critical thresholds (~5% environmental positivity, <5 cases/year), and the explicit mechanistic link to unmasking of programmatic immunity gaps in older ages who no longer receive natural boosting, represents a novel application to Pakistan's current epidemiological transition. The quantitative thresholds for transmission intensity and predicted median age increases are Pakistan-specific novel predictions.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If age-stratified serosurveys were conducted in 2024 in North Waziristan and Lakki Marwat (highest transmission areas 2020-2022) versus Islamabad or Punjab districts (minimal/no transmission), type-1 neutralizing antibody seroprevalence in persons aged 10-19 years would be significantly higher in the former endemic districts (>75%) versus non-endemic districts (40-60%), demonstrating natural boosting effects in endemic areas.</li>
                <li>If WPV1 transmission intensity continues to decline in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with environmental positivity sustained below 2% for 12+ months, and if paralytic cases occur during this period, they will have a higher median age than the current 15 months, potentially rising to 20-30 months range.</li>
                <li>If historical WPV1 case data from Pakistan were analyzed by year for the period 2015-2023, correlating annual district-level environmental surveillance positivity rates with median case age, a statistically significant negative correlation would be found (lower transmission intensity → higher median case age), with strongest correlation in districts that transitioned from high to low transmission.</li>
                <li>If AFP surveillance data for 2015-2023 were re-analyzed to examine the maximum age of cases by year in endemic districts, an increasing trend in maximum case age would be observed as transmission declined, with the 16-year-old case in 2022-2023 representing the upper end of an emerging trend.</li>
                <li>If environmental surveillance samples from 2020-2022 in North Waziristan were tested for age-specific shedding markers (where available), viral loads in environmental samples would correlate more strongly with population density of 0-5 year-olds during high transmission (2020) but show more diverse age-source signals during declining transmission (2022).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If WPV1 circulation is interrupted in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for ≥2 years (environmental samples negative, no cases), followed by reintroduction through importation from Afghanistan, the resulting outbreak would show substantially higher median case age (≥36 months) and include a higher proportion of cases in school-age children (5-9 years) compared to the current pattern, demonstrating that immunity gaps have shifted to older ages in the absence of natural boosting. The magnitude and timing of such a shift are uncertain and depend on immunity decay rates.</li>
                <li>If serological surveys were conducted 18 months apart (2024 vs. 2025/2026) in areas with successful transmission interruption (e.g., districts with zero WPV1 environmental detections for 18+ months), measuring the same birth cohorts of individuals who were adolescents (15-19 years) at first survey, a measurable decline in type-1 seroprevalence would be observed in the second survey while young children (maintained by vaccination) show stable high seroprevalence. This would quantify the rate of immunity waning in the absence of natural boosting, though the magnitude and rapidity are uncertain.</li>
                <li>If expanded-age campaigns (targeting 0-14 years with OPV) were implemented in endemic districts just as transmission is declining (environmental positivity 2-5%, 1-3 cases/year), the age shift might be prevented or delayed compared to matched control districts receiving standard child-only campaigns, providing a natural experiment on the interaction of programmatic and natural immunity. Whether the effect would be large enough to detect and whether it would impact transmission is unknown.</li>
                <li>If longitudinal cohort studies tracked immunity (serology) in adolescents (age 12-16 years in 2023) living in North Waziristan over 3 years during transmission decline, and compared their immunity trajectories to same-age cohorts in Islamabad (never endemic), the endemic-area cohort would show initial high immunity that declines over time while the non-endemic cohort shows stable low immunity. The rate of decline and whether it becomes epidemiologically significant (allowing transmission) is unknown.</li>
                <li>If detailed phylogenetic analysis of WPV1 strains from 2020-2023 were performed with epidemiologic linkage, transmission chains increasingly involve older source cases (5-15 years) in 2022-2023 compared to 2020 when chains primarily originated from 0-5 year-olds. Whether molecular epidemiology can detect such age-specific source attribution is uncertain.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If serosurveys conducted in 2024 in hyperendemic districts (North Waziristan) during or immediately after high-transmission years show that older children and adolescents (10-19 years) have equally low or lower seroprevalence (<50%) compared to vaccinated young children (3-5 years with ≥3 OPV doses), this would contradict the natural boosting hypothesis and suggest that older ages maintain immunity gaps even during high transmission.</li>
                <li>If no age shift is observed in paralytic cases or infection age distributions over a 5-year period (2023-2028) despite documented transmission decline to very low levels (environmental positivity <1% sustained, <1 case/year), this would challenge the hypothesis that natural boosting is the primary mechanism maintaining older-age immunity in endemic settings and suggest alternative explanations (e.g., persistent low-level vaccination coverage in older ages, cross-reactive immunity from other enteroviruses).</li>
                <li>If a controlled or quasi-experimental trial of expanded-age campaigns (0-14 years) versus standard campaigns (0-4 years) in matched declining-transmission districts (environmental positivity 2-5%) shows large reductions in transmission (>50% reduction in environmental detections) in expanded-age areas despite models predicting minimal benefit in endemic settings, this would suggest older-age immunity gaps exist and are epidemiologically important even in endemic contexts, contrary to the natural boosting theory.</li>
                <li>If detailed environmental surveillance with age-structured sampling (e.g., schools vs. household clusters with young children) in endemic areas during high transmission shows that school-based samples have equal or higher WPV1 positivity rates compared to young-child-cluster samples, this would suggest older school-age children contribute substantially to environmental contamination even during endemic periods, contradicting the theory that they are well-protected by natural boosting.</li>
                <li>If retrospective analysis of the 16-year-old case from 2022-2023 reveals the individual had documented prior WPV1 infection (via medical records or family history) or multiple OPV doses, this would suggest the older-age case was not due to lack of immunity from natural boosting but rather to individual-level factors (immunocompromise, vaccine failure), weakening evidence for population-level age shifts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detections in areas distant from endemic foci (e.g., Karachi, Lahore, Punjab) where transmission has been historically low or absent may not provide sufficient natural boosting to maintain older-age immunity, yet transmission appears limited in these areas despite potential older-age immunity gaps. Alternative explanations could include better vaccination coverage, different sanitation, or lower introduction pressure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The detection of the 16-year-old case even during an endemic period (though at the tail end of declining transmission) suggests some older individuals remain susceptible despite ongoing circulation. This could represent immunocompromised status, vaccine failure, lack of prior exposure due to individual mobility patterns, or alternatively could be an early signal of age shift not fully explained by the theory's timing predictions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Detection of 'orphan' viruses (≥1.5% VP1 divergence from nearest known relative) in environmental surveillance in Karachi and Bannu indicates long-term undetected transmission chains, but the age groups sustaining these chains are unknown. If older ages were maintaining these silent chains despite natural boosting, this would contradict the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Adult importation case (22 years old) returning from Pakistan to Australia (2007) developed paralytic disease, suggesting adults can be susceptible despite Pakistan being endemic. This could represent an expatriate with limited exposure or could suggest natural boosting is less universal than the theory assumes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper emphasizes that reinfected immune adults can participate in transmission chains and spread virus long distances, with examples of cVDPV2 detected in London, Jerusalem, and New York in 2022 interpreted as adult traveler-mediated spread. How endemic boosting affects reinfection susceptibility and shedding in adults is not fully accounted for by the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>WPV1 importation from Pakistan to Malawi in 2021 was 'most probably carried by adults without signs of infection' (trade/business travelers). If Pakistani adults from endemic areas are susceptible to infection despite natural boosting, this challenges the theory; alternatively, they may be reinfections with limited shedding, which the theory does not fully address. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Routine immunization coverage among infants is 83% (2021) nationally but highly heterogeneous (Balochistan 45.1% to Punjab 94.9% for 12-23 month olds), yet case distributions don't show clear correlation with these coverage levels across provinces, suggesting other factors (potentially including natural boosting in endemic areas) are important. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.2" class="evidence-link">[e20.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Type-2 serosurveys in 6-11 month-olds showed substantial immunity gaps after tOPV withdrawal, but no comparable surveys in older children/adolescents were conducted, so the theory's prediction of maintained older-age immunity in endemic areas lacks direct serological confirmation for Pakistan. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Surveys of adults in Pakistan showed lower vaccination rates than children, with markedly lower adult immunization coverage, yet no adult paralytic cases were detected during endemic periods. Whether this reflects natural boosting immunity or other factors (case-fatality differences, surveillance gaps) is not fully explained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-24.html#e24.0" class="evidence-link">[e24.0]</a> </li>
