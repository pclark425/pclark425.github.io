                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Due to the exclusive focus of AFP surveillance and SIAs on children under fifteen and under five respectively, there is a knowledge gap about the precise contribution of older children, adolescents, and adults to silent poliovirus transmission in Pakistan. However, all available evidence from environmental, clinical, and molecular sources indicates that if such transmission occurs, it is infrequent, subordinate to child-based transmission, and insufficient to maintain endemicity. When immunity gaps are present (e.g., in mobile populations or cross-border movement), older age groups may play a role as transient carriers or importers.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Limited Surveillance and Intervention Among Older Age Groups Creates Data Gaps</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Because routine AFP surveillance is concentrated on children <15 and case/campaign targeting is on <5, the role of older ages (15+) in transmission is not directly observed; environmental detection suggests possible silent transmission in unmonitored groups, but no sustained or large-scale outbreaks implicating older ages have been detected.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies nationally to all surveillance and intervention syndromes for poliovirus in Pakistan, 2010–2024.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Surveillance definitions and non-detection of older ages do not exclude occasional, undetected older-age transmission, especially where immunity is low.</li>
                <li>Importation or outbreak events (Xinjiang, Barcelona immunodeficient excretor) are exceptions and highlight potential areas for data gap bridging.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Surveillance and vaccination targeting definitions: AFP <15 years, SIAs <5 years; coverage/vaccine status tracking rarely extends to older children/adolescents/adults. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.2" class="evidence-link">[e59.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.1" class="evidence-link">[e56.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.1" class="evidence-link">[e58.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.4" class="evidence-link">[e59.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.0" class="evidence-link">[e45.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detects circulation even in absence of reported cases; these positives may reflect silent transmission not fully attributed to age. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.3" class="evidence-link">[e59.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-35.html#e35.0" class="evidence-link">[e35.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.0" class="evidence-link">[e58.0]</a> </li>
    <li>All-age vaccination at border crossings and for high-risk mobile populations is implemented specifically to cover possible immunity gaps in adults and older children; these interventions are preventive, acknowledging, but not measuring, risk. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Narrative, review, and programmatic sources consistently note the lack of direct epidemiological measurement or research among older children and adults. <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.0" class="evidence-link">[e44.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-47.html#e47.0" class="evidence-link">[e47.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-33.html#e33.0" class="evidence-link">[e33.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-57.html#e57.0" class="evidence-link">[e57.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory defines the knowledge boundary and potential for unknowns, while arguing that all available evidence, both positive and negative, points toward a subordinate role for older ages.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is well-established that polio surveillance targets children, and that adult infections are potentially missed; global guidance focuses interventions on young children.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Synthesizes negative evidence and surveillance/data practice to explicitly state that knowledge gaps exist but all observed clinical, environmental, and outbreak evidence suggest these gaps are only of limited practical consequence for sustained endemic transmission.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Older Age Transmission Primarily as Spillover During Immunity Gaps, Not as Endemic Reservoirs</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Older children, adolescents, and adults may play a supporting role as spillover transmitters or bridging hosts during periods or regions of low historic immunity (e.g., Xinjiang 2011, mobile high-risk groups), but the lack of recurrent, widespread outbreaks in these populations in Pakistan demonstrates that they do not form a robust or self-sustaining transmission reservoir.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Boundary and exceptional event contexts in Pakistan and regions epidemiologically linked to Pakistan, 2010–2024.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Exceptional settings with extremely low adult immunity (Xinjiang) allow for short-term outbreaks involving adults, but these are rare and context-dependent.</li>
                <li>Does not predict substantial adult-driven, silent endemic cycles during normal program practice.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Xinjiang 2011 outbreak showed adults 15–39 (low seroprevalence) accounting for ~50% of all cases, with low geometric mean titres and lower immunity than younger children. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>
    <li>All-age vaccination at borders/entry points implemented after recognition that mobile adults may serve as pathway for importation—but routine transmission resumes primarily among children when child immunity is low. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-48.html#e48.0" class="evidence-link">[e48.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Evidence from Spain (VDPV importation): adult immunodeficient individual shedding VDPV for years due to secondary exposure via adult contacts from Pakistan; essentially never detected in routine Pakistani surveillance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>No documented persistent or large-scale outbreaks in older populations in Pakistan proper, despite extensive environmental and clinical surveillance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.0" class="evidence-link">[e59.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.1" class="evidence-link">[e59.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.1" class="evidence-link">[e55.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.0" class="evidence-link">[e41.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory is related to existing concepts of polio transmission, but more precisely defines spillover and boundary roles in light of new and broader evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is recognized in polio epidemiology that adults with low immunity can participate in outbreaks when exposed, especially where historic vaccine coverage has been poor.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Careful conceptual distinction and synthesis in the Pakistani context: defines older-age group role as primarily a bridging or spillover phenomenon that does not sustain endemic cycles.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multi-year absence of adult/adolescent-targeted surveillance will continue to yield very few (if any) confirmed paralytic polio cases in these age groups, except during exceptional immunity-gap contexts.</li>
                <li>Future importation-linked outbreaks in areas with significant adult/adolescent immunity gaps will result in transient spread involving older ages, but will not shift the dominant transmission profile away from children.</li>
                <li>Environmental surveillance, while sometimes persistent, will largely be resolved through campaigns targeting children rather than newly implemented adult/adolescent interventions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Should a large population cohort of Pakistani adults/adolescents systematically sampled in an environmental-positive area demonstrate high rates of asymptomatic viral shedding, this could indicate more significant undetected transmission than previously appreciated.</li>
                <li>If SIA scale-back among children is matched with improved adult immunization, transmission will recur if under-five coverage falls, demonstrating dependency on child immunity regardless of adult vaccination improvements.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a large, repeated cohort study detects significant persistent poliovirus shedding in >1% of healthy adults/adolescents, this theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If an extended outbreak is recognized among adults/adolescents without concurrent/supervening paediatric cases or evidence of transmission linkage to children, this would conflict with the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Deficiency of age-resolved environmental or direct virological/shedding research among Pakistani older-age groups leaves room for undetected transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.3" class="evidence-link">[e59.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.0" class="evidence-link">[e38.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.1" class="evidence-link">[e38.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Potential for unique social/cultural mixing patterns, not accounted for in current surveillance or analytic models. </li>
