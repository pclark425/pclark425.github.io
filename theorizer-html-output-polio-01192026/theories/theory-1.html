                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Poliovirus transmission in Pakistan is incompletely characterized due to systematic surveillance gaps in older age groups (≥5 years, adolescents, and adults). While paralytic cases concentrate in young children due to age-dependent disease risk, actual transmission chains may involve contributions from older age groups who experience predominantly asymptomatic or subclinical infections. The programmatic focus on children <5 years for vaccination campaigns and <15 years for AFP surveillance creates a structural blind spot that systematically underestimates the role of older ages in maintaining circulation and enabling geographic spread. However, in endemic settings with sustained high transmission (such as core reservoir areas in Pakistan), natural boosting through ongoing environmental exposure may maintain immunity in older age groups and limit their transmission reservoir role compared to lower-transmission or previously polio-free settings.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Age-Dependent Surveillance Sensitivity Inequality</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The sensitivity of poliovirus detection systems in Pakistan decreases sharply with age, with high sensitivity for paralytic disease in children <15 years (via AFP surveillance achieving nonpolio AFP rates >15 per 100,000 and stool adequacy >85%) but near-zero sensitivity for infection detection in persons ≥15 years, creating systematic underascertainment of older-age transmission contributions.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to Pakistan's poliovirus surveillance infrastructure during the endemic period (2010-2023), encompassing AFP surveillance systems (targeting <15 years), environmental surveillance programs (114 sites by 2023), and supplementary immunization activities (targeting <5 years). Relevant to contexts where surveillance and intervention systems are age-targeted rather than population-wide.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Environmental surveillance provides age-agnostic detection but cannot attribute contributions to specific age groups without paired individual-level sampling.</li>
                <li>Importation case investigations may occasionally capture adult cases (e.g., travel-associated cases like the 2007 Pakistan→Australia case), but these are not part of routine systematic surveillance.</li>
                <li>The single detected case at age 197 months (~16 years) in 2022-2023 demonstrates that AFP surveillance can occasionally detect older adolescent cases, but this is outside the standard <15 year focus and such cases are rare in routine reporting.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>AFP surveillance explicitly covers persons aged <15 years only, with performance indicators (nonpolio AFP rate and stool adequacy) calculated per 100,000 population <15 years. National NPAFP rate was 18.9 per 100,000 <15 in 2022 and 15.3 in 2023, exceeding WHO benchmark of ≥2. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.3" class="evidence-link">[e31.3]</a> </li>
    <li>AFP surveillance performance during 2020-2021 showed national nonpolio AFP rate 15.3 per 100,000 <15 years in 2020, annualized 10.3 in 2021, with stool adequacy rates ≥80%, but coverage limited to <15 year age group. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Supplementary immunization activities systematically target children aged <5 years. NIDs typically target ~40-44 million children <5 nationwide with no routine inclusion of older children, adolescents, or adults in mass OPV campaigns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.1" class="evidence-link">[e20.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.1" class="evidence-link">[e30.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Routine immunization coverage estimates are reported only for infants by age 12 months and children aged 12-23 months (WHO/UNICEF 2021 estimate: 83% for 3 OPV doses and 83% for 1 IPV dose), with no systematic coverage data for older age groups. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.2" class="evidence-link">[e20.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>One WPV1 case was detected in a person aged 197 months (~16 years) during 2022-2023, demonstrating that reliance on <15 year surveillance can miss cases in older adolescents. This case fell outside the standard surveillance age group. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detects poliovirus circulation at community level without age resolution, revealing 'orphan' viruses (≥1.5% VP1 divergence) indicating long-term undetected transmission not captured by AFP surveillance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The 2016-2019 serosurveys in Pakistan measured immunity only in children aged 6-11 months (n=12,109 samples), explicitly excluding older children, adolescents, and adults, with authors noting lack of older-age data as a limitation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Spatio-temporal immunity modeling for Pakistan (2004-2016) was restricted to children <36 months (n=24,730 non-polio AFP cases) with no data on immunity gaps in older children or adults. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.0" class="evidence-link">[e16.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SIA targeting focus on children <5 years illustrated by campaigns: Feb 2020-July 2021 NIDs targeted ~40 million children but excluded older ages; November 2021 combined measles-rubella campaign reached 90 million persons aged 9 months-15 years with MR vaccine but bOPV was limited to <5 years. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.1" class="evidence-link">[e30.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.5" class="evidence-link">[e31.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Mass campaigns aim to protect children under age 5 and are a central eradication strategy; programmatic shortfalls noted but focus remains on <5 year target. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Review notes that GPEI immunization activities target children <5 years in LMICs with many OPV doses, while only some countries provide 1-2 IPV doses; programmatic focus excludes older ages from routine vaccination efforts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.0" class="evidence-link">[e11.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While surveillance age-targeting is standard GPEI practice documented extensively (WHO 2018 surveillance standards, multiple MMWR progress reports), the specific framing of this as creating systematic blind spots that may mask older-age transmission roles in endemic settings represents a novel synthesis of the operational and epidemiological evidence from Pakistan that is not explicitly stated as a unified concept in the reviewed literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Age-targeted surveillance for poliovirus (AFP in <15 years) is a long-standing WHO standard established in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and the concentration of paralytic cases in young children is well-established epidemiology documented since the 1950s.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit characterization of age-stratified surveillance sensitivity as a structural inequality that systematically creates knowledge gaps about older-age transmission contributions is not comprehensively articulated in the Pakistan polio literature, particularly the quantitative contrast between high sensitivity in young children (NPAFP >15 per 100,000) and near-zero systematic detection in older ages creating potential for unrecognized transmission reservoirs.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Inverse Clinical-to-Subclinical Ratio with Age</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The probability of paralytic disease given poliovirus infection decreases substantially with age (approximately 1 per 1,000 infections in infants versus 1 per 75 in adults representing an ~13-fold difference), such that for every paralytic case detected in older age groups, there are proportionally many more asymptomatic or subclinical infections than in younger children. This creates an age-dependent detection bias where case-based surveillance becomes progressively less sensitive for identifying infected individuals as age increases, making older-age transmission chains particularly difficult to detect through paralytic case surveillance.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to wild-type and vaccine-derived poliovirus infections across all age groups in humans, based on established clinical epidemiology of poliomyelitis documented across multiple settings globally. Most directly applicable to first infections; the ratio may differ for reinfections in previously immune individuals who typically have even lower paralysis rates.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The exact paralysis risk ratios vary by poliovirus type (type 1 vs type 2 vs type 3), dose of exposure, route of infection, and immune status.</li>
                <li>Reinfections in previously immune individuals have even lower rates of paralysis than first infections, potentially <1 per 1,000 infections even in adults.</li>
                <li>Immunocompromised individuals may have altered paralysis risk independent of age, and can shed virus for prolonged periods.</li>
                <li>The age-specific paralysis rates cited are general clinical observations not specifically measured in Pakistan's recent epidemic but extrapolated from historical global data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>General clinical observation that paralysis occurs approximately in 1 per 1,000 infections in infants versus about 1 per 75 infections in adults, though this is classical polio epidemiology not Pakistan-specific measurement. <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.1" class="evidence-link">[e11.1]</a> </li>
    <li>A 22-year-old Australian traveler acquired polio in Pakistan (2007) and developed paralytic disease; the paper emphasizes that for every adult with disease there are many more infected due to the low case:infection ratio, illustrating that adult paralytic cases represent tip of iceberg of adult infections. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Core argument that >99% of first infections are asymptomatic for paralysis and that reinfections in immune adults are commonly asymptomatic but contagious, with adult asymptomatic carriage implicated in importations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>General statement that 95-99% of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic across ages with clinical disease being the minority outcome; paper notes most persons do not develop symptoms (subclinical infections). <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.1" class="evidence-link">[e11.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-24.html#e24.0" class="evidence-link">[e24.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance demonstrates community circulation including asymptomatic excretion, detecting poliovirus in areas without corresponding paralytic cases. In 2020, 53% (407/768) sewage samples WPV1-positive versus only 84 WPV1 paralytic cases nationally. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Importation of WPV1 from Pakistan to Malawi (2021) was most probably carried by adults without signs of infection (asymptomatic adult carriage), demonstrating adults can be infected and transmit without clinical disease. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper states persons vaccinated years or decades earlier can become transiently infected and excrete poliovirus for weeks (asymptomatic or subclinical infections and shedding possible in previously vaccinated individuals including adults). <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Review notes paralytic polio occurs in <1% of WPV-infected children (general statement), implying substantial asymptomatic or non-paralytic circulation can occur across ages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.0" class="evidence-link">[e19.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying clinical epidemiology is well-established and not novel (existing knowledge), but the specific application to explain Pakistan's age-skewed case distribution as a surveillance artifact rather than necessarily evidence of minimal older-age transmission, and the formalization of the detection bias as an 'inverse ratio' concept, represents a novel analytical framework for interpreting endemic country surveillance data.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The age-dependent increase in paralysis risk per infection is classical polio epidemiology established since the mid-20th century and documented extensively in historical literature (Paul 1971, Bodian 1955).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit quantitative framing of this relationship as creating an 'inverse clinical-to-subclinical ratio' that systematically biases surveillance sensitivity by age and makes older-age transmission chains harder to detect, and the specific application of this principle to interpret Pakistan's surveillance data showing few older cases despite potential substantial older-age transmission, represents a novel interpretive framework not explicitly articulated in prior Pakistan polio literature.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Environmental Detection Without Age Attribution Paradox</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Environmental surveillance in Pakistan consistently detects poliovirus circulation (including orphan viruses indicating prolonged undetected transmission with ≥1.5% VP1 sequence divergence) in areas and time periods without corresponding AFP-detected paralytic cases, demonstrating the existence of transmission chains that are not captured by age-targeted clinical surveillance. Since environmental samples represent community-wide excretion from all age groups but cannot be attributed to specific ages without paired individual sampling, these detections provide evidence of uncharacterized transmission that could involve substantial contributions from older ages, though alternative explanations include improved case detection in young ages or circulation primarily among under-vaccinated young children with high subclinical infection rates.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to Pakistan's environmental surveillance network (68-114 sewage sampling sites across provinces) during 2020-2023 and to any setting where environmental surveillance operates alongside age-limited clinical surveillance. Most relevant when interpreting community-level viral detection data in contexts with endemic or epidemic transmission where paralytic cases are concentrated in specific age groups.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Environmental positivity rates reflect a mix of shedding from multiple sources (recently vaccinated children with vaccine virus, acutely infected individuals of any age, chronically infected immunocompromised individuals) and do not directly measure transmission events or differentiate between age groups.</li>
                <li>Detection of orphan viruses (≥1.5% VP1 divergence from known sequences) specifically indicates prolonged undetected circulation but still cannot identify the age groups involved without additional sampling.</li>
                <li>High environmental positivity with few cases could also indicate very high subclinical infection rates among under-vaccinated young children rather than necessarily implicating older ages.</li>
                <li>In endemic high-transmission areas, the paradox may be less pronounced because continuous circulation leads to more paralytic cases in the most susceptible (young, under-vaccinated) population.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detected WPV1 in sewage samples from multiple provinces including orphan viruses in Bannu (April 2022, earliest isolates with ≥1.5% divergence) and Karachi (5.3% VP1 divergence from closest relative), indicating undetected transmission and surveillance gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>A Karachi environmental isolate (2023) differed by 5.3% in VP1 from its closest relative, classifying it as an 'orphan' and indicating long-term undetected local transmission not captured by AFP surveillance, with sequence divergence suggesting prolonged circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance reveals wider geographic circulation than paralytic case detection, detecting WPV1 in areas without recent paralytic cases.

    <li>In 2020, 53% (407/768) sewage samples were WPV1-positive compared to only 84 WPV1 paralytic cases nationally, demonstrating extensive circulation beyond detected cases. 2021 showed 12% (61/513) WPV1-positive environmental samples. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance 2022: 37 of 1,024 sewage samples (4%) WPV1-positive; 2023 (to date): 11 of 1,119 samples (1%) positive. 2021: 65 of 833 samples (8%) positive; 2020: 407 of 786 samples (52%) positive. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental data indicate population-level excretion but do not provide age-specific attribution; papers explicitly note environmental surveillance cannot identify which age groups are responsible for detections without paired individual sampling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While environmental surveillance methods and orphan virus interpretation are standard established practice, the specific framing of Pakistan's extensive environmental findings (e.g., 53% positivity in 2020 with <100 cases) as revealing an age-attribution gap that could mask older-age transmission represents a novel theoretical construct not explicitly articulated in the GPEI literature or Pakistan progress reports.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Environmental surveillance as a complement to AFP surveillance is established practice in the GPEI since the early 2000s, and detection of orphan viruses indicating surveillance gaps is a recognized phenomenon in polio epidemiology and has been documented in multiple settings (Asghar et al. 2014).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit articulation of environmental surveillance findings in Pakistan as evidence of an 'age-attribution paradox' where community-wide circulation is detected but cannot be attributed to age groups, combined with the inference that this missing attribution may conceal substantial older-age contributions, represents a novel synthesis specific to understanding Pakistan's transmission dynamics and the limitations of combining age-agnostic environmental data with age-limited clinical surveillance.</p>

            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Vaccination strategies in Pakistan that exclusively or predominantly target young children (<5 years for SIAs, infants for routine immunization) create immunity gradients where protection is repeatedly boosted in the youngest cohorts but may wane in older age groups who are not systematically reached by campaigns. However, in endemic settings with ongoing high-intensity WPV circulation (such as core reservoir districts in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), natural boosting of immunity through repeated environmental exposure may counteract waning in older cohorts, maintaining their immunity and limiting their potential as transmission reservoirs. Therefore, immunity gap displacement to older ages is most likely in lower-transmission or transitional settings, while in high-transmission endemic areas, immunity gaps remain concentrated in under-vaccinated young children who lack both vaccine-induced and naturally-acquired immunity.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to Pakistan's polio eradication program during the endemic period with repeated SIAs targeting children <5 years (2010-2023). Most relevant in understanding the differential dynamics between high-transmission endemic reservoir areas (e.g., North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat) versus lower-transmission or recently affected areas. Less applicable in settings with very recent introduction of virus where older ages lack any prior exposure, or in post-elimination settings with importations where older ages may be primary reservoir.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In high-transmission endemic areas with frequent wild virus circulation (e.g., North Waziristan 2020-2022 with continuous case detection), natural boosting of immunity in older ages through environmental exposure may counteract waning, reducing immunity gaps in older cohorts and concentrating susceptibility in young under-vaccinated children.</li>
                <li>The immunity gap displacement effect is most pronounced for mucosal (intestinal) immunity relevant to transmission rather than systemic immunity preventing paralysis, as systemic immunity tends to be longer-lasting and may persist even as mucosal immunity wanes.</li>
                <li>Adults who were vaccinated only with IPV (rather than OPV) in childhood may have particularly poor mucosal immunity and be more susceptible to intestinal infection and shedding.</li>
                <li>In areas with improving vaccination coverage and declining transmission intensity, the natural boosting effect diminishes and immunity gaps in older ages may become more prominent.</li>
                <li>Modeling evidence suggests that in endemic settings, expanded-age-group campaigns offer minimal incremental benefit because older cohorts are naturally boosted, whereas such campaigns are highly effective in previously polio-free settings.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>SIAs explicitly target children aged <5 years, with approximately 40-44 million children targeted per national immunization day but no systematic inclusion of older children, adolescents, or adults. Specific campaigns: NIDs typically targeted ~40 million children <5 nationwide. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.1" class="evidence-link">[e20.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.1" class="evidence-link">[e30.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Routine immunization coverage is measured and reported only for infants by age 12 months and children 12-23 months (WHO/UNICEF 2021 estimate: 83% for 3 OPV doses and 1 IPV dose), with no coverage estimates for older age groups. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.2" class="evidence-link">[e20.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper explicitly notes that programmatic immunity gap exists: routine/supplementary immunization is focused on <5-year-olds, leaving transmission potential among older age groups through waning mucosal immunity; programmatic focus on children <5 may leave immunity status in older ages unassessed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>A combined measles-rubella campaign in November 2021 reached 90 million persons aged 9 months to 15 years with MR vaccine, but bOPV in that campaign was limited to children <5 years (41 million doses), leaving older children without OPV boosting despite being reached for other vaccines. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.5" class="evidence-link">[e31.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Conceptual point that secretory (mucosal) immunity declines over years so persons vaccinated long ago (typically older adolescents/adults) can be transiently infected and excrete virus despite prior vaccination; waning mucosal immunity creates potential for older ages to become transmission links. <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper discusses that mucosal immunity wanes with time while systemic (paralysis-preventing) immunity tends to be long-lived, creating potential for older ages to become transmission links despite protection from disease. Comparative point made: systemic immunity long-lived, whereas mucosal immunity wanes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>CRITICAL COUNTEREVIDENCE - In endemic countries (Pakistan included) ongoing WPV circulation provides frequent boosting of immunity in older children; most transmission and paralytic disease occurs in very young children (<5 years). Endemic settings show mean age of WPV infection ~2 years. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>CRITICAL COUNTEREVIDENCE - Modeling study: in endemic settings vaccinating older children offers little incremental benefit for eradication because ongoing WPV circulation keeps older cohorts boosted; immunity gaps in older children tend not to persist in endemic settings because repeated exposure/wild-virus circulation boosts older cohorts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>CRITICAL COUNTEREVIDENCE - Modeling result: expanding SIAs to 5-14 years in endemic settings increased elimination probability by only ~8-18%, while adding targeted outreach SIAs focusing on hard-to-reach groups produced ~55% increase in elimination probability with fewer vaccine doses. EAG mostly boosts already-high titers in older children (diminishing returns). <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper notes GPEI immunization activities target children <5 years in LMICs and such children receive many OPV doses while only some countries provide 1-2 IPV doses; older ages excluded from routine efforts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Review notes adult vaccination coverage described as 'significantly lower' compared to children, suggesting potential population immunity gaps outside the routine pediatric target groups. <a href="../results/extraction-result-24.html#e24.0" class="evidence-link">[e24.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-11.html#e11.0" class="evidence-link">[e11.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the components (waning immunity, age-targeted campaigns, natural boosting) are known and documented, the synthesis into a context-dependent displacement theory that explains differential dynamics between high-transmission endemic areas (where displacement is minimal due to natural boosting) versus lower-transmission settings (where displacement may be significant) represents a novel interpretive framework that integrates both the surveillance gap hypothesis and the counterevidence from endemic settings, not previously articulated as a unified theory in Pakistan polio literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Waning of mucosal immunity over time and the distinction between systemic and mucosal immunity are established concepts in polio vaccinology (Ogra et al. 1968, Sutter et al. 2013). Age-targeting of vaccination campaigns (<5 years) is standard GPEI practice documented since the 1988 WHA resolution. Natural boosting in endemic areas is recognized in modeling literature (Grassly et al. 2006, 2014).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific theoretical construct of 'immunity gap displacement' whereby repeated targeting of young children in endemic settings may inadvertently shift transmission reservoir potential to systematically under-vaccinated older age groups is not explicitly articulated in the Pakistan literature, BUT the critical novel refinement here is the context-dependency: this displacement is most relevant in lower-transmission or transitional settings, while in high-transmission endemic areas natural boosting maintains older-age immunity and gaps remain concentrated in young under-vaccinated children.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If age-stratified serosurveys were conducted in Pakistan comparing children <5 years versus children 5-14 years versus adults ≥18 years in LOW-transmission districts (e.g., Punjab districts with no recent WPV1 cases), type-specific neutralizing antibody titers would be highest in young children (due to recent vaccination), intermediate in school-age children, and lowest in adults, with the steepest decline in mucosal immunity markers (e.g., IgA) versus systemic immunity (IgG).</li>
                <li>If environmental surveillance sampling were expanded to include smaller community-level sites (e.g., neighborhood sewage collection points) rather than just district-level sites, the proportion of sites with detectable WPV1 in the absence of recent paralytic cases would increase, further demonstrating the surveillance gap between environmental circulation and case detection.</li>
                <li>If vaccination campaign lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) were expanded to assess OPV coverage in children 5-9 years old (not just <5 years), coverage would be substantially lower in 5-9 year olds compared to <5 year olds, demonstrating the programmatic immunity gap in older children.</li>
                <li>If retrospective contact tracing and stool sampling were conducted among household contacts and neighbors of confirmed WPV1 cases, asymptomatic poliovirus shedding would be detected in a proportion of contacts, but age-stratified analysis would show higher detection rates in young siblings (<5 years) than in adult household members in endemic reservoir districts where natural boosting is occurring.</li>
                <li>If IPV-only vaccinated adults from Pakistan were tested for stool shedding after oral OPV challenge, a substantial proportion would shed virus despite having neutralizing antibodies, demonstrating poor mucosal immunity in the absence of OPV vaccination or natural boosting.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If mass vaccination campaigns were expanded to include all persons up to age 30 years in LOWER-transmission districts of Pakistan (e.g., Punjab, Sindh) that have had recent environmental detections but few cases, transmission detected by environmental surveillance would decline more rapidly than with <5 year campaigns alone. However, in HIGH-transmission endemic reservoir districts (e.g., North Waziristan), expanded age campaigns would show minimal additional impact due to natural boosting maintaining immunity in older ages. This would demonstrate context-dependent immunity gap displacement and would be highly impactful in guiding programmatic strategy.</li>
                <li>If AFP surveillance were expanded to systematically capture cases in all ages (including adults ≥15 years) with enhanced sensitivity and active case-finding, the age distribution of detected paralytic cases might shift somewhat older OR remain heavily concentrated in <5 years. If it shifts substantially (≥20% of cases in persons ≥5 years), this would validate that current surveillance misses many older cases; if it remains concentrated in young children, this would validate that paralytic disease truly occurs almost exclusively in young children regardless of transmission patterns, supporting the inverse clinical-to-subclinical ratio hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If whole-genome sequencing of poliovirus isolates from environmental samples and from matched household surveys with age-stratified sampling were analyzed for transmission chain reconstruction in both high-transmission (North Waziristan) and low-transmission (Punjab) settings, phylogenetic analysis might reveal that ≥30% of transmission events involve index cases aged ≥5 years transmitting to young children in low-transmission settings, but <10% in high-transmission endemic areas, demonstrating context-dependent transmission dynamics. This would be highly impactful for targeting interventions.</li>
                <li>If adult travelers from endemic districts of Pakistan to polio-free countries were systematically screened for poliovirus shedding (stool sampling) upon arrival during peak transmission season, the proportion actively shedding WPV1 asymptomatically could be ≥1% (demonstrating substantial adult reservoir) or <0.1% (suggesting minimal adult contribution). Given the low paralysis rate in adults, even if 0.1-1% of travelers are shedding, this could represent a substantial infection reservoir, but the true rate and its implications for transmission are unknown and would be highly impactful for understanding importation risk and adult transmission roles.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If intensive age-stratified serosurveys in high-transmission endemic reservoir districts (North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat during 2020-2022 peak transmission) show that adults and older children have equally high or higher type-specific neutralizing antibody prevalence (≥90%) and titers compared to young children, this would challenge the assumption of immunity gaps in older ages in endemic settings and would support that ongoing circulation maintains their immunity through natural boosting, contradicting the immunity gap displacement hypothesis in high-transmission areas.</li>
                <li>If stool-based poliovirus shedding surveys in household contacts of cases conducted with rigorous methodology find zero or negligible shedding (≤1%) among persons ≥15 years compared to substantial shedding (≥20%) in children <5 years across both high and low transmission settings, this would strongly contradict the hypothesis that older ages contribute substantially to transmission chains and would support that transmission is primarily within young-child networks.</li>
                <li>If genetic epidemiology and comprehensive contact tracing definitively reconstruct transmission chains showing that >95% of transmission events are from children <5 years to other children <5 years with minimal involvement of older ages as intermediaries, even in settings with extensive environmental detection, this would support that transmission is primarily within young-child networks and that environmental detection reflects cumulative shedding from infected young children rather than older-age reservoirs.</li>
                <li>If expanded-age-group SIAs (targeting 0-14 years instead of 0-4 years) in Pakistan core endemic reservoir districts (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) show no reduction in WPV1 incidence or environmental detection compared to standard <5 year campaigns over a 2-year period, this would suggest older children do not constitute a significant transmission reservoir in endemic settings and would support the natural boosting hypothesis that older ages are protected by ongoing circulation.</li>
                <li>If systematic serological surveys of OPV-vaccinated adults aged 20-40 years in both endemic and non-endemic districts of Pakistan show equally high mucosal immunity markers (IgA, neutralizing antibodies) regardless of recent WPV circulation intensity in their area, this would contradict the waning mucosal immunity hypothesis and challenge the concept that programmatic targeting creates immunity gaps in older ages.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The evidence that in endemic countries (Pakistan included in analysis group) ongoing WPV circulation provides frequent boosting of immunity in older children, concentrating transmission in very young children (mean age ~2 years), suggests older children may not have large immunity gaps in high-transmission settings. Paper states endemic countries have much lower mean age (~2 years) of infection and far fewer cases in older children. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The extremely high proportion (81-87%) of WPV1 paralytic cases in Pakistan being zero-dose or severely under-vaccinated young children concentrates the documented immunity gap precisely in the youngest age group rather than older ages. Among 21 cases in 2022-2023, 17 (81%) had never received OPV; among 15 cases in 2021-2022, 87% were zero-dose. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Modeling studies calibrated to endemic settings (Nigeria data) suggest that expanded-age-group campaigns offer only modest benefits in endemic areas (elimination probability increase ~8-18% for expanding SIAs to 5-14 years) where older children are naturally boosted, compared to much larger benefits (implied from comparison) in previously polio-free areas. Adding targeted outreach to hard-to-reach groups produced ~55% increase in elimination probability, demonstrating greater impact of reaching missed young children than expanding age groups. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The modeling conclusion that EAG campaigns mostly boost already-high antibody titers in older children in endemic settings (diminishing returns), reducing only a very small fraction (<1% change) of individuals with low mucosal titers in 5-9 year olds, because endemic settings have ongoing wild virus circulation that naturally boosts older cohorts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>All 15 WPV1 cases in 2021-2022 were aged 7-28 months (median 15 months) and 21 cases in 2022-2023 were aged 3-197 months (median 15 months), with only one case at age 16 years being a rare outlier. Case age distributions remain heavily concentrated in infancy/toddlerhood despite extensive circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Both WPV1 and cVDPV2 cases have similar age profiles (median ~18 months for cVDPV2 cases during Jul 2019-Jul 2021, range 2 months to 12 years) with vast majority among infants/toddlers, suggesting similar transmission dynamics concentrate disease burden in youngest ages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.3" class="evidence-link">[e30.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The 2016-2019 serosurveys among 6-11 month olds showed marked heterogeneity in type-2 immunity by area and by birth cohort (children born before vs after tOPV switch), but also cited other studies (Afghanistan, India) that found higher type-2 seroprevalence in older cohorts (36-48 months) than in 6-11 month olds, suggesting older children in those settings retained immunity from pre-switch exposures. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> </li>
