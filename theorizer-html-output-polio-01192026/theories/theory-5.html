                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Despite evidence of viral circulation detectable by environmental and molecular surveillance, the overwhelming epidemiologic and clinical burden of symptomatic and detected asymptomatic poliovirus transmission in Pakistan is maintained by children under five years of age. Although older age groups (older children, adolescents, adults) are occasionally involved as spillover cases, importers, or transient shedders (notably in the context of population movements or immunodeficient hosts), there is no evidence for a sustained, silent reservoir in these populations sufficient to maintain endemic transmission independently of under-five child cycles.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Clinical and Virological Case Burden Skewed to Young Children</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> More than 90% of all detected paralytic WPV1 and cVDPV2 cases in Pakistan occur in children under five, with case median ages typically between 15 and 18 months. Confirmed cases in older children or adolescents are rare outliers, and no adult paralytic cases are detected in recent surveillance data, despite high-intensity national environmental and clinical case-finding efforts.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to AFP surveillance-confirmed polio (all types) and national case-based transmission chains as detected with standard surveillance in all provinces and major subnational units of Pakistan, 2016–2024.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Paralytic cases in children older than five (up to 13–16 years) occasionally occur but are much less frequent.</li>
                <li>This law does not capture asymptomatic infections, which may go undetected by clinical surveillance.</li>
                <li>Does not apply to exceptional importations or immunodeficient-host shedding events.</li>

            <h3>Statement 1: Asymptomatic Adult and Older Child Transmission is Rare and Insufficient to Sustain Endemic Circulation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> There is no evidence for sustained or epidemiologically significant poliovirus reservoirs in older children, adolescents, or adults in Pakistan. Environmental surveillance and molecular epidemiology consistently trace persistent virus circulation to areas of low child coverage, not to unvaccinated older-age populations, and intensified SIAs in children are consistently sufficient to interrupt environmental virus detection.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to nationwide environmental (sewage) surveillance, molecular lineage tracking, and outbreak response in Pakistan from 2010–2024.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Adult or older child transmission may occur as a transitory phenomenon during large population movements (e.g., border crossing events), importation, or among immunodeficient excretors, but is insufficient to sustain endemicity in the absence of susceptible young children.</li>
                <li>Serological or molecular evidence of transmission outside the under-15 population is rare and mostly limited to exceptional or imported events (Xinjiang, Barcelona VDPV importation).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detects circulating poliovirus in absence of paralytic cases but these signals are eliminated by SIAs focused on children; thus, majority of transmission is child-driven. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.3" class="evidence-link">[e59.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-35.html#e35.0" class="evidence-link">[e35.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.0" class="evidence-link">[e58.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Case-based and molecular epidemiology model endemic and outbreak risks according to immunity/vaccine coverage in young children, not unvaccinated adults. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.0" class="evidence-link">[e36.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-48.html#e48.0" class="evidence-link">[e48.0]</a> </li>
    <li>All-age border/transit interventions implemented only as preventive measures during mass migration or importation events, not in routine response to sustained adult-driven circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Modelling and serosurveys in Pakistan focus on children; no systematic detection or modelling of endemic, silent adult reservoirs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.0" class="evidence-link">[e38.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.1" class="evidence-link">[e38.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Reports of importation events (Xinjiang outbreak, VDPV case in Barcelona) highlight rare outbreaks in older ages when immunity is extremely low, but these are exceptional spillovers and not characteristic of routine transmission in Pakistan. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Sustained routine SIAs and routine immunization, when sufficiently high among children, are uniformly associated with disappearance of environmental positives regardless of adult vaccination status. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.4" class="evidence-link">[e59.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.2" class="evidence-link">[e59.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Statement advances the argument by drawing on detailed Pakistani evidence and multi-mode surveillance (molecular, environmental, programmatic), explicitly countering the silent adult reservoir hypothesis for modern endemic transmission.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Established theory recognizes children as main transmitters, with adult/asymptomatic carriage known but rarely sustaining prolonged transmission.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly synthesizes new Pakistani molecular/environmental evidence and negative findings from high-sensitivity surveillance to refute hidden reservoirs in older populations, and differentiates between endemic versus import-driven or immunodeficient-host transmission.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a district reaches >95% OPV coverage among children <5, and SIAs continue at intense frequency, environmental detection of poliovirus will decline to zero within 1–2 SIA rounds, regardless of older child/adult vaccination status.</li>
                <li>Environmental positives occurring where no AFP-detected cases are found will be resolved by intensified under-five SIA rounds, not by adult/adolescent vaccination efforts.</li>
                <li>Sustained polio outbreaks among adults or adolescents in Pakistan will remain rare and almost uniformly linked to absence of susceptible child populations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multi-year, systematic stool surveys of adolescents and adults in environmental-positive, child case-negative areas will reveal at most rare, transient poliovirus shedding (<0.5% prevalence), suggesting limited silent reservoirs.</li>
                <li>Even with perfect immunization among older children and adults, if SIAs for under-fives are interrupted, transmission will persist or rapidly re-emerge; but interruption of child transmission will halt sustained polio even with low adult/adolescent population immunity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Discovery of persistent poliovirus excretion in >5% of healthy asymptomatic adolescents or adults in environmental-positive areas would refute the theory.</li>
                <li>A major outbreak of >20 adult paralytic cases in a district with no under-five cases in the previous year would challenge fundamental premises of the theory.</li>
                <li>Detection of direct, sustained community transmission chains (multiple generations) involving only older children, adolescents, or adults in Pakistan would falsify this theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Absence of large-scale, age-stratified population-based stool surveillance or serosurveys in older children/adults in Pakistan permits the possibility of rare undetected reservoirs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.3" class="evidence-link">[e59.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.0" class="evidence-link">[e38.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.1" class="evidence-link">[e38.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Exceptional immunodeficient long-term excretor cases and their transmission potential, as observed in high-income countries and single-case importations, are not systematically searched for. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
