                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Adults and older adolescents play a specific and under-recognized role in the long-distance geographic dissemination of poliovirus from Pakistan's endemic reservoirs through asymptomatic carriage during travel, migration, and trade activities. While local transmission and paralytic cases are concentrated in young children (<5 years) with limited mobility in specific high-risk areas (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan, Karachi), older age groups with greater geographic mobility can acquire subclinical infections in endemic areas and transport virus over long distances (>100 km, including internationally), seeding environmental detections and potentially initiating transmission chains in previously uninfected areas. This mechanism is particularly important for explaining: (1) environmental surveillance detections in areas distant from case clusters, (2) orphan virus detections indicating undetected transmission, (3) international importation events to polio-free regions, and (4) cross-border transmission between Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, this theory operates within the context that most sustained transmission occurs through local chains in high-risk areas among young children, and that in endemic settings older cohorts are frequently boosted by natural exposure, limiting the extent of their susceptibility to reinfection.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Age-Mobility-Asymptomaticity Transmission Triad for Long-Distance Spread</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> For long-distance poliovirus dissemination (>100 km from endemic foci), the combination of (1) high mobility/travel frequency (adults and older adolescents travel more frequently and over longer distances than young children), (2) high probability of asymptomatic infection when infected (>99% of infections in previously immune individuals do not result in paralysis, making infections invisible to AFP surveillance), and (3) sufficient intestinal replication and shedding duration (days to weeks in reinfected individuals, though shorter than primary infections) makes older adolescents and adults particularly efficient vectors for geographic spread to distant locations. This mechanism is distinct from local transmission, which is dominated by young children with primary infections who shed at higher titers and for longer durations but have limited geographic mobility.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies specifically to long-distance (>100 km) population movement from endemic poliovirus reservoirs in Pakistan (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan, Karachi) to other geographic locations, both domestic (inter-provincial, inter-district) and international. Most relevant for adults and older adolescents (age >15 years) with travel/migration patterns including trade, business travel, labor migration, and visiting friends/relatives (VFR) travel. The theory applies in contexts where: (a) surveillance relies primarily on AFP detection in children <15 years and environmental surveillance at fixed sites, (b) older individuals have prior immunity from OPV vaccination or natural exposure (endemic settings), allowing reinfection with minimal or no symptoms, and (c) mucosal immunity has waned sufficiently to permit intestinal replication and shedding despite systemic immunity. Does NOT claim that adults are the primary drivers of overall transmission (which is dominated by young children in local settings), but rather that they play a disproportionate role specifically in long-distance dissemination.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very young children (<2 years) typically have more limited independent mobility and are less likely to travel long distances alone, though they shed virus at higher quantities and for longer durations when infected with primary infections.</li>
                <li>The shedding duration in reinfected immune adults is typically shorter (days to a few weeks) than in first-infection naïve individuals (weeks to months), which may limit the temporal window for transmission but is still sufficient for long-distance transport during travel.</li>
                <li>Adults with recent OPV vaccination may have better mucosal immunity temporarily, reducing reinfection susceptibility; adults with only IPV vaccination history have systemic immunity (preventing paralysis) but limited mucosal immunity, making them susceptible to intestinal infection and shedding.</li>
                <li>In endemic settings with ongoing circulation, older children and adults receive natural boosting from repeated environmental exposure, which may reduce their susceptibility to reinfection compared to settings with interrupted transmission; however, mobility patterns mean travelers from non-endemic areas may still be susceptible when visiting endemic zones.</li>
                <li>Family travel involving young children can also contribute to long-distance spread; the adult-mediated mechanism is most distinctive when independent adult travel (without young children) results in virus transport.</li>
                <li>Cross-border movement between Pakistan and Afghanistan involves mixed-age populations including families with children; the relative contribution of adults versus children to cross-border transmission is not clearly quantified but adult mobility for trade/work is specifically implicated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>A 22-year-old adult acquired poliovirus infection in Pakistan and imported it to Australia (2007), developing paralytic disease; paper emphasizes that for every adult with disease there are many more infected asymptomatically due to low case:infection ratio (<1% of first infections lead to paralysis). <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Adult importation case from Pakistan illustrates that adults can acquire infection abroad and either develop disease or more commonly carry infection silently, potentially transmitting to others on return; international travel by adults identified as risk factor for introducing poliovirus to nonendemic areas. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> </li>
    <li>2021 WPV1 importation from Pakistan to Malawi was 'most probably carried by adults traveling for trade/business who had no signs of infection,' demonstrating asymptomatic adult-mediated international spread over >6,000 km. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper argues immune adults (and vaccinated older children) can be reinfected with WPV or cVDPV and become contagious, acting as links in transmission chains that sustain circulation and enable long-distance spread; transmission chains typically originate from infants/young children with first infection but then involve reinfected older children and adults who sustain and propagate silent transmission including long-distance spread. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper discusses that immigrants returning to visit friends and relatives have household and community contacts that place them at risk of acquiring and potentially importing infection; travelers (including adult immigrants visiting friends/relatives) can import virus into polio-free areas. <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Adult mobility/travel for trade/business identified as mechanism for long-distance movement of virus; importation by traveler commentary notes that persons vaccinated years or decades earlier can become transiently infected and excrete poliovirus for weeks (asymptomatic or subclinical infections and shedding possible). <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Cross-border movement of high-risk subpopulation between Pakistan and Afghanistan implicated in sustaining WPV1 transmission; narrow band of indigenous WPV1 transmission in security-challenged subdistricts of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and contiguous Afghanistan, with movement of high-risk population across border. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> </li>
    <li>WPV1 transmission continues primarily in Karachi and along cross-border corridors between Afghanistan and Pakistan (Nangahar–Pakistan and Kandahar–Pakistan corridors); cross-border movement of mobile populations is implicated in sustaining transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.0" class="evidence-link">[e19.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper emphasizes that >99% of first infections are asymptomatic for paralysis and that reinfections (including in adults) are commonly asymptomatic but contagious; adult asymptomatic carriage is implicated in importations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper references cVDPV2 lineages detected in sewage (London, Jerusalem, New York) in 2022 and interprets rapid geographic detection as consistent with adult traveler-mediated spread (though not Pakistan-specific environmental data). <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Waning mucosal immunity in older ages, close physical proximity between adults and young children in LMICs, and adult mobility/travel are highlighted as age-specific risk factors for transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Commentary states that persons vaccinated years or decades earlier can become transiently infected and excrete poliovirus for weeks; secretory immunity declines over years so persons vaccinated long ago (typically older adolescents/adults) can be transiently infected and excrete virus. <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While adult importation cases are documented and the components (travel, asymptomaticity, shedding) are individually recognized, the systematic synthesis into a theory explaining Pakistan's long-distance geographic spread patterns, with explicit distinction from local transmission dominated by children, represents a novel framework not explicitly developed in Pakistan-specific literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Adult travel as a risk factor for poliovirus importation is recognized in polio literature, the high rate of asymptomatic infection is well-established, and waning mucosal immunity in older ages is documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of a 'transmission triad' specifically linking adult age-associated high mobility, high asymptomaticity, and adequate shedding as a synergistic mechanism for long-distance (>100 km) dissemination from Pakistan's endemic reservoirs, with the argument that this mechanism is systematically under-recognized because adults fall outside AFP surveillance (<15 years) and that this creates a distinct epidemiological pattern for long-distance vs. local transmission.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Inverse Distance-Age Gradient in Transmission Detection</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The probability that a poliovirus transmission chain is detected by surveillance decreases with both (1) the geographic distance over which virus is transported from endemic foci, and (2) the average age of transmission chain intermediaries. Long-distance transmission chains (>100 km) involving adult or older adolescent intermediaries have the lowest detection probability because: (a) adults rarely develop paralysis (making them invisible to AFP surveillance which focuses on <15 years), (b) environmental surveillance site density may be insufficient to capture transient virus introduction during travel (sites are fixed while travelers are mobile), and (c) reinfected individuals shed for shorter durations and possibly at lower titers than primary infections. Consequently, surveillance data systematically underrepresent the role of adults in long-distance transmission while accurately capturing local transmission among young children.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to interpretation of poliovirus transmission chains and surveillance data in Pakistan and other endemic settings where surveillance relies primarily on: (1) AFP surveillance for paralytic case detection in children <15 years, and (2) environmental surveillance at fixed sampling sites (typically 68-114 sites nationally in Pakistan). Relevant for understanding the relationship between observed paralytic cases, environmental detections, and underlying transmission networks, particularly for explaining discordances such as environmental positives without nearby cases, orphan viruses indicating undetected transmission chains, and genetic linkages between geographically distant isolates. Most applicable to transmission events covering distances >100 km between high-transmission endemic foci (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan) and other areas (other provinces, cross-border, international).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very short-distance transmission (<10 km, within neighborhoods or districts) involving adults may be detected if it results in paralytic cases in co-resident or nearby young children, even if the adult intermediary is not directly detected by AFP surveillance.</li>
                <li>Areas with very dense environmental surveillance networks (multiple sites per district) may capture long-distance adult-mediated introductions even without paralytic cases, though current network density in Pakistan (68-114 sites nationally) may be insufficient for comprehensive detection.</li>
                <li>Targeted investigations following importation events (case-response activities, contact tracing, special surveys) may retrospectively identify adult links that would not be detected through routine surveillance.</li>
                <li>Household transmission from adults to children may be detected when the child case is identified, even though the adult source remains undetected.</li>
                <li>In areas with very high incidence among young children, environmental detections may primarily reflect local transmission rather than adult-mediated importations, making the age composition of transmission chains ambiguous.</li>
                <li>Detection of a paralytic case in an older child or adolescent (e.g., the 16-year-old case reported at 197 months) demonstrates that AFP surveillance does occasionally capture older-age cases, but this is rare and the surveillance system is not optimized for >15 years.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Environmental detection of orphan viruses (e.g., Karachi isolate belonging to YB3A cluster differing by 5.3% in VP1 from its closest relative) indicates long-term undetected transmission chains that were never captured by AFP surveillance, suggesting geographic spread and circulation occurred without detected intermediary cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance identified WPV1 circulation in Karachi and other areas without recent paralytic cases; sequence divergence in Karachi indicates prolonged undetected transmission; ES reveals gaps in AFP surveillance and suggests wider geographic spread than paralytic case data alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detected WPV1 in multiple provinces including areas without corresponding AFP cases; orphan isolates (≥1.5% divergent) in Bannu (April 2022) indicate undetected transmission and surveillance gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental isolates genetically linked to WPV1 cases in North Waziristan but orphan viruses indicate undetected transmission; environmental positives in areas without reported paralytic cases suggest immunity/surveillance gaps in the broader community. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Adult importation from Pakistan to Malawi (>6,000 km) by asymptomatic adult carriers who would not be detected by AFP surveillance demonstrates extreme long-distance transport without detection until arrival. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper argues that transmission chains typically originate from infants/young children with first infection (maximal shedding) and then involve reinfected vaccinated or previously infected individuals—older children and adults—who sustain and propagate silent transmission including long-distance spread. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Detection of genetically-linked environmental isolates showing both indigenous YB3C cluster and YB3A cluster (Afghanistan-associated) from geographically dispersed sites (Lahore/Punjab, multiple Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts, Karachi/Sindh) without corresponding paralytic case clusters in intermediate areas suggests undetected geographic spread. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance revealed wider geographic circulation than paralytic case detection; WPV1 detected in sewage from Lahore (Punjab), Dera Ismail Khan, Hangu, Peshawar, South Waziristan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), and Karachi (Sindh) in 2023, while paralytic cases were concentrated in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> </li>
    <li>2020: 52% (407/786) of sewage samples WPV1-positive; 2021: 8% (65/833); 2022: 2% (13/748) WPV1-positive; environmental detection demonstrates community poliovirus circulation and asymptomatic excretion but no age-specific shedding data provided. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Detection of orphan viruses and widespread environmental positives imply surveillance-identified immunity gaps in the population broadly; AFP surveillance limited to <15 years, leaving persons ≥15 years unmonitored by AFP case detection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental detection implies community-level circulation that could include older age groups, but no direct data quantify infection or transmission among older children, adolescents, or adults; AFP surveillance is limited to <15 years. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>AFP surveillance focuses on <15y; detection of a 16-year-old case (197 months, ~16 years) indicates that reliance on <15 surveillance might miss older adolescent/adult paralytic cases and potentially some transmission among older ages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> </li>
    <li>A reported case with age 197 months (~16 years) lies outside the standard AFP surveillance age group (<15 years), highlighting potential surveillance coverage limits for older adolescents. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While individual components (orphan viruses, surveillance gaps for adults) are recognized, the integrated gradient theory that explicitly predicts systematic underdetection of long-distance adult-mediated chains as a function of both distance and age, and uses this to explain specific surveillance patterns in Pakistan, is not explicitly developed as a unified framework in the literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Orphan viruses indicating undetected transmission and environmental detection without corresponding paralytic cases are recognized phenomena in polio surveillance. The lower detection probability for adult transmission is implicit in surveillance system design (AFP <15 years).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation of an 'inverse distance-age gradient' as a systematic, quantifiable bias in transmission chain detection, with the prediction that detection probability is jointly and multiplicatively determined by distance and age, represents a novel theoretical framework for interpreting Pakistan surveillance data and explaining specific patterns (orphan viruses, distant environmental positives).</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Environmental Detection-Case Discordance as Adult Transmission Signal</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Geographic areas showing persistent environmental surveillance positivity for poliovirus without corresponding paralytic AFP cases in recent months (within the same or previous surveillance period) are likely experiencing transmission chains involving a higher proportion of reinfected older children, adolescents, or adults compared to areas with concordant environmental and case detections. This is because: (1) older individuals with prior immunity rarely develop paralysis when reinfected, (2) they can maintain intestinal virus replication sufficient for environmental shedding, and (3) their mobility patterns allow virus introduction from distant endemic foci without establishing large local chains of primary infection in young children (which would produce paralytic cases).</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to interpretation of environmental surveillance (ES) data in Pakistan, particularly in areas with established ES sites (68-114 sites nationally) that are geographically distant (>100-200 km) from recognized endemic transmission foci (southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, parts of Balochistan). Most relevant for: (1) urban areas with high population mobility (Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad/Rawalpindi), (2) transit corridors (areas along major highways, border crossings), and (3) areas that have recently reported ES positives but no paralytic cases within 3-6 months. The theory applies when ES detections are confirmed as WPV1 or cVDPV (not vaccine virus from recent OPV campaigns) and when AFP surveillance quality indicators are adequate (NPAFP rate ≥2, stool adequacy ≥80%), ensuring that absence of cases is not simply due to poor surveillance.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very recent environmental detections (<2-4 weeks) may not yet have resulted in paralytic cases even if transmission is occurring primarily among young children, due to the incubation period and delay to AFP case identification.</li>
                <li>Areas with very recent SIA campaigns using OPV may show environmental positivity due to vaccine virus shedding rather than wild virus transmission.</li>
                <li>Low-density environmental surveillance (single site per large geographic area) may detect virus from any transmission pattern, not specifically adult-mediated; denser networks would provide stronger signal.</li>
                <li>Areas with very low routine immunization coverage (<50%) may have high susceptibility among young children, in which case environmental detection without cases may reflect early introduction before chain amplification rather than adult-dominant transmission.</li>
                <li>Genetic sequencing showing close relationship (<0.5% divergence) between environmental isolates and recent local cases suggests ongoing local transmission rather than new adult-mediated introduction.</li>
                <li>High-incidence endemic areas may show both environmental positives and cases, reflecting mixed transmission patterns including both local chains among children and geographic spread involving adults.</li>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If stool sampling were conducted among adult traders, truck drivers, and migrant workers departing from high-transmission districts (North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan) to other Pakistani provinces or internationally, the rate of poliovirus detection would be significantly higher (5-20% prevalence during high transmission season) than in non-mobile adults from the same districts (<1-2%), confirming that mobile adults carry virus out of endemic areas.</li>
                <li>If contact tracing were conducted backward from environmental surveillance positive sites in areas without recent cases (e.g., Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad), investigations would identify recent visitors or migrants from endemic areas (particularly southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) significantly more frequently than would be expected by chance (expected ~5-10% of population are recent visitors from KP, but >30% of ES-positive site contacts would be recent KP visitors).</li>
                <li>If phylogenetic analysis of poliovirus isolates from environmental surveillance were systematically compared between high-transmission endemic districts (North Waziristan) and distant low-transmission districts (Lahore, Islamabad), viral lineages in distant sites would show clustering patterns consistent with founder effects (limited genetic diversity, small number of closely related sequences) rather than extensive local diversity, indicating recent introduction events rather than sustained local transmission.</li>
                <li>If mobile populations (truck drivers, traders, seasonal workers) traveling regularly between endemic and non-endemic areas were targeted for repeated OPV vaccination (every 3-6 months) and surveillance, followed by monitoring of environmental surveillance in destination areas, this would lead to measurable reductions (30-50% decrease) in environmental detections in previously virus-positive distant sites within 6-12 months.</li>
                <li>If GPS tracking and environmental sampling were combined in high-mobility populations (with consent), clusters of environmental positivity would show spatial-temporal patterns consistent with travel routes and schedules of mobile populations rather than random geographic distribution.</li>
                <li>If intensive surveillance (every 2-4 weeks) were conducted in areas showing ES-positive but case-negative patterns, household surveys would identify higher seroconversion rates among older children (5-15 years) and adults compared to young children (<5 years), relative to what is seen in areas with concordant ES-positive and case-positive patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If all adults aged 18-45 years living in or traveling from core endemic districts (North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan, parts of Quetta) were required to receive bivalent OPV before inter-provincial or international travel (enforced through travel permits/checkpoints), WPV1 environmental detections in non-endemic provinces (Punjab, Sindh excluding Karachi, Islamabad) would decrease by ≥50% within 6-9 months, demonstrating that adult travelers are a primary mechanism for geographic spread. If detections do not decrease substantially (<20% reduction), it would suggest other mechanisms (possibly contaminated goods, water, young child travel with families, or local transmission) dominate, or that the adult vaccination is insufficient to prevent shedding.</li>
                <li>If intensive weekly stool surveillance were conducted on adult male traders and truck drivers operating between Pakistan and Afghanistan border crossings for 12 consecutive months, ≥20% would have at least one episode of poliovirus shedding detected, demonstrating this population serves as a major cross-border transmission bridge. If rates are <5%, this population's role may be overstated or the sampling frequency/methods are insufficient, or border-crossing populations are better vaccinated than assumed.</li>
                <li>If retrospective investigations of all documented WPV1 importations to polio-free countries from Pakistan (past 10 years) were systematically conducted with traveler screening, contact tracing, and genetic analysis, ≥70% of importation events would be traced to adult or older adolescent (>15 years) travelers rather than young children, confirming adults as primary international dissemination vectors. If <30% involve adults, young children traveling with families may be the dominant importation mechanism, or detection methods may be biased.</li>
                <li>If expanded-age vaccination campaigns targeting all individuals up to age 45 (in addition to children <5) were implemented in endemic districts for 18-24 months with high coverage (>80%), international exportations from Pakistan would be reduced to near-zero (0-2 detections per year outside Pakistan/Afghanistan, compared to historical rates), demonstrating adult vaccination is necessary for preventing exportation. If exportations continue at >50% of historical rates, this would suggest: (a) coverage was insufficient, (b) immunity wanes too quickly, (c) older age groups (>45) are important, or (d) other mechanisms (contaminated goods, child travel) are substantial contributors.</li>
                <li>If the density of environmental surveillance sites in Pakistan were quadrupled specifically in high-mobility areas (major urban centers, transportation hubs, border crossings) and samples were genomically sequenced, orphan virus detection rates would increase by ≥3-fold, revealing extensive undetected transmission and confirming that current surveillance misses most long-distance transmission events. If orphan rates increase by <1.5-fold, current surveillance may be capturing most transmission or new sites are not optimally placed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If intensive stool surveillance of adult travelers from high-transmission endemic areas shows poliovirus detection rates <0.5% (lower than or comparable to age-matched non-travelers and substantially lower than young children in the same areas), this would challenge the hypothesis that adults are important vectors for geographic spread and suggest adults rarely acquire or maintain sufficient infection for shedding.</li>
                <li>If phylogeographic reconstruction of poliovirus transmission using genetic sequences from environmental surveillance and cases consistently shows that long-distance spread events (>100 km) are predominantly associated with movement of young children with families (traced through family travel records, genetic clustering patterns indicating family-associated introductions) rather than independent adult travel, this would contradict the theory that independent adult mobility is the primary long-distance dissemination mechanism.</li>
                <li>If targeted vaccination campaigns of high-mobility adult populations (traders, truckers, migrant workers) traveling from endemic areas, conducted with high coverage (>75%) and followed for 12-18 months, show no measurable impact (change <10%) on environmental surveillance positivity rates or genetic diversity patterns in distant destination areas, this would suggest adults are not the primary mechanism for geographic spread.</li>
                <li>If case investigations and contact tracing of confirmed importation events to polio-free countries consistently trace virus introduction to young children traveling internationally with families rather than independent adult travelers (>70% of traced events involve child index cases), this would challenge the primacy of adult-mediated international dissemination and suggest family travel with young children is the dominant mechanism.</li>
                <li>If intensive household surveys and seroprevalence studies in areas showing environmental positivity without cases reveal similar age-specific infection patterns (high among young children, low among adults) as areas with concordant environmental and case detections, this would challenge the theory that ES-case discordance indicates adult-dominated transmission and suggest the discordance simply reflects AFP surveillance sensitivity issues.</li>
                <li>If modeling studies incorporating realistic adult mobility patterns, shedding durations, and reinfection probabilities show that adult-mediated transmission cannot explain observed patterns of environmental detections (geographic distribution, temporal patterns, genetic diversity) and that alternative mechanisms (child travel, contaminated fomites) are required, this would challenge the quantitative sufficiency of the adult transmission mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The vast majority of confirmed paralytic WPV1 cases in Pakistan during 2020-2023 occurred in very young children with median age 15-18 months, concentrated in just a few districts of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, suggesting that most sustained transmission occurs through local chains among young children in specific high-risk areas rather than through adult-mediated geographic spread. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> </li>
    <li>High proportion (81-87%) of paralytic WPV1 cases were zero-dose children who had never received OPV through routine immunization, and cases were concentrated in areas with known low routine immunization coverage, suggesting local immunity gaps in young children in specific areas drive most transmission rather than adult-mediated importations from other areas. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Genetic analysis showing that 20 of 21 cases in 2022 belonged to a single genetic cluster (YB3C) concentrated in three adjacent districts (North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan) suggests sustained, locally-focused transmission rather than repeated independent importations via adult travelers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Persistent poliovirus transmission in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is attributed to specific local factors: repeatedly missed children during SIAs (~50,000 regularly missed in seven high-risk districts), security issues preventing vaccinator access, intimidation of vaccinators, community boycotts, and fake finger-marking overestimating coverage—all affecting local young children rather than adult travel patterns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.1" class="evidence-link">[e20.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Modeling studies (Quantifying the Impact of Expanded Age Group Campaigns) found that in endemic settings (which include Pakistan) ongoing WPV circulation provides frequent boosting of immunity in older children and adults, concentrating transmission and paralytic cases in younger children (mean age ~2 years); older children and adults are therefore less likely to sustain transmission or show large immunity gaps in endemic areas. Expanded age group (EAG) campaigns targeting older children showed limited benefit in endemic settings because older cohorts are already boosted by natural circulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Most WPV1 environmental detections occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (8 of 13 in 2022), where most paralytic cases were also concentrated, suggesting that environmental detections largely reflect local transmission in endemic areas rather than adult-mediated long-distance spread to distant provinces. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper notes that in endemic countries (Pakistan included) the mean age of WPV infection is ~2 years and the majority of confirmed type-1 paralytic cases are in children under five years old; frequent boosting from ongoing WPV circulation in endemic settings means immunity gaps in older children tend not to persist. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Analysis of Afghanistan serosurvey suggests mass polio vaccination campaigns aim to protect children under age 5 as the central eradication strategy; programmatic focus on <5 may reflect evidence that this age group is most critical for transmission, though the paper notes this focus may bias surveillance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Pakistan-Afghanistan cross-border movement involves mixed populations including families with children, not exclusively adult independent travelers; the paper does not quantify the relative contribution of adults versus children to cross-border transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-15.html#e15.0" class="evidence-link">[e15.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.0" class="evidence-link">[e19.0]</a> </li>
