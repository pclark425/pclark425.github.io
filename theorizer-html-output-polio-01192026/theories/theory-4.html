                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> School-age children (approximately 5-14 years) in Pakistan may constitute an under-recognized transmission reservoir that bridges the gap between highly-vaccinated young children (<5 years, who receive many OPV doses through routine and campaign efforts) and partially-immune adults (who may have waning immunity but also benefit from any past natural exposure or childhood vaccination). This age group experiences a convergence of risk factors: (1) systematic exclusion from SIAs which target <5 years, (2) potential waning of immunity from early-childhood vaccination without natural boosting in areas transitioning to lower endemicity, (3) high contact rates both with young children (siblings, relatives) and with the broader community through school attendance, (4) high probability of asymptomatic infection making them invisible to AFP surveillance which focuses on <15 years but is most sensitive for detecting young children, and (5) sufficient intestinal viral replication to serve as transmission links despite lower shedding than primary infections in young children. School-age children may be particularly important in sustaining transmission in areas transitioning from high to low endemicity, in districts with suboptimal routine immunization coverage where their childhood vaccination was incomplete, and in areas where programmatic quality issues result in chronically missed children who age into this bracket without adequate immunity.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: School-Age Programmatic Immunity Trough</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Children aged 5-14 years in Pakistan districts with OPV3 routine immunization coverage below 80% (measured at 12-23 months) experience a programmatic immunity trough characterized by: (a) systematic exclusion from all routine SIAs which target children <5 years, (b) partial waning of mucosal immunity acquired through early-childhood OPV doses (which may have been incomplete due to low routine coverage), (c) reduced likelihood of natural immune boosting compared to younger children in the same households who have more intense fecal-oral exposures, and (d) absence of maternal antibody protection. This creates a local minimum in population-level mucosal immunity against poliovirus at ages 5-14 years, particularly for poliovirus type-2 following the 2016 switch from tOPV to bOPV which removed type-2 from routine vaccination. The immunity trough is most pronounced in areas where transmission intensity is declining (reducing natural boosting opportunities) but has not been eliminated.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Most applicable to Pakistan districts with OPV3 routine coverage <80% measured at 12-23 months age (which includes all districts in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh as of 2021, and approximately 5 of 36 districts in Punjab) during the period 2016-2023. Specifically relevant for mucosal (secretory) immunity which wanes over 3-5 years, faster than systemic immunity. Most applicable in areas transitioning from moderate to low poliovirus transmission intensity, where natural boosting is declining but SIAs remain focused exclusively on <5 year-olds. Less applicable in persistently hyperendemic areas (e.g., core WPV1 reservoir districts in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 2020-2022) where very high circulation provides frequent natural boosting across all age groups, and in very high routine coverage areas (e.g., most of Punjab with >80% coverage) where initial childhood immunity is more complete.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In hyperendemic areas with sustained high WPV1 circulation (e.g., North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan during 2020-2022 when these districts accounted for all WPV1 cases), school-age children may receive sufficient natural boosting from ongoing community transmission to maintain immunity despite programmatic exclusion from SIAs.</li>
                <li>Districts or areas that have conducted expanded-age campaigns targeting beyond <5 years (such as the November 2021 measles-rubella campaign that reached 9 months to 15 years, though this delivered MR vaccine not OPV) or special school-based vaccination initiatives would not exhibit the same immunity trough, though the 2021 MR campaign specifically excluded OPV delivery to 5-15 year-olds.</li>
                <li>Children who received IPV in addition to OPV (IPV was introduced into Pakistan's routine schedule in 2015, with national coverage reaching 83-85% by 2020-2021 for one dose by 12 months) may have better maintained systemic immunity even as mucosal immunity wanes, providing protection against paralytic disease but potentially not preventing intestinal infection and shedding.</li>
                <li>For poliovirus type-2 specifically, the immunity trough may be more severe because children born after the April 2016 global switch from tOPV to bOPV have had no type-2 OPV exposure through routine vaccination, creating a growing cohort of type-2 susceptible school-age children (by 2023, this includes all children aged 5-7 years). Type-2 immunity gaps were partially addressed by mOPV2 and IPV campaigns in some areas but coverage was heterogeneous.</li>
                <li>Gender-specific patterns: in areas with substantially lower school enrollment for girls compared to boys (common in some rural and conservative areas of Pakistan, particularly Balochistan and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), the school-mediated amplification component would affect boys more than girls, though the programmatic immunity gap affects both genders equally.</li>
                <li>The transition from high to low endemic transmission creates a critical temporal window: as WPV1 circulation declines (as occurred 2020-2023 with cases dropping from 84 in 2020 to 1 in 2023), natural boosting of school-age children decreases, potentially widening the immunity trough just as eradication becomes feasible, creating a 'last mile' reservoir.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>All SIAs (National Immunization Days and Subnational Immunization Days) in Pakistan during 2020-2023 explicitly and exclusively targeted children aged <5 years, with typical nationwide targeting of approximately 40-44 million children per NID campaign, systematically excluding all school-age children (5-14 years) from bOPV vaccination. This represents a categorical programmatic exclusion from mass vaccination efforts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.1" class="evidence-link">[e20.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.1" class="evidence-link">[e30.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.1" class="evidence-link">[e19.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The November 2021 combined measles-rubella vaccination campaign reached 90 million persons aged 9 months to 15 years (demonstrating operational feasibility of reaching school-age children), but bOPV was administered only to children aged <5 years during this same campaign, explicitly leaving school-age children (5-15 years) without any OPV boosting even when they were reached for MR vaccine delivery. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.5" class="evidence-link">[e31.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Routine immunization coverage data are collected only for infants by 12 months and children aged 12-23 months; third-party surveys (2021 WHO/Gavi-sponsored) showed provincial-level OPV3 coverage ranging from 45.1% in Balochistan to 94.9% in Punjab among children 12-23 months, with no districts in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh achieving ≥80% OPV3 coverage. This means cohorts of school-age children (who were 12-23 months old in years prior) entered school years with incomplete primary vaccination series in these provinces. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.2" class="evidence-link">[e20.2]</a> </li>
    <li>National OPV3 and IPV1 coverage by 12 months estimated at 83% (2020-2021), indicating that approximately 17% of each birth cohort nationally did not complete the primary series, creating a baseline immunity gap that persists as these cohorts age into school years without subsequent SIA boosting since SIAs target only <5 years. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.2" class="evidence-link">[e20.2]</a> </li>
    <li>District-level heterogeneity in routine coverage: specific high-risk districts showed very low OPV3 coverage (e.g., Killa Abdullah 20.7% OPV3, Pishin 33.2% OPV3 among sampled 12-23 month-olds in 2021 surveys), meaning school-age children from recent birth cohorts in these areas have severe baseline immunity deficits that are not addressed by current <5-year-focused SIAs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Programmatic statement that routine and supplementary immunization activities are focused on children <5 years, explicitly leaving transmission potential among older age groups through waning mucosal immunity, as mucosal immunity is known to decline over time while systemic immunity persists longer. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Mechanistic evidence: secretory (mucosal) immunity declines over years following vaccination while systemic immunity is longer-lasting, creating potential for older ages to become transmission links through intestinal infection and shedding despite maintaining protection from paralytic disease. This waning pattern means school-age children vaccinated in infancy may have insufficient mucosal immunity to prevent infection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Repeatedly missed children during SIAs: approximately 400,000-500,000 children (0.9-1.8% of ~40 million targeted) were repeatedly missed during NIDs in 2020-2022, concentrated in high-risk districts. These chronically missed children age into school years without ever receiving adequate OPV doses, creating a growing pool of under-immunized school-age children in specific geographic pockets. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.1" class="evidence-link">[e30.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.1" class="evidence-link">[e20.1]</a> </li>
    <li>For type-2 poliovirus specifically: serosurveys of children aged 6-11 months in 2016-2019 showed low type-2 seroprevalence among children born after the April 2016 tOPV-to-bOPV switch (approximately 25% type-2 seroprevalence among routine-only children in many areas before mOPV2/IPV campaigns, rising to >50% in 2019 post-campaigns but with substantial geographic heterogeneity, e.g., Pishin 28%, Sukkur 30%). Children from these cohorts are now aged 7-11 years (as of 2023) and represent a growing school-age population with limited type-2 immunity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detected WPV1 in areas and time periods without corresponding paralytic cases among young children, including 'orphan' viruses (≥1.5% VP1 divergence from known sequences) indicating long-term undetected transmission. A Karachi environmental isolate in 2023 showed 5.3% VP1 divergence from its closest relative, classified as orphan and indicating prolonged undetected local transmission. Such undetected transmission chains may involve older children or adolescents who do not develop paralysis but sustain transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>AFP surveillance focuses on persons aged <15 years but case detection is likely biased toward younger children due to higher clinical attack rates and better healthcare-seeking for young children; one confirmed WPV1 paralytic case occurred at age 197 months (~16 years), demonstrating that older adolescents can be infected and occasionally develop disease, suggesting circulation in older age ranges can occur and is detected when it causes paralysis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Importation events: a 22-year-old Australian traveler developed poliomyelitis after returning from Pakistan (2007), and a 2021 importation of WPV1 from Pakistan to Malawi was attributed to asymptomatic adult travelers, demonstrating that older individuals can acquire infection in Pakistan and remain infectious during travel, implying ongoing transmission involving older age groups. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-29.html#e29.0" class="evidence-link">[e29.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the component phenomena (waning immunity, age-focused SIAs) are well-documented, the integrated hypothesis that these create an epidemiologically significant school-age immunity trough in Pakistan's specific programmatic and epidemiologic context represents a novel theoretical framework requiring empirical validation through age-stratified serological surveys and transmission studies.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Waning of vaccine-induced mucosal immunity over time is well-established in poliovirus immunology literature. The age-targeting of GPEI SIAs to children <5 years is standard global practice and by definition creates a programmatic coverage gap in older ages.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific hypothesis that school-age children (5-14 years) in Pakistan represent a local immunity minimum or 'trough' positioned between highly-vaccinated younger children and partially naturally-immune adults, and that this trough may be epidemiologically important for sustaining poliovirus transmission particularly during the transition from moderate to low endemicity, has not been explicitly developed, modeled, or empirically tested in the Pakistan polio eradication literature.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: School-Mediated Contact Network Amplification</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> School attendance by children aged 5-14 years creates dense, age-assortative contact networks with sustained close contact (typically 5-6 hours per day, 5-6 days per week during school terms) that can efficiently amplify poliovirus transmission within this age group if immunity gaps exist. School-based contact networks provide: (a) high contact rates among age-peers, (b) bridging connections between different household clusters through students who share classrooms but live in different neighborhoods, and (c) daily return to households where school-age children have direct contact with younger siblings and other household members. If school-age children have immunity gaps (as hypothesized in the immunity trough statement), schools can serve as amplification nodes that generate secondary household transmission chains to susceptible young children. The amplification efficiency depends on school enrollment rates, class sizes, and the degree of age-mixing in schools versus households.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to districts in Pakistan with functional school systems and moderate-to-high primary and middle school enrollment rates during school term times (typically excluding summer holidays and religious holidays). Most relevant in urban and peri-urban areas where schools are larger (larger class sizes create denser contact networks) and enrollment rates are higher, particularly for primary schools (ages 5-10) which have higher enrollment than middle schools (ages 11-14). Less applicable in areas where security concerns, conflict, or socioeconomic factors result in very low school attendance rates (e.g., some rural areas of Balochistan and formerly FATA regions, areas with active conflict 2020-2022). School enrollment rates vary substantially by gender (lower for girls) and region, creating geographic and gender heterogeneity in the strength of school-based amplification. The mechanism operates only during school terms and is eliminated during school closures (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic closures in 2020-2021, summer and winter holidays, religious observances).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Gender-segregated schooling: Pakistan has separate schools for boys and girls in many areas, particularly beyond primary grades, which creates two partially independent transmission networks. Combined with lower enrollment rates for girls in conservative areas, school-based amplification may predominantly affect boys in some regions.</li>
                <li>Urban versus rural: urban areas (e.g., Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta) have larger schools with higher enrollment and larger class sizes, potentially creating more efficient amplification networks than small rural schools with lower enrollment and smaller class sizes.</li>
                <li>School closures: during extended school closures (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic closures in Pakistan during 2020-2021, extended holidays, conflict-related closures in some areas), this amplification mechanism is inactive and transmission would revert to household-based patterns. This could create temporal variation in the importance of school-age transmission.</li>
                <li>Socioeconomic stratification: private versus public schools may have different contact patterns and different student immunity profiles depending on underlying household vaccination practices and healthcare access.</li>
                <li>Age-mixing patterns: multi-grade classrooms in some rural schools create different contact patterns than age-segregated urban schools; household size and composition affect the number and age distribution of contacts school-age children bring poliovirus home to.</li>
                <li>Out-of-school children: children aged 5-14 who do not attend school (due to poverty, child labor, disability, gender discrimination, or other factors) would not participate in school-based amplification networks but might have different community contact patterns (e.g., work-related contacts for child laborers).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Qualitative discussion notes that LMIC settings have close child-adult contact patterns (infants carried to markets, close household proximity) that differ from high-income countries; school attendance represents an additional contact pattern layer specific to school-age children that has not been explicitly analyzed in Pakistan poliovirus studies but is plausibly important for transmission given high contact rates in school settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>No empirical age-stratified contact pattern data (social contact surveys, contact diaries, or contact matrices) are presented in any of the Pakistan poliovirus studies reviewed, leaving school-based contact networks and their relative importance for transmission empirically uncharacterized. This represents a major evidence gap for evaluating the school-age reservoir hypothesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.0" class="evidence-link">[e16.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-19.html#e19.0" class="evidence-link">[e19.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance detected WPV1 in sewage from urban areas including Lahore (Punjab), multiple districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Karachi (Sindh) during periods without corresponding paralytic AFP cases in young children in those specific locations. For example, Karachi had environmental WPV1 detection in 2023 with orphan virus (5.3% divergence) indicating prolonged undetected transmission, but had no recent paralytic cases. Such detections could reflect transmission chains involving school-age children who shed virus in community sewage but do not develop paralysis detectable by AFP surveillance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Detection of genetically 'orphan' polioviruses (≥1.5% VP1 nucleotide divergence from nearest known sequences, indicating >6 months of undetected circulation) in environmental surveillance from multiple locations including Bannu district (April 2022) and Karachi (2023 with 5.3% divergence) indicates prolonged transmission chains that were not detected by AFP surveillance. Such chains may involve older children and adolescents who have low rates of paralytic disease but can sustain transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.4" class="evidence-link">[e31.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.4" class="evidence-link">[e20.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.4" class="evidence-link">[e30.4]</a> </li>
    <li>One confirmed WPV1 paralytic case occurred at age 197 months (approximately 16 years), an outlier far above the median case age of 15 months. This demonstrates that older adolescents can be infected with WPV1 and occasionally develop paralytic disease, indicating that poliovirus circulation extends to older age ranges and that school-age children (5-14 years) are plausibly within the age range experiencing infection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.3" class="evidence-link">[e20.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Importation of WPV1 from Pakistan to Malawi (2021) was attributed to adults traveling for trade/business who had no signs of infection (asymptomatic carriage), demonstrating that mobility and contact networks of older individuals can facilitate long-distance poliovirus spread. Domestic mobility of school-age children between home and school represents a shorter-range but higher-frequency version of such bridging contacts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.0" class="evidence-link">[e7.0]</a> </li>
    <li>General statement from importation cases and modeling that reinfected immune individuals (including older children and adults) can become contagious and act as links in transmission chains, even though they rarely develop paralysis. School-age children with partial immunity from early childhood vaccination could serve as such reinfection links if exposed at school. <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.2" class="evidence-link">[e7.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Knowledge/attitudes surveys of adults showed that education level strongly correlates with awareness and willingness to vaccinate children, with substantial geographic variation (e.g., Khyber Pakhtunkhwa showing lower willingness 63.3% versus Sindh 91.3% and Punjab 83.3%), suggesting that community-level factors affecting vaccination also vary geographically and may differentially affect school-age immunity gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-27.html#e27.0" class="evidence-link">[e27.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While school-based amplification is a well-established epidemiological concept for other childhood infections, its application to poliovirus transmission in Pakistan represents a novel untested hypothesis that has not been studied empirically (no contact surveys, school-based surveillance, or transmission network reconstruction involving schools) and has not been incorporated into poliovirus transmission models for Pakistan.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> School-based contact networks as drivers of infectious disease transmission are well-established for respiratory pathogens (influenza, measles, pertussis) and have been studied using social contact surveys and transmission models.

                <li>If age-stratified seroprevalence surveys using poliovirus neutralization assays were conducted comparing type-1 and type-3 neutralizing antibody titers in children aged 4-5 years (who recently received SIA boosting as target <5 year group) versus children aged 8-10 years (who have not received SIA boosting for 3-5 years since aging out of <5 year target) in low routine coverage districts (OPV3 <70%, e.g., districts in Balochistan such as Pishin, Killa Abdullah, or parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), seroprevalence (proportion with protective titers ≥1:8) would be 15-25 percentage points lower in the 8-10 year age group compared to the 4-5 year age group, demonstrating the immunity trough.</li>
                <li>If environmental surveillance sampling were expanded to include schools (collecting sewage or wastewater samples from school toilet/sanitation facilities) in parallel with existing community environmental surveillance sites in the same geographic areas during school term times, school-based samples would show equal or higher WPV1 detection rates (percentage of samples positive) compared to community-based samples from the same period and area, with school positivity declining to community baseline levels during school holiday periods. This would demonstrate school-based concentration of transmission during term times.</li>
                <li>If systematic stool sampling were conducted among household contacts of index paralytic polio cases in young children (age <3 years), with sampling stratified by age of household contacts, school-age siblings (5-14 years) would show intermediate poliovirus shedding rates (e.g., 20-40% stool positive at time of index case detection) between young child siblings (likely 50-70% positive due to intense household exposure) and adult household members (likely 5-15% positive due to lower susceptibility and lower exposure), demonstrating that school-age children participate in household transmission chains.</li>
                <li>If lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) or other coverage surveys following SIAs were conducted stratified by age of children in households (comparing coverage among <5 year-olds, 5-9 year-olds, and 10-14 year-olds), the 5-14 year age groups would show near-zero SIA coverage (only incidental doses to children misclassified as <5 or from rare expanded-age campaigns), confirming systematic programmatic exclusion from immunization activities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a cluster-randomized trial were conducted comparing standard SIAs targeting children <5 years versus expanded-age SIAs targeting children <10 years or <15 years in matched pairs of districts with low routine coverage (OPV3 <70%) and recent WPV1 environmental detections, WPV1 environmental positivity rates would decline 30-50% faster (measured as time to sustained negative environmental surveillance) in expanded-age campaign districts compared to control districts over 12-18 months of follow-up. This would demonstrate that school-age children are critical transmission reservoirs. Alternative outcome: if environmental positivity declines equally in both arms, school-age immunity gaps are not epidemiologically important, potentially because natural boosting maintains immunity or because transmission is concentrated in younger children.</li>
                <li>If social contact surveys measuring daily close contacts (face-to-face conversation distance for ≥15 minutes) were conducted in Pakistan using methods similar to POLYMOD studies, stratified by age groups (0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50+ years), school-age children (5-14 years) would show 2-4 times higher total daily contact rates compared to young children (0-4 years) and 1.5-2 times higher contact rates than adults (20+ years), with particularly high age-assortative mixing (contact rates with same age-group) during school terms. The exact magnitude of contact rate differences and the degree of age-assortativity in Pakistan settings are highly uncertain without empirical data and could vary substantially from high-income country contact patterns.</li>
                <li>If whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were combined with detailed household and community epidemiological investigation (including systematic stool sampling of all age groups) following WPV1 environmental detections in urban areas without recent paralytic cases, transmission network reconstruction would identify school-age children (5-14 years) as intermediate transmission links in ≥30% of reconstructed transmission chains connecting environmental detections to ultimate sources. The actual percentage is highly uncertain and depends on transmission network structure, contact patterns, and relative infectiousness/susceptibility by age group.</li>
                <li>If targeted serological surveys were conducted among school-age children (5-14 years, stratified into 5-9 and 10-14 year sub-groups) in areas with recent environmental WPV1 detections (within 3 months) but no paralytic AFP cases, ≥10% of surveyed school-age children would show serological evidence of recent infection (defined as 4-fold rise in neutralizing antibody titers between paired sera 4-6 weeks apart, or IgM positivity, or very high IgG titers consistent with recent exposure), demonstrating silent circulation in this age group. Actual rates are unknown and could range from <1% to >30% depending on transmission intensity and population immunity.</li>
                <li>If school-based surveillance were implemented by conducting systematic monthly stool sampling of sentinel students (e.g., 20-30 students per school, age-stratified) in 50-100 schools in high-risk districts, compared with existing community environmental surveillance, school-based surveillance would detect WPV1 circulation an average of 2-6 weeks earlier than community environmental surveillance in ≥40% of transmission events, demonstrating that schools are leading indicators of transmission. Alternative outcome: if school-based surveillance shows no advantage over community surveillance, either school-age children are not important amplifiers or environmental surveillance already captures school-related transmission adequately.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If age-stratified seroprevalence surveys show that school-age children (5-14 years) in low routine coverage districts (OPV3 <70%) have equal or higher poliovirus neutralizing antibody seroprevalence (proportion with protective titers ≥1:8) compared to young children (ages 2-4 years) who are actively targeted by recent SIAs, this would contradict the immunity trough hypothesis and suggest that alternative mechanisms (such as natural boosting from ongoing transmission, higher quality of early childhood vaccination than administrative data suggest, or protective immunity persisting longer than hypothesized) maintain immunity in school-age children despite programmatic exclusion.</li>
                <li>If detailed contact tracing, household investigations, and molecular epidemiology (whole genome sequencing and transmission network reconstruction) following paralytic cases in young children consistently show that school-age siblings or school-age household contacts are rarely identified as transmission links (<5% of reconstructed transmission chains involve school-age intermediaries between community circulation and the paralytic case), this would challenge the hypothesis that school-age children serve as important transmission bridges to young children.</li>
                <li>If school-based environmental surveillance (sampling sewage from school sanitation facilities) during outbreak investigations consistently shows negative WPV1 results while concurrent community environmental surveillance from the same geographic area shows positive results, this would suggest that school-age children are not major shedders of poliovirus and that transmission is concentrated outside of school settings (e.g., in households, markets, or other community venues).</li>
                <li>If a cluster-randomized trial of expanded-age SIAs targeting children <10 or <15 years versus standard <5 year SIAs shows no significant difference in WPV1 environmental detection rates, paralytic case incidence, or time to interruption of transmission between intervention and control districts after 18-24 months of follow-up, this would demonstrate that school-age immunity gaps (if they exist) are not epidemiologically significant for sustaining transmission, potentially because coverage in this age group has minimal impact on transmission dynamics.</li>
                <li>If social contact surveys in Pakistan show that school-age children (5-14 years) have lower total daily contact rates and lower contact rates with young children (<5 years) compared to adults (e.g., mothers aged 20-40), this would challenge the hypothesis that school-age children are important bridging contacts to young children and suggest adults may be more important transmission links.</li>
                <li>If systematic stool sampling of school-age children during periods of known WPV1 environmental detection (confirmed by concurrent environmental positives) shows very low prevalence of poliovirus shedding (<1% of school-age children positive) despite serological evidence of infection (rising titers), this would suggest that school-age children have low-level or short-duration shedding that may not be sufficient to sustain transmission chains efficiently.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Modeling studies explicitly calibrated to endemic settings (including Pakistan indirectly through use of Zaria, Nigeria seroprevalence data as a proxy for endemic contexts) conclude that expanded-age group campaigns targeting older children (5-14 years) offer minimal benefit for polio eradication because ongoing wild poliovirus circulation in endemic areas provides frequent natural immune boosting to older cohorts, maintaining their immunity at high levels despite programmatic exclusion from SIAs. The model found that expanding SIAs to 5-14 year-olds increased elimination probability by only ~8-18% compared to baseline, far less than targeted campaigns reaching chronically missed populations. This directly contradicts the immunity trough hypothesis unless natural boosting is declining rapidly as transmission intensity drops. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Endemic country classification analysis (which includes Pakistan) reports that mean age of WPV1 infection in endemic settings is approximately 2 years and the vast majority of confirmed type-1 paralytic cases occur in children under five years old, with very few cases in older children. This concentration of cases in very young children suggests that the primary transmission reservoir may be within the under-5 age group itself rather than requiring school-age amplification to sustain transmission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>WPV1 case series from Pakistan consistently show extremely young median ages (15-18 months across multiple reporting periods 2020-2023) and age ranges predominantly <3 years (e.g., 7-28 months in 2021-2022, 3 months to 197 months with median 15 months in 2022-2023), with the single case at 197 months (~16 years) being a dramatic outlier. Additionally, 81-87% of cases had zero OPV doses through routine immunization. This pattern suggests that the primary drivers of ongoing transmission and paralytic disease are unvaccinated or severely under-vaccinated young children rather than partially-immune school-age children. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> </li>
    <li>School attendance rates, particularly for girls and in rural areas of high-risk provinces (Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, formerly FATA), may be substantially lower than national averages, potentially limiting the size and density of school-based contact networks in precisely the areas with highest poliovirus transmission risk. If school enrollment is low in high-risk areas, school-based amplification may not be an important mechanism in those settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-26.html#e26.0" class="evidence-link">[e26.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-27.html#e27.0" class="evidence-link">[e27.0]</a> </li>
    <li>COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extended school closures in Pakistan during 2020-2021, which would have eliminated school-based transmission mechanisms during this period. However, WPV1 transmission persisted during this time (84 cases in 2020, 1 case in 2021) concentrated in North Waziristan and surrounding areas, suggesting that school-based amplification is not necessary for transmission persistence, at least in hyperendemic core reservoir areas. <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.0" class="evidence-link">[e30.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.1" class="evidence-link">[e30.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.3" class="evidence-link">[e30.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Type-2 serosurveys of children aged 6-11 months (2016-2019) showed that type-2 immunity responded strongly to mOPV2 and IPV supplementary immunization activities even in young children, with substantial increases in seroprevalence following campaigns. If type-2 campaigns targeting young children were sufficient to control cVDPV2 transmission (135 cases in 2020 declining to 8 in 2021 following type-2 campaigns), this suggests that targeting young children alone may be adequate for interrupting transmission without requiring school-age vaccination. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.3" class="evidence-link">[e30.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Geographic concentration of WPV1 transmission in specific districts (particularly North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan accounting for all or nearly all cases during 2020-2022) and strong genetic clustering of cases suggests that transmission is driven by very localized factors (security-related access issues, chronically missed children, community refusals) rather than broader population-level immunity gaps such as school-age susceptibility. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-30.html#e30.2" class="evidence-link">[e30.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-16.html#e16.0" class="evidence-link">[e16.0]</a> </li>
