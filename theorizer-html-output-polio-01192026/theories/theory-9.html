                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In the context of global poliovirus control, adults in Pakistan who receive OPV—even if asymptomatic—can act as transient importers of vaccine-derived poliovirus through international travel, particularly when moving soon after vaccination or being exposed in high-transmission environments. These adults may expose immunologically vulnerable contacts abroad (notably, immunodeficient adults or unvaccinated children), forming a 'mobility bridge' for VDPV export. However, evidence from Pakistan indicates that sustained adult-driven VDPV transmission within the Pakistani population is exceptionally rare or absent, and such events only result in onward chains if the recipient population is also susceptible.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Adult Short-Chain Transmission and Importation Bridge</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Adults vaccinated with OPV in Pakistan, or adults exposed during high-transmission periods, can transiently excrete and transmit vaccine-derived poliovirus to close contacts (including adults or children) in contexts of international travel or household mixing; in recipient populations, sustained onward transmission is unlikely if local immunity is high, and within Pakistan, there is no evidence for persistent adult-driven transmission chains.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to scenarios involving adults (≥15 years) who have recently received OPV in Pakistan or traveled from OPV-using regions, with emphasis on post-vaccination or recent exposure periods in OPV-using settings; describes both export risk from Pakistan and importation events into non-endemic countries. Does not extend to routine transmission dynamics in children, nor to countries using only IPV.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Immunodeficient or immunologically naïve contacts (either adults or children) in the recipient population are at greatest risk for prolonged excretion or paralytic disease.</li>
                <li>Outbreak risk in recipient settings is primarily a function of local population immunity; adults act as infection bridges but do not generate sustained adult-to-adult transmission chains.</li>
                <li>Planned cessation of OPV in Pakistan may eventually eliminate this export risk pathway.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>A 26-year-old immunodeficient man in Barcelona excreted VDPV1 and VDPV3, likely acquired via household or visiting adult contacts who had received OPV in Pakistan; molecular clock analysis supports timing with import, but onward household/community transmission was absent despite wide exposure and high post-exposure vaccination coverage. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>All exposed household and community contacts (adults and a child) tested negative for VDPV in stools; post-exposure IPV vaccination campaigns were deployed to both adult and child contacts, highlighting perceived risk across ages, but actual spread was absent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Case investigations and environmental surveillance in the recipient country (Spain) showed no VDPV circulation in the wider community. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Review-level evidence notes all-age border and transit-point vaccination is used as a precaution for mobile high-risk populations, implying risk from adult importation, but confirming no documented onward outbreaks started from such adult bridges within Pakistan. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The DIK Communication Survey and other studies document that polio interventions, vaccination, and surveillance in Pakistan overwhelmingly target children under age 5 (SIAs) or under 15 (AFP surveillance), and provide no evidence of ongoing VDPV or WPV outbreaks driven by adults. <a href="../results/extraction-result-57.html#e57.0" class="evidence-link">[e57.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.4" class="evidence-link">[e59.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.1" class="evidence-link">[e56.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.2" class="evidence-link">[e59.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.0" class="evidence-link">[e45.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-47.html#e47.0" class="evidence-link">[e47.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-34.html#e34.0" class="evidence-link">[e34.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.0" class="evidence-link">[e38.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.0" class="evidence-link">[e41.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-33.html#e33.0" class="evidence-link">[e33.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.1" class="evidence-link">[e55.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.0" class="evidence-link">[e59.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.1" class="evidence-link">[e59.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.3" class="evidence-link">[e59.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.4" class="evidence-link">[e59.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Sustained adult-to-adult or adult-to-child transmission chains of VDPV or WPV have not been documented in Pakistani surveillance or epidemiological data, with adult involvement in transmission chains inferred only circumstantially or through rare importation events. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.1" class="evidence-link">[e56.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.2" class="evidence-link">[e59.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.0" class="evidence-link">[e45.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-47.html#e47.0" class="evidence-link">[e47.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-34.html#e34.0" class="evidence-link">[e34.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-33.html#e33.0" class="evidence-link">[e33.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Environmental surveillance in Pakistan detects virus circulation (including VDPV), but provides no age-resolved identification of shedding, and targeted investigations, including broad negative sampling, have not found evidence for persistent adult reservoirs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.3" class="evidence-link">[e59.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.4" class="evidence-link">[e56.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.1" class="evidence-link">[e58.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.0" class="evidence-link">[e58.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.1" class="evidence-link">[e55.1]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes and elevates limited direct case evidence with programmatic and surveillance data from Pakistan, providing a model for risk prediction that is more mechanism-resolved and context-specific than broad travel-related importation warnings.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Global VDPV importation through travel is documented, with most guidelines focused on child travelers/exporters. The risk of adult contacts as importers/exporters has been acknowledged in GPEI and some case reports, usually in context of family units.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the mechanistic risk pathway of adult OPV vaccinees as transient VDPV bridges, highlights specific Pakistan-outbound OPV exposure as a source, integrates the null evidence for endogenous adult-driven chains in Pakistan, and distinguishes the context of immunodeficient hosts in recipient countries.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Enhanced post-travel or post-migration screening of adult OPV vaccinees from Pakistan will occasionally identify short-term asymptomatic excretors, especially if exposure occurred close to departure, but secondary transmission chains will be rare or absent where recipient population vaccination coverage is high.</li>
                <li>Widespread environmental surveillance in high-poliodensity global cities receiving migrants from Pakistan will continue to detect sporadic VDPV introductions, but will rarely show evidence of sustained undetected transmission when campaigns and coverage are maintained.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Active surveillance among immunodeficient persons in populations with high levels of recent migration from Pakistan may uncover clusters of VDPV excretors linked to adult-mediated importations, especially if environmental surveillance lags behind.</li>
                <li>If there is a substantial decline in recipient population IPV coverage, then adult OPV-vaccinated migrants from Pakistan could sporadically initiate more substantial outbreaks—testing the resilience of the mobility bridge.</li>
                <li>Should a large-scale event (e.g., mass haj returnees with recent OPV exposure) occur, this model predicts possible isolated VDPV detections but not large outbreaks absent susceptible clusters.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If systematic screening of recently OPV-vaccinated adults from Pakistan consistently fails to detect any VDPV excretion, despite careful timing and sufficiently sensitive methods, the presumption of appreciable adult excretion risk would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If recipient countries with high IPV/OPV coverage begin experiencing household or community VDPV outbreaks directly traceable to adult Pakistani travelers despite high immunity, this theory's assertion of limited adult-driven spread would require revision.</li>
                <li>If robust evidence emerges (e.g., through environmental sequencing) that prolonged, undetected adult-to-adult transmission chains of VDPV or WPV are circulating within Pakistani populations, the theory would be contradicted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Quantitative risk estimates for adult-derived VDPV importations from Pakistan (e.g., proportion of adult OPV vaccinees who shed VDPV, duration, and infectiousness) are not currently available in the evidence base. </li>
    <li>No direct virological or serological studies in Pakistan have systematically sampled adults for prolonged or asymptomatic poliovirus shedding (VDPV or WPV), leaving a potential knowledge gap on subclinical reservoirs. </li>
