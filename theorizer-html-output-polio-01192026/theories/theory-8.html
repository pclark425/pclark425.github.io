                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the role of older age groups in poliovirus transmission in Pakistan, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> When poliovirus is imported into a population or region with historically low poliovirus exposure or waning immunity in older adolescents and adults (such as parts of southern Xinjiang), these older age groups can constitute a significant pool of susceptibles and transiently become important drivers of poliovirus transmission, leading to an atypically high adult burden of paralytic cases until expanded-age SIAs restore herd immunity. This phenomenon is conditional on the coincidence of importation and adult immunity gaps created by prolonged lack of natural boosting and low vaccine uptake in adults.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Elevated Susceptibility and Clinical Disease in Older Adolescents and Adults Following Importation into Immunity-Naïve Regions</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In regions with historical interruption of wild-type poliovirus circulation and low adult or older adolescent vaccination coverage, importation from a high-incidence country (e.g., Pakistan) results in expansion of both poliovirus infection and polio cases into older adolescents and adults, reflected as a large fraction of paralytic cases and low seroprevalence in these age groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to regions adjacent to high-incidence areas (such as portions of southern Xinjiang) that have not experienced poliovirus circulation in years (or decades), in which adult and older adolescent cohorts did not receive routine OPV/IPV or natural boosting post-childhood, and which subsequently experience WPV or VDPV importation. Not generalized to chronically endemic Pakistan districts with ongoing exposure.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Does not apply in chronically endemic settings or where SIAs/RI have provided broad coverage across all ages.</li>
                <li>The expansion of transmission and clinical disease to older age groups is highly transient, dissipating after multi-age SIA rounds.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>During the 2011 southern Xinjiang outbreak (WPV1 imported from Pakistan), 47.6% (10/21) of confirmed WPV1 cases and 60.9% (14/23) of clinically compatible (paralytic) cases occurred in adults aged 15–39 years, supported by serosurvey data showing low P1/P2/P3 seroprevalence in that age group. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The lowest seroprevalence after infants was in adults aged 15–39 years; P1/P2/P3 seropositivity was less than 60% in adults 15–39 years (Xinjiang serosurvey). <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Geometric mean titers for all serotypes were lower in the 15–39 group than in school-aged children, implying waned or absent immunity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Expanded SIAs, after confirmation of a large susceptible adult cohort, targeted individuals <40 years (multi-stage: <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Adult importation-associated cases were not observed in persistently endemic districts of Pakistan, suggesting context specificity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.0" class="evidence-link">[e59.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.0" class="evidence-link">[e42.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Adult polio outbreaks post-import are recognized but infrequently modeled; this theory consolidates their predictability and control in a mechanistically explicit form, using the Xinjiang event and extended SIA targeting as a paradigm.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Adult outbreaks following importation have been described in limited literature, notably in the Xinjiang event, but rarely formalized as a predictable mechanism or linked specifically to Pakistan as a source.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This formalization posits a mechanistic, testable law tying importation from Pakistan to surges in adult clinical burden conditional on measured immunity gaps, abstracted as a predictive framework for border/proximal districts with known adult susceptibility.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Future importations of WPV or VDPV into border districts or regions adjacent to Pakistan, where adult cohorts display serologic evidence of waned or absent immunity, will result in higher-than-typical proportions of paralytic cases among adults and older adolescents until multi-age SIAs are conducted.</li>
                <li>Expanded-age SIAs following such importations will rapidly curb transmission, after which polio cases will again become concentrated in young children.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Environmental surveillance in newly affected importation regions may detect persistent poliovirus shedding prior to expanded-age SIAs, reflecting contributions from older age groups who are asymptomatic shedders.</li>
                <li>In settings where partial adult immunity (through limited boosting, e.g., previous child contacts or incomplete coverage) exists, the age-distribution shift and size of adult polio outbreaks may be more muted or absent, modifying/counteracting the full effect.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If adult serosurveys show high (≥90%) immunity in regions with historic absence of SIAs yet no natural boosting and adult cases are still common after importation, the theory would need revision.</li>
                <li>If importation into a genuinely non-immune region with adult immunity gaps fails to produce outbreaks in older ages, or if expanded SIAs in such scenarios do not shift transmission back to children, core mechanisms would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>No direct evidence or systematic serosurveys from within Pakistani districts have mapped how adult population immunity or adult polio case risk changes over time after SIAs or repeated importations. </li>
    <li>Lack of direct documentation of age-specific transmission chains and environmental viral sequence attribution to older age groups in importation-affected border districts. </li>
