                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Response-Anchored, Diminishing-Returns Theory of Anti-PD-1 Duration in Advanced Melanoma</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the optimal duration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for melanoma, and whether it differs by depth of response, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In unresectable stage III/IV cutaneous melanoma, the marginal benefit of continuing anti-PD-1 beyond about 12 months depends strongly on depth of response and residual disease activity. A consistent gradient of post-discontinuation relapse risk exists (CR < PR < SD). Many CRs and a biomarker-selected subset of PRs can stop at ~12 months and remain controlled off therapy. In contrast, PR/SD with residual metabolic activity benefit from longer exposure (toward ~24 months) or until functional remission is achieved. Prolongation beyond what is required for durable control primarily increases cumulative late irAEs and economic burden, yielding diminishing net clinical value.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a prospective cohort that stops at ~12 months only for CR or PR with PET CMR, 2-year off-therapy PFS will exceed 85% overall, with <15% requiring systemic therapy by 24 months.</li>
                <li>Among SD patients at 12 months who continue to 24 months, ~30–40% will convert to PET CMR by 24 months; those stopping at that point will achieve 2-year off-therapy PFS ~60–70%, exceeding historical ~40% when stopping without biomarker selection.</li>
                <li>Patients with brain metastases who stop at 12 months despite PET CMR will have roughly double the relapse hazard versus those without brain metastases, with a higher proportion of intracranial relapses.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Continuation beyond 24 months in PR patients with persistent PET non-CMR will yield <10% additional CMR conversions but increase late irAE incidence by ≥15% absolute; net OS impact uncertain.</li>
                <li>Incorporating ctDNA negativity at 6–9 months to accelerate stopping in CRs will maintain >80% 2-year off-therapy PFS, enabling safe reduction of exposure in selected patients.</li>
                <li>A biologically favorable SD subset (low baseline TMTV, early ctDNA clearance) will safely stop by 12 months with ≥70% 2-year PFS—if validated, this will broaden early-stop eligibility.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If DANTE shows that stopping all responders at 12 months (without biomarker gating) is inferior to continuation with HR for PFS ≥1.5 across CR and PR strata, the early-stop component of the theory would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If MELBASE-like prospective cohorts show no increase in late irAEs with ≥2 years exposure compared to ≤1 year after adjustment, the diminishing-returns toxicity premise would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If PR patients with PET non-CMR at 12 months who stop nonetheless achieve ≥80% 2-year PFS, the requirement for functional remission prior to early stopping would be invalidated.</li>
            </ol>
