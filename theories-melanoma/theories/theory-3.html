                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why giving neoadjuvant-adjuvant immunotherapy improves melanoma outcomes compared to adjuvant only immunotherapy, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Neoadjuvant immunotherapy enables real-time assessment of treatment efficacy through pathologic response evaluation at surgery, allowing for rational personalization of subsequent adjuvant therapy and surgical extent based on individual response. This response-adaptive strategy permits safe de-escalation (reduced adjuvant therapy or less extensive surgery) in excellent responders while identifying non-responders who may benefit from treatment intensification, ultimately optimizing the benefit-to-toxicity ratio at the individual patient level in ways impossible with adjuvant-only approaches where no early response assessment is available.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Pathologic Response as Therapy Selector</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In patients achieving major pathologic response (≤10% viable tumor) to neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors, omission or substantial reduction of subsequent adjuvant therapy maintains excellent outcomes (>90% 2-year RFS) while reducing cumulative toxicity, whereas patients with poor pathologic response (<50% tumor regression) require adjuvant therapy intensification or alternative strategies to optimize outcomes.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to solid tumors treated with neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors where pathologic response can be reliably assessed at definitive surgery and has been validated as prognostic for recurrence-free survival, particularly resectable macroscopic stage III melanoma (stage IIIB-D) with standardized pathologic assessment using established criteria (e.g., INMC criteria defining pCR, near-pCR, pPR, pNR). Requires tumors where sufficient viable tissue remains after neoadjuvant therapy to permit meaningful pathologic assessment.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Optimal pathologic response thresholds for therapy de-escalation decisions may vary by tumor type and are best validated for cutaneous melanoma; mucosal melanoma may have different thresholds</li>
                <li>Some patients with poor pathologic response may still achieve good long-term outcomes due to systemic immune priming not reflected in index lesion pathology, suggesting pathologic response is not perfectly predictive</li>
                <li>Very extensive baseline disease (bulky or matted nodes, extensive extracapsular extension) may require adjuvant therapy even with good pathologic response due to higher baseline metastatic risk</li>
                <li>Patients with oligometastatic stage IV disease may not be appropriate for therapy de-escalation even with excellent pathologic response</li>
                <li>Requires standardized pathologic assessment methodology and potentially central pathology review to ensure reproducible response categorization</li>
                <li>Complete clinical responders who achieve radiographic complete response may not have tissue available for pathologic assessment, requiring alternative response metrics</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>PRADO extension study showed patients with major pathologic response (≤10% viable tumor in index node, n=60) who omitted therapeutic lymph node dissection achieved 93.3% 2-year RFS and 100% 2-year distant metastasis-free survival, demonstrating excellent outcomes with therapy de-escalation in responders. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>NADINA trial design used pathologic response to determine adjuvant therapy allocation - only partial/non-responders received subsequent adjuvant therapy while major responders did not receive additional adjuvant therapy, implementing response-driven de-escalation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>NADINA trial reported major pathological response (MPR) rate of 59% in the neoadjuvant group (MPR defined as ≤10% viable tumor in index node), with these responders eligible for adjuvant therapy omission. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>OpACIN-neo/PRADO used index-node pathologic response as a biomarker to guide whether therapeutic lymph node dissection was performed and whether adjuvant therapy was administered, demonstrating feasibility of dual de-escalation based on pathologic response. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>INMC pooled analysis of six neoadjuvant trials showed that pathologic complete response (pCR) was strongly associated with improved relapse-free survival - patients with pCR after immunotherapy had 100% relapse-free rate versus 72% for non-pCR patients (p < 0.001), validating pathologic response as a surrogate for clinical outcomes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.2" class="evidence-link">[e10.2]</a> </li>
    <li>INMC pooled analysis showed that among 51 patients who achieved pCR after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, zero recurrence events were observed at median follow-up of 10 months, supporting safety of therapy de-escalation in complete responders. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.2" class="evidence-link">[e6.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Neoadjuvant relatlimab + nivolumab study (n=30) showed 2-year RFS for patients with any pathologic response was 92% versus 55% for patients with no pathologic response (p=0.005), demonstrating strong correlation between pathologic response and survival outcomes that supports response-driven treatment decisions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.3" class="evidence-link">[e9.3]</a> </li>
    <li>INMC pooled analysis reported overall pCR rate ~41% (38% in immunotherapy-treated patients) and emphasized that achievement of pCR was strongly associated with improved RFS, providing population-level validation of pathologic response as a decision-making biomarker. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.2" class="evidence-link">[e10.2]</a> </li>
    <li>INMC pooled analysis (Menzies et al.) showed that pathologic complete/near-complete responses after neoadjuvant immunotherapy strongly associate with improved survival outcomes, supporting use of pathologic response to guide therapy decisions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.3" class="evidence-link">[e8.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Ho 2022 mucosal melanoma cohort showed that objective and pathologic responses after neoadjuvant therapy correlated with improved EFS and OS, with pathologic response providing actionable information for treatment planning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Ho 2022 cohort showed 3 patients with complete clinical response were able to omit surgery entirely after neoadjuvant therapy, representing the most extreme form of therapy de-escalation enabled by neoadjuvant response assessment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple pooled analyses and individual studies consistently showed strong correlation between pathologic response and survival, validating pathologic response as an appropriate decision-making biomarker across different neoadjuvant regimens and patient populations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.2" class="evidence-link">[e10.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.3" class="evidence-link">[e9.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.2" class="evidence-link">[e6.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.3" class="evidence-link">[e8.3]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While response-adapted therapy concepts exist in other disease contexts, the prospective demonstration that pathologic response to neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors can safely guide omission of both adjuvant therapy and extensive surgery with maintenance of excellent outcomes represents a novel application with immunotherapy-specific validation in multiple trials (PRADO, NADINA, neoadjuvant relatlimab+nivolumab study).</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Response-adapted therapy exists in hematologic malignancies (particularly Hodgkin lymphoma using interim PET scanning) and some solid tumor chemotherapy settings where response guides subsequent treatment intensity. Pathologic response has been used as a surrogate endpoint in neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials for decades.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific application to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy where pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment guides both adjuvant therapy AND surgical extent decisions simultaneously, with prospective validation showing excellent outcomes (>90% 2-year RFS) with de-escalation in a significant proportion of patients (~60% major responders in NADINA), is novel. The use of pathologic response as a real-time treatment selection biomarker for immunotherapy specifically, rather than just an endpoint, represents a paradigm shift.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Surgical De-escalation in Major Responders</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Patients achieving major pathologic response (≤10% viable tumor) in index lymph nodes after neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors can safely omit completion lymph node dissection without compromising regional or distant disease control, avoiding surgical morbidity in approximately 50-60% of patients who respond well to neoadjuvant therapy.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies specifically to patients with resectable macroscopic nodal melanoma (clinical stage IIIB-D) treated with neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors where index node pathologic response can be assessed via excisional biopsy or sentinel node procedure and has been shown to predict findings in the complete nodal basin. Requires baseline disease that is amenable to index node sampling, careful patient selection with discussion of residual risk, and ideally prospective trial participation or registry enrollment given relatively recent validation of this approach.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Requires careful patient selection and counseling about residual risk of occult nodal disease (estimated <10% based on PRADO data but longer follow-up needed)</li>
                <li>May not apply to patients with very extensive nodal burden at baseline (bulky nodes >4cm, matted adenopathy, extensive extracapsular extension) even if index node shows major response, as risk of residual disease in basin may be higher</li>
                <li>Requires reliable assessment of index node pathology using standardized criteria, ideally with experienced pathologist review</li>
                <li>Some anatomic sites (particularly head and neck nodes in critical locations near major vessels or nerves) may have different surgical de-escalation considerations due to proximity to critical structures</li>
                <li>Patients with palpable residual nodal disease despite major index node response may not be appropriate for surgical de-escalation</li>
                <li>Longer-term follow-up data (>5 years) are still maturing and may reveal late regional recurrences that could modify recommendations</li>

    <li>PRADO extension included n=60 patients with index-node MPR who were managed with surgical de-escalation (omission of therapeutic lymph node dissection), establishing feasibility in a meaningful patient cohort. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>OpACIN-neo/PRADO design specifically tested surgical de-escalation based on pathologic response as a strategy enabled by the neoadjuvant approach, with prospective protocol-defined criteria for omitting completion dissection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>

    <li>SWOG S1801 trial reported similar rates of resection between neoadjuvant and adjuvant arms, demonstrating that neoadjuvant therapy does not prevent surgery when needed and enables response assessment to guide surgical extent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Ho 2022 cohort reported that neoadjuvant therapy downstaged disease in some patients, potentially enabling less extensive surgery, and allowed complete surgery omission in 3 complete responders. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 2: Cumulative Toxicity Reduction Through Response-Adapted Therapy</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Response-driven therapy personalization enabled by neoadjuvant pathologic assessment reduces cumulative toxicity burden by limiting intensive combination therapy or prolonged adjuvant treatment to non-responders while de-escalating in responders, achieving population-level reduction in grade 3+ toxicity of 30-50% compared to uniform adjuvant treatment strategies without compromising overall population efficacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to checkpoint inhibitor regimens where upfront combination therapy or prolonged treatment duration has substantial cumulative toxicity (particularly combination ipilimumab+nivolumab with 40-90% grade 3/4 adverse event rates in standard dosing, and prolonged adjuvant therapy with cumulative immune-related adverse events) in resectable melanoma where response-adapted strategies can be implemented. Greatest benefit observed with high-toxicity combination regimens versus lower-toxicity single-agent approaches. Requires validated pathologic response thresholds and acceptance of individualized treatment intensity.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Toxicity benefit is greatest with high-toxicity regimens (particularly combination ipilimumab+nivolumab) versus lower-toxicity monotherapy where cumulative toxicity is already limited</li>
                <li>Requires accepting individualized residual risk in de-escalated patients, with careful patient selection and informed consent</li>
                <li>May not provide net benefit if non-responders cannot be effectively salvaged with intensified therapy after progression</li>
                <li>Dose-optimized neoadjuvant regimens (e.g., ipilimumab 1mg/kg + nivolumab 3mg/kg) reduce toxicity independent of response-driven de-escalation, and combining both strategies may provide additive benefit</li>
                <li>Long-term or permanent immune-related adverse events (particularly endocrinopathies) may not be reduced by early therapy cessation if they occur during neoadjuvant phase</li>
                <li>Surgical morbidity from neoadjuvant therapy (if increased) must be weighed against reduced systemic therapy toxicity in overall toxicity calculus</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>OpACIN-neo identified a dose-optimized regimen (ipilimumab 1mg/kg + nivolumab 3mg/kg x2 cycles neoadjuvant) with 20% grade 3/4 AE rate within first 12 weeks while maintaining 77% pathologic response rate (57% pCR), substantially lower toxicity than standard dosing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.1" class="evidence-link">[e6.1]</a> </li>
    <li>OpACIN-neo showed the flipped-dose ipilimumab 1mg/kg + nivolumab 3mg/kg regimen had lower rate of grade ≥3 immune-related adverse events (20%) compared with standard ipilimumab 3mg/kg + nivolumab 1mg/kg regimen (40%) while maintaining similar radiographic and pathologic response rates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>NADINA trial showed 29.7% grade ≥3 systemic therapy-related adverse events in the neoadjuvant ipilimumab+nivolumab arm versus 14.7% in the adjuvant-only nivolumab monotherapy arm, but response-driven adjuvant allocation in neoadjuvant arm (only non-responders receiving adjuvant therapy) could further reduce total population exposure and toxicity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>NADINA trial reported endocrinopathies were more frequent in the neoadjuvant combination group (30.7% vs 9.9% in adjuvant monotherapy), highlighting cumulative toxicity of intensive combination therapy that response-driven approaches might mitigate. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>OpACIN trial reported approximately 90% of patients in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant combination arms experienced grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events, highlighting the severe toxicity burden of full-course combination therapy and need for de-escalation strategies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> </li>
    <li>OpACIN trial at 4-year follow-up showed most grade 3/4 AEs had recovered to grade ≤1 except for endocrine toxicities requiring ongoing hormone replacement, indicating some toxicities are permanent regardless of therapy duration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PRADO design allowed omission of adjuvant therapy in major pathologic responders, reducing cumulative immunotherapy exposure and associated toxicity risk in approximately 60% of patients. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Ho 2022 mucosal melanoma cohort reported grade ≥3 toxicities in 39% (14/36) with neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors, with most grade ≥3 events (13/14) occurring in patients receiving combination ipilimumab+nivolumab, highlighting which patients most need de-escalation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SWOG S1801 trial reported similar rates of pembrolizumab-related versus surgery-related adverse events in both neoadjuvant and adjuvant arms, suggesting neoadjuvant approach does not add prohibitive toxicity while enabling response assessment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This represents a novel application of response-adapted therapy specifically to reduce checkpoint inhibitor cumulative toxicity while maintaining population-level efficacy, validated in prospective trials (OpACIN-neo, PRADO, NADINA) with specific quantified toxicity benefits and maintained efficacy signals. The concept extends beyond simple dose reduction to integrated response-driven multi-modal de-escalation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Dose optimization and toxicity reduction strategies are common goals in oncology drug development across all therapeutic classes. Response-adapted dosing exists in some contexts (e.g., rituximab maintenance in lymphoma based on response).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific integrated strategy of using neoadjuvant pathologic response to prospectively guide which patients receive reduced cumulative checkpoint inhibitor therapy (both in terms of adjuvant therapy omission and potentially reduced surgical morbidity), with quantified toxicity reductions (20-30% lower grade 3+ AE rates in optimized regimens) and maintained population-level efficacy in prospective trials, is novel. The dual de-escalation (therapy and surgery) based on pathologic response represents a novel toxicity reduction paradigm.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>A randomized trial comparing response-adapted neoadjuvant therapy (with adjuvant and surgical de-escalation in major pathologic responders) versus standard one-year adjuvant therapy will show non-inferior efficacy with 30-40% reduction in grade 3+ toxicity and 40-50% reduction in surgical morbidity in the neoadjuvant arm at 3-year follow-up.</li>
                <li>Patients with pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy who receive no adjuvant therapy will maintain 3-year RFS >85% and 5-year RFS >75% in prospective validation cohorts, confirming long-term safety of adjuvant therapy omission in this subgroup.</li>
                <li>Real-world implementation studies of response-adapted neoadjuvant strategies will show 50-65% of patients are eligible for some form of de-escalation (surgical or adjuvant therapy), with toxicity profiles and short-term outcomes (2-year RFS) similar to prospective trial data, validating generalizability.</li>
                <li>Cost-effectiveness analyses will favor response-adapted neoadjuvant strategies over standard adjuvant therapy when reduced surgical extent, reduced adjuvant therapy in responders, and reduced toxicity management costs are incorporated, despite higher upfront imaging and pathology costs, with estimated cost savings of $15,000-30,000 per patient in the responder subgroup.</li>
                <li>Quality of life assessments at 1-year and 2-year post-treatment will significantly favor response-adapted neoadjuvant strategies (effect size 0.3-0.5 SD) due to reduced surgical morbidity in responders (~60% of patients) and reduced cumulative immune-related adverse events, particularly in physical function and social function domains.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If pathologic response thresholds could be accurately predicted (>85% PPV, >80% NPV) from early on-treatment biopsies (week 3-4) or liquid biopsy markers (e.g., ctDNA clearance kinetics), therapy could be adapted in real-time even before definitive surgery, potentially allowing ultra-short neoadjuvant courses (4-6 weeks) in predicted responders or early switching in predicted non-responders - the accuracy and timing of such early prediction remain unknown.</li>
                <li>Machine learning models incorporating baseline tumor features (imaging radiomics, baseline immune infiltrate patterns, mutational signatures), early ctDNA changes (clearance kinetics, fragment size patterns), and interim imaging responses might predict final pathologic response with sufficient accuracy (>90%) to guide surgical decisions without requiring index node pathologic assessment first - the achievable accuracy and required training set size are unknown.</li>
                <li>Some patients classified as non-responders after standard 6-9 week neoadjuvant courses might show delayed responses if given more prolonged neoadjuvant therapy (e.g., 4-6 months instead of 2-3 months), potentially converting to pathologic responders and avoiding the need for therapy intensification or extensive surgery - the proportion of such delayed responders and optimal extended duration are unknown.</li>
                <li>The combination of response-adapted therapy de-escalation with improved upfront biomarker selection (using multi-omic classifiers to identify truly high-risk patients who benefit most from intensive therapy versus lower-risk patients who could receive less intensive therapy) might enable a 'precision escalation/de-escalation' approach reducing both under-treatment (of high-risk patients) and over-treatment (of low-risk patients) - the feasibility and magnitude of benefit are unknown.</li>
                <li>Long-term immune memory and systemic immune repertoire reshaping established during neoadjuvant therapy with intact tumor antigen exposure might provide protection against second primary melanomas or other malignancies beyond the treated site, a benefit that wouldn't be captured in standard melanoma-specific RFS endpoints but could emerge in 10+ year follow-up - whether such trans-tumor protection occurs in humans is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a randomized trial showed patients with major pathologic response who received full one-year adjuvant therapy had identical RFS and OS to those who omitted adjuvant therapy (with overlapping confidence intervals and HR 0.95-1.05), this would validate de-escalation but also fundamentally question whether adjuvant therapy adds any value even in excellent responders, potentially narrowing the population needing any systemic therapy.</li>
                <li>If patients with poor/no pathologic response who received intensified adjuvant therapy (e.g., switching to alternative checkpoint inhibitors, adding targeted therapy, or extending duration) had outcomes no better than those who received standard adjuvant therapy in a randomized comparison, this would challenge the value of pathologic response for treatment intensification decisions and suggest non-responders have intrinsically resistant biology not addressable with more therapy.</li>
                <li>If long-term follow-up (>5 years, median 7-10 years) of surgical de-escalation cohorts showed late regional recurrences specifically in the de-escalated population that eroded early outcome advantages (e.g., 5-year RFS dropping from 93% to 75% while surgical cohort remained stable at 85%), this would challenge the safety of response-driven surgical de-escalation and require re-evaluation of patient selection criteria.</li>
                <li>If pathologic response assessment showed high inter-observer variability (kappa <0.6) or poor correlation between institutional and centrally-reviewed pathology in a prospective quality assurance study, the reliability of pathologic response as a real-time decision-making tool would be questioned and might require centralized real-time pathology review for safe implementation.</li>
                <li>If surgical outcomes data (wound complications, lymphedema rates, functional impairment, quality of life) were equivalent between patients undergoing complete lymph node dissection versus those with limited/no dissection in long-term follow-up studies, the surgical morbidity benefit of de-escalation would be questioned and might not justify the residual recurrence risk, undermining a key rationale for the approach.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Optimal pathologic response thresholds for different de-escalation decisions (surgery vs adjuvant therapy omission vs both) are not fully defined - current thresholds (≤10% viable tumor for major response) are empirically derived from initial studies but may not be optimal for all decisions or all patient subgroups. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.2" class="evidence-link">[e6.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Some patients with poor pathologic response still achieve good long-term outcomes in multiple studies, suggesting pathologic response captures only one aspect of treatment efficacy and other factors (systemic immune priming, micrometastatic disease clearance) may matter equally for outcome but are not assessed by index lesion pathology. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.2" class="evidence-link">[e10.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.3" class="evidence-link">[e9.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The incremental benefit of adjuvant therapy specifically in patients who achieve major pathologic response is unknown from available data - they may have excellent outcomes regardless of whether they receive adjuvant therapy, making it difficult to determine if de-escalation truly maintains efficacy or if the comparison group was receiving unnecessary therapy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.2" class="evidence-link">[e6.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Patient and physician acceptance of de-escalation strategies in real-world practice outside of protocol-driven trials may differ substantially from trial participation rates, potentially limiting implementation despite proven safety and efficacy in selected trial populations. </li>
    <li>The mechanisms underlying why some patients achieve pathologic response while others do not, and whether non-responders have fundamentally different tumor biology versus treatable resistance mechanisms, remain incompletely characterized and limit ability to predict response upfront. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4.html#e4.0" class="evidence-link">[e4.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.1" class="evidence-link">[e10.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Longer-term outcomes beyond 2-3 years for de-escalated patients are not yet mature in most cohorts, and late recurrences (5-10+ years) could potentially emerge that would change risk-benefit calculations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.2" class="evidence-link">[e6.2]</a> </li>
