                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Depth-of-Response Adaptive Duration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the optimal duration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma, and whether it differs by degree of response, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the optimal duration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma is best determined by the depth and confirmation of antitumor response, rather than arbitrary fixed treatment lengths. Specifically, patients who achieve confirmed complete response (CR) can safely discontinue therapy after a minimum exposure (preferably >6 months) with a durable remission rate exceeding ~85–90% over two to three years, while those with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) have incrementally higher relapse risks and may benefit from longer exposure. Advanced pathologic or biomarker confirmation (e.g., PET-CT CMR, negative biopsy, ctDNA clearance) further refines which patients can stop early with confidence. This framework replaces fixed-duration or indefinite therapy with a “response-adapted” approach, maximizing benefit per exposure and minimizing overtreatment.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Optimal Discontinuation Is Defined by Achieving and Confirming Deep Response</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Patients with advanced melanoma achieving confirmed radiographic or pathologic CR after ≥6 months of anti-PD-1 can discontinue therapy and expect a ≥85% 2-year progression-free survival (PFS), while incremental benefit for durations beyond 1–2 years is negligible for CRs.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to adults with advanced unresectable melanoma treated with anti-PD-1, who achieve and document confirmed CR (RECIST or by PET/biopsy) after at least 6 months of therapy; excludes those with residual measurable/metabolic disease, primary resistant biology, or short (<6 months) exposures.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>CR achieved early (<6 months) is a risk factor for relapse—recommend continuing to at least 6 months’ total exposure.</li>
                <li>Patients with CR on PET/metabolic imaging (CMR) but radiographic PR may be eligible for early discontinuation if biopsy or ctDNA negative.</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Response-adapted duration (especially for CRs) is implicitly recognized, but universal operationalization as an endpoint is not codified.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Guidelines and some trials permit stopping after CR with minimum exposure, but do not systematize as a universal approach; fixed durations still common.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes a mandatory CR+confirmed threshold (≥6 months) as the 'discontinuation breakpoint' and demands biomarker/advanced imaging confirmation to maximize prediction of remission.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Partial Responders and Stable Disease Require Longer Exposure Based on Relapse Risk Gradient</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Patients with PR/SD who discontinue anti-PD-1 after <12–18 months have higher likelihood of relapse (>30–50%) than those with CR, and, unless advanced biomarker clearance is demonstrated (e.g., PET CMR, negative biopsy, ctDNA), should receive extended therapy up to 18–24 months or until confirmed maximal response.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to advanced melanoma patients with ongoing PR or SD who are medically fit for prolonged therapy and who have not met criteria for CR or comprehensive disease clearance; excludes patients with severe toxicity or financial constraints.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Occasional PR/SD patients achieving PET/CT CMR and negative biopsy—potential early-stopping candidates.</li>
                <li>Patients with high LDH, brain metastases, or high disease burden may still benefit from extended courses (>2 years).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Jansen et al./van Zeijl/Warner/Pokorny studies: PR/SD patients stopping anti-PD-1 at ~1 year have 24-month PFS 31–68%; SD relapse rate up to 50%, PR typically ~30%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.1" class="evidence-link">[e56.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-57.html#e57.6" class="evidence-link">[e57.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.1" class="evidence-link">[e58.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.2" class="evidence-link">[e55.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.2" class="evidence-link">[e50.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-49.html#e49.1" class="evidence-link">[e49.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.2" class="evidence-link">[e58.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Tan2018, PET studies: PR/SD with metabolic CMR or negative biopsy after 1 year have excellent 2-year PFS (>90%), while PR/SD without metabolic clearance have relapse rates >50%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.5" class="evidence-link">[e52.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The risk gradient for PR/SD is acknowledged in anecdotal practice, but explicit imaging/biomarker-adapted rules for early stop in non-CR are not standard.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that PR/SD patients do not fare as well post-discontinuation as CRs and thus may benefit from longer therapy.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Operationalizing PET CMR/biopsy/ctDNA clearance as surrogate stop criteria for PR/SD, replacing purely fixed-duration approaches.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Biomarker-guided (PET/CT CMR, negative biopsy, ctDNA clearance) early discontinuation in PR/SD will yield similar PFS/OS as fixed 2-year duration and substantially lower cost and toxicity.</li>
                <li>Prospective randomized trials will show non-inferiority of therapy shortened/discontinued after confirmed CR for ≥6 months versus 2-year arms.</li>
                <li>Patients with PR/SD stopping early without metabolic/pathologic clearance will show increased relapse rates, justifying extension or biomarker adaptation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A subset of PR/SD patients with sustained metabolic clearance and negative ctDNA at 1 year will match CRs in long-term outcomes after early discontinuation.</li>
                <li>Novel immune or transcriptomic signatures will emerge as more accurate predictors of safe discontinuation than current response depth, enabling further personalized shortening.</li>
                <li>In the adjuvant setting, response-adapted adjuvant durations (as in neoadjuvant trials like NADINA) will outperform fixed 1-year courses for major responders.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A trial showing no difference in relapse rates between early-stopped PR/SD with/without biomarker clearance would challenge the necessity of advanced imaging-guided discontinuation.</li>
                <li>Confirming that CR patients with <6 months’ exposure have as good outcomes as those with ≥6 months would challenge the minimal duration rule.</li>
                <li>Finding that 2-year fixed duration always outperforms response-adaptive stopping in every subgroup (including CRs) would falsify the thesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Exceptions exist: some patients achieving CR then relapsing late (years post-cessation) even after long exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.3" class="evidence-link">[e50.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.4" class="evidence-link">[e58.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Rare SD/PR patients can convert to CR after cessation (delayed deepening), not predicted by baseline assessments. <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.1" class="evidence-link">[e55.1]</a> </li>
