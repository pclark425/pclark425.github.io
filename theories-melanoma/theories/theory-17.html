                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the optimal duration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma, and whether it differs by degree of response, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Elective discontinuation of anti-PD-1 therapy after approximately 1 year in advanced melanoma patients can be made safe—yields relapse rates comparable to or better than traditional CR-based stopping—*if* no evidence of biologically active disease is found using metabolic imaging (PET/CT) and/or highly sensitive molecular biomarkers (ctDNA), regardless of residual disease observed on anatomic imaging (CT/MRI) or whether the best response is PR or SD. This approach identifies a subpopulation suitable for shorter, rationalized therapy duration and allows durable remission with minimized toxicity and cost.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: PET/ctDNA/biopsy-based Early Discontinuation Criteria Yields Low Relapse Across BORs</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In advanced melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy, achieving complete metabolic response (CMR) on PET/CT or undetectable ctDNA (and, if PET-positive, negative biopsy for viable melanoma) after ~1 year identifies a population—regardless of radiographic BOR (CR, PR, SD)—with 1- to 2-year progression rates after elective discontinuation consistently ≤10%. These rates approximate or improve upon traditional CR-only stop rules and surpass outcomes for PR/SD patients selected by CT alone.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Patients with advanced (unresectable stage III/IV) melanoma who have received at least ~1 year of anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, plus/minus CTLA-4) with no evidence of metabolic activity of disease on PET/CT or undetectable ctDNA, including patients with residual anatomic lesions (PR/SD) by RECIST at the time of discontinuation. Not validated in adjuvant-only or neoadjuvant settings, nor for tumors with low baseline metabolic activity or in cases with technically uninformative ctDNA.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>PET/CT false negatives in patients with inherently low-metabolism disease (e.g., mucosal, uveal melanoma).</li>
                <li>Lesions inaccessible/small for biopsy may limit negative predictive value in PET-positive/biopsy-negative patients.</li>
                <li>ctDNA utility restricted in patients without known trackable driver mutations or low disease burden.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Gibney2021: Elective discontinuation after a median ~12 months in advanced melanoma patients with PET CMR/biopsy-negative findings resulted in 1- and 2-year event-free survival of 100% and 95%, respectively, despite including many PR patients by CT. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Tan2018: In a retrospective cohort, PR/SD patients with PET CMR after ~1 year of anti-PD-1 therapy had a 24-month PFS of 93% (compared to 49% in PR/SD with non-CMR). Patients with PET CMR did as well as those with CR by CT. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.5" class="evidence-link">[e52.5]</a> </li>
    <li>PET-Stop (EA6192): Ongoing prospective trial randomizing patients after 1 year of ICI to discontinue if PET-negative or PET-positive/biopsy-negative, incorporating ctDNA/immune profiling. Trial designed to detect <10% relapse at 1 year after stop in PET/biopsy-negative population. <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.9" class="evidence-link">[e55.9]</a> </li>
    <li>van Zeijl Netherlands observational: Elective discontinuation after ~11 months in CRs and PRs shows PFS is substantially higher when selection is tightened by metabolic imaging (PET/CT). <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Jansen2019 and associated real-world discontinuation studies: Relapse risk stratified by BOR shows CRs have lowest relapse risk (~14% at 2 years post stop), but data from PET/CT studies indicate PR/SD patients can have equivalently low risk if CMR/negative biomarker status. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.6" class="evidence-link">[e52.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.2" class="evidence-link">[e55.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.1" class="evidence-link">[e56.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.1" class="evidence-link">[e58.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.2" class="evidence-link">[e50.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Biomarker-guided discontinuation also recommended as a research direction in SITC guidelines and prospective studies, noting that standard CT imaging alone is insufficient to select all patients at truly low risk. <a href="../results/extraction-result-57.html#e57.0" class="evidence-link">[e57.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Existing data suggest PET/biopsy/ctDNA-based approaches, but no prior clinical law systematizes metabolic/molecular remission as an equalizer of relapse risk across anatomic BORs at a fixed duration; this is thus a novel, integrative proposition.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> PET-based stopping after 1 year has been assessed retrospectively (Gibney, Tan), and is the basis of ongoing PET-Stop/EA6192 trial; ctDNA is being explored for relapse risk after discontinuation. However, practice and guidelines still focus on anatomic CR, with PR/SD generally ineligible for early discontinuation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law proposes, and synthesizes cross-validated evidence, that either PET (CMR) or ctDNA (clearance) or pathologic biopsy negativity is sufficient to safely allow discontinuation at 1 year for a broader population (including CT PR/SD); not as a trial concept, but as a predictive, quantitative law.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In prospective cohorts, advanced melanoma patients with PET CMR and/or undetectable ctDNA after 1 year of anti-PD-1 (regardless of CT PR/SD) will have ≤10% relapse (progression or melanoma death) at 1–2 years after discontinuation, matching or exceeding CR-only outcomes.</li>
                <li>Application of PET/ctDNA-guided discontinuation will substantially reduce therapy durations and cumulative toxicity without compromising long-term disease control in selected PR/SD patients.</li>
                <li>Patients with PET/biopsy CMR but PR/SD by anatomic imaging will have event-free survival/risk of relapse comparable to anatomic CR/PET CMR subgroup after early discontinuation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adding ctDNA negativity to PET CMR will further enrich for ultra-low relapse population, possibly allowing discontinuation after <1 year in future studies.</li>
                <li>In other high-immunogenicity tumors (e.g., NSCLC), PET/ctDNA-guided early stop will yield similar durability, supporting generalized biomarker-based duration minimization.</li>
                <li>Combined PET/metabolic and ctDNA/molecular clearance may prospectively identify patients in whom therapy can be safely shortened below 6 months.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If, in a prospective biomarker-driven discontinuation study, relapse rates after stopping at 1 year in PR/SD patients with PET/ctDNA-negative results exceed 15%, the law would be weakened or invalidated.</li>
                <li>If PR/SD patients meeting strict PET/ctDNA/biopsy-based criteria for discontinuation experience significantly higher or earlier relapse compared to CRs (by any measure), the equivalence claim fails.</li>
                <li>Demonstration of high false-negative rates for PET/ctDNA in certain melanoma subtypes would undermine generalizability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases of residual micrometastatic disease undetectable by PET/CT or ctDNA that lead to late relapse (>2 years post-discontinuation); currently rare but not captured in existing studies with limited follow-up. </li>
    <li>Patients who lack trackable mutations for ctDNA monitoring or whose tumors are PET-invisible due to intrinsic biology remain inadequately risk-stratified. </li>
