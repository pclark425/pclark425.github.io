                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why giving neoadjuvant-adjuvant immunotherapy improves melanoma outcomes compared to adjuvant only immunotherapy, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Neoadjuvant immunotherapy leverages the intact primary tumor and draining lymph nodes as an endogenous antigen depot and immune priming site, generating a qualitatively and quantitatively superior systemic anti-tumor immune response compared to adjuvant therapy given after tumor removal. The presence of tumor tissue during immune checkpoint blockade enables continuous antigen presentation, T-cell priming, clonal expansion, and epitope spreading that collectively produce durable systemic immunity capable of controlling micrometastatic disease. This theory posits that a critical temporal window exists where simultaneous checkpoint inhibitor administration and tumor antigen availability creates immune priming effects that cannot be replicated after surgical tumor removal.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Tumor-Resident T-Cell Expansion Amplification</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the presence of intact tumor tissue results in greater expansion and systemic dissemination of tumor-resident T-cell clones compared to administration after tumor removal, with these expanded clones persisting systemically for weeks to months post-resection and trafficking to distant sites to control micrometastatic disease.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to solid tumors with pre-existing tumor-resident T-cell populations treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, or combinations) in the neoadjuvant setting compared to adjuvant setting. Most validated in melanoma (particularly cutaneous melanoma with high mutational burden) but potentially applicable to other immunogenic solid tumors with sufficient tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Effects are measurable through peripheral blood T-cell receptor sequencing and correlate with clinical outcomes.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect magnitude may vary with tumor mutational burden, with high-TMB tumors showing greater clonal expansion</li>
                <li>May be attenuated or absent in immunologically 'cold' tumors with poor baseline T-cell infiltration (<5% CD8+ T cells)</li>
                <li>Timing and duration of neoadjuvant therapy (typically 2-3 cycles over 6-9 weeks) influences the degree of clonal expansion</li>
                <li>Combination checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4) may produce greater expansion than monotherapy but with higher toxicity</li>
                <li>Mucosal melanomas with lower mutational burden may show attenuated effects compared to cutaneous melanomas</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the general hypothesis of neoadjuvant immune priming existed in the vaccine and neoadjuvant chemotherapy literature, the specific demonstration of tumor-resident T-cell clone expansion as the mechanism, with direct clinical trial evidence comparing neoadjuvant vs adjuvant checkpoint inhibitor timing using modern sequencing methods, represents a significant mechanistic advance that validates and refines prior hypotheses.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept that neoadjuvant therapy may enhance immune responses has been hypothesized based on vaccine principles, and preclinical work suggested timing effects on immune activation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law specifically quantifies that tumor-resident (not just general peripheral) T-cell clones are preferentially expanded and systemically disseminated with neoadjuvant timing, with documented persistence post-resection measured through T-cell receptor sequencing - a mechanistic insight from direct human comparative trials that was not previously demonstrated.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Pathologic Response as Immune Efficacy Surrogate</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Achievement of pathologic complete response (pCR, defined as 0% viable tumor) or major pathologic response (typically defined as ≤10% viable tumor) after neoadjuvant immunotherapy strongly predicts improved recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival, serving as an on-treatment biomarker of effective systemic immune priming that is uniquely available with neoadjuvant approaches and not with adjuvant-only therapy. The strength of this prognostic relationship (typically HR <0.2 for pCR vs no response) suggests pathologic response reflects fundamental immune system reprogramming rather than merely local tumor destruction.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to solid tumors treated with neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors where surgical resection permits standardized pathologic assessment. Most robustly validated in resectable stage III-IV melanoma (cutaneous and mucosal subtypes) using International Neoadjuvant Melanoma Consortium (INMC) pathologic response criteria. The relationship between pathologic response and survival appears consistent across anti-PD-1 monotherapy and combination anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 regimens, though response rates differ. Limited data exist for other solid tumor types.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pathologic response thresholds have different prognostic implications: pCR (0% viable) > major response (≤10% viable) > partial response (≤50% viable) > no response, with clearest survival separation between pCR/major response vs others</li>
                <li>Some patients (approximately 5-15%) without pathologic response may still derive clinical benefit and remain disease-free, suggesting pathologic response is highly specific but not perfectly sensitive for identifying all responders</li>
                <li>Different tumor types may have different pathologic response-outcome correlations; most data are from melanoma with high mutational burden</li>
                <li>Timing of pathologic assessment matters - responses are typically evaluated after 2-3 cycles (6-9 weeks) of neoadjuvant therapy</li>
                <li>Inter-observer variability in pathologic assessment can affect response classification, particularly distinguishing near-complete from partial responses</li>
                <li>Pathologic response in index nodes may not perfectly reflect response in all involved lymph nodes or primary tumor sites</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While pathologic response as a surrogate endpoint has precedent in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (particularly breast cancer per Cortazar 2014), its validation specifically for checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy with consistently large effect sizes across multiple independent melanoma trials, and its application to guide treatment de-escalation based on immune response rather than tumor cell death per se, represents a novel application that extends beyond existing paradigms.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Pathologic response has been recognized as a potential surrogate endpoint in neoadjuvant settings for various cancers (particularly breast cancer with neoadjuvant chemotherapy), where pCR correlates with improved survival.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The consistent, strong quantitative relationship between pathologic response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy and survival outcomes (with effect sizes often HR <0.2) validated across multiple independent trials, with specific thresholds (≤10% viable tumor) established as prognostic, and the use of pathologic response to guide surgical and adjuvant therapy de-escalation, is novel in the immunotherapy context where mechanism of action differs fundamentally from cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Neoadjuvant Timing Advantage for Event-Free Survival</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In resectable stage III-IV melanoma, neoadjuvant administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (with or without continuation as adjuvant therapy) produces superior event-free survival compared to adjuvant-only administration of identical agents at identical total doses, with effect sizes typically showing 12-month event-free survival improvements of 15-30 percentage points (e.g., 84% vs 57% in NADINA) and hazard ratios favoring neoadjuvant timing by approximately 40-60% in randomized trials. This survival advantage manifests despite similar total drug exposure, indicating that timing of administration relative to surgery is a critical determinant of efficacy.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to patients with resectable macroscopic stage III (particularly IIIB-IIID with palpable nodal disease) or oligometastatic stage IV melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1 monotherapy such as pembrolizumab or nivolumab, or anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 combinations) where direct randomized comparison data exist. Most robust evidence is from cutaneous melanoma; limited data exist for mucosal melanoma subtypes. Effects are most clearly demonstrated with neoadjuvant durations of 2-3 cycles (6-9 weeks) prior to surgery. Patient populations are typically treatment-naïve in the perioperative setting.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Benefit magnitude may vary with specific regimen: combination ipilimumab+nivolumab shows larger absolute EFS improvements but higher toxicity than anti-PD-1 monotherapy</li>
                <li>Follow-up duration matters: some trials (SWOG S1801) show sustained EFS separation at 2+ years, while others (OpACIN) show similar RFS at 4 years despite different OS</li>
                <li>Patient selection criteria influence absolute benefit: stage IIIB-D with macroscopic disease shows clearest benefit; stage IIIA with microscopic disease less well studied</li>
                <li>Neoadjuvant duration tested ranges from 2-3 cycles in most trials; optimal duration balancing immune priming vs surgical delay risk remains undefined</li>
                <li>Some neoadjuvant strategies use response-adapted adjuvant therapy (PRADO, NADINA) which confounds direct timing comparisons</li>
                <li>Mucosal melanomas with lower mutational burden may show attenuated benefits compared to cutaneous melanomas</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While neoadjuvant approaches exist in oncology and adjuvant immunotherapy was established, the specific randomized evidence that immune checkpoint inhibitor timing (neoadjuvant vs adjuvant) impacts survival outcomes when total drug exposure is controlled - rather than just comparing treatment vs no treatment - represents fundamentally new knowledge about immunotherapy mechanisms that was not previously demonstrated and could not be inferred from adjuvant-only trials.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> General concept that earlier treatment may improve outcomes exists across oncology; adjuvant immunotherapy benefits over observation were already established in resected melanoma (CheckMate-238, KEYNOTE-054).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Quantitative demonstration through multiple independent randomized trials that neoadjuvant timing specifically (not just earlier treatment or more total treatment) provides survival advantage over adjuvant timing of identical agents at identical total doses, with effect sizes documented as 15-30 percentage point EFS improvements and HR ~0.4-0.6, represents new knowledge showing that the timing of immunotherapy relative to surgery is itself a critical efficacy determinant.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Antigen Availability Window Hypothesis</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The superior outcomes with neoadjuvant immunotherapy result from a critical temporal window where immune checkpoint blockade occurs simultaneously with high tumor antigen availability (from intact primary tumor, involved lymph nodes, and tumor-draining lymph node antigen-presenting cells), enabling enhanced antigen presentation, broader epitope recognition, T-cell clonal expansion, and systemic priming that cannot be replicated after surgical removal of the antigen source. This creates an 'in situ vaccination' effect where the tumor serves as both antigen depot and immune priming site, with effects persisting systemically long after tumor removal.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to immunogenic solid tumors (typically defined as tumors with >10 mutations per megabase, significant neoantigen burden, or pre-existing T-cell infiltration) treated with checkpoint inhibitors that work through T-cell activation mechanisms (anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4, anti-LAG-3). Particularly relevant in melanoma (especially cutaneous melanoma with median ~15 mutations/Mb) and potentially other mutation-rich tumors (NSCLC, MSI-high tumors). Effects depend on intact tumor-draining lymph node axis at time of treatment initiation. Less applicable to tumors with low mutational burden (<5 mutations/Mb), minimal T-cell infiltration, or after complete surgical removal.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect depends on baseline tumor antigenicity: high mutational burden tumors (>10 mutations/Mb) show stronger effects than low mutational burden tumors</li>
                <li>Requires pre-existing immune infiltration: 'cold' tumors with <5% CD8+ T-cell infiltration may not benefit from this mechanism</li>
                <li>Window duration optimization: most trials use 2-3 cycles (6-9 weeks) but optimal duration balancing priming vs surgical delay is undefined</li>
                <li>Tumors with low antigenicity (e.g., some mucosal melanomas with <5 mutations/Mb) may show attenuated effects</li>
                <li>Mechanism requires functional tumor-draining lymph nodes; prior lymph node dissection or radiation may impair effect</li>
                <li>Very rapid tumor growth may necessitate shorter neoadjuvant windows, potentially limiting immune priming</li>

    <li>Multiple studies hypothesize neoadjuvant therapy provides immunological priming with tumor in situ, with intact tumor serving as antigen source for enhanced T-cell exposure and activation, enabling in situ vaccination effect. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.3" class="evidence-link">[e8.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4.html#e4.0" class="evidence-link">[e4.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5.html#e5.0" class="evidence-link">[e5.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5.html#e5.1" class="evidence-link">[e5.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.2" class="evidence-link">[e8.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5.html#e5.3" class="evidence-link">[e5.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5.html#e5.4" class="evidence-link">[e5.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Liu et al. preclinical study mechanistically demonstrated that intact tumor at time of checkpoint blockade enables in situ vaccination effect with broader tumor antigen-specific T-cell priming, antigen spreading, and superior eradication of metastatic disease compared to adjuvant timing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.1" class="evidence-link">[e10.1]</a> </li>
    <li>OpACIN/Blank trial authors propose neoadjuvant therapy leverages intact primary tumor and tumor-draining lymph nodes to increase endogenous tumor antigen presentation and T-cell priming, leading to activation, proliferation, and trafficking of tumor-specific T cells; trial showed greater tumor-resident T-cell clone expansion with neoadjuvant timing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4.html#e4.0" class="evidence-link">[e4.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-7.html#e7.1" class="evidence-link">[e7.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> </li>
    <li>High pathologic response rates (ranging 35-90% across studies: OpACIN-neo 77%, relatlimab+nivolumab 70%, NADINA 59%, Ho 2022 mucosal 35%) with neoadjuvant therapy indicate effective local immune activation and tumor cell killing enabled by antigen-driven T-cell responses during treatment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.3" class="evidence-link">[e9.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.0" class="evidence-link">[e8.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.1" class="evidence-link">[e6.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> </li>
    <li>SITC guideline and multiple trial authors cite abundant tumor antigen availability in situ at time of treatment as key mechanism enabling robust systemic priming, earlier treatment of micrometastatic disease, and facilitation of biomarker identification. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>INMC pooled analysis authors emphasize that neoadjuvant immunotherapy promotes systemic antitumor immune priming (in situ vaccination effect) with expansion of tumor-specific T cells and antigen spreading, explaining why pathological responses predict improved RFS. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.2" class="evidence-link">[e10.2]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This formalizes and provides both mechanistic preclinical evidence and clinical trial validation for what was previously a theoretical construct, demonstrating through multiple independent studies that the timing overlap of checkpoint blockade and antigen availability produces measurable clinical benefits (EFS improvements) and mechanistic effects (T-cell clone expansion) that distinguish it from general vaccination concepts and establish checkpoint inhibitor timing as a critical therapeutic variable.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept of in situ vaccination and antigen availability has been proposed in vaccine immunology literature and some earlier neoadjuvant therapy hypotheses, with the general principle that local antigen presence may enhance immune responses.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific articulation that a temporal window of simultaneous checkpoint blockade and antigen availability creates non-replicable immune priming (quantified through T-cell clone expansion), supported by direct comparative clinical trial evidence showing survival benefits that persist long after antigen source removal, and mechanistic validation through preclinical models demonstrating antigen spreading and metastatic control, represents a novel synthesis and validation of the in situ vaccination concept specifically for checkpoint inhibitors.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In other immunogenic solid tumors with high mutational burden (non-small cell lung cancer with >10 mutations/Mb, MSI-high colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma), neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors will produce superior event-free survival compared to adjuvant-only approaches, with magnitude of benefit correlating with baseline tumor mutational burden (expected HR ~0.5-0.7 for high-TMB tumors).</li>
                <li>Patients achieving pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant immunotherapy can safely omit or substantially de-escalate adjuvant therapy without compromising outcomes, as demonstrated in PRADO extension, potentially reducing toxicity while maintaining efficacy (predicted ≥90% 2-year RFS with surgery alone after pCR).</li>
                <li>Combination neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1 + anti-CTLA-4) will produce higher pathologic response rates (70-80%) than anti-PD-1 monotherapy (40-50%), with optimal dosing favoring higher anti-PD-1 relative to anti-CTLA-4 dosing (e.g., nivolumab 3mg/kg + ipilimumab 1mg/kg) to balance efficacy and toxicity.</li>
                <li>Extending the duration of neoadjuvant therapy beyond 3 cycles (9 weeks) will produce diminishing returns in pathologic response rate (<5% additional pCR per additional cycle), as most immune priming occurs during the first 6-9 weeks, while surgical delay risks increase.</li>
                <li>Tumors with high baseline CD8+ T-cell infiltration (>20% of tumor area) will show greater pathologic response to neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors (predicted 70-90% response rate) than those with low infiltration (<5%, predicted 20-40% response rate).</li>
                <li>Neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor therapy will enable pathologic downstaging in 30-50% of patients with initially borderline-resectable disease, allowing definitive surgical resection in patients who would otherwise require more extensive or morbid procedures.</li>
                <li>The survival benefit of neoadjuvant versus adjuvant timing will be most pronounced in patients with high-risk features (stage IIIC-D, high tumor burden), with less benefit in lower-risk stage IIIB patients where adjuvant therapy already produces excellent outcomes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sequential neoadjuvant checkpoint blockade followed by adoptive T-cell therapy (using ex vivo expanded tumor-resident T-cell clones identified during neoadjuvant treatment) may produce synergistic benefits beyond either approach alone, potentially achieving near-universal pathologic complete responses (>90% pCR) in high-TMB tumors, though technical and logistical challenges remain substantial.</li>
                <li>Neoadjuvant immunotherapy may enable organ preservation in traditionally surgically-managed tumors (bladder cancer, soft tissue sarcomas, laryngeal cancer) if very high pathologic complete response rates (>80%) can be achieved and reliably assessed non-invasively through imaging biomarkers, fundamentally changing treatment paradigms but requiring validation of imaging-pathologic correlations.</li>
                <li>The expanded tumor-resident T-cell clones induced by neoadjuvant therapy may provide cross-protection against antigenically-similar second primary tumors or late recurrences years to decades after treatment through establishment of durable memory T-cell populations, representing a form of 'immune surveillance' that could reduce lifetime cancer burden.</li>
                <li>Neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitor treatment might fundamentally alter the metastatic potential and immunogenicity of residual tumor cells through immunoediting, either eliminating the most immunogenic clones (potentially harmful by selecting for immune-evasive variants) or inducing a durable state of immune equilibrium (potentially beneficial by controlling residual disease), with unclear net effect on long-term outcomes.</li>
                <li>Window-of-opportunity studies using extremely short neoadjuvant exposures (single dose, 1-2 weeks) might reveal that immune priming occurs very rapidly and that longer neoadjuvant courses (6-9 weeks currently standard) add primarily toxicity rather than efficacy, potentially enabling earlier surgery and reduced treatment burden.</li>
                <li>Addition of neoadjuvant radiation therapy to checkpoint inhibitors might enhance in situ vaccination effects through increased tumor antigen release and abscopal immune responses, but could also damage tumor-draining lymph nodes and impair immune priming, with the net effect on outcomes uncertain.</li>
                <li>Neoadjuvant strategies might be particularly beneficial in elderly patients (>70 years) who have intact tumors but may not tolerate prolonged adjuvant therapy, allowing concentration of immune priming during the neoadjuvant window, though age-related immune senescence may limit response magnitude.</li>
                <li>The optimal number of neoadjuvant cycles may vary by tumor growth kinetics: slowly-growing tumors might benefit from extended neoadjuvant therapy (4-6 cycles) allowing more complete immune priming, while rapidly-growing tumors might require abbreviated courses (1-2 cycles) to avoid unresectable progression.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibitors were shown to produce equivalent tumor-resident T-cell clone expansion and systemic T-cell responses when tumor is removed before treatment initiation (using autologous tumor lysates or irradiated tumor cells as vaccines), this would contradict the antigen availability window hypothesis and suggest antigen presentation kinetics are not treatment-timing dependent.</li>
                <li>If pathologic non-responders to neoadjuvant therapy (patients with >50% viable residual tumor) had equivalent long-term event-free survival to pathologic complete responders at 5+ years follow-up, this would challenge the theory that pathologic response reflects meaningful systemic immune priming and suggests it is merely a marker of intrinsic tumor biology.</li>
                <li>If a trial showed equivalent event-free survival between neoadjuvant therapy (2-3 cycles pre-surgery + adjuvant) and adjuvant therapy (same agent, same total number of cycles starting post-surgery) with identical total drug exposure and the only difference being surgical timing, this would fundamentally undermine the core premise of neoadjuvant timing advantage and suggest observed benefits are due to total drug exposure or patient selection.</li>
                <li>If tumors with complete pathologic response (0% viable tumor) showed no difference in tumor-resident T-cell clone expansion measured in peripheral blood compared to non-responding tumors (>90% viable tumor), this would challenge the mechanistic link between clonal expansion and pathologic response.</li>
                <li>If administration of checkpoint inhibitors exclusively to tumor-draining lymph nodes (without systemic treatment of the primary tumor) produced equivalent systemic immunity and survival outcomes to treating the intact tumor systemically, this would question whether the primary tumor itself (vs draining lymph nodes) is the critical antigen source for immune priming.</li>
                <li>If delaying surgery by 6-9 weeks for neoadjuvant therapy (compared to immediate surgery + adjuvant therapy) resulted in higher rates of unresectable disease progression (>20% of patients) that offset survival benefits in responders, this would limit the population where neoadjuvant approaches are beneficial.</li>
                <li>If patients receiving adjuvant checkpoint inhibitors who later develop recurrence and are re-treated showed equivalent tumor-resident T-cell responses to those who received neoadjuvant therapy initially, this would suggest timing effects can be overcome by re-exposure and the neoadjuvant window is not uniquely irreplaceable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>OpACIN trial showed similar 4-year RFS between neoadjuvant and adjuvant arms (60% both) despite numerically different OS (90% vs 70%), which is unexpected if neoadjuvant therapy truly provides superior systemic immunity - suggests possible differences in post-recurrence outcomes or salvage therapy effectiveness rather than prevention of recurrence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some patients achieve pathologic complete response but still experience recurrence (estimated 5-10% in various trials), indicating pathologic response is not perfectly predictive and other factors (tumor biology, micrometastatic burden at baseline, immune escape mechanisms) influence outcomes independent of neoadjuvant immune priming. <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.2" class="evidence-link">[e10.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.3" class="evidence-link">[e9.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Dimitriou 2022 retrospective cohort of 545 metastatic mucosal melanoma patients showed no significant difference in ORR, PFS, or OS between anti-PD-1 monotherapy and combination anti-PD-1 + ipilimumab therapy, contrasting with better combination results in neoadjuvant cutaneous melanoma trials - suggests mucosal melanoma biology or metastatic setting fundamentally differs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.7" class="evidence-link">[e8.7]</a> </li>
    <li>The specific duration and number of neoadjuvant cycles that optimize immune priming versus surgical delay risk is not clearly defined across studies (ranges from 2-3 cycles in most trials), and no trials have systematically compared different neoadjuvant durations head-to-head. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-10.html#e10.0" class="evidence-link">[e10.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.1" class="evidence-link">[e6.1]</a> </li>
    <li>SWOG S1801 reported similar rates of surgery completion and perioperative adverse events between neoadjuvant and adjuvant arms, but detailed data on surgical complications, wound healing, and operative times are not consistently reported across neoadjuvant trials to assess true surgical safety impact. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.0" class="evidence-link">[e9.0]</a> </li>
    <li>CheckMate-238 and KEYNOTE-054 excluded mucosal melanoma patients from landmark adjuvant trials, and D'Angelo 2017 pooled analysis showed lower response rates in mucosal melanoma (combination ~37-43%, monotherapy ~30%) compared to cutaneous melanoma, but mechanisms underlying differential responses are not fully explained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.4" class="evidence-link">[e8.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.5" class="evidence-link">[e8.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-8.html#e8.6" class="evidence-link">[e8.6]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for why some patients with minimal residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy still require adjuvant therapy for optimal outcomes, while others with complete pathologic response may not - suggesting heterogeneity in quality/durability of immune responses not captured by pathologic assessment alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.1" class="evidence-link">[e9.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-9.html#e9.2" class="evidence-link">[e9.2]</a> </li>
    <li>NCT04949113 phase 3 trial comparing neoadjuvant ipilimumab+nivolumab versus adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy is ongoing but results not yet available to confirm or refute findings from smaller trials. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5.html#e5.2" class="evidence-link">[e5.2]</a> </li>
