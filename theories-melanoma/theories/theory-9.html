                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the optimal duration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma and whether it differs by degree of response, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The optimal duration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma is fundamentally determined by the depth of radiographic response achieved, with complete responders requiring shorter treatment durations (minimum 6 months) to achieve durable disease control, while partial responders and patients with stable disease require longer durations (approaching or exceeding 12-24 months) to maximize durability of benefit. This theory posits that response depth serves as a surrogate marker for immune memory establishment and tumor antigen elimination completeness, and that immune-related adverse events signal robust immune activation that can sustain responses even after early discontinuation.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: CR Minimum Duration Threshold</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Patients achieving complete radiographic response (CR) to anti-PD1 therapy who receive at least 6 months of treatment can safely discontinue therapy with high probability (approximately 85-90%) of maintaining durable disease control at 24 months, whereas CR patients treated for less than 6 months have significantly higher relapse risk. Treatment durations beyond 6 months in CR patients do not provide significant incremental benefit in disease control.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV cutaneous melanoma receiving first-line anti-PD1 monotherapy (pembrolizumab 200mg Q3W or nivolumab 240mg Q2W or 480mg Q4W) who achieve confirmed complete response by RECIST 1.1 criteria with confirmatory imaging at least 4-6 weeks after initial CR documentation. Excludes patients with uveal, mucosal, or acral melanoma subtypes where data are extremely limited. Application to combination immunotherapy regimens (nivolumab plus ipilimumab) is supported but with less extensive data. Most robust evidence for treatment-naive patients; applicability to previously treated patients less well-established.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Patients with history of brain metastases at any time may have higher relapse risk (identified as risk factor in e40.0) even after CR and >6 months treatment</li>
                <li>Younger patients may have higher relapse risk after early discontinuation (identified as risk factor in e40.0)</li>
                <li>Patients with elevated LDH at time of discontinuation may have higher relapse risk (identified as risk factor in e40.0)</li>
                <li>Some CR patients convert from PR after discontinuation (~8% in KEYNOTE-006), suggesting ongoing immune activity post-cessation</li>
                <li>Patients treated in later lines of therapy (second-line or beyond) should exercise greater caution with early discontinuation</li>
                <li>Very small subset of CR patients (<6 months treatment in Belgian cohort) who maintain durable responses exist but represent exceptions rather than the rule</li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While response-based duration strategies exist in melanoma trial protocols, the precise 6-month minimum threshold with supporting multi-cohort quantitative evidence (>85% 24-month PFS) and the demonstration via Belgian cohort analysis that durations beyond 6 months (across 6-12, 12-18, 18-24, >24 month bins) show no incremental benefit in CR patients represents a novel refinement of existing paradigms with real-world validation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Clinical practice guidelines already recommend consideration of discontinuation after CR in melanoma, based on trial protocols like KEYNOTE-001 and KEYNOTE-006 that included stopping rules for CR patients achieving response and receiving minimum therapy durations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific quantification of a 6-month minimum threshold for CR patients synthesized from multiple independent real-world cohorts (Belgian, Dutch, MSK, Pokorny, Gibney) showing consistent threshold effects and durability rates (85-95% at 2-3 years), with explicit demonstration that durations beyond 6 months confer no incremental benefit, represents a novel evidence-based boundary condition not explicitly defined in prior consensus recommendations.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: PR/SD Extended Duration Requirement</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Patients achieving partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) as best overall response have substantially higher risk of disease progression after treatment discontinuation compared to CR patients. Post-discontinuation 24-month progression rates approximate 25-32% for PR patients and 36-50% for SD patients (versus 10-15% for CR patients), necessitating longer treatment durations approaching or exceeding 18-24 months to optimize disease control. Elective discontinuation before 18 months should be discouraged in non-CR patients, particularly those treated in later lines of therapy.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV cutaneous melanoma receiving anti-PD1 therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy, or in combination with ipilimumab) who achieve confirmed partial response or stable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Greatest certainty for first-line therapy populations receiving monotherapy; combination therapy patients may have different kinetics. Limited data for non-cutaneous melanoma subtypes. Strongest evidence comes from patients who discontinued in absence of progression (elective or toxicity-driven), not progression-driven discontinuation.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Approximately 8% of PR patients in KEYNOTE-006 converted to CR after discontinuation, suggesting a subset may have more durable responses than expected and ongoing immune-mediated tumor clearance</li>
                <li>SD patients appear to have the highest relapse risk (36-50% at 24 months) across multiple cohorts and may benefit most from extended therapy or should be considered for alternative approaches</li>
                <li>Combination therapy (nivo+ipi) patients who discontinue early due to toxicity during induction may still have durable benefit despite lesser depth of response, potentially due to strong early immune activation</li>
                <li>PR/SD patients treated in second-line or later lines of therapy have been specifically identified as poor candidates for early discontinuation and should be discouraged from stopping before 18 months</li>
                <li>Patients with non-CR status and additional risk factors (younger age, brain metastasis history, elevated LDH) represent especially high-risk group for early discontinuation</li>
                <li>Small minority of PR/SD patients do maintain long-term responses after early discontinuation, but identifying them prospectively remains challenging</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While response-based stratification is recognized in melanoma practice and some trials included response-dependent stopping rules, the precise quantification of relapse risks by response category synthesized from real-world cohorts, coupled with the explicit 18-month minimum threshold for non-CR patients from Asher et al.'s real-world analysis, represents a novel evidence-based framework with specific numerical boundaries beyond previous general consensus statements that 'deeper responses do better'.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is established from multiple studies and meta-analyses that depth of response (CR vs PR vs SD) correlates with durability after ICI discontinuation in melanoma, and consensus guidelines acknowledge this distinction without specific quantitative thresholds.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The quantitative synthesis across multiple independent cohorts (Belgian, Dutch, Pokorny, KEYNOTE-006) establishing specific relapse rate ranges (PR: 25-32%, SD: 36-50% versus CR: 10-15% at 24 months) and the explicit evidence-based recommendation for extended durations (≥18-24 months for PR/SD versus ≥6 months for CR) with specific discouragement of early discontinuation before 18 months represents novel integration of disparate observational data into actionable, quantified thresholds.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Immune Activation-Response Durability Coupling</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Development of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) during anti-PD1 therapy, particularly when occurring early and leading to treatment discontinuation during the induction phase, is associated with comparable or non-inferior long-term efficacy outcomes (ORR, PFS, OS) versus patients who continue therapy without significant irAEs. This suggests that irAEs serve as biomarkers of robust anti-tumor immune activation that can sustain disease control after treatment cessation, and that early severe irAEs requiring discontinuation do not compromise efficacy and may even signal favorable prognosis.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies most robustly to patients with advanced melanoma receiving combination immunotherapy (nivolumab 1mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3mg/kg induction followed by nivolumab maintenance) who develop treatment-related immune-related adverse events of grade 2-4 requiring treatment modification or discontinuation. Evidence strongest for induction-phase discontinuation (within first 4 cycles/~3 months). Also supported for anti-PD1 monotherapy but with less dramatic effect sizes. Applies to cutaneous melanoma with best evidence; limited data for non-cutaneous subtypes. Effect appears independent of use of corticosteroids or infliximab for irAE management in most analyses.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Effect appears strongest for specific irAE types: cutaneous irAEs such as vitiligo-like depigmentation show particularly strong association with improved survival</li>
                <li>Combination therapy (nivo+ipi) shows more pronounced effect due to higher irAE rates (~60% grade 3-4) compared to monotherapy (~20% grade 3-4)</li>
                <li>Patients who discontinue during induction phase (median ~1.4 months, 3 doses) due to irAEs may have similar or even numerically superior outcomes (ORR 58.3% vs 50.2%) to those completing maintenance phase (median ~9.4 months)</li>
                <li>Use of high-dose systemic corticosteroids (91% of irAE-discontinuation cohort in CheckMate pooled analysis) and infliximab (10% vs 1% in controls) for irAE management does not appear to consistently compromise response durability in pooled analyses, though individual cases of progression after infliximab are reported</li>
                <li>Late-onset irAEs (occurring months to years after discontinuation) can occur but are relatively uncommon; in one series 43% of patients treated >1 year developed late irAEs but only 15% in that subgroup, suggesting cumulative risk increases with duration</li>
                <li>Patients developing irAEs during treatment with non-CR best response still benefit from irAE-response coupling, though underlying response depth remains prognostic</li>
                <li>The mechanism may involve shared immune activation pathways between anti-tumor immunity and autoimmunity, but causality versus correlation is not definitively established</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>CheckMate pooled analysis (069+067, n=407 treated with nivo+ipi): patients who discontinued during induction phase due to AEs (n=96, median 1.4 months, median 3 doses each) had ORR 58.3% (95% CI 47.8-68.3) vs 50.2% (95% CI 43.6-56.8) for those who did not discontinue due to AEs (n=233, median 9.4 months) (p=0.180); median PFS 8.4 months (95% CI 5.8-16.7) vs 10.8 months (95% CI 5.9-23.0) (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.72-1.37, p=0.966); median OS not reached in either group (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.54-1.17, p=0.2344); 18-month OS rates 67% vs 62% <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In CheckMate pooled analysis, early induction-phase discontinuation due to irAEs showed no statistically significant difference in PFS or OS despite dramatically shorter treatment duration (median 1.4 months vs 9.4 months, approximately 7-fold difference), suggesting irAEs may signal immune activation sufficient for durable benefit <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>CheckMate pooled analysis documented that among 176 patients who discontinued nivo+ipi due to treatment-related AEs at any time (median 1.5 months, median 3 nivo/3 ipi doses), outcomes were comparable to 231 who did not discontinue for AEs despite much shorter exposure; 65% vs 76% were free of subsequent systemic therapy at 12 months <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Pooled analysis of randomized phase II/III trials showed patients who discontinued combination PD-1/CTLA-4 therapy early due to irAEs had efficacy outcomes (proportion of CRs and time to response) approximately equal to those who continued treatment <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.3" class="evidence-link">[e44.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated cutaneous immune-related adverse events (particularly vitiligo-like depigmentation) in stage III-IV melanoma patients receiving immunotherapy were associated with improved survival, supporting link between irAEs and durable response <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.2" class="evidence-link">[e41.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple pooled analyses and retrospective reviews indicate that responders who stop therapy because of irAEs often maintain similar long-term survival compared with those who continue, suggesting severe irAE-driven early cessation does not necessarily compromise efficacy <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.6" class="evidence-link">[e42.6]</a> </li>
    <li>CheckMate pooled analysis showed median time to response was similar between induction-discontinued (2.7 months, range 1.9-10.3) and non-discontinued groups (2.8 months, range 1.4-17.1), and median duration of response was not reached in either group, suggesting rapid and durable responses in irAE-discontinuation cohort <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Among CheckMate pooled analysis patients, best overall response rates for induction-discontinued cohort were CR 11.5%, PR 46.9%, SD 18.8%; for non-discontinued: CR 12.0%, PR 38.2%, SD 10.7%, showing similar or higher response rates despite early cessation <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In CheckMate analysis, ongoing responders at data cutoff were 64.3% (36/56) in induction-discontinued vs 80.3% (94/117) in non-discontinued, showing majority maintained responses after early irAE-driven discontinuation <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Grade 3-4 treatment-related AEs in CheckMate pooled analysis occurred predominantly during induction phase, with time to onset: skin 2-3 weeks, GI 6-11 weeks, hepatic 8-10 weeks, endocrine 11-12 weeks, supporting early immune activation hypothesis <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Literature summary notes grade 3/4 irAEs up to ~20% with single-agent PD-1 therapy and up to 59% with combination PD-1+CTLA-4 therapy, yet pooled analyses suggest comparable survival outcomes in those discontinuing for toxicity versus continuing <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.12" class="evidence-link">[e44.12]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While irAE-outcome associations are extensively documented as prognostic biomarkers, the CheckMate pooled analysis demonstrating that early discontinuation at median 1.4 months due to irAEs produces non-inferior efficacy (HR 0.99 for PFS, p=0.966) compared to 7-fold longer treatment duration represents a novel application of this knowledge. This shifts irAEs from prognostic markers to potential therapeutic decision-making criteria for safe early cessation, supported by rigorous pooled analysis of randomized trials rather than just observational correlation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The association between irAEs and improved outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors is well-established in the literature through multiple meta-analyses showing correlations between irAE development and enhanced response rates, PFS, and OS across tumor types including melanoma.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific application to treatment duration optimization—that irAE-driven early discontinuation during induction phase (median 1.4 months, ~3 doses) yields non-inferior or potentially superior outcomes (ORR, PFS, OS) compared to full-duration therapy (median 9.4 months)—represents a novel therapeutic paradigm. This suggests irAEs can serve as active stopping signals permitting safe early discontinuation rather than merely serving as prognostic biomarkers, with the CheckMate pooled analysis providing the most robust quantitative evidence for this paradigm shift.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A prospective randomized trial comparing CR patients discontinued at 6 months versus 12 months will show non-inferior 24-month PFS rates (both in range of 82-90%) with no statistically significant difference in OS at 3-5 years.</li>
                <li>PR patients who discontinue at 12 months will have 24-month PFS rates in the range of 55-70%, intermediate between CR (85-90%) and SD (30-40%) patients.</li>
                <li>Implementation of a response-stratified protocol (≥6 months for CR, ≥18 months for PR/SD) will reduce treatment-related irAE burden by approximately 30-40% compared to universal 24-month protocols while maintaining equivalent population-level 24-month PFS.</li>
                <li>Patients who develop grade 2-3 cutaneous irAEs (particularly vitiligo) within the first 3-6 months and achieve PR or better will maintain response durability (24-month PFS ≥70%) comparable to those without irAEs who receive full 2-year therapy.</li>
                <li>In real-world implementation, approximately 25-30% of patients will be CR at one year and eligible for discontinuation at 12-15 months under a response-stratified protocol, while 50-60% with PR/SD will continue to 18-24+ months.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether molecular markers (ctDNA clearance kinetics, tumor mutation burden >20 mutations/Mb, PD-L1 expression) can further refine the 6-month threshold in CR patients to identify a subset who could safely stop at 3-4 months or conversely identify higher-risk CRs requiring longer therapy.</li>
                <li>Whether the response-duration relationship and specific thresholds (6 months CR, 18-24 months PR/SD) hold for non-cutaneous melanoma subtypes (uveal, mucosal, acral) which have different tumor biology, lower response rates, and potentially different immunotherapy kinetics.</li>
                <li>Whether combination therapy (nivo+ipi) responders, due to higher initial response rates and more robust immune activation (evidenced by higher irAE rates), can discontinue even earlier than monotherapy responders achieving similar response depths, or if the higher relapse risk with aggressive disease necessitates longer treatment.</li>
                <li>Whether patients achieving CR who discontinue at 6-12 months have significantly different long-term (5-10 year) cure rates or late relapse patterns compared to those who complete full 24-month therapy, or if survival curves converge after sufficient follow-up.</li>
                <li>Whether rechallenge with anti-PD1 therapy after progression in early-discontinuation patients (stopped at 6-12 months for CR) yields significantly different response rates, response durability, and subsequent survival compared to rechallenge after standard-duration (24-month) therapy or progression on therapy.</li>
                <li>Whether biomarker-guided discontinuation strategies using serial PET/CT metabolic response (complete metabolic response with SUV < liver), ctDNA clearance to undetectable levels, or tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte profiles can safely permit even shorter durations than radiographic CR alone and improve positive predictive value for durable remission after discontinuation.</li>
                <li>Whether the irAE-response coupling effect shows dose-response relationship (i.e., more severe irAEs predict more durable responses) or threshold effect, and whether specific irAE types (endocrine, cutaneous, hepatic, GI) have differential predictive value for duration optimization.</li>
                <li>Whether patients with PR who show deep partial responses (e.g., >90% tumor shrinkage) have durability profiles more similar to CR patients and could adopt shorter durations, or if any residual disease by RECIST mandates longer therapy regardless of response depth.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that CR patients who discontinue at 6-9 months have significantly inferior 24-month PFS (<70%) compared to historical CR cohorts or concurrent controls would fundamentally challenge the 6-month minimum threshold sufficiency and suggest longer minimum durations are required even for CR.</li>
                <li>Demonstration that CR patients treated for 18-24 months have significantly superior long-term outcomes (e.g., 5-year PFS >95% or late relapse rate <5%) compared to those stopping at 6-12 months (e.g., 5-year PFS 75-80% or late relapse rate 15-20%) would challenge the assertion that durations beyond 6 months provide no incremental benefit in CR and suggest optimal duration may be longer even for complete responders.</li>
                <li>Evidence that PR patients who continue therapy beyond 24 months (e.g., to 36 months) have substantially lower relapse rates (e.g., 24-month post-treatment PFS >80%) compared to those stopping at 12-18 months (post-treatment PFS 50-70%) would challenge the adequacy of proposed 18-24 month durations for PR patients and suggest even longer therapy may be beneficial.</li>
                <li>Finding that development of irAEs is associated with shorter time to progression after discontinuation, higher relapse rates (e.g., >40% at 24 months), or inferior OS despite initial response would fundamentally challenge the immune activation-durability coupling theory and suggest irAEs may compromise long-term disease control.</li>
                <li>Data showing that ctDNA-positive CR patients at time of discontinuation have substantially worse outcomes (e.g., 24-month PFS <60%) compared to ctDNA-negative CR patients (24-month PFS >90%), with ctDNA status independent of treatment duration, would challenge the sufficiency of radiographic CR alone and suggest molecular disease persistence requires longer therapy or different approaches regardless of imaging response.</li>
                <li>Evidence that SD patients who receive extended therapy (e.g., 30-36 months) have dramatically improved outcomes approaching those of PR patients would challenge the inherent prognostic limitation of SD as a response category and suggest very prolonged therapy can overcome initial poor response depth.</li>
                <li>Finding that use of high-dose corticosteroids or immunosuppression for irAE management consistently compromises response durability (e.g., reducing 24-month PFS from 70% to <50% in matched cohorts) would challenge the current paradigm that aggressive irAE treatment does not impair anti-tumor immunity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The mechanism by which approximately 8% of PR patients in KEYNOTE-006 converted to CR after discontinuation of therapy is not explained by static radiographic response assessment alone and may involve continued immune-mediated tumor clearance, delayed tumor necrosis/fibrosis becoming apparent on imaging, or ongoing T-cell memory function eliminating residual microscopic disease. <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.1" class="evidence-link">[e44.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.3" class="evidence-link">[e43.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The observation that some patients (approximately 10-15% in various cohorts) maintain durable responses for years after very short treatment durations (<6 months, sometimes even 1-3 months in irAE-discontinuation cohorts) challenges the necessity of minimum duration thresholds for all patients and suggests existence of a subset with rapid establishment of immune memory or complete early tumor antigen elimination. <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-40.html#e40.0" class="evidence-link">[e40.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The mechanistic basis for why specific response depths (CR vs PR vs SD) correlate with durability after discontinuation—whether this reflects extent of tumor antigen elimination, quality/quantity of memory T-cell responses, degree of immune checkpoint axis remodeling, or tumor microenvironment restructuring—requires validation through correlative immunologic and molecular studies. </li>
    <li>Patient-specific risk factors (younger age identified in e40.0, baseline elevated LDH in e40.0, history of brain metastases in e40.0) that modify relapse risk within response categories are identified in real-world analyses but are not yet integrated into validated risk-stratification algorithms or formally tested interaction terms for duration optimization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-40.html#e40.0" class="evidence-link">[e40.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Cross-histology differences requiring mechanistic explanation: why cutaneous melanoma may permit substantially shorter durations for responders (6-12 months for CR) than NSCLC (where CheckMate-153 suggested continuous treatment superiority to 1-year fixed duration) is not mechanistically explained and may reflect differences in tumor immunogenicity, mutation burden, antigen heterogeneity, or metastatic site biology. <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.11" class="evidence-link">[e44.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.4" class="evidence-link">[e43.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.0" class="evidence-link">[e41.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The observation that some patients with residual radiographic lesions at discontinuation (classified as PR or SD) nonetheless maintain long-term disease control raises questions about whether all visible lesions represent viable tumor versus treated tumor remnants (fibrosis, necrosis, inflammation), and whether advanced imaging (PET/CT) or biopsy confirmation should be incorporated into response assessment for discontinuation decisions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.5" class="evidence-link">[e46.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The finding that retreatment response rates after progression post-discontinuation vary widely across studies (from 15% to >50%) is not fully explained, and factors determining retreatment efficacy (time off therapy, reason for initial discontinuation, sites of progression, intervening therapies) are not systematically characterized. <a href="../results/extraction-result-42.html#e42.5" class="evidence-link">[e42.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.6" class="evidence-link">[e46.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.0" class="evidence-link">[e39.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Limited-duration cohort (6 months total treatment, n=40 in e45.5) reporting PFS of 12 months provides provocative signal for very short courses but lacks detail on patient selection, response assessment timing, and long-term outcomes that would explain apparent efficacy with minimal exposure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.5" class="evidence-link">[e45.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The mechanism and predictors of late-onset irAEs (occurring months to years after discontinuation, documented in e43.6 with 57.3% probability of irAE by 24 months) and whether late irAEs also correlate with continued anti-tumor immunity or represent distinct phenomena are not fully elucidated. <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.6" class="evidence-link">[e43.6]</a> </li>
    <li>The observation that patients treated in later lines of therapy (second-line or beyond) have worse outcomes with early discontinuation is documented but mechanism unclear—whether this reflects tumor selection for immune resistance, immune exhaustion from prior therapies, or different disease biology—and optimal durations for later-line therapy are not specifically defined. <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.7" class="evidence-link">[e46.7]</a> </li>
