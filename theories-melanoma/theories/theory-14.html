                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the optimal duration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma, and whether it differs by degree of response, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Optimal anti-PD-1 duration is determined by a shifting balance between diminishing relapse-reduction and escalating risk of late immune toxicities, financial burden, and compromised quality of life (QoL). There exists a 'plateau zone' (typically 6–12 months in CRs, 12–24 in PR/SD), beyond which extended therapy neither significantly reduces relapse nor prevents late irAEs, many of which arise off-treatment; overtreatment increases late cost/toxicity without added benefit.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Late-Onset Adverse Events Plateau with Prolonged Therapy</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The probability of developing new or persistent moderate-to-severe immune-related adverse events rises with cumulative duration of anti-PD-1 and plateaus beyond 12–24 months, but late irAEs may occur off-treatment and are not eliminated by early discontinuation.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Patients with melanoma treated with anti-PD-1 (monotherapy ± CTLA-4), irrespective of line, response category, or treatment setting; focused on late toxicity patterns (≥1 year to >6 months post-discontinuation).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Combination therapy (nivo+ipi) has substantially higher acute/early toxicity hazard.</li>
                <li>Endocrine, rheumatologic, and cutaneous irAEs can persist for years after cessation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>Pooled analyses: even patients discontinuing early (median exposure 1–2 months) develop delayed/persistent toxicity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.0" class="evidence-link">[e68.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.4" class="evidence-link">[e52.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.5" class="evidence-link">[e55.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Guidelines recommend vigilance for irAEs long after cessation; no treatment duration eliminates late toxicity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-57.html#e57.0" class="evidence-link">[e57.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory extends existing toxicity awareness by assigning a non-linear, plateau-based relationship to duration effects and integrating with cost/QoL.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Late irAEs, cost, and QoL impacts are recognized; however, curve-plateau analysis and definition of a toxicity-cost equilibrium zone for duration is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly formalizes a 'plateau zone' for toxicity-risk with diminishing benefit and persisting off-drug risk, guiding duration choice by equilibrium principles.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Marginal Relapse Reduction with Prolonged Therapy</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Extending anti-PD-1 therapy beyond 6–12 months in CR or 12–24 months in PR/SD yields only marginal further reduction in relapse; this benefit is generally outweighed by increasing cost, toxicity, and risk of late irAEs unless high-risk features predict imminent relapse.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Advanced/metastatic melanoma (unresectable stage III/IV) receiving anti-PD-1 monotherapy; applies to patients achieving durable disease control; excludes patients with aggressive biology or residual high-risk features.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>High-risk features (active brain mets, high LDH, poor PS) may justify extended therapy.</li>
                <li>Situations requiring time-limited therapy for logistic/financial reasons may prioritize earlier elective discontinuation.</li>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Extending anti-PD-1 therapy in CR patients from 12 months to 2 years will not yield a significant reduction in 3-year relapse rates.</li>
                <li>Patients discontinuing at 6–12 months (CR/major PR) will experience similar rates of late irAEs post-discontinuation as those continuing longer.</li>
                <li>Ongoing therapy past the plateau point will increase financial burden and treatment fatigue more than it decreases relapse risk.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Ultra-short duration anti-PD-1 (≤3 months) may be sufficient for selected CRs if the equilibrium zone is reached earlier based on biomarkers.</li>
                <li>Adjusting therapy duration based on individual toxicity-risk algorithms may allow safe de-escalation below current clinical minima.</li>
                <li>Integration of QoL/patient-reported outcome metrics into stopping decisions will not compromise progression-free survival but improve population-level well-being.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Randomized controlled trial shows that CR/PR patients treated for 2 years have numerically lower late irAE incidence than those stopping at 6–12 months.</li>
                <li>Extending therapy beyond identified plateau zone results in step-wise further reduction in relapse without additional toxicity.</li>
                <li>Large-scale biomarker studies find no plateau in relapse risk reduction with duration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
