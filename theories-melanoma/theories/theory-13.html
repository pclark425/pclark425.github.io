                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the optimal duration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma, and whether it differs by degree of response, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The optimal duration of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma should be tailored to the depth of treatment response, as substantiated by aggregate clinical trial and real-world data. Complete responders (CR) can discontinue anti-PD-1 after a minimal treatment threshold (approximately 6 months after CR, with at least two additional cycles), maintaining high durable remission rates, while non-CR (PR/SD) patients require longer therapy (≥12-18 months) to minimize relapse. Therapy beyond these durations yields diminishing returns in relapse prevention and escalates risk/cost. Biomarker evidence (PET/biopsy) can assist in safely adapting these durations.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Minimal Effective Duration for Complete Responders</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In unresectable/metastatic melanoma, patients achieving radiographically confirmed CR on anti-PD-1 monotherapy who receive at least 6 months of therapy (including ≥2 doses post-CR) can safely discontinue therapy with 2-year relapse rates ≈10–15%, comparable to longer treatment.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Adults with unresectable stage III/IV melanoma receiving first- or second-line anti-PD-1 monotherapy (nivolumab/pembrolizumab), with radiological CR sustained for ≥6 months and at least two additional treatments post-CR; excluding high-risk groups (CNS metastases, high LDH, very early CR).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Patients with active CNS metastases, high LDH, or rapid baseline progression may not safely follow this rule without additional validation.</li>
                <li>PET-negative partial responders or negative biopsy for residual disease after PR may be considered equivalent to CR for discontinuation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>KEYNOTE-001/006/protocol amendment: CR patients stopping after ≥6 months and ≥2 cycles post-CR had 2-year PFS 87–90%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.1" class="evidence-link">[e50.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.1" class="evidence-link">[e56.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-49.html#e49.1" class="evidence-link">[e49.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.1" class="evidence-link">[e52.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.1" class="evidence-link">[e54.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.3" class="evidence-link">[e56.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.5" class="evidence-link">[e58.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.4" class="evidence-link">[e58.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Real-world cohorts/observational data (Jansen, van Zeijl, Warner/Betof Warner): elective discontinuation after 6–12 months CR yielded 2-year relapse rates ≈10–15%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.2" class="evidence-link">[e56.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.2" class="evidence-link">[e50.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.3" class="evidence-link">[e55.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.2" class="evidence-link">[e55.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Guidelines (SITC, NCCN, ESMO) recognize CR-based elective discontinuation — especially after 6 months — as reasonable, though not formally mandated without more evidence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-57.html#e57.0" class="evidence-link">[e57.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.5" class="evidence-link">[e56.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Retrospective and post-hoc analyses (KEYNOTE-006): Among CRs who completed two years or stopped early after ≥6 months, 2-year PFS was high and not statistically different. <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.1" class="evidence-link">[e55.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-49.html#e49.0" class="evidence-link">[e49.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.2" class="evidence-link">[e52.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.2" class="evidence-link">[e54.2]</a> </li>
    <li>PET/CT-guided, biopsy-negative PRs have EFS similar to radiographic CRs; PET-negative PRs may discontinue safely. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.5" class="evidence-link">[e52.5]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 1: Relapse Risk Gradient and Extended Duration for Non-CR</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Partial responders (PR) and stable disease (SD) patients who discontinue anti-PD-1 therapy before 12–18 months experience substantially higher post-discontinuation relapse rates (24-month PFS: PR ≈53–68%, SD ≈31–50%) compared to CRs; optimal relapse risk reduction generally requires ≥12–18 months of therapy in these groups.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Adults with unresectable/metastatic (stage III/IV) melanoma on anti-PD-1 monotherapy whose best RECIST response is PR or SD; applies to first-line and later-line therapy.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>PET/biopsy-negative PRs (metabolic/pathologic CR) may be safely discontinued earlier, similar to CR patients.</li>
                <li>Late-line/previously treated patients may need even longer therapy due to increased relapse risk.</li>
                <li>Very favorable biomarkers (e.g. ctDNA negativity) may justify shorter duration, but require validation.</li>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a randomized trial, CR patients who stop anti-PD-1 at ≥6 months post-CR will have non-inferior 2-year PFS compared to those treated for 2 years, provided CNS/LDH exclusion.</li>
                <li>PR/SD patients who discontinue before 1 year will have higher rates of relapse (>30%) at 2 years than those treated ≥18 months.</li>
                <li>Implementing PET/biopsy-driven discontinuation for PRs with metabolic/pathological CRs will result in comparable relapse rates to radiographic CRs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>ctDNA negativity after 6–9 months will allow even earlier or biomarker-adapted discontinuation in both CR and deep PR patients.</li>
                <li>Ultra-short therapy (<6 months) in exceptional CRs (highly inflamed/biomarker-favorable) will yield relapse rates comparable to standard minimal durations.</li>
                <li>Retreatment of PR/SD patients relapsing after elective 1-year discontinuation will salvage the majority, reducing OS penalty versus continuous therapy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A prospective randomized trial shows CR patients stopping at ≥6 months have significantly higher relapse rates (>30% at 2 years) than those treated longer.</li>
                <li>Non-CR (PR/SD) patients stopping at <1 year have the same relapse risk as CRs, refuting the duration-risk gradient.</li>
                <li>PET/biopsy-negative PRs who discontinue early experience unexpectedly high relapse rates, undermining biomarker adaptation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Patients with CNS metastases, elevated post-PD-1 LDH, or aggressive biology have persistently higher relapse even after the minimum durations recommended. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.3" class="evidence-link">[e58.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Delayed immune-related adverse events (late irAEs), including those occurring months after short treatment exposures, are not predicted by response or duration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.5" class="evidence-link">[e54.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-63.html#e63.0" class="evidence-link">[e63.0]</a> </li>
