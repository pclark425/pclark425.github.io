                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Efficacy outcomes seemed similar between patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment because of AEs during the induction phase and those who did not discontinue because of aEs, suggesting that many patients may continue to derive benefit from combination therapy even after discontinuation.</p>
