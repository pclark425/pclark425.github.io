The enhanced T-cell infiltration required tumor antigen expression (gp100) — gp100-negative tumors did not show increased T-cell trafficking after PLX4720. VEGF downregulation is necessary but not sufficient (anti-VEGF reproduced only part of the effect). Overexpression of VEGF in tumors abrogated the PLX4720-induced T-cell infiltration. The combination does not directly address known molecular mechanisms of acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance (e.g., MAPK re-activation via NRAS, COT, RAF switch), which may still emerge.</td>
