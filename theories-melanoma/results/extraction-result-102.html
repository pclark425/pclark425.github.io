                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive and obstinate skin cancer with poor prognosis. Variant novel applicable regimens have emerged during the past decades intensively, while the most profound approaches are oncogene-targeted therapy and T-lymphocyte mediated immunotherapy. Although targeted therapies generated remarkable and rapid clinical responses in the majority of patients, acquired resistance was developed promptly within months leading to tumor relapse. By contrast, immunotherapies elicited long-term tumor regression. However, the overall response rate was limited. In view of the above, either targeted therapy or immunotherapy cannot elicit durable clinical responses in large range of patients. Interestingly, the advantages and limitations of these regimens happened to be complementary. An increasing number of preclinical studies and clinical trials proved a synergistic antitumor effect with the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, implying a promising prospect for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In order to achieve a better therapeutic effectiveness and reduce toxicity in patients, great efforts need to be made to illuminate multifaceted interplay between targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>
