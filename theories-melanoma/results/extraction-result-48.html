                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A multistakeholder taskforce was convened—consisting of experts in cancer immunotherapy from academia, industry, and government—to generate consensus clinical definitions for resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibitors in three distinct scenarios: primary resistance, secondary resistance, and progression after treatment discontinuation.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> As the field of cancer immunotherapy continues to advance at a fast pace, treatment approaches and drug development are evolving rapidly to maximize patient benefit. New agents are commonly evaluated for activity in patients who had previously received a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor as standard of care or in an investigational study. However, because of the kinetics and patterns of response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and the lack of consistency in the clinical definitions of resistance to therapy, the design of clinical trials of new agents and interpretation of results remains an important challenge. To address this unmet need, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer convened a multistakeholder taskforce—consisting of experts in cancer immunotherapy from academia, industry, and government—to generate consensus clinical definitions for resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibitors in three distinct scenarios: primary resistance, secondary resistance, and progression after treatment discontinuation. The taskforce generated consensus on several key issues such as the timeframes that delineate each type of resistance, the necessity for confirmatory scans, and identified caveats for each specific resistance classification. The goal of this effort is to provide guidance for clinical trial design and to support analyses of emerging molecular and cellular data surrounding mechanisms of resistance.</p>

(3) Secondary resistance: progression ≥6 months from treatment initiation while still on therapy; confirmatory imaging recommended (4–12 weeks) in some working groups. (4) For adjuvant/neoadjuvant/discontinuation settings: use a 12-week cutoff after last dose to separate 'early' (≤12 weeks, considered resistant per above definitions) vs 'late' (>12 weeks, may respond to rechallenge) relapse; recommend biopsy to confirm recurrence in adjuvant setting rather than radiographic confirmation. (5) For neoadjuvant therapy: pathological major response prior to surgery → if recurrence later, treat as secondary resistance; lack of pathological response → treat as primary resistance. (6) Apply the definitions broadly to solid tumors but allow histology-specific caveats (e.g., indolent tumors or rapidly progressing histologies like small cell lung cancer). (7) The taskforce emphasized these are definitions for clinical trial design and NOT prescriptive treatment-duration recommendations; they must be validated with empirical data.</td>

It acknowledges uncertainty about whether shorter durations are safe for complete responders and recommends that patients who progress >12 weeks after stopping therapy may retain a meaningful chance of responding to rechallenge; exceptions are noted for indolent tumor types and that further data (including retrospective and prospective analyses) are required to validate or revise the timing thresholds.</td>
