                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is indicated that anti-PD-1 treatment might provide a significant survival benefit in patients with melanoma and that patients treated with nivolumab reported significantly fewer treatment-related adverse events than those treated with other agents.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Antibodies targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) help prevent tumor cells from escaping immune-mediated destruction. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to gain insight into the efficacy of PD-1 antibodies for the treatment of melanoma. Five trials involving 2,828 adult patients were included in this meta-analysis. In patients with previously untreated or refractory melanoma, treatment with PD-1 antibodies significantly improved the six-month progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.50–0.60, P<0.00001) and the overall response rate (OR 3.89, 95% CI 3.12–4.83, P<0.00001). This meta-analysis indicated that anti-PD-1 treatment might provide a significant survival benefit in patients with melanoma. In addition, we found that patients treated with nivolumab reported significantly fewer treatment-related adverse events (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57–0.97, P = 0.03) than those treated with other agents, but there was a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of adverse events in patients treated with pembrolizumab.</p>
