                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Malignancies represent a persisting worldwide health burden. Tumor treatment is commonly based on surgical and/or non-surgical therapies. In the recent decade, novel non-surgical treatment strategies involving monoclonal antibodies (mAB) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been successfully incorporated into standard treatment algorithms. Such emerging therapy concepts have demonstrated improved complete remission rates and prolonged progression-free survival compared to conventional chemotherapies. However, the in-toto surgical tumor resection followed by reconstructive surgery oftentimes remains the only curative therapy. Breast cancer (BC), skin cancer (SC), head and neck cancer (HNC), and sarcoma amongst other cancer entities commonly require reconstructive surgery to restore form, aesthetics, and functionality. Understanding the basic principles, strengths, and limitations of mAB and ICI as (neo-) adjuvant therapies and treatment alternatives for resectable or unresectable tumors is paramount for optimized surgical therapy planning. Yet, there is a scarcity of studies that condense the current body of literature on mAB and ICI for BC, SC, HNC, and sarcoma. This knowledge gap may result in suboptimal treatment planning, ultimately impairing patient outcomes. Herein, we aim to summarize the current translational endeavors focusing on mAB and ICI. This line of research may serve as an evidence-based fundament to guide targeted therapy and optimize interdisciplinary anti-cancer strategies.</p>
