                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The optimal duration of ICIs therapy is discussed to help guide clinical work based on the literature, as reported, immunotherapy response patterns, immune-related adverse events and tumor stages are all related to the diversity of ICI duration in previous researches.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Immunotherapy, represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has made a revolutionary difference in the treatment of malignant tumors, and considerably extended patients’ overall survival (OS). In the world medical profession, however, there still reaches no clear consensus on the optimal duration of ICIs therapy. As reported, immunotherapy response patterns, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and tumor stages are all related to the diversity of ICIs duration in previous researches. Besides, there lacks clear clinical guidance on the intermittent or continuous use of ICIs. This review aims to discuss the optimal duration of ICIs, hoping to help guide clinical work based on the literature.</p>
