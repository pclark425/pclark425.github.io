                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Efficacy outcomes seemed similar between patients who discontinued nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment because of AEs during the induction phase and those who did not discontinue because of aEs, suggesting that many patients may continue to derive benefit from combination therapy even after discontinuation.</p>

However, authors caution interpretation because of retrospective design, confounding (patients who discontinued had fewer with M1c disease and lower LDH), relatively short follow-up, and inability to separate effects of treatment duration from presence of immune-related AEs as a biomarker of response. Therefore the paper supports the possibility that shorter duration can still yield durable responses in some patients but does not provide definitive evidence to change practice.</td>
