                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract. Melanoma is a type of skin cancerous tumor that develops from melanocytes and often appears on the skin's surface, however it can also spread to other areas like the eyes and mucous membranes. Research on it has made significant progress in recent years. Immunotherapy has become an important means of treating melanoma. The use of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has achieved significant success, so some patients have achieved long-term survival. benefit. Secondly, there have been breakthroughs in targeted therapeutic drugs targeting specific molecular targets such as BRAF and MEK. It has the ability to successfully stop melanoma cells from growing and spreading. Despite significant advances in immunotherapy and targeted therapies, drug resistance remains a serious problem; metastasis of melanoma is one of the main causes of its lethality, but little is known about how melanoma cells metastasize to other organs There are still many unanswered questions about the mechanism. This article compares the benefits of immune-targeted combination therapy with immunotherapy alone. It also immunotherapy and targeted therapy alone. It comes to the conclusion that combination therapy is the best course of action. The mechanism of action, effectiveness and drawbacks of drug resistance of the targeted therapy drug Vemurafenib were also introduced, further confirming the 1+1>2 treatment plan. Combination therapy provides new ideas for future cancer medicine, but the drug resistance of some targets needs to be solved, and subsequent research can focus on the development of new targets.</p>
