                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This decade has brought significantly improved out-comes for patients with advanced melanoma with immunotherapies and targeted treatments offering utility in a variety of settings. In 2020, we can hope for durable long-term responses, and complete remission in a subset of patients with metastatic disease. In the adjuvant setting, approximately 50% improvements in recurrence-free survival are seen both with targeted and immunotherapies. Early data from neoadjuvant immunotherapy clinical trials are very promising. However, responses to treatment are heterogeneous and not always durable; further advances are required, and several emerging strategies are of particular interest. We review the systemic treatment of melanoma, discussing the treatment of unresectable stage III–IV and recurrent disease, outlining curative treatment of cutaneous melanoma in the adjuvant setting and briefly discussing neoadjuvant systemic therapies for advanced melanoma.</p>
