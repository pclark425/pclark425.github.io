                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The results suggest that secondary resistance to immunotherapies can arise upon selection for new oncogenic variants that mediate T cell exclusion, and similar evaluation for the emergence of tumor-intrinsic alterations in resistant lesions should be done prospectively at the time of relapse.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> BackgroundWhile cancer immunotherapies including checkpoint blockade antibodies, adoptive T cell therapy, and even some vaccines have given rise to major clinical responses with durability in many cases, a subset of patients who initially respond subsequently develop secondary resistance to therapy. Tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of acquired immunotherapy resistance are incompletely understood.MethodsBaseline and treatment-resistant tumors underwent molecular analysis via transcriptional profiling or genomic sequencing for oncogenic alterations and histologic analysis for T cell infiltration to investigate mechanisms contributing to T cell exclusion and acquired resistance to immunotherapy.ResultsWe describe two patients with metastatic melanoma who initially showed a durable partial response to either a melanoma-peptide/interleukin-12 vaccine or combined anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-1 therapy, but subsequently developed new treatment-resistant metastases. In the first case, the recurrent tumor showed new robust tumor expression of β-catenin, whereas in the second case genomic sequencing revealed acquired PTEN loss. Both cases were associated with loss of T cell infiltration, and both pathways have been mechanistically linked to immune resistance preclinically.ConclusionOur results suggest that secondary resistance to immunotherapies can arise upon selection for new oncogenic variants that mediate T cell exclusion. To identify the spectrum of underlying mechanisms of therapeutic resistance, similar evaluation for the emergence of tumor-intrinsic alterations in resistant lesions should be done prospectively at the time of relapse in a range of additional patients developing secondary resistance.</p>
