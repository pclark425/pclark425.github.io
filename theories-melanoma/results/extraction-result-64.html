The study shows that persistent control (tumor burden <20% increase from baseline) correlates with better OS, but does not provide data on safety or relapse after early discontinuation in complete responders or on stopping rules by response. Pseudoprogression cases demonstrate that some patients can respond after confirmed irPD and after several months (responses observed at 3 to 22 months), implying that extending therapy beyond initial progression may be beneficial in a small subset; however, pseudoprogression was uncommon (~4%) and the authors caution that the 20% threshold will misclassify a minority who later respond. Overall, the paper does not supply direct evidence to support shorter durations for CRs or definitive discontinuation rules by response category.</td>
