                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> This work presents the case of a 75-year-old man with metastatic melanoma who underwent 95 cycles of nivolumab without significant treatment-related toxicities or progression and suggests the optimal duration of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) agents in patients with good tolerance and no progression.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The treatment of metastatic melanoma changed dramatically with the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Patients face prolonged exposure to these agents, which can frequently generate a large spectrum of adverse reactions. It has been shown that a considerable number of patients treated with ICIs achieve a durable response to treatment that is maintained even after cessation. We present the case of a 75-year-old man with metastatic melanoma who underwent 95 cycles of nivolumab without significant treatment-related toxicities or progression. Future studies are needed to deﬁne more clearly the optimal duration of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) agents in patients with good tolerance and no progression. Patients could avoid discomfort caused by frequent physician visits, high additional costs, and possible adverse reactions that may occur after such a long period of exposure to immunotherapy.</p>
