                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is concluded that neural rosette development is a relevant experimental 2D in-vitro model of morphogenesis because it is a multi-scale self-organization process that involves both cell differentiation and tissue development.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Neural rosettes develop from the self-organization of differentiating human pluripotent stem cells. This process mimics the emergence of the embryonic central nervous system primordium, i.e., the neural tube, whose formation is under close investigation as errors during such process result in severe diseases like spina bifida and anencephaly. While neural tube formation is recognized as an example of self-organization, we still do not understand the fundamental mechanisms guiding the process. Here, we discuss the different theoretical frameworks that have been proposed to explain self-organization in morphogenesis. We show that an explanation based exclusively on stem cell differentiation cannot describe the emergence of spatial organization, and an explanation based on patterning models cannot explain how different groups of cells can collectively migrate and produce the mechanical transformations required to generate the neural tube. We conclude that neural rosette development is a relevant experimental 2D in-vitro model of morphogenesis because it is a multi-scale self-organization process that involves both cell differentiation and tissue development. Ultimately, to understand rosette formation, we first need to fully understand the complex interplay between growth, migration, cytoarchitecture organization, and cell type evolution.</p>
