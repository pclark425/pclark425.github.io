                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It was indicated that homozygous mutant variants (Gln/Gln) of XPD were associated with increased lung cancer risk, whereas TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was not associated with risk of lung cancer among Bangladeshi patients.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Tumor suppressor gene (TP53) is considered as the most frequently mutated gene in almost all forms of human cancer. Moreover, genetic variations in the XPD gene affect the DNA repair capacity increasing cancer susceptibility. Polymorphisms within these genes can play a major role in determining individual lung cancer susceptibility. However, several studies have investigated this possibility; but reported conflicting results. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the role of TP53 Arg72Pro and XPD Lys751Gln gene polymorphisms on lung cancer susceptibility in the Bangladeshi population. Materials and Methods: Study subjects comprised of 180 lung cancer patients and 200 healthy volunteers. Genetic polymorphism of TP53 was determined by multiplex PCR-based method, while XPD genotypes were analyzed using Polymerase Chain Reaction-based Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Lung cancer risk was estimated as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: From the results, no significant association between TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and lung cancer risk was observed. Whereas, patients with homozygous mutant variants (Gln/Gln) of XPD at codon 751 were found significantly associated with lung cancer risk when compared to the control (OR=3.58; 95% CI=1.58-8.09; p=0.002). Lung cancer risk was found significantly higher with Gln/Gln variants of XPD among smokers (OR=4.03; 95% CI=1.11-14.63; p=0.026). Significant increased risk of lung cancer was found with Arg/Pro genotypes of TP53, Lys/Gln and Gln/Gln variants of XPD in individuals with family history of cancer (OR=3.44; 95% CI=1.36-8.72; p=0.011; OR=3.17; 95% CI=1.20-8.39; p=0.024; OR=16.35; 95% CI=0.92-289.5; p=0.007, respectively). Conclusion: The findings indicated that homozygous mutant variants (Gln/Gln) of XPD were associated with increased lung cancer risk, whereas TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was not associated with risk of lung cancer among Bangladeshi patients.</p>
