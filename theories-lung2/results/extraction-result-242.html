                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Thymomas are rare neoplasms of the thymus and are often associated with immune-mediated paraneoplastic syndromes, most commonly, myasthenia gravis. The same underlying mechanism can produce antibodies to other self-antigens in various organ systems. Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare complication of thymoma. We present a 35-year-old healthy male, initially thought to have drug-induced liver injury, who was subsequently diagnosed with thymoma-induced autoimmune hepatitis, a rare syndrome of which only two previous cases have been reported.</p>
