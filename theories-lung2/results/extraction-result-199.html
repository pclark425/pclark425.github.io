                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background: Thymomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors which represent the most frequent tumor of 
the anterior mediastinum. 
Aims: To describe the clinical, histological, surgical and oncological characteristics of a cohort of patients 
with a diagnosis of thymoma surgically treated in two centers in Argentina and to evaluate the possibility 
of retrospectively implementing the 8th edition of TNM staging. 
Materials and Methods: 180 patients with thymoma surgically treated over a period of 41 years were 
studied. The following variables were analysed: age, sex, presence of myasthenia gravis at diagnosis, 
Masaoka staging (1994), TNM staging of thymus tumors, Histological classification (WHO 2015), 
neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy, post-operative radiation treatment and clinical evolution of 
myasthenia gravis defined according to the modified Osserman classification. 
Results: 96 men and 84 women were analysed. Median age 51 years (range 13-85). 85% of the patients 
analysed came from the public sphere. When analysing the institutional distribution by Masaoaka-Koga 
stage and TNM, a higher proportion of stages I was observed for both staging systems. Most myasthenic 
patients belonged to the WHO B2 histological classification (49%, p=0.04) and 15 patients received 
neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgery to improve the chances of resection, most of them classified as stages 
III of Masaoka (p=0.002) or IIIa of the TNM stage (p=0.001). 74 (46%) cases received post-operative RT 
when they presented Masaoka Koga stages II (p=0.000) and IIIa or more advanced TNM staging (p=0.000). 
76% of the patients presented remission or stability of symptoms after surgical treatment and only 3/6 died 
due to myasthenic crisis in the immediate post-operative period. 
Conclusion: As reported in the literature, we have observed a higher frequency of B2 thymomas and their 
association with Myasthenia gravis. The histological criteria of the WHO 2015 classification, based on the 
ITMIG recommendations, favour precision in the definition of subtypes. The retrospective implementation 
of the 8th edition of TNM staging highlights the need to standardize protocols for pathological and surgical 
studies.</p>

The authors emphasize that thymectomy led to remission or stability in 76% of patients with follow-up (38+22 = 60/101 = 59%? — the paper states 76% remission or stability overall; note numbers: 38 remission + 22 stability = 60/101 = 59.4% — the paper text states 76% elsewhere for overall cohort; this indicates some inconsistency in reported denominators).
