                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) representing the most aggressive subtype. Standard treatments have not changed in decades, and the 5-year survival rate has remained <7%. Genomic analyses have identified key driver mutations of SCLC that were subsequently validated in animal models of SCLC. To provide better treatment options, a deeper understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying SCLC initiation, progression, metastasis, and acquisition of resistance is required. In this review, we describe the genetic landscape of SCLC, features of the cell of origin, and targeted therapeutic approaches.</p>
