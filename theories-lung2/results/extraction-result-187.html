                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Alopecia areata in the patient had developed in association with thymoma and was recovered rapidly after thymectomy, and her hairless patches were completely recovered 3 months afterThymectomy without being recurred 3 years after Thymectomy.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alopecia areata is a chronic organ-specific autoimmune disease and it could be associated with other autoimmune diseases. We, herein, report a case of alopecia areata in a patient with a thymoma without myasthenia gravis. Multiple hairless patches rapidly developed 6 weeks before the first visit on the patient who had been newly diagnosed with thymoma 2 weeks before the hairless patches occurred, and thymectomy was done 2 weeks before visiting dermatologic department. She had no symptoms associated with myasthenia gravis, and there were no abnormal findings on neurologic exams and acetylcholine receptor autoantibody was not detected in serum. Scalp biopsy showed numerous lymphocytic inflammations around hair follicles and in immunohistochemical staining, the aggregation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed around hair follicles and FoxP3+ T lymphocytes were rarely observed around hair follicles. The patient refused any treatment and her hairless patches were completely recovered 3 months after thymectomy, without being recurred 3 years after thymectomy. On the basis of both clinical manifestations and histologic findings, we concluded that alopecia areata in the patient had developed in association with thymoma and was recovered rapidly after thymectomy.</p>
