                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is shown that the emergence of spatio-temporal activity sequences requires: (1) individual neurons preferentially project a small fraction of their axons in a specific direction, and (2) the preferential projection direction of neighboring neurons is similar.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Spatio-temporal sequences of neuronal activity are observed in many brain regions in a variety of tasks and are thought to form the basis of meaningful behavior. However, mechanisms by which a neuronal network can generate spatio-temporal activity sequences have remained obscure. Existing models are biologically untenable because they either require manual embedding of a feedforward network within a random network or supervised learning to train the connectivity of a network to generate sequences. Here, we propose a biologically plausible, generative rule to create spatio-temporal activity sequences in a network of spiking neurons with distance-dependent connectivity. We show that the emergence of spatio-temporal activity sequences requires: (1) individual neurons preferentially project a small fraction of their axons in a specific direction, and (2) the preferential projection direction of neighboring neurons is similar. Thus, an anisotropic but correlated connectivity of neuron groups suffices to generate spatio-temporal activity sequences in an otherwise random neuronal network model.</p>

Hebbian and anti-Hebbian unsupervised plasticity can build feedforward chains in small recurrent networks but, according to cited work, may isolate the learned feedforward module from the rest of the network unless plasticity is manually turned off. Supervised learning/echo-state training can impose arbitrary temporal sequences but require training. Short-term synaptic depression and spike-frequency adaptation change effective synaptic drive or neuron excitability over short times and can destabilize spatial bumps, producing moving bumps; these are intrinsic, transient mechanisms rather than long-term structural changes. Neuromodulators (e.g., dopamine, acetylcholine) can potentiate or suppress synapses in spatial patches, creating transient effective asymmetric connectivity.</td>
