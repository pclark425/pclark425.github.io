                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare mediastinal neoplasms arising from thymic epithelial cells, and the presence of synchronous or metachronous primary thymic neoplasms in a single patient is an extremely rare event. Thymoma patients appear to have an inherent predisposition toward developing additional neoplasms. This additionally presents a diagnostic challenge, revealing the importance of multidisciplinary expertise to the management of these patients. This is a case report of a patient with a thymoma and thymic carcinoma, submitted to surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy.</p>
