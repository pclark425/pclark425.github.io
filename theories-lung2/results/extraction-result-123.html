                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A decrease in lung cancer risk, although not significant, was found in people who switched from non-filter brands to filter brands and from dark to light tobacco and in smokers who reduced their daily consumption of cigarettes by more than 25% as compared to smokers who had not changed habits.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Data from a case-control study on lung cancer were used to evaluate how changes in cigarette habits, mainly smoking cessation, switch from non-filter to filter brands, from dark to light tobacco, or from handrolled to manufactured cigarettes, and reduction in daily consumption influence lung cancer risk. The results presented concern all males, exclusive cigarette smokers, involved in the study, i.e. 1,057 histologically confirmed lung cancer and 1,503 matched controls. The general decrease in lung cancer risk with the years since cessation was also found in each subgroup of cigarette exposure defined by duration of smoking, daily consumption and type of cigarettes smoked. Among smokers who had given up smoking from less than 10 years earlier, the lung cancer risks were two-fold higher for those who had stopped smoking for coughing or health reasons than for those who had stopped smoking for reasons other than health problems. A decrease in lung cancer risk, although not significant, was found in people who switched from non-filter brands to filter brands and from dark to light tobacco and in smokers who reduced their daily consumption of cigarettes by more than 25% as compared to smokers who had not changed habits.</p>
