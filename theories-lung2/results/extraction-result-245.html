                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Thymic epithelial tumors (TETs), including thymomas and thymic carcinomas, are rare malignancies arising from the thymus gland. The optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Standard first-line systemic treatment involves cytotoxic chemotherapeutic regimens; however, alternative options for systemic treatment are required. Current research focuses on the unique profile of immune-related pathogenic mechanisms of TETs, involving an overlap with certain autoimmune phenotypes, as well as on determining the landscape of oncogenic molecular alterations and the role of tumor angiogenesis. The aim of the present review is to summarize the current clinical investigation on immunotherapy and targeted agents in the management of TETs. Regarding immune checkpoint inhibitors, efficacy results are promising in certain subsets of patients; however, caution is required concerning their toxicity. Anti-angiogenic agents, mainly potent small-molecule inhibitors, have demonstrated antitumor activity in TETs, whereas other targeted agents, including KIT inhibitors and epigenetic agents, are associated with encouraging, yet still modest results for unselected populations, in the absence of predictive biomarkers. Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for patients with TETs, and should implement multicenter collaborations and appropriate clinical trials tailored for rare tumor types.</p>

                            <td>Thymomas are frequently associated with autoimmune/paraneoplastic syndromes (≈30%), most commonly myasthenia gravis. Plausible mechanisms include impaired thymic negative selection (dysfunctional mTECs, AIRE/Fezf2 deficiency), altered antigen presentation (reduced MHC II), and molecular mimicry (tumor-expressed antigens sharing epitopes with neuromuscular targets). Genomic data (TCGA) complicate the picture by showing no simple, consistent defects in classical tolerance genes between MG+ and MG- tumors, implying multifactorial causation. Clinical immunotherapies (ICIs) can exacerbate autoimmunity in thymoma patients, and pre-existing autoantibodies/B-cell lymphopenia predict some severe immune toxicities.</td>
