(2) Total duration of smoking habit — interacts with benefit from quitting: shorter total duration before quitting leads to greater proportional reduction (e.g., men with 1–19 years duration had much greater risk decline after quitting than men with ≥50 years). (3) Changes in daily consumption — stopped, >50% reduction, <50% reduction, increase; stopping produced the largest benefit, >50% reduction did not reliably lower risk in current smokers (RR ≈ 1.01 for >50% reduction), and increasing consumption raised risk (RR = 1.26). (4) Type/brand switching — switching from non-filter to filter reduced risk modestly but left an elevated risk relative to lifelong filter smokers; switching filter→non-filter increased risk. (5) Frequency and depth of inhalation — some indication of greater reduction in risk for those who inhaled less often or less deeply, although these findings were not uniformly strong; Table III shows stratified RRs by inhalation frequency and depth with some heterogeneity (tests for differences in linear trends p < 0.05 for some comparisons).</td>

(2) Duration interaction (Table II): among men current smokers: 1–19 years = 1.0 (baseline), 20–39 years = 2.2, 40–49 years = 2.8, ≥50 years = 3.0; for men who had quit ≥10 years, corresponding RRs were 0.3, 1.0, 1.6, 2.7 respectively, showing much less decline for long-duration smokers. (3) Change in daily consumption (Table IV): stopped (100%) RR = 0.76 (95% CI 0.7–0.8) relative to no change; increased consumption RR = 1.26 (95% CI 1.1–1.4); reduced >50% RR = 1.01 (95% CI 0.9–1.2); reduced <50% RR = 0.84 (95% CI 0.7–1.0). (4) Type of cigarette (Table VI): current smokers of non-filter only had RR = 1.78 (95% CI 1.5–2.1) versus filter-only current smokers; switching non-filter→filter or filter→non-filter also showed elevated RRs vs filter-only (e.g., current smokers non-filter→filter RR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.4–1.9). (5) For many stratified comparisons the authors report statistically significant trends or differences (e.g., tests for linear trend p < 0.001 for years since stopping; some tests for differences in linear trends p < 0.05 in Table III).</td>

(2) Reductions in daily consumption (short of complete cessation) often produced only small or no reductions in relative risk (e.g., >50% reduction in current smokers had RR ≈ 1.01), showing that some smokers who reduce amounts still develop lung cancer at similar rates. (3) Small numbers limited precision in some strata (especially women in some analyses), so some strata lack clear patterns.</td>

(2) Possible recall gaps in smoking histories (no complete accounting of short quit periods between brand changes); the questionnaire recorded only up to four cigarette brands, which could underestimate exposure duration for subjects reporting ≥5 brands. (3) Small numbers in some subgroups (notably women and some stratified cells) limiting precision. (4) Lack of molecular/biologic measures — no genetic, metabolic, or DNA repair data to explain inter-individual susceptibility. (5) Generalizability limited to similar Western European hospital populations and to ever-smokers captured by this hospital sampling process.</td>
