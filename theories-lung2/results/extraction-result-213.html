                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is shown that PDAC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naive mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden and suggests that exosomal MIF primes the liver for metastasis and may be a prognostic marker for the development of PDAC liver metastasis.</p>

(2) Fluorescently labeled exosomes from multiple PDAC models localized preferentially to the liver and were taken up predominantly (>80% of exosome+ liver cells) by F4/80+ or F4/80+CD11b+ Kupffer cells; control exosomes from normal pancreas did not show this tropism. (3) RNA-seq of human Kupffer cells educated in vitro with PDAC exosomes showed upregulation of liver fibrosis pathways including TGFβ and other soluble factors. (4) Immunofluorescence after exosome education showed increased fibronectin deposition and activated αSMA+ hepatic stellate cells; collagen I, vitronectin and tenascin C were not increased in the same way. (5) Bone-marrow GFP transplantation experiments demonstrated recruitment of GFP+ bone-marrow-derived F4/80+ macrophages (≈67% of GFP+ cells) and some Gr-1+ cells to educated livers. (6) Pharmacologic inhibition of TGFβ receptor (A83-01) during exosome education reduced αSMA+ hStC numbers, FN deposition, F4/80+ macrophage recruitment, and the pro-metastatic effect. (7) Conditional fibronectin (Fn) knockout during exosome education reduced F4/80+ macrophage frequency and abolished the exosome-induced increase in liver metastasis, whereas Fn reduction without prior education did not change baseline metastasis. (8) Transient depletion of CD11b+ cells (DT-inducible DTR system) during education reduced F4/80+ macrophages without affecting αSMA or FN, and reversed exosome-induced increases in liver metastasis, showing recruited macrophages are functionally required. (9) Proteomics identified MIF as highly expressed in PDAC exosomes; shRNA-mediated MIF knockdown in PAN02 cells produced exosomes that still bound to Kupffer cells but failed to induce KC TGFβ upregulation, hStC αSMA induction, FN deposition, macrophage recruitment, tumor cell retention at 24h, and increased liver metastasis. (10) Exosomal MIF levels were elevated in PKCY mice (PanIN and PDAC stages) and in plasma exosomes from PDAC patients who later developed metastatic disease compared to patients with no evidence of disease and healthy controls, suggesting clinical relevance.</td>
