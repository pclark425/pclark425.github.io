                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The data from electronic patient records of never smokers diagnosed with lung cancer treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto) between 1988 and 2015 were analyzed to characterize demographic and clinical features, pathology, molecular profile, treatment and survival.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Introduction Lung cancer in never smokers represents a distinct epidemiological, clinical, and molecular entity. Results Most 712 never smoking lung cancer patients were female (72%) with a median age at diagnosis of 62.2 years (18–94). Caucasians (46%), East Asians (42%), adenocarcinoma histology (87%) and presentation with metastatic disease at diagnosis (59%) were common. Of 515 patients with available archival tissue, the most common identified single mutations were EGFR (52.2%), followed by ALK (7.5%), KRAS (2.3%), TP53 (1.3%), ERBB2 (1%), BRAF (0.4%), PIK3CA (0.4%), SMAD4 (0.4%), CTNNB1 (0.2%), AKT1 (0.2%), and NRAS (0.2%); 8% tumors had multiple mutations, while 25.8% had none identified. Median overall survival (mOS) was 42.2 months (mo) for the entire cohort. Patients with mutations in their tumors had significantly better mOS (69.5 mo) when compared to those without (31.0 mo) (HR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.44–0.79; p < 0.001). Earlier stage (p < 0.001), adenocarcinoma histology (p = 0.012), good performance status (p < 0.001) and use of targeted therapy (p < 0.001) were each independently associated with longer survival. Patients with ALK-translocation-positive tumours have significantly longer OS compared to those without any mutations (p = 0.0029) and to those with other and null mutations (p = 0.022). Conclusions Lung cancer in never smokers represents a distinct clinical and molecular entity characterized by a high incidence of targetable mutations and long survival. Methods We analyzed retrospectively the data from electronic patient records of never smokers diagnosed with lung cancer treated at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto) between 1988–2015 to characterize demographic and clinical features, pathology, molecular profile (using hotspot or targeted sequencing panels), treatment and survival.</p>
