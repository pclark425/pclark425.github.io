                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Monitoring of circulating and disseminating tumor cells in PCa patients during the course of radiotherapy may give novel insight into how metastatic spread is influenced by radiotherapy and vice versa.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Radiotherapy and surgery are curative treatment options for localized prostate cancer (PCa) with a 5-year survival rate of nearly 100%. Once PCa cells spread into distant organs, such as bone, the overall survival rate of patients drops dramatically. The metastatic cascade and organotropism of PCa cells are regulated by different cellular subtypes, organ microenvironment, and their interactions. This cross-talk leads to pre-metastatic niche formation that releases chemo-attractive factors enforcing the formation of distant metastasis. Biological characteristics of PCa metastasis impacting on metastatic sites, burden, and latency is of clinical relevance. Therefore, the implementation of modern hybrid imaging technologies into clinical routine increased the sensitivity to detect metastases at earlier stages. This enlarged the number of PCa patients diagnosed with a limited number of metastases, summarized as oligometastatic disease. These patients can be treated with androgen deprivation in combination with local-ablative radiotherapy or radiopharmaceuticals directed to metastatic sites. Unfortunately, the number of patients with disease recurrence is high due to the enormous heterogeneity within the oligometastatic patient population and the lack of available biomarkers with predictive potential for metastasis-directed radiotherapy. Another, so far unmet clinical need is the diagnosis of minimal residual disease before onset of clinical manifestation and/or early relapse after initial therapy. Here, monitoring of circulating and disseminating tumor cells in PCa patients during the course of radiotherapy may give us novel insight into how metastatic spread is influenced by radiotherapy and vice versa. In summary, this review critically compares current clinical concepts for metastatic PCa patients and discuss the implementation of recent preclinical findings improving our understanding of metastatic dissemination and radiotherapy resistance into standard of care.</p>

(2) Adhesion molecules: cadherin-11 expression increases bone-homing and is higher in metastases vs primary tumor; cadherin-11 upregulates invasive MMPs (MMP-7, -15) (Huang et al.). (3) Niche hijacking/dormancy: GAS6 binding to TAM receptors induces dormancy; annexin-2 directs PCa cells to endosteal niche (Taichman, others). (4) Dormancy regulators: TBK1 induction by osteoblast contact inhibits mTOR and induces cell-cycle arrest (Kim et al.); TGF-β2 and BMP-7 from osteoblasts activate signaling (p38MAPK, p27/p21) associated with dormancy. (5) Reactivation: castration-induced bone resorption increases bone metastasis in vivo; osteoclast inhibition (bisphosphonates, RANKL inhibitors) prevents this in animal models. Clinical trials: denosumab reduced skeletal-related events and zoledronic acid prevents bone loss; radium-223 improved overall survival in metastatic CRPC (ALSYMPCA).</td>
