                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is reported that AT-1S113R is unable to form homodimers in the ER membrane and is devoid of acetyl-CoA transport activity, revealing a previously unknown aspect ofacetyl- CoA metabolism that affects the immune and nervous systems and the risk for malignancies.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The import of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen by AT-1/SLC33A1 is essential for the Nε-lysine acetylation of ER-resident and ER-transiting proteins. A point-mutation (S113R) in AT-1 has been associated with a familial form of spastic paraplegia. Here, we report that AT-1S113R is unable to form homodimers in the ER membrane and is devoid of acetyl-CoA transport activity. The reduced influx of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen results in reduced acetylation of ER proteins and an aberrant form of autophagy. Mice homozygous for the mutation display early developmental arrest. In contrast, heterozygous animals develop to full term, but display neurodegeneration and propensity to infections, inflammation, and cancer. The immune and cancer phenotypes are contingent on the presence of pathogens in the colony, whereas the nervous system phenotype is not. In conclusion, our results reveal a previously unknown aspect of acetyl-CoA metabolism that affects the immune and nervous systems and the risk for malignancies.</p>

Non-acetylated Atg9A promotes aberrant/overactive ER-associated autophagy (ERAD(II)/autophagy) downstream of the IRE1/XBP1 branch of the unfolded protein response. Aberrant autophagy drives neuronal loss (neurodegeneration). Separately, altered autophagy at the ER perturbs antigen presentation and immune homeostasis, favoring chronic inflammation (elevated IL-17 and neutrophil recruitment) upon pathogen exposure, and chronic inflammation promotes tumorigenesis; thus both neurodegeneration and cancer propensity arise from the same primary defect but via divergent downstream effects (neuronal autophagic death vs. immune dysregulation → inflammation-driven cancer).</td>

(2) Analytical ultracentrifugation/glycerol gradient: WT AT-1 behaves as homodimer (~120 kDa functional unit); S113R fails to dimerize (co-IP experiments) explaining loss of transport. (3) Knock-in mice AT-1S113R/+ liver ER vesicles show ~50% reduced acetyl-CoA influx and reduced ER protein acetylation (Fig.3C,D). (4) AT-1S113R/+ mice develop progressive neurodegeneration (sciatic nerve axonal loss, neuronal loss in spinal cord, reduced FA and corpus callosum thickness on DTI/MRI, gliosis, microglial activation measured by [11C]PBR28 PET) independent of pathogen exposure. (5) When housed in pathogen-exposed facility, AT-1S113R/+ mice show widespread infections/inflammation and increased cancer incidence (open facility data: 55.5% of dead mutants had cancer). (6) Cell/tissue assays: increased autophagy markers (beclin-1, LC3β II), decreased p62, LC3β puncta in neurons and MEFs; EM showing large autophagosomes; autophagic flux assays confirm increased induction rather than block. (7) Rescue: expressing a 'gain-of-acetylation' Atg9A mutant (Atg9A_Gln) in MEFs rescues aberrant autophagy phenotype (reduces LC3β puncta and beclin/LC3β II levels), supporting Atg9A acetylation as mechanistic node.</td>

Important contextual counterpoint in this study: AT-1S113R/+ mice show the neurodegenerative phenotype regardless of pathogen exposure (observed in both SPF and open facilities), but the increased infections, inflammation and cancer phenotype is environment-dependent — in SPF (pathogen-free) housing AT-1S113R/+ mice exhibit essentially no cancer (0% cancer in necropsies) despite the same genetic defect. Thus cancer propensity is not an inevitable concomitant of neurodegeneration in this model and requires pathogen-driven immune activation. Also, this model demonstrates co-occurrence rather than inverse relationship (i.e., cancer and neurodegeneration can co-occur in the same organism).</td>
