                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> It is shown that PDAC-derived exosomes induce liver pre-metastatic niche formation in naive mice and consequently increase liver metastatic burden and suggests that exosomal MIF primes the liver for metastasis and may be a prognostic marker for the development of PDAC liver metastasis.</p>
