                <p><strong>Paper Venue:</strong> Clinical Cancer Research</p>
                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Functional ALK rearrangements were mutually exclusive with EGFR and KRAS mutations in a large Western patient population, and this lack of overlap was also observed in ALK-positive cancers with acquired resistance to crizotinib.</p>
