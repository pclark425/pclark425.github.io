                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The incidence of cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases exponentially with age. A growing body of epidemiological evidence and molecular investigations inspired the hypothesis of an inverse relationship between these two pathologies. It has been proposed that the two diseases might utilize the same proteins and pathways that are, however, modulated differently and sometimes in opposite directions. Investigation of the common processes underlying these diseases may enhance the understanding of their pathogenesis and may also guide novel therapeutic strategies. Starting from a text-mining approach, our in silico study integrated the dispersed biological evidence by combining data mining, gene set enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses while searching for common biological hallmarks linked to AD and cancer. We retrieved 138 genes (ALZCAN gene set), computed a significant number of enriched gene ontology clusters, and identified four PPI modules. The investigation confirmed the relevance of autophagy, ubiquitin proteasome system, and cell death as common biological hallmarks shared by cancer and AD. Then, from a closer investigation of the PPI modules and of the miRNAs enrichment data, several genes (SQSTM1, UCHL1, STUB1, BECN1, CDKN2A, TP53, EGFR, GSK3B, and HSPA9) and miRNAs (miR-146a-5p, MiR-34a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-9-5p, and miR-16-5p) emerged as promising candidates. The integrative approach uncovered novel miRNA-gene networks (e.g., miR-146 and miR-34 regulating p62 and Beclin1 in autophagy) that might give new insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in AD and cancer.</p>

(2) Metabolic reprogramming — cancers upregulate aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) to fuel proliferation, whereas age-related neurodegeneration features decreased glycolysis and compensatory increase of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation; these opposite metabolic states can differentially select for survival vs death. (3) Opposite modulation of protein homeostasis systems — autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are differentially regulated in cancer and AD (e.g., Beclin1 reduced in AD, autophagy can promote or suppress tumors depending on context). (4) Cell fate regulatory pathways — enhanced cell death/senescence in neurons versus suppressed apoptosis and increased proliferation in cancer, with central roles for TP53, CDKN2A, and related effectors. (5) Signaling-pathway switches — dysregulation of Wnt signaling/PIN1/GSK3B, EGFR/IGF1R/NOTCH1 axis that have context-dependent, often opposite, outcomes in dividing cells versus post-mitotic neurons. (6) miRNA-mediated regulation — miRNAs (miR-146a-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-9-5p, miR-16-5p, etc.) differentially regulate autophagy/UPS and signaling hubs (e.g., miR-146a → SQSTM1/p62; miR-34a → BECN1; miR-21 → STUB1/CHIP), producing opposite effects in cancer and AD.</td>

Experimental findings from cited primary literature used as supporting evidence include: p62 (SQSTM1) inactivation in mice causes GSK3β activation and tau hyperphosphorylation leading to neurodegeneration (Ramesh Babu et al., 2008); miR-34a knockout in APP/PS1 mice improves cognition and reduces amyloid (Jian et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018); miR-146a upregulated in AD models and affects inflammation (Lukiw et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011); Beclin1 decreased in AD patients (Jaeger et al., 2010); many miRNA–target interactions supported by reporter assays, western blots and qPCR in miRTarBase.
