                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A strong negative association was observed between the expression levels of miRNAs in GBM compared to AD, suggesting that although the molecular pathways behind the development of these two pathologies are the same, they appear to be inversely regulated by miRNas.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> There is recent evidence to indicate the existence of an inverse association between the incidence of neurological disorders and cancer development. Concurrently, the transcriptional pathways responsible for the onset of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been found to be mutually exclusive between the two pathologies. Despite advancements being made concerning the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development of GBM and AD, little is known about the identity of the microRNA (miRNAs or miRs) involved in the development and progression of these two pathologies and their possible inverse expression patterns. On these bases, the aim of the present study was to identify a set of miRNAs significantly de-regulated in both GBM and AD, and hence to determine whether the identified miRNAs exhibit an inverse association within the two pathologies. For this purpose, miRNA expression profiling datasets derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) DataSets and relative to GBM and AD were used. Once the miRNAs significantly de-regulated in both pathologies were identified, DIANA-mirPath pathway prediction and STRING Gene Ontology enrichment analyses were performed to establish their functional roles in each of the pathologies. The results allowed the identification of a set of miRNAs found de-regulated in both GBM and AD, whose expression levels were inversely associated in the two pathologies. In particular, a strong negative association was observed between the expression levels of miRNAs in GBM compared to AD, suggesting that although the molecular pathways behind the development of these two pathologies are the same, they appear to be inversely regulated by miRNAs. Despite the identification of this set of miRNAs which may be used for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes, further functional in vitro and in vivo evaluations are warranted in order to validate the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the identified miRNAs, as well as their involvement in the development of GBM and AD.</p>
