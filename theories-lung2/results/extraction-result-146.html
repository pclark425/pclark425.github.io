(b) Genome-wide expression identified a 17-gene brain metastasis signature (BrMS) associated with clinical brain relapse. (c) Functional perturbation: RNAi/shRNA knockdown of COX2 reduced brain metastatic activity of BrM2 cells in mice; treatment of mice with cetuximab (anti-EGFR) reduced brain metastasis. (d) In vitro human BBB model (primary brain endothelial cells + astrocytes producing a tight, albumin-impermeable barrier): BrM2 cells showed 3-4× higher transmigration than parental cells; COX2 knockdown or EGFR blockade (cetuximab) inhibited transmigration; combined knockdown of COX2, HBEGF and EREG further reduced transmigration. (e) ST6GALNAC5: expression was dramatically upregulated in BrM2 derivatives (MDA231: ~30×; CN34: >100×; other pleural isolates similarly elevated). SNA lectin staining (binds α2,6-linked sialic acid) was strong in BrM2-derived tumours and in 50% (6/12) of human breast-cancer brain metastasis samples versus 18% (2/11) of lung metastases. ST6GALNAC5 knockdown decreased adhesion to brain endothelial monolayers, reduced BBB transmigration to baseline, and decreased brain metastatic activity in mice; conversely, ectopic ST6GALNAC5 expression in an aggressive lung-colonizing LM2 line increased BBB transmigration and brain infiltration (more micrometastases). (f) ST6GALNAC5 knockdown did not affect in vitro growth, primary tumour growth, or lung seeding by CN34-BrM2 cells, indicating a brain-specific role.</td>
