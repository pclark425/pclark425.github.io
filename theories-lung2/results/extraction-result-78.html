                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Differentiating multiple pulmonary lesions as multiple primary lung cancer (MLC) or intra-pulmonary metastasis (IPM) is critical. Lung cancer also has a high genetic heterogeneity, which influenced the treatment strategy. Genetic information may aid in tracing lineage information on multiple lung lesions. This study applied comprehensive genomic profiling to decipher the intrinsic genetics of multiple lung lesions. Methods Sixty-six lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) tumor lesions (FFEP) archived from 30 patients were included in this study. The 508 cancer-related genes were evaluated by targeted next-generation sequencing (MGI-seq 2000). Results The study included a total of 30 LUADs (66 samples). The majority of tumors demonstrated intra-tumoral heterogeneity. Two hundred twenty-four mutations were detected by sequencing the 66 samples. We investigated the driver gene mutations of NSCLC patients with multiple lesions. EGFR was the most frequently (48/198) mutated driver gene. The codons in EGFR mainly affected by mutations were p.L858R (18/66 [27.3%]) and exon 19del (8/66 [12.1%]). In addition, additional driver genes were found, including TP53, BRAF, ERBB2, MET, and PIK3CA. We also found that the inter-component heterogeneity of different lesions and more than two different mutation types of EGFR were detected in seven patients with two lesions (P3, P10, P24, P25, P28, P29, and P30). The TMB values of different lesions in each patient were different in 26 patients (except P4, P5, P14, and P30). Conclusions Comprehensive genomic profiling should be applied to distinguishing the nature of multiple lung lesions irrespective of radiologic and histologic diagnoses.</p>
