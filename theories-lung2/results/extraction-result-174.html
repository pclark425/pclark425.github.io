                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The present review article presents a summary and discussion of the miRNAs that form part of colorectal cancer (CRC)-derived exosomal cargoes and which play distinct roles in epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity and metastatic organotropism.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The journey of cancer cells from a primary tumor to distant sites is a multi-step process that involves cellular reprogramming, the breaking or breaching of physical barriers and the preparation of a pre-metastatic niche for colonization. The loss of adhesion between cells, cytoskeletal remodeling, the reduction in size and change in cell shape, the destruction of the extracellular matrix, and the modification of the tumor microenvironment facilitate migration and invasion into surrounding tissues. The promotion of vascular leakiness enables intra- and extravasation, while angiogenesis and immune suppression help metastasizing cells become established in the new site. Tumor-derived exosomes have long been known to harbor microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) that help prepare secondary sites for metastasis; however, their roles in the early and intermediate steps of the metastatic cascade are only beginning to be characterized. The present review article presents a summary and discussion of the miRNAs that form part of colorectal cancer (CRC)-derived exosomal cargoes and which play distinct roles in epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity and metastatic organotropism. First, an overview of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastatic organotropism, as well as exosome biogenesis, cargo sorting and uptake by recipient cells is presented. Lastly, the potential of these exosomal miRNAs as prognostic biomarkers for metastatic CRC, and the blocking of these as a possible therapeutic intervention is discussed.</p>
