                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> A thymoma is a rare malignant tumor of the thymus gland, often associated with local invasion, recurrence, and autoimmune disorders. The interplay between thymoma and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) represents a complex clinical phenomenon, yet its underlying mechanisms and optimal management strategies remain incompletely understood. We present the case of a 69-year-old male with recurrent thymoma, initially classified as type B1/AB, complicated by the subsequent development of MDS. The patient, who had worked as a plumber for over 20 years, had previously undergone robotic video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in an attempt to treat the thymoma. Despite these interventions, the tumor recurred, invading the left lung pleura. Following his admission to our hospital, he experienced subsequent hospitalizations for anemia, recurrent pleural effusions, and leukocytosis, which were managed with blood transfusions, thoracentesis, and antibiotics. The onset of MDS in this patient raises questions about the potential interplay between thymoma and hematologic disorders, possibly related to immunological dysregulation, genetic predisposition, occupational exposure, or environmental factors. This case illustrates the intricate link between recurrent thymoma and the onset of MDS. It emphasizes the necessity for further research to uncover their underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets for this intriguing clinical entity. Additionally, the case reinforces the vital role of a multidisciplinary approach in treating both thymoma and MDS, as the complexities of care require collaborative efforts to ensure optimal patient outcomes.</p>
