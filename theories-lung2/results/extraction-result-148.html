                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Breast cancer is the most common malignant disease in female patients worldwide and can spread to almost every place in the human body, most frequently metastasizing to lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver and brain. The liver is a common metastatic location for solid cancers as a whole, and it is also the third most common metastatic site for breast cancer. Breast cancer liver metastasis (BCLM) is a complex process. Although the hepatic microenvironment and liver sinusoidal structure are crucial factors for the initial arrest of breast cancer and progression within the liver, the biological basis of BCLM remains to be elucidated. Importantly, further understanding of the interaction between breast cancer cells and hepatic microenvironment in the liver metastasis of breast cancer will suggest ways for the development of effective therapy and prevention strategies for BCLM. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the hepatic microenvironment in BCLM formation and discuss current systemic therapies for treating patients with BCLM as well as potential therapeutic development based on the liver microenvironment-associated signaling proteins governing BCLM.</p>

(2) Tabariés et al. (Mol Cell Biol/Oncogene) demonstrated that Claudin-2 is enriched in liver metastases and promotes tumor–hepatocyte adhesion; Lyn kinase modulation of Claudin-2 and treatment with the Lyn-selective inhibitor Bafetinib reduced liver metastasis in preclinical models. (3) Zhang et al. showed TGF-β1 increases CD44high/CD24- breast cancer stem population and promotes local invasion and liver metastasis (cell and animal models). (4) Seubert et al. showed TIMP-1 creates a liver premetastatic niche via SDF-1/CXCR4-dependent neutrophil recruitment in mice. (5) Correia et al. (Nature 2021) showed activated HSCs suppress NK cell–sustained dormancy permitting outgrowth of hepatic micrometastases (mouse models). (6) Wellenstein et al. (Nature 2019) demonstrated loss of p53 triggers WNT-dependent systemic inflammation (neutrophil-driven) promoting metastasis; blockade of Wnt secretion (LGK974) reduced neutrophilic inflammation and BCLM in models. (7) Liang et al. (PNAS) reported neutrophil-derived transferrin instructs metastatic growth and that depletion reduces metastatic growth. These findings are cited as evidence across in vitro co-cultures, orthotopic/experimental metastasis mouse models, genetic perturbation, pharmacologic inhibition, and patient tumor profiling.</td>
