                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> T-77C and Arg399Gln polymorphisms of the XRCC1 gene, as well as the 186C>T and Val158Met polymorphism of the COMT gene, increased the risk of lung cancer in non-smoking women, with the factors of occupation type, cooking-oil fumes, and soot exposures representing key contributing factors.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Backgrpound Various studies have highlighted the link between polymorphisms in the XRCC1 gene (encoding X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1) with the incidence of decreased DNA repair capacity and an increased predisposition to cancer. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) plays a crucial role in estrogen-induced cancers. In the present study was analyzed the potential influence of XRCC1 and COMT gene polymorphisms as predisposing factors from a lung cancer perspective, in addition to conducting an investigation into their interaction with environmental risk factors in relation to lung cancer among non-smoking Chinese women. Material/Methods The XRCC1 gene T-77C, Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln, COMT gene 186C>T, and Val158Met mutations were evaluated in peripheral blood collected from 261 non-smoking female patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer and 265 female patients with benign lung disease. Result The results obtained from this study demonstrated that XRCC1–77TC + CC, XRCC1 399Gln/Gln, COMT 186CT + TT, COMT 158Val/Met genotypes, type of occupation, cooking-oil fumes, and soot exposures were all independent risk factors involved with the occurrence of lung cancer among non-smoking women. Moreover, interactions between environmental exposure factors as well as XRCC1 and COMT gene polymorphisms were determined to play significant contributory roles regarding susceptibility of non-smoking females to lung cancer. Conclusions Taken together, T-77C and Arg399Gln polymorphisms of the XRCC1 gene, as well as the 186C>T and Val158Met polymorphisms of the COMT gene, increased the risk of lung cancer in non-smoking women, with the factors of occupation type, cooking-oil fumes, and soot exposures representing key contributing factors.</p>

(2) Altered estrogen/catechol metabolism — COMT methylates catechol estrogens to non-genotoxic metabolites; COMT variants/haplotypes that reduce COMT activity or expression would increase genotoxic catechol estrogen levels, potentially promoting estrogen-related carcinogenesis in lung tissue. (3) Environmental co-exposures (cooking-oil fumes rich in aldehydes and PAHs, soot, occupational carcinogens including metals) provide differential external carcinogen dose; when combined with susceptible genotypes (XRCC1/COMT), these exposures synergize to increase cancer risk. The paper also cites work showing COMT haplotypes alter protein expression by changing mRNA secondary structure, linking genotype to altered enzyme levels/function.</td>
