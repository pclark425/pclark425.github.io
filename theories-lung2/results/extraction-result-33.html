                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A computational method is proposed to identify novel lung adenocarcinoma drivers based on dysfunctional genes on the methylation, microRNA, mutation and mRNA levels and confirmed that some have the potential to contribute to the tumorigenesis process on multiple levels.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Tumors are formed by the abnormal proliferation of somatic cells with disordered growth regulation under the influence of tumorigenic factors. Recently, the theory of “cancer drivers” connects tumor initiation with several specific mutations in the so-called cancer driver genes. According to the differentiation of four basic levels between tumor and adjacent normal tissues, the cancer drivers can be divided into the following: (1) Methylation level, (2) microRNA level, (3) mutation level and (4) mRNA level. In this study, a computational method is proposed to identify novel lung adenocarcinoma drivers based on dysfunctional genes on the methylation, microRNA, mutation and mRNA levels. First, a large network was constructed using protein-protein interactions. Next, we searched all of the shortest paths connecting dysfunctional genes on different levels and extracted new candidate genes lying on these paths. Finally, the obtained candidate genes were filtered by a permutation test and an additional strict selection procedure involving a betweenness ratio and an interaction score. Several candidate genes remained, which are deemed to be related to two different levels of cancer. The analyses confirmed our assertions that some have the potential to contribute to the tumorigenesis process on multiple levels.</p>

Candidate genes were retained only if permutation-derived FDR < 0.05, betweenness ratio (number of connecting shortest paths normalized by |Gi|*|Gj|) >= 0.01, and a min-max PPI interaction score >= 400. Multiple genes passed these filters and many are supported by prior literature cited in the paper (examples: TCF3 methylation affecting A549 proliferation [ref.49]; TCF3 regulation by miRNAs [ref.50]; FZD1 linked to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling and cancer drug resistance [refs.51,52]; SHH/PTCH1 implicated via tables and prior work).
