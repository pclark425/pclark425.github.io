                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Lung cancer remains a formidable challenge in oncology, necessitating innovative and comprehensive therapeutic approaches. Lung cancer treatment encompasses diverse modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Chemotherapy continues to stand as a fundamental treatment approach, yet the consequential side effects it brings forth pose significant barriers to its broad implementation and serve as a primary impediment in clinical practice. This review presents a detailed exploration of natural molecules, dietary strategies, and their potential to enhance chemotherapy's efficacy and mitigate adverse effects. Moreover, the significance of combined therapies emerges, elucidating their capacity to synergistically combat lung cancer through enhanced treatment efficacy, resistance prevention, and personalized patient care. This paper also underscores the value of adjuvant therapy and its role in extending patient survival and reducing recurrence rates. In addition, the interplay between gut microbiota and chemotherapy outcomes is examined, emphasizing the potential for microbiota modulation to optimize treatment responses. Conclusively, this comprehensive review underscores the dynamic landscape of lung cancer treatment, advocating for a holistic approach that integrates cutting-edge therapeutic paradigms to enhance patient outcomes and quality of life.</p>
