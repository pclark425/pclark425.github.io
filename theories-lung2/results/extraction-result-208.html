                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A fatal immune-mediated adverse events’ storm in a thymoma patient treated with Pembrolizumab is reported, leading to hepatotoxicity accompanied by lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and thyroid dysfunction, unveiling a novel potential pathophysiological effect of immunotherapy.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Recent advances in tumor immunotherapy have made it possible to efficiently unleash immune effectors, reacting against neoplastic cells. Although these approaches primarily aim to eradicate malignancy, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) often influence patients’ prognosis, constituting a new spectrum of side effects. Taking into account the typical microenvironment and the intricate equilibrium between the anti-tumor response and the immune cells, the thymoma constitutes a unicum in the immune-oncology field. We report a fatal immune-mediated adverse events’ storm in a thymoma patient treated with Pembrolizumab, leading to hepatotoxicity accompanied by lymphocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and thyroid dysfunction, unveiling a novel potential pathophysiological effect of immunotherapy. The clinical proficiency of the immune checkpoint inhibitors in thymoma patients warrants timely prevention and management of off-target consequences in order to optimize this promising therapeutic option. This case report describes a unique consequence of irAEs, emerging as a red flag warranting a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
