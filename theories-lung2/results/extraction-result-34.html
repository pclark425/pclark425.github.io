                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Tumor samples from 3 of 91 patients with lung cancer without known oncogenic alterations assayed by next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated evidence of NTRK1 gene fusions.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We identified new gene fusions in patients with lung cancer harboring the kinase domain of the NTRK1 gene that encodes the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TRKA protein). Both the MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1 fusions lead to constitutive TRKA kinase activity and are oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth. Tumor samples from 3 of 91 patients with lung cancer (3.3%) without known oncogenic alterations assayed by next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated evidence of NTRK1 gene fusions.</p>

Protein: expression of fusion protein observed in patient-derived cells (CUTO-3) and autophosphorylation of TRKA at key tyrosines. Cytology/models: MPRIP- and CD74-NTRK1 expression induced IL-3-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells, anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells, and tumor formation in nude mice; kinase-dead mutants did not. Functional dependence: siRNA knockdown of TPM3-NTRK1 in KM12 reduced proliferation. Prevalence: 3/91 (~3.3%) of lung adenocarcinomas lacking other known drivers harbored NTRK1 fusions. Drug sensitivity: ARRY-470 (selective pan-TRK inhibitor) and CEP-701 inhibited fusion autophosphorylation and proliferation in cell models; crizotinib showed weaker activity. Clinical: one index patient treated with crizotinib had a minor radiographic/biochemical response then progression at ~3 months.</td>

Functional data: fusion expression yielded autophosphorylation and downstream signaling, abolished by kinase-dead mutants.</td>
