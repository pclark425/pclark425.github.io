(2) Many driver mutations also occur subclonally and regionally (heterogeneous drivers), some in an APOBEC mutation context (examples: PIK3CA, EP300, TGFBR1, PTPRD, AKAP9). (3) Elevated APOBEC3B mRNA expression was observed regionally where APOBEC signatures were strongest. (4) Structural events disrupted tumor suppressors (e.g., FANCM, NF1) via clustered translocations. (5) Genome-doubling preceded or followed driver acquisition depending on tumor, implying timing of ploidy changes in susceptibility/progression.</td>

(2) Continued exposure (current smokers) did not always show the same loss of strand bias in late mutations, indicating behavioral status (ongoing smoking vs cessation) affects the evolving mutational signature.</td>

(2) Every tumor had a significant decrease in the proportion of C>A transversions in late versus early mutations (P < 0.05); the mean odds ratio for LUAD was 3.13 (range 2.07–5.55) and for LUSC 1.34 (range 1.21–1.46). (3) TCGA validation: LUAD current smokers P < 0.0001 and former smokers P < 0.0001 (never-smokers P = 0.147) for decreased late C>A proportion; LUSC current smokers P = 0.003 and former smokers P < 0.0001 (never-smokers P = 0.673). (4) APOBEC contribution: on average 31% (range 8–41%) of nonsilent branch (late) mutations occurred in an APOBEC context versus 11% (7–16%) of truncal nonsilent mutations in the M-seq set. (5) In TCGA LUAD tumors with APOBEC signatures, late enrichment of APOBEC mutations was significant (P < 0.001); in TCGA data 20% of subclonal driver mutations occurred in an APOBEC context versus 11% of clonal driver mutations. (6) Probability of missing a category-1 driver by single-region sampling averaged 42% (range 0–67%); for all potential driver genes (categories 1–3) average probability was 83% (range 67–100%). (7) In LUSC, 25% of tumors displayed no decrease in C>A transversions over time, compared with <10% in LUAD.</td>

(2) Current smokers did not show a statistically significant decrease in strand bias of C>A transversions between early and late mutations (LUAD P = 0.23; LUSC P = 0.22), whereas former smokers did. (3) Tumor L003 demonstrated two anatomically separate tumors that shared only a highly recurrent EGFR L858R mutation (and no shared silent mutations), consistent with independent clonal origins and parallel evolution—illustrating that identical oncogenic events can arise independently rather than by dissemination.</td>

(4) Clinical demographic details (age/sex/ethnicity) and full clinical follow-up outcomes are not provided in the main text. (5) The study is not population-based and therefore cannot directly identify epidemiologic risk factors that distinguish smokers who do versus do not develop lung cancer; instead it provides mechanistic genomic correlates.</td>
