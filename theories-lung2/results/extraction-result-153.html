                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Evidence is obtained that overproduction and developmental remodeling, including substantial elimination of synaptic spines, continues beyond adolescence and throughout the third decade of life before stabilizing at the adult level, which has implications for understanding the effect of environmental impact on the development of human cognitive and emotional capacities.</p>
