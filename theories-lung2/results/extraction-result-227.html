Labeled PDAC exosomes preferentially localized to liver and >80% of exosome-positive liver cells were F4/80+ or F4/80+CD11b+ (Kupffer cell phenotype). In vitro RNA-seq of human Kupffer cells educated with PDAC exosomes showed upregulation of liver fibrosis/TGFβ-related pathways. TGFβ inhibition (ALK5 inhibitor A83-01) during exosome education reduced αSMA+ hStC frequency, FN deposition and F4/80+ macrophage recruitment. Conditional fibronectin knockout during exosome education reduced recruited macrophages and reverted the pro-metastatic phenotype in intra-splenic metastasis assays. Transplantation of GFP+ bone marrow followed by exosome education showed recruited GFP+ cells in liver (≈67% of GFP+ cells were F4/80+). MIF identified by exosome proteomics; MIF knockdown in PAN02 cells did not change exosome size/number or binding to liver CD11b+F4/80+ cells but prevented TGFβ upregulation in F4/80+ cells, reduced αSMA in hStCs, decreased FN deposition and macrophage frequency, reduced tumor cell retention at 24h, and decreased eventual liver metastasis promoted by exosome education. Plasma exosomal MIF was elevated in PDAC patient samples (stage I patients who later developed liver metastasis) and in PKCY mice with PanIN/PDAC lesions.</td>

TGFβ has complex, stage-dependent roles and systemic TGFβ inhibition has potential adverse effects; thus TGFβ may have tumor-suppressor functions in certain contexts. Exosomal MIF may be more important in early stages of metastasis (pre-metastatic niche initiation) than in established metastatic disease, as suggested by bimodal MIF distribution in patients with established liver metastases. Study limitations include non-randomized experiments and lack of blinding, and that systemic effects of inhibiting MIF/TGFβ/FN were not fully tested.</td>
