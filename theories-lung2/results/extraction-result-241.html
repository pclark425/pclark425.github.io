                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> © 2019 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research Thymic epithelial tumours form the most important differential diagnosis for anterior mediastinal masses, among which thymomas constitute nearly 50 per cent of these lesions. These are infrequent and possess certain unique characteristics1. The thymus plays a central role in the development of self-immunological tolerance by appropriate conditioning of T-cell progenitors that enter the gland. Consequently, thymic pathology (including thymomas) leads to the generation of a variety of autoantibodies. Hence, a significant proportion of patients with thymomas present with features of paraneoplastic syndromes (PNSs) to the extent of exclusion of chest-related symptoms. The most common manifestation is myasthenia gravis, induced by anti-acetylcholine esterase antibodies, identified in close to 95 per cent of patients with available clinical data in a large series of Indian patients published in this issue2. It must be borne in mind that there are also other PNSs (including multiorgan autoimmunity), secondary cancers as well as opportunistic infections, which are explained in part by acquired T-cell immunodeficiency3. The presence of PNSs, paradoxically, was associated with favourable features4.</p>
