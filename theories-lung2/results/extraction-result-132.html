                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The genetic differences between lung cancer in smokers versus never-smokers are focused on: gene expression, germ-line polymorphisms, gene mutations, as well as ethnic and gender differences.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, therefore lung cancer epidemiological trends reflect the past trends of cigarette smoking to a great extent. The geographic patterns in mortality closely follow those in incidence. Although lung cancer is strongly associated with cigarette smoking, only about 15% of smokers get lung cancer, and also some never-smokers develop this malignancy. Although less frequent, lung cancer in never smokers is the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes worldwide. Lung cancer in smokers and never-smokers differs in many aspects: in histological types, environmental factors representing a risk, and in genes associated with this disease. In this review, we will focus on the genetic differences between lung cancer in smokers versus never-smokers: gene expression, germ-line polymorphisms, gene mutations, as well as ethnic and gender differences. Finally, treatment options for smokers and never-smokers will be briefly reviewed.</p>
