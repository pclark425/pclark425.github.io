                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Thymomas are well known for paraneoplastic neurologic disorders (PNDs), but multiple PNDs co-exist rarely. We are reporting a case of thymoma with myasthenia gravis who presented with concomitant status epilepticus, likely of paraneoplastic etiology, without any evidence of encephalitis, on imaging, and on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Possibly, a case of two paraneoplastic autoimmune disorders coexisting in a thymoma patient.</p>
