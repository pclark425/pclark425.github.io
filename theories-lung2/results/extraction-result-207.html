The ITMIG dataset lacked consistent MG severity (MGFA) data, so effects of thymectomy on MG in this cohort cannot be assessed.

The authors emphasize that improved outcomes in PN/AI(+) patients may be confounded by favorable features (earlier stage, complete resections) and detection bias (symptoms leading to earlier diagnosis), and in multivariate models PN/AI was not an independent prognostic factor.
