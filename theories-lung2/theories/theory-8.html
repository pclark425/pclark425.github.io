                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A subset of smokers develop lung cancer because tobacco and environmental carcinogen exposure (particularly PM2.5) drives them into a stable 'pro-carcinogenic epigenetic state' characterized by: (1) DNA methylation changes (AHRR and F2RL3 hypomethylation, TP53 promoter hypermethylation via PM2.5-induced ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway), (2) altered miRNA/lncRNA expression (miR-182/185/802 downregulation, lncRNA loc146880 induction) reducing tumor-suppressor function and activating oncogenes, (3) histone modifications, and (4) chromatin accessibility changes creating a 'field cancerization' effect where the entire bronchial epithelium is primed for transformation. This epigenetic state is heritable through cell divisions, amplifies the carcinogenic consequences of tobacco-induced DNA mutations, and is only slowly and incompletely reversible with smoking cessation (explaining persistent elevated risk and gradual risk reduction after quitting). Individual susceptibility to establishing this epigenetic state varies based on genetic background (metabolic enzyme polymorphisms, DNA repair capacity), intensity and duration of exposure, and co-exposures (PM2.5, occupational carcinogens).</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Epigenetic Field Cancerization Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Chronic tobacco smoke and PM2.5 exposure induces coordinated, stable epigenetic alterations across the bronchial epithelium that persist through cell divisions and create a tissue-wide 'primed' or 'prepared' state. Specifically: (1) Hypomethylation occurs at AHRR and F2RL3 CpG sites in proportion to cumulative exposure; (2) PM2.5-generated ROS activates the Akt signaling pathway, which upregulates DNMT3B expression, leading to hypermethylation and transcriptional silencing of the TP53 tumor suppressor promoter; (3) miR-182, miR-185, and miR-802 are downregulated while lncRNA loc146880 is induced, derepressing target oncogenes (SLC30A1, SERPINB2, AKR1C1) and promoting neoplastic transformation pathways (Rnd3); (4) These changes reduce the number of additional genetic hits required for malignant transformation because tumor suppressors are already epigenetically silenced, oncogenes are activated, and DNA damage response pathways are blunted. The probability and extent of entering this primed state depends on: exposure intensity and duration (higher pack-years increases probability), genetic variants affecting epigenetic machinery (DNMT, TET enzymes) and carcinogen metabolism (CYP, GST variants), DNA repair capacity (XRCC1, ERCC variants), and co-exposures (PM2.5 composition, occupational carcinogens). Non-cancerous lung tissue from smokers exhibits altered gene expression profiles ('field effect') requiring fewer additional molecular changes to progress to cancer compared to never-smokers.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to: (1) Individuals with chronic tobacco smoke exposure (typically >10 pack-years, though lower in susceptible individuals) and/or significant PM2.5/environmental carcinogen exposure; (2) Bronchial epithelial cells and potentially other respiratory epithelium; (3) Changes measurable in both target tissue (bronchial epithelium) and surrogate tissue (peripheral blood leukocytes, though magnitude may differ); (4) Time scale of months-to-years for establishment (dose-dependent), with changes detectable after sustained exposure. Excludes: Acute or very light exposures insufficient to establish stable epigenetic changes; non-respiratory tissues (though some systemic methylation changes occur); immediate post-exposure period before stable states are established.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Methylation changes are CpG-site and gene-specific; not all genomic regions show smoking-associated epigenetic alterations; AHRR and F2RL3 are among the most robust and well-replicated loci</li>
                <li>The relationship between peripheral blood methylation (commonly measured) and target bronchial tissue methylation is correlative but not identical; blood methylation serves as a systemic biomarker but tissue-specific changes may be more extensive</li>
                <li>Genetic variants in DNMT1/3A/3B (maintenance and de novo methyltransferases) and TET1/2/3 (demethylases) may modify individual susceptibility to establishing epigenetic changes per unit exposure</li>
                <li>PM2.5 chemical composition matters: source-specific PM (traffic, biomass combustion, industrial) has different oxidative potential and epigenetic effects; PAH-rich and metal-rich PM may have stronger effects</li>
                <li>Co-exposures amplify effects: combined tobacco + PM2.5 + occupational exposures (asbestos, diesel) may synergistically drive epigenetic state transitions</li>
                <li>Cell turnover rate in bronchial epithelium affects maintenance and dilution of epigenetic marks</li>
                <li>Age-related epigenetic drift (background methylation changes with aging) may interact with smoking-induced changes, potentially explaining age-dependent susceptibility</li>
                <li>Stem/progenitor cells in bronchial epithelium may be particularly susceptible to stable epigenetic alterations that propagate through daughter cells</li>
                <li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other smoking-related lung diseases show overlapping epigenetic changes, confounding cancer-specific signatures</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Smoking causes hypomethylation of CpG sites in AHRR and F2RL3 genes; methylation levels at these loci correlate with cumulative smoking exposure (pack-years) and with lung cancer risk prospectively <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>PM2.5 exposure induces ROS production which activates Akt signaling, leading to upregulation of DNMT3B expression; DNMT3B catalyzes hypermethylation of the TP53 tumor suppressor promoter, reducing p53 expression and impairing DNA damage response and apoptosis in bronchial epithelial cells <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.1" class="evidence-link">[e110.1]</a> </li>
    <li>PM2.5 exposure downregulates miR-182, miR-185, and miR-802 expression and induces lncRNA loc146880; these non-coding RNA changes lead to upregulation of target oncogenes (SLC30A1, SERPINB2, AKR1C1) and activation of pro-transformation pathways (Rnd3), promoting neoplastic transformation in vitro <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.2" class="evidence-link">[e110.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Non-cancerous lung tissue from smokers shows altered gene expression profiles ('field effect' or 'preparation' of tissue), such that fewer additional molecular changes are required for progression to tumorigenesis compared to tissue from never-smokers <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Epigenetic changes (AHRR, F2RL3 hypomethylation) provide a mechanistic link between cumulative smoking exposure and increased lung cancer risk; these methylation signatures are detectable in peripheral blood and predict future cancer risk <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>PM2.5 is a heterogeneous mixture (black carbon, metals, PAHs, nitrate, sulfate) that penetrates deep into alveoli and is associated epidemiologically with increased lung cancer incidence; mechanistic studies show PM2.5 causes oxidative stress, inflammation, and epigenetic/genotoxic changes <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.0" class="evidence-link">[e110.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Source-specific PM2.5 composition (traffic, biomass combustion) modifies biological effects; different PM2.5 chemical components have different oxidative potentials and capacities to induce epigenetic changes <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.6" class="evidence-link">[e110.6]</a> </li>
    <li>PM2.5 chemical composition varies by source (metals from e-waste, PAHs from traffic, sulfur/silicon from truck exhaust), producing source-specific epigenetic patterns and differential oxidative potential; this explains heterogeneity in PM2.5 effects <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.6" class="evidence-link">[e110.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Repeated low-dose PM2.5 exposure (chronic exposure model, not acute high-dose) increases DNMT3B activity via ROS-Akt pathway, leading to TP53 promoter hypermethylation; this distinguishes chronic environmental exposure effects from acute experimental exposures <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.1" class="evidence-link">[e110.1]</a> </li>
    <li>PM2.5 induces cellular autophagy which can be cytoprotective by removing damaged organelles; genetic or molecular alterations affecting autophagy (e.g., HDAC3 deletion in mice) can attenuate PM2.5-induced lung injury, indicating epigenetic modifiers of cellular response to PM2.5 <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.7" class="evidence-link">[e110.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Ambient PM2.5 is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by IARC; long-term PM2.5 exposure acts additively or synergistically with tobacco exposure through oxidative stress and chronic inflammation mechanisms <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.5" class="evidence-link">[e65.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While individual components (AHRR/F2RL3 methylation, field cancerization concept, PM2.5 carcinogenicity) are well-established, the integration into a mechanistic state-transition model with specific molecular pathways (ROS-Akt-DNMT3B, miRNA networks) and explicit predictions about inter-individual susceptibility and co-exposure effects represents a novel organizational framework closely related to but extending beyond existing epigenetic cancer theories.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Smoking-associated DNA methylation changes at AHRR and F2RL3 loci have been extensively documented through epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and replicated across multiple cohorts. The concept of field cancerization in tobacco-exposed respiratory epithelium was originally proposed by Slaughter et al. (1953) for oral epithelium and has been applied to lung. PM2.5-induced oxidative stress and inflammation are well-established mechanisms.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The integration of multiple epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation at specific loci, specific miRNA/lncRNA changes, TP53 silencing via ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway) into a unified 'epigenetic priming' framework that explicitly explains differential susceptibility among smokers is novel. The mechanistic connection between PM2.5 co-exposure and epigenetic state establishment via the ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway represents a specific molecular pathway not previously integrated into field cancerization models. The framing as a stable 'state transition' with explicit consideration of entry probability modulated by genetic background (metabolic, repair genes) and co-exposures is a novel synthesis.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Epigenetic Memory and Reversibility Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Smoking-induced epigenetic changes exhibit 'memory' through cell divisions due to maintenance DNA methylation (DNMT1 copying methylation patterns to daughter strands), chromatin state inheritance (histone modifications propagated through cell division), and transcriptional feedback loops (epigenetically altered gene expression maintaining itself). This epigenetic memory explains temporal risk dynamics after smoking cessation: (1) Lung cancer risk decreases gradually over years-to-decades after quitting rather than immediately, because the pro-carcinogenic epigenetic state persists despite elimination of tobacco exposure; (2) Former heavy smokers retain significantly elevated risk compared to never-smokers even decades after cessation, due to incomplete reversion of epigenetic changes; (3) Methylation levels at smoking-associated loci (AHRR, F2RL3) partially revert toward never-smoker levels with time since cessation, but reversion is slow and often incomplete; (4) The rate and completeness of epigenetic reversion varies by locus (locus-specific reversion kinetics), by individual (genetic variants in TET demethylases, cell turnover rates), and by co-exposures (persistent PM2.5 exposure may maintain epigenetic changes despite smoking cessation). Quantitatively, methylation reversion follows complex kinetics with some loci showing faster reversion than others, and smoking cessation epidemiology shows risk reduction continues for 10-20+ years after quitting.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to: (1) Former smokers (ex-smokers) at any time after cessation; (2) Explains post-cessation risk dynamics and the persistent elevation of lung cancer risk in ex-smokers versus never-smokers; (3) Measurable epigenetic changes in blood and tissue; (4) Time scale of years-to-decades for reversion processes. Most relevant for: Understanding why cessation is protective but incompletely so; predicting individual post-cessation risk based on methylation profiles; identifying high-risk ex-smokers with persistent epigenetic abnormalities. Excludes: Active smokers (covered by Epigenetic Priming Law); never-smokers; immediate post-cessation period (hours-days) where behavioral/physiological changes dominate.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Reversion kinetics differ substantially by CpG locus: some sites (particularly at AHRR) show detectable reversion within years, while others may be more stable/persistent</li>
                <li>Active demethylation by TET enzymes versus passive dilution through cell division without maintenance methylation contribute differentially to reversion; genetic variants in TET1/2/3 may influence reversion rate</li>
                <li>Cell turnover rate in bronchial epithelium affects how quickly epigenetic changes are diluted in the tissue; slower turnover in stem/progenitor populations may maintain epigenetic memory longer</li>
                <li>Co-exposures can impede reversion: persistent PM2.5 or occupational carcinogen exposure after smoking cessation may maintain some epigenetic changes (e.g., continued TP53 hypermethylation via PM2.5-DNMT3B pathway)</li>
                <li>Age at cessation may influence reversion efficiency: younger individuals may have more active TET-mediated demethylation or faster epithelial turnover facilitating reversion</li>
                <li>Chromatin state memory (histone modifications, chromatin accessibility) may persist even if DNA methylation partially reverts, maintaining some aspects of the primed state</li>
                <li>Clonal expansion of cells with stable epigenetic alterations (particularly in stem/progenitor populations) may resist dilution and maintain epigenetic memory at tissue level</li>
                <li>Second-hand smoke exposure or e-cigarette use after cessation may slow reversion or maintain partial epigenetic changes</li>
                <li>Individuals with genetic variants in epigenetic machinery (DNMT, TET, histone modifiers) may show different reversion kinetics</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Smoking cessation reduces lung cancer risk progressively over time, approaching but not fully reaching never-smoker risk levels even decades after quitting; continuous smokers face 20-50× excess risk versus never-smokers, and risk reduction continues for 10-20+ years post-cessation <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.0" class="evidence-link">[e65.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Methylation levels at smoking-associated CpG sites (AHRR, F2RL3) increase toward never-smoker levels with increasing time since smoking cessation; methylation measured in blood serves as a biomarker of exposure with temporal dynamics reflecting reversion <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Epigenetic signatures (AHRR, F2RL3 hypomethylation) provide a mechanistic link between cumulative smoking exposure and persistent increased lung cancer risk; these changes partially revert after cessation, explaining gradual risk reduction <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Former smokers show intermediate methylation patterns between current smokers and never-smokers at smoking-associated loci, consistent with incomplete reversion <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Smoking cessation is associated with restoration of methylation toward never-smoker patterns at AHRR and F2RL3 loci and with reduced lung cancer risk over time; this temporal correlation supports epigenetic memory as a mechanism of persistent risk <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.5" class="evidence-link">[e67.5]</a> </li>
    <li>PM2.5 exposure continues to drive TP53 promoter hypermethylation via the ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway; in ex-smokers with ongoing PM2.5 exposure, this pathway may maintain tumor suppressor silencing despite smoking cessation <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.1" class="evidence-link">[e110.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Duration of smoking (cumulative exposure) is identified as the most influential factor for lung cancer risk, more so than intensity alone; this suggests that long-duration exposure establishes more stable epigenetic changes that persist after cessation <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.0" class="evidence-link">[e65.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Temporal lag of several decades exists between population smoking prevalence peaks and lung cancer incidence peaks, consistent with slow accumulation and incomplete reversion of pro-carcinogenic changes <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.0" class="evidence-link">[e65.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying observations about cessation-associated risk reduction and methylation reversion are well-established in the literature. However, the mechanistic framing as a quantitative kinetic law explaining reversion dynamics through specific cellular processes (maintenance methylation, TET-mediated demethylation, cell turnover, co-exposure effects), with explicit predictions about inter-individual variation and modifiable factors, represents a novel synthesis that extends existing epigenetic cancer frameworks with specific mechanistic detail.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The epidemiological observation that smoking cessation gradually reduces lung cancer risk over years-to-decades is well-documented (e.g., Peto et al. 2000). Smoking-associated DNA methylation changes and their partial reversion after cessation have been demonstrated in multiple prospective cohort studies and EWAS analyses. The concept of maintenance methylation by DNMT1 is a fundamental principle of epigenetics.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation as an 'epigenetic memory law' that mechanistically explains the slow reversion kinetics via specific processes (DNMT1 maintenance methylation, chromatin state inheritance, transcriptional feedback, cell turnover dynamics) and quantitatively predicts incomplete reversion explaining persistent ex-smoker risk is novel. The integration of PM2.5 co-exposure as a factor maintaining epigenetic changes (via ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway) despite smoking cessation, and the explicit prediction of inter-individual variation in reversion rates based on genetic variants (TET enzymes) and biological factors (epithelial turnover rate, age at cessation) represents a novel mechanistic framework.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Among ex-smokers with equivalent pack-year exposure and equivalent quit duration, those with persistent AHRR and F2RL3 hypomethylation (below median reversion) measured in peripheral blood will have 2-3× higher risk of subsequent lung cancer diagnosis compared to those who have reverted to near never-smoker methylation levels (above median reversion).</li>
                <li>Light smokers (<20 pack-years) who develop lung cancer will show more extensive epigenetic alterations in bronchial epithelium (measured by methylation arrays on bronchial brushings/biopsies) compared to light smokers with equivalent exposure who do not develop cancer, identifying them as 'epigenetic high responders' with greater susceptibility to establishing pro-carcinogenic epigenetic states per unit exposure.</li>
                <li>Ex-smokers with continued high residential PM2.5 exposure (>15 μg/m³ annual average) will show slower reversion of smoking-associated methylation changes compared to ex-smokers with low PM2.5 exposure (<10 μg/m³), and will have higher lung cancer incidence, due to PM2.5 maintaining the ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway and TP53 hypermethylation.</li>
                <li>Single-cell methylation profiling of bronchial epithelium from current smokers will reveal discrete subpopulations of cells with extensive epigenetic alterations coexisting with less-altered cells; smokers who subsequently develop lung cancer will show larger fractions of highly-altered cell subpopulations at baseline, and these subpopulations will be clonally expanded.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal blood methylation measurements (AHRR, F2RL3) in current smokers sampled every 2-3 years will show that individuals with progressive hypomethylation over time (increasing epigenetic dysregulation) have higher subsequent lung cancer risk than those with stable methylation levels despite continued smoking, indicating dynamic epigenetic susceptibility.</li>
                <li>Genetic variants in TET2 and TET3 demethylase genes will associate with different rates of methylation reversion after smoking cessation: individuals with reduced-function TET variants will show slower reversion kinetics and higher persistent post-cessation lung cancer risk.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pharmacological intervention with low-dose DNA methylation inhibitors (e.g., decitabine at sub-cytotoxic doses) or histone deacetylase inhibitors in high-risk ex-smokers with persistent hypermethylation of TP53 and other tumor suppressors will accelerate reversion of methylation patterns toward never-smoker levels, reduce progression of pre-malignant bronchial lesions (dysplasia), and decrease lung cancer incidence over 5-10 years of follow-up. If effective, this would validate epigenetic state as a therapeutically targetable causal mechanism.</li>
                <li>CRISPR-based targeted epigenetic editing (dCas9-TET or dCas9-DNMT3A fusion proteins) to experimentally restore normal methylation patterns at AHRR, F2RL3, and TP53 loci in patient-derived bronchial epithelial organoids or xenografts will reduce transformation frequency when subsequently exposed to tobacco carcinogens or PM2.5, definitively proving causality of these specific epigenetic changes in mediating susceptibility.</li>
                <li>Monozygotic twin pairs discordant for smoking history and duration will show smoking-associated methylation differences in peripheral blood and (if obtainable) bronchial tissue, and within-pair differences in methylation profiles (particularly at AHRR, F2RL3, TP53) will predict which twin develops lung cancer better than smoking history alone, proving that individual epigenetic susceptibility (independent of genetic sequence) modifies risk.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal epigenetic profiling (repeated blood sampling every 1-2 years for 10+ years) in high-risk smokers will reveal that individuals who eventually develop lung cancer show progressive multi-loci epigenetic dysregulation (coordinated changes across multiple smoking-associated loci) beginning 5-10 years before clinical diagnosis, enabling early detection and interception strategies.</li>
                <li>Pregnancy during or shortly after smoking exposure will result in trans-generational epigenetic effects, with offspring of mothers who smoked showing partially inherited methylation patterns at specific loci (particularly imprinted genes and smoking-associated loci) and altered lung cancer susceptibility in adulthood, potentially mediated through in-utero epigenetic programming.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that methylation patterns at AHRR and F2RL3 in peripheral blood or bronchial tissue do not differ between ex-smokers who develop lung cancer and those who remain cancer-free (matched for pack-years and time since cessation) would challenge the Epigenetic Field Cancerization Law's prediction that persistent epigenetic alterations increase cancer risk.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that methylation reversion kinetics after smoking cessation are identical across all individuals (no inter-individual variation) regardless of genetic background, age at cessation, or co-exposures would contradict the Epigenetic Memory Law's prediction that reversion rates vary based on biological and environmental factors.</li>
                <li>Showing that smoking cessation produces immediate (within 3-6 months) complete reversion of all smoking-associated methylation changes to never-smoker levels would challenge the Epigenetic Memory Law's central premise of slow, incomplete reversion explaining persistent elevated risk decades after quitting.</li>
                <li>Finding that bronchial epithelium from smokers shows no field cancerization effect (methylation patterns and gene expression profiles are identical to those from never-smokers when sampled away from tumor sites) would refute the concept of tissue-wide epigenetic priming.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that lung cancer risk in ex-smokers drops to never-smoker levels within 2-3 years of cessation (contradicting well-established epidemiology showing decades-long elevated risk) would challenge the entire premise of epigenetic memory maintaining cancer susceptibility after exposure cessation.</li>
                <li>Finding that experimentally blocking the ROS-Akt-DNMT3B pathway in bronchial epithelial cells does not prevent PM2.5-induced TP53 promoter hypermethylation would refute the proposed mechanistic pathway.</li>
                <li>Showing that TET enzyme genetic variants do not associate with differences in methylation reversion rates after cessation or with differential post-cessation lung cancer risk would challenge predictions about genetic modulation of epigenetic memory.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not mechanistically explain which individuals (among equal-exposure smokers) will readily establish stable pro-carcinogenic epigenetic states versus those who remain epigenetically resistant; genetic susceptibility is mentioned but specific gene variants beyond DNMT/TET are not detailed. </li>
    <li>Histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K9me3, etc.) and chromatin accessibility changes are mentioned as part of the epigenetic state but are not mechanistically detailed or linked to specific evidence; the theory focuses primarily on DNA methylation and non-coding RNAs. </li>
    <li>The quantitative relationship between peripheral blood methylation (commonly measured) and target tissue (bronchial epithelium) methylation is assumed but not proven; blood methylation serves as a surrogate biomarker but the correlation with lung tissue states needs validation. </li>
    <li>Sex differences in epigenetic responses to smoking are not addressed; women and men may have different susceptibility to establishing epigenetic changes or different reversion kinetics. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address epigenetic effects of other tobacco/nicotine delivery methods (chewing tobacco, e-cigarettes, heated tobacco products) which may have different epigenetic profiles than conventional cigarette smoking. </li>
    <li>Interaction between age-related epigenetic drift (background accumulation of methylation changes with aging independent of smoking) and smoking-induced changes is mentioned but not mechanistically integrated. </li>
    <li>The role of epigenetic changes in cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells versus bulk tumor or normal tissue is not addressed; epigenetic alterations in rare stem/progenitor populations may be particularly important. </li>
