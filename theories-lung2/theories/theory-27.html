                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Transcription-factor and cytoskeletal-motility rewiring as an invasion-first driver-negative program (revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A subset of RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas may progress by (i) perturbing transcriptional cell-state regulators (e.g., ZKSCAN1, POU4F2) that are statistically selected in LUAD and can be mutually exclusive with canonical MAPK/RTK drivers, and (ii) acquiring noncanonical alterations in cytoskeletal/motility signaling (e.g., Rho-GEF/ROCK axis via ASEF and ROCK1 rearrangements). Rather than creating strong early oncogene addiction, these lesions may primarily increase phenotypic plasticity, invasion, and dissemination competence. Late endogenous mutational processes (especially APOBEC and other C→T/transition-dominated signatures enriched in subclones) provide ongoing diversification that can generate metastasis-seeding subclones and allow selection of invasion-enhancing variants. This theory is explicitly about a progression/invasion-centered route in tumors that appear driver-negative by coding-driver panels and may require WGS/RNA-seq to detect relevant events.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Statement/Laws)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: MEGS membership of a TF implies functional substitution for canonical RTK/RAS/RAF activation in a tumor subset</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If a transcriptional regulator gene is (a) recurrently and significantly mutated in lung adenocarcinoma and (b) part of a statistically significant mutually exclusive gene set (MEGS) with canonical RTK/RAS/RAF pathway drivers (e.g., EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, MET, NF1), then—within LUAD tumors lacking those canonical driver alterations—mutations in that transcriptional regulator are predicted to be under positive selection as a substitutive oncogenic program (e.g., via cell-state reprogramming, invasion, survival, or drug tolerance), rather than being purely passenger events.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to LUAD cohorts large enough for robust mutual-exclusivity inference and with reasonably complete ascertainment of RTK/RAS/RAF drivers (including point mutations, CNAs, fusions, and splice events where possible). Intended for interpreting driver-negative or RTK/RAS/RAF-negative subsets, not for claiming universal driver status in all LUAD contexts.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Mutual exclusivity can be induced by hidden stratification (e.g., smoking status, tumor subtype) or technical detection differences; MEGS membership is hypothesis-generating rather than proof of functional substitution.</li>
                <li>A transcription-factor alteration may function as a modifier (e.g., invasion/metastasis enhancer) rather than a true initiating driver even if mutually exclusive with canonical drivers.</li>
                <li>If canonical drivers are incompletely measured (e.g., WES-only without RNA/WGS), apparent exclusivity may be inflated by missed RTK fusions, splice alterations, or enhancer hijacking.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ZKSCAN1 is recurrently mutated in EAGLE LUAD (6/101; 5.9%) with predicted disruptive variants (nonsense/splice and zinc-finger missense) and replicates in pooled WES (MutSigCV p=0.029). <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.1" class="evidence-link">[e53.1]</a> </li>
    <li>ZKSCAN1 is reported as part of a highly significant mutually exclusive gene set with BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, MET and NF1 across 825 LUAD samples; the MEGS covers ~60.3% of patients, implying ZKSCAN1 tends to occur in tumors lacking those canonical RTK/RAS/RAF alterations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.1" class="evidence-link">[e53.1]</a> </li>
    <li>NF1 loss-of-function is itself a recurrent LUAD alteration (8–11% overall) and in cited series ~70% of NF1-mutant tumors have no other somatic alteration, consistent with alternative, nonredundant driver routes within the RTK/RAS/RAF landscape. <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.0" class="evidence-link">[e113.0]</a> </li>
    <li>POU4F2 is another recurrently and significantly mutated transcription factor in EAGLE (9/101; replicated MutSigCV p=1.3×10^-4), supporting the presence of TF-centric noncanonical mutational targets in LUAD beyond classic RTK/RAS/RAF oncogenes (even though MEGS evidence is specifically given for ZKSCAN1). <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying mutual-exclusivity concept is established, but applying it specifically to TF mutations as substitutes for RTK/RAS/RAF addiction in driver-negative LUAD, with an invasion/cell-state framing, is a new synthesis atop the provided evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Mutual exclusivity has long been used to infer pathway redundancy and nominate alternative drivers in cancer genomics, and TF dysregulation is a recognized oncogenic mechanism.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This statement formalizes an explicit inference rule for driver-negative LUAD: MEGS membership of a recurrently mutated TF (exemplified by ZKSCAN1) predicts a substitutive oncogenic program that need not manifest as direct MAPK hyperactivation, emphasizing cell-state/invasion as plausible substitutes.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 1: Motility-pathway structural or coding alterations contribute to progression in oncogene-negative LUAD and are expected to be rare, heterogeneous, and WGS/RNA-dependent to detect</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In LUAD tumors lacking identifiable canonical RTK/RAS/RAF driver alterations by standard exonic hotspot screening, rare but potentially activating alterations affecting cytoskeletal/motility regulators (e.g., Rho-GEFs and Rho/ROCK kinases) can increase tumor fitness primarily by enhancing invasion/migration and metastatic competence. These alterations are predicted to show (i) low recurrence at the exact-gene level (many private events), (ii) enrichment among tumors that appear driver-negative on WES-only panels, and (iii) closer association with progression endpoints and subclonal diversification than with early clonal dominance.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to the subset of LUAD classified as RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative by comprehensive profiling, and especially to cohorts using WGS (for multi-exon duplications and other SVs) and/or deep sequencing suited to detect subclonal events. Intended as a progression model (invasion/metastasis) rather than a universal initiation model.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>ASEF’s statistical signal is cohort-dependent and non-replicated in pooled analyses; ASEF may be a false positive, a population-specific signal, or a modifier rather than a driver.</li>
                <li>A motility alteration alone may be insufficient for tumor formation; cooperating survival/cell-cycle alterations (e.g., PI3K activation, anti-apoptosis) may be necessary but are not required by this statement.</li>
                <li>Structural motility alterations may be missed by WES; negative findings in WES-only cohorts are not strong evidence of absence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ASEF (ARHGEF4), a Rho-GEF involved in cytoskeletal regulation and migration, was identified as significantly mutated in the EAGLE cohort (MutSig p=3.1×10^-5) but did not replicate as significant in pooled TCGA+Broad WES (MutSigCV p=0.46), consistent with heterogeneity/context dependence expected for progression-leaning motility alterations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.2" class="evidence-link">[e53.2]</a> </li>
    <li>A large in-frame multi-exon duplication of ROCK1 (19-exon duplication) was detected by WGS in a LUAD tumor described as lacking mutations in canonical oncogenes, providing a concrete example of a structural (WGS-detectable) motility-pathway candidate alteration in an oncogene-negative context. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.2" class="evidence-link">[e54.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Endogenous mutational processes (APOBEC and C→T transitions) are enriched in subclonal mutations (APOBEC 13.2% subclonal vs 8.0% clonal; extremely significant) and these endogenous signatures associate with increased distant metastasis risk, supporting the idea that progression traits often arise late/subclonally rather than as early clonal oncogene addictions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The EAGLE study reports that >20% of tumors lacked nonsynonymous mutations in previously known LUAD drivers, motivating alternative mechanisms (including noncanonical mutated genes and fusions) that could include motility/invasion-related events missed by standard driver lists. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.2" class="evidence-link">[e53.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.5" class="evidence-link">[e53.5]</a> </li>
    <li>WGS-based work in LUAD identifies rare structural rearrangements/duplications in kinase or signaling genes in tumors without canonical oncogene mutations (e.g., ROCK1 duplication), illustrating that SV discovery expands candidate mechanisms in driver-negative tumors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.2" class="evidence-link">[e54.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The component ideas exist, but the specific, testable framing for driver-negative LUAD—rare WGS-detectable motility SVs plus late subclonal mutagenesis as a progression engine—is a new synthesis from the provided evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Rho/ROCK signaling is widely implicated in invasion/metastasis biology, and subclonal diversification has been linked to progression in many cancers.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law ties together (i) driver-negative ascertainment bias (WES-only vs WGS), (ii) expected low gene-level recurrence/private structural events in motility pathways, and (iii) a temporal prediction that these act as late progression drivers aligned with subclonal mutagenesis signatures in LUAD.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In LUAD RNA-seq cohorts restricted to RTK/RAS/RAF-negative tumors (after comprehensive fusion/splice/CNA calling), ZKSCAN1-mutant tumors will show consistent deregulation of invasion/motility and cell-state programs (e.g., ECM remodeling, adhesion, EMT-related gene sets) more than classical MAPK transcriptional output, relative to RTK/RAS/RAF-driven tumors.</li>
                <li>Driver-negative LUADs with high subclonal APOBEC activity will show increased intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity and a higher rate of acquiring motility/invasion-related subclonal mutations/SVs at progression compared with driver-positive LUADs matched for stage.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>CRISPR knock-in of representative ZKSCAN1 zinc-finger–disrupting mutations into driver-negative LUAD organoids will increase invasion in 3D matrices and metastatic colonization in vivo without necessarily increasing 2D proliferation; if true, ZKSCAN1 becomes a mechanistic driver of invasion-first LUAD.</li>
                <li>ROCK1-duplication (or analogous Rho/ROCK-activating SV) tumors will exhibit selective in vivo vulnerability to ROCK pathway inhibition (e.g., reduced invasion/metastasis burden more than primary-tumor shrinkage), defining a new therapeutic niche for a subset of driver-negative LUAD.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If, after rigorous adjustment for tumor purity/subtype/smoking and comprehensive driver calling, ZKSCAN1 mutations do not associate with any reproducible expression program or phenotypic signature (invasion, plasticity, survival), then MEGS-based substitution is likely reflecting confounding rather than function.</li>
                <li>If engineered ROCK1 multi-exon duplication does not increase ROCK signaling output (e.g., phospho-MLC2) or invasion/migration in LUAD models, then the proposed motility-SV mechanism is weakened and the duplication may be passenger.</li>
                <li>If driver-negative LUAD progression/metastasis is not associated with increased subclonal APOBEC/transition signatures (or if those signatures are not enriched in metastatic subclones), then the proposed synergy between invasion rewiring and late endogenous mutagenesis is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Actionable kinase drivers that resolve apparent driver-negativity via structural or splice events (e.g., KIF5B-RET, ROS1 fusions, MET exon 14 skipping/amplification, ERBB2 super-enhancer activation, EGFR Δex25-26) are alternative explanations for many 'driver-negative' cases and are outside the invasion-first mechanism proposed here. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.2" class="evidence-link">[e113.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.1" class="evidence-link">[e113.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.1" class="evidence-link">[e51.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Non-motility, non-TF alternative driver modules in driver-negative LUAD—such as coordinated PI3K/cell-cycle CNAs (EMSY/CCND1/PIK3CA with CDKN2A anticorrelation), PTEN loss, and RB1-CCND1 dysregulation—are not explained by this invasion-first TF/motility program. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.4" class="evidence-link">[e52.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.1" class="evidence-link">[e52.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Epigenetic/RNA-deregulation tumor suppressor routes (e.g., ARID1A truncations, RBM10 truncations, U2AF1 p.S34F) provide non-RTK mechanisms not covered by this invasion-first subset theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.5" class="evidence-link">[e54.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.4" class="evidence-link">[e54.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> </li>
