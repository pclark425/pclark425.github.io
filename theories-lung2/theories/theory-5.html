                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why only some cigarette smokers develop lung cancer while others do not, despite smoking being a strong risk factor, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Differential lung cancer susceptibility among smokers arises substantially from inter-individual variation in adaptive and innate immune surveillance capacity. Polymorphisms in antigen-processing machinery (ERAP1/2, immunoproteasome subunits PSMB8/PSMB9, TAP transporters), HLA class I/II diversity (evolutionary divergence affecting peptide repertoire breadth), and NK cell inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions (KIR-HLA) determine whether tobacco-induced neoantigens are efficiently presented and recognized. Tumors that arise in smokers represent 'immune escape variants' that evaded elimination; individuals with robust antigen presentation (broad peptide repertoires via diverse HLA alleles and optimal ERAP trimming) and weak NK inhibitory signaling eliminate transformed clones before clinical cancer develops, while those with narrow peptide repertoires, suboptimal trimming, or strong inhibitory interactions permit escape. The effects are exposure-dependent: ERAP and other immune gene associations differ between smokers and never-smokers because the substrate peptides (derived from different mutational signatures) differ, and the relative importance of immune surveillance varies with mutational burden.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Neoantigen Presentation Breadth Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The breadth of tumor-derived peptide repertoire presented by HLA class I molecules is determined by: (1) HLA allelic diversity (higher evolutionary divergence = broader peptide-binding specificity), (2) ERAP1/2 trimming specificity (allotype combinations determine peptide length/sequence optimization for each individual's HLA alleles), and (3) immunoproteasome activity (PSMB8/9 variants affect peptide generation quality). Individuals with greater presentation breadth have higher probability of presenting immunogenic tumor neoantigens, enabling CD8+ T cell recognition and elimination of tobacco-damaged clones. The effect is substrate-dependent: ERAP allotypes that are optimal for trimming peptides derived from tobacco-signature mutations (C>A transversions, smoking-associated mutational patterns) may differ from those optimal for never-smoker tumor peptides (APOBEC-associated mutations, spontaneous mutations).</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to adaptive immune recognition of tumor cells in the context of tobacco-induced mutagenesis generating neoantigens; most relevant for tumors with moderate-to-high mutational burden (typical of smoking-related NSCLC with >5-10 mutations/Mb); requires functional CD8+ T cells and intact antigen presentation machinery; excludes immunodeficient individuals, those on immunosuppressive therapy, tumors with complete HLA loss, and very low mutation-burden tumors (<1 mutation/Mb) that generate few neoantigens. Effects are HLA-allele-specific and may differ substantially between ethnic populations with different HLA allele frequency distributions (e.g., differences between Polish Caucasian and Chinese populations noted in evidence).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>ERAP effects are HLA-allele-dependent: specific ERAP-HLA combinations determine functional outcomes; studies without HLA stratification may miss associations or show null results (as noted for unstratified ERAP1 analyses)</li>
                <li>ERAP1/2 functional effects depend on substrate peptide sequences, which differ between smokers (tobacco mutational signature: C>A transversions) and never-smokers (EGFR mutations, APOBEC signature, other patterns) - explaining opposite-direction associations by smoking status</li>
                <li>ERAP2 rs2248374 G allele causes nonsense-mediated decay and absent functional ERAP2 protein; heterozygotes (A/G) express ERAP2, homozygotes (G/G) do not, fundamentally changing the peptide trimming machinery from ERAP1+ERAP2 heterodimers to ERAP1 homodimers only</li>
                <li>Heterozygosity at ERAP1 or PSMB9 may confer advantage (heterosis) by enabling co-expression of two enzyme variants with different substrate specificities, broadening the peptide repertoire (ERAP1 rs27044 CG and PSMB9 rs17587 GA heterozygotes showed better outcomes)</li>
                <li>Very high mutation burden tumors (>20 mutations/Mb, as in some heavy smokers) may generate so many subclonal neoantigens that they overwhelm presentation capacity or dilute immune responses across too many targets</li>
                <li>Tumors can undergo immunoediting and lose the most immunogenic neoantigens even if initially presented, particularly under selection pressure from immune responses or immunotherapy</li>
                <li>Effects vary by ethnic background: ERAP1 allele frequencies and functional consequences differ between populations (noted differences between Chinese and Polish cohorts), affecting detectability and direction of associations</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ERAP1 polymorphisms (rs26653, rs26618, rs2287987, rs30187, rs27044) associate with NSCLC risk with opposite effects in smokers vs never-smokers; e.g., rs26653 CC in smokers OR=2.56 (95% CI 1.07-10.1) but GC in never-smokers OR=0.51 (95% CI 0.25-0.97), CC OR=0.42 (0.06-1.17) <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP1 rs30187 shows similar opposite-direction effects: in smokers CT/CC OR≈1.17 (0.81-1.72) and TT/CC OR≈1.39 (0.75-2.94); in never-smokers CT/CC OR≈0.57 (0.29-1.09) and TT/CC OR≈0.32 (0.09-0.77) <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP1 variants encode allotypes with different enzymatic activities and substrate specificities that alter trimming of peptides in the ER and thus the repertoire of peptides presented by HLA class I molecules, affecting anti-tumor CD8+ T cell recognition and NK-cell interactions <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Global ERAP1 test across all measured SNPs was highly significant: χ²(10)=32.6, p=0.000314, indicating that ERAP1 variation as a whole strongly associates with NSCLC risk <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP1 haplotype rs26653C-rs26618T-rs2287987T-rs30187T-rs27044G-rs2248374G (with functional ERAP2) decreased risk ~2-fold in never-smokers (OR=0.52) <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP2 rs2248374 A allele yields normal ERAP2 expression; rs2248374G causes nonsense-mediated decay and absent/undetectable ERAP2; presence or absence of functional ERAP2 alters ERAP1:ERAP2 dimer formation and peptide trimming capabilities <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.1" class="evidence-link">[e70.1]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP2 presence (functional, rs2248374A) sometimes abolished ERAP1-only effects: identical ERAP1 haplotypes with ERAP2-G vs ERAP2-A had different disease associations, demonstrating ERAP1 x ERAP2 haplotype interactions <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.1" class="evidence-link">[e70.1]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP1 low-activity haplotype increased risk in never-smokers only when ERAP2 was non-functional, suggesting compensatory mechanisms when both enzymes are present <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.1" class="evidence-link">[e70.1]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP1 rs27044 heterozygotes (CG) had higher chance of better chemotherapy response: OR=1.76 (95% CI 0.92-3.33), p=0.0698 (adjusted model); complete response 26.7% vs 16.9% in homozygotes; progressive disease 20.0% vs 30.12% in homozygotes <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.7" class="evidence-link">[e70.7]</a> </li>
    <li>PSMB9 rs17587 GA heterozygotes had lower mean disease stage in some age strata (mean stage ~2.49 vs 3.04 in younger homozygotes), suggesting heterozygote advantage in disease progression <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.7" class="evidence-link">[e70.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.2" class="evidence-link">[e70.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Co-expression of two enzyme allotypes (e.g., different ERAP1 variants) in heterozygotes increases substrate range and may enable generation of otherwise absent immunogenic epitopes; likewise, heterozygosity in PSMB9 may broaden peptide generation <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.7" class="evidence-link">[e70.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Combined heterozygosity at PSMB9 and ERAP1 rs27044 associated with the strongest decline of stage with increasing age, demonstrating gene-gene interaction effects on clinical outcomes <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.7" class="evidence-link">[e70.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Immunoproteasome subunits (PSMB9/PSMB8) produce peptides better suited for TAP/HLA-I binding compared to constitutive proteasome; PSMB9/8 generate peptides with hydrophobic C-termini preferred by TAP and HLA-I <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.2" class="evidence-link">[e70.2]</a> </li>
    <li>PSMB9 rs17587 associated with disease stage differences (heterozygotes GA had lower mean stage than homozygotes in certain age groups), though no overall OR for disease risk was significant <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.2" class="evidence-link">[e70.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Variants in immunoproteasome or TAP function change the peptide repertoire; altered peptide sets can increase or decrease presentation of tumor neoantigens and so modulate CTL-mediated elimination of tumor cells and disease progression <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.2" class="evidence-link">[e70.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Greater HLA-I evolutionary divergence associated with improved immunosurveillance and better response to immune-checkpoint therapy in high-mutation tumors (broad HLA diversity enables recognition of more neoantigens) <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>HLA class I allotype variation determines which tumor-derived peptides are presented and therefore whether CTLs can recognize and kill tumor cells; HLA-I allotypes differ in peptide binding specificities <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.3" class="evidence-link">[e70.3]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP effects are HLA-dependent and would be diluted without HLA stratification; the functional consequence of an ERAP variant depends on which HLA alleles are present to bind the trimmed peptides <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.3" class="evidence-link">[e70.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Different neoantigen repertoires between smokers (high mutation burden, tobacco mutational signature) and never-smokers (lower burden, EGFR/other driver mutations) influence immunogenicity and tumor immune recognition; smokers have higher mutational burden producing more neoantigens <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.5" class="evidence-link">[e70.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Somatic driver mutation profile differs: EGFR mutations enriched in never-smokers while KRAS mutations (especially Gly12Cys and Gly12Val) enriched in smokers, producing different neoantigen sequences for immune recognition <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Differences in HLA-I allotypes and expression alter the set of peptides presented (immunopeptidome); combined with APM activity (ERAPs, proteasome, TAP), this defines whether immunogenic neoantigens are generated and presented, explaining inter-individual differences in immune elimination <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.3" class="evidence-link">[e70.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.4" class="evidence-link">[e67.4]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 1: NK Cell Inhibitory Checkpoint Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Natural killer cell-mediated elimination of tumor cells is governed by the balance of activating and inhibitory signals, with inhibitory KIR-HLA class I interactions providing dominant 'don't kill' signals. Individuals with weaker inhibitory interactions (KIR-HLA genotype combinations producing poor inhibition, such as absence of strong inhibitory KIRs or HLA ligands for inhibitory KIRs) have enhanced NK surveillance of tobacco-damaged cells with downregulated or altered HLA expression, reducing cancer risk. Smokers' tumors show more frequent HLA loss of heterozygosity (LOH) compared to never-smokers, particularly in high-mutation (mezzo-forte and forte) genomic subtypes; individuals with strong inhibitory KIR-HLA interactions cannot compensate via NK surveillance when HLA is lost, allowing tumor escape, while those with weak inhibitory interactions maintain NK-mediated elimination even when HLA is partially lost.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to innate immune surveillance of tumors via NK cells, particularly relevant for cells with HLA downregulation, HLA loss of heterozygosity, or altered HLA expression (common mechanisms in tobacco-related lung cancer, more frequent in smokers than never-smokers); complements adaptive (CTL) immunity; requires functional NK cells; excludes individuals with NK cell deficiencies, severe immunosuppression, or conditions where NK cells are absent or profoundly dysfunctional; most relevant in smoking-related NSCLC where HLA loss is more common.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>NK effects depend on specific KIR-HLA combinations; simple KIR genotyping or HLA typing alone may not predict functional NK inhibition—combinatorial KIR-HLA interaction analysis is necessary</li>
                <li>Tumor HLA loss (LOH) is more frequent in smokers (mezzo-forte/forte genomic subtypes with high mutation burden) than never-smokers, so KIR-HLA effects may be smoking-exposure-dependent and strongest in smoker populations</li>
                <li>Some tumors upregulate non-classical HLA molecules (HLA-E, HLA-G) that interact with different NK receptors (NKG2A/CD94 for HLA-E, LILRB1/KIR2DL4 for HLA-G), providing alternative inhibitory pathways that may bypass classical KIR-HLA interactions</li>
                <li>NK cell education (licensing) by self-HLA during development affects functional responsiveness; NK cells in individuals lacking inhibitory KIR ligands may be hyporesponsive</li>
                <li>Activating KIRs and other activating receptors (NKG2D, DNAM-1, natural cytotoxicity receptors) also contribute to the net signal; the balance of all activating and inhibitory signals determines outcome</li>
                <li>KIR gene content is highly variable (presence/absence polymorphism); some individuals lack certain KIR genes entirely, fundamentally altering their NK receptor repertoire</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Inhibitory KIR-HLA interactions can protect tumor cells from NK killing; certain KIR/HLA genotype combinations with weaker inhibitory interactions associated with better treatment outcomes <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.4" class="evidence-link">[e67.4]</a> </li>
    <li>HLA-I loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is more frequent in tumors from smokers compared to never-smokers; HLA-I LOH enables immune evasion especially from CTLs, making NK surveillance critical as a backup mechanism <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.4" class="evidence-link">[e67.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>HLA-I LOH was reported more frequently in smokers' lung tumors, particularly in 'mezzo-forte' and 'forte' genomic subtypes (high mutation burden categories) <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.4" class="evidence-link">[e67.4]</a> </li>
    <li>NK cells sense HLA-I downregulation via the 'missing-self' mechanism and can kill cells with reduced HLA expression that would otherwise evade CTL recognition <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.3" class="evidence-link">[e70.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Inhibitory KIR-HLA interactions are a form of immune checkpoint; strong inhibitory signals from KIR binding to self-HLA prevent NK activation, while loss of HLA removes the inhibitory signal and can trigger NK-mediated killing (unless other inhibitory signals dominate) <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.4" class="evidence-link">[e67.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Different somatic mutation patterns between smokers (higher mutational burden) and never-smokers produce different neoantigen loads and different selection pressures for HLA loss; smokers' high-mutation tumors have stronger selection for HLA loss to escape CTLs <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.5" class="evidence-link">[e70.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Greater HLA diversity (evolutionary divergence) associated with better immunotherapy response in high-mutation tumors, suggesting that in absence of HLA loss, diverse HLA is protective; but when HLA is lost, NK surveillance becomes critical <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying NK immunology is existing knowledge, but the application to explaining differential smoking-related lung cancer susceptibility with specific attention to smoking-induced HLA loss patterns creating exposure-dependent genetic effects, and predictions about when NK surveillance is most vs least important, is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The 'missing-self' hypothesis for NK cell recognition, the role of inhibitory KIR-HLA interactions in regulating NK function, and HLA loss as a tumor immune evasion mechanism are well-established in immunology. NK cells' role in cancer immunosurveillance is recognized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing as a smoking-exposure-dependent susceptibility determinant for lung cancer, with recognition that smokers' tumors have more frequent HLA loss (creating stronger selection for weak inhibitory KIR-HLA genotypes in smoker populations), and the testable prediction that KIR-HLA genotypes modify smoking-related cancer risk more strongly than never-smoker risk, with specific mechanistic explanation for the exposure-dependence, represents a novel application.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Immunogenicity-Exposure Interaction Law</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The strength of immune surveillance effects on cancer risk depends non-monotonically on mutational burden: (1) At very low mutation loads (<1-2 mutations/Mb, as in some never-smokers or very light smokers), few neoantigens are generated regardless of presentation efficiency, so immune gene effects are minimal because there is little substrate for immune recognition; (2) At moderate mutation burdens (5-20 mutations/Mb, typical of moderate smokers or individuals with some protective DNA repair capacity despite smoking), sufficient neoantigens are generated to enable immune surveillance, and genetic differences in presentation efficiency (HLA diversity, ERAP function, immunoproteasome) strongly determine whether transformed clones are eliminated—this is the range where immune gene associations are strongest; (3) At very high mutation loads (>20-40 mutations/Mb, heavy long-term smokers), the sheer number of mutations may overwhelm surveillance capacity, create too many subclonal neoantigens diluting responses, or drive rapid tumor evolution and immune evasion, reducing the relative importance of baseline immune genetic differences. This predicts immune gene associations will show inverted-U or threshold relationships with exposure, being strongest at moderate smoking levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to tobacco-induced lung carcinogenesis where mutation burden varies continuously with exposure dose and duration; requires tumors to have neoantigen generation capacity; most relevant for explaining gene-by-exposure interaction effects and why associations differ across smoking strata; applies to populations with sufficient exposure variation to span low, moderate, and high mutation burden ranges; excludes truly non-immunogenic tumors and situations where immune responses are completely absent.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Very high mutation burden may produce too many subclonal neoantigens (hundreds of private neoantigens per tumor region), diluting T cell responses across too many targets and preventing effective immune elimination</li>
                <li>Chronic high-level antigen exposure can lead to T cell exhaustion (upregulation of PD-1, TIM-3, LAG-3) independent of initial presentation quality, limiting the benefit of good antigen presentation in heavily exposed individuals</li>
                <li>Tumors can undergo immunoediting and selectively lose the most immunogenic neoantigens over time; this process is accelerated in high-mutation tumors, potentially masking immune gene effects</li>
                <li>Immune checkpoint upregulation (PD-L1, PD-L2, IDO) can override effective neoantigen presentation; in high-mutation tumors with strong checkpoint expression, presentation breadth may matter less</li>
                <li>The 'moderate exposure' range where immune effects are strongest will vary by population depending on background DNA repair capacity, metabolic activation/detoxification genotypes, and other modifiers</li>
                <li>In never-smokers with lung cancer, mutations arise from different sources (EGFR driver mutations, APOBEC mutagenesis, environmental exposures like radon or air pollution) producing different neoantigen qualities that may be more or less immunogenic per mutation</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ERAP1 polymorphism effects differ and often reverse direction between smokers (higher exposure/mutation burden) and never-smokers (lower burden), suggesting exposure-level-dependent immunogenicity; rs26653 CC harmful in smokers (OR=2.56) but protective variants (GC, CC) in never-smokers (OR=0.51, 0.42) <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ERAP1 rs30187 similarly shows opposite effects by smoking status: risk-increasing tendency in smokers, strongly protective in never-smokers (TT/CC OR=0.32 in never-smokers vs OR=1.39 in smokers) <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Strong gene-environment interaction between ERAP polymorphisms and smoking status, with effects often reversing direction; this is consistent with substrate-dependent trimming efficiency and different optimal ERAP variants for different mutational signatures <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DNA repair gene (ERCC1, XPD, XRCC1) effects appear stronger or detectable primarily at low-moderate exposure where genetic susceptibility is not overwhelmed by damage; genetic effects may manifest more at lower exposures (e.g., second-hand smoke in never-smokers) <a href="../results/extraction-result-69.html#e69.7" class="evidence-link">[e69.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-69.html#e69.8" class="evidence-link">[e69.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-64.html#e64.4" class="evidence-link">[e64.4]</a> </li>
    <li>ERCC1 rs11615 showed stronger association in non-smokers than smokers in subset analyses (non-smokers homozygous OR = 2.39; smokers OR = 2.16), suggesting genetic deficits in DNA repair have larger relative effect at lower tobacco exposure <a href="../results/extraction-result-69.html#e69.0" class="evidence-link">[e69.0]</a> </li>
    <li>XPA G23A protective effect most evident in current smokers and heavy smokers (>29 pack-years) but not in all strata, suggesting non-monotonic or threshold relationships <a href="../results/extraction-result-73.html#e73.0" class="evidence-link">[e73.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Smokers' tumors have higher mutational burden with many passenger mutations (median >10 mutations/Mb in smokers vs <5 in never-smokers in some cohorts); never-smokers have fewer total mutations but enrichment for driver mutations <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.5" class="evidence-link">[e70.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Different neoantigen repertoires between smokers (high burden, tobacco signature) and never-smokers (lower burden, EGFR/ALK/other drivers) influence immunogenicity; APM/ERAP effects interact with somatic mutation landscape to determine net immune recognition <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.5" class="evidence-link">[e70.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.4" class="evidence-link">[e67.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Greater HLA diversity associated with better response to immunotherapy specifically in high-mutation tumors (>10-20 mutations/Mb), suggesting immune surveillance becomes more effective when sufficient neoantigens are present but not overwhelmed <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>
    <li>APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis contributes to clustered hypermutation and is dynamic over tumor evolution; in smokers, relative decrease in smoking-related mutations over time corresponds with increasing APOBEC mutations, affecting neoantigen evolution and immune escape <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.6" class="evidence-link">[e67.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Approximately only 15% of smokers develop lung cancer despite high exposure, suggesting that at high exposure levels, additional factors beyond mutation generation (including immune surveillance) determine outcomes <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.6" class="evidence-link">[e70.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While component concepts (TMB, immunogenicity, gene-environment interaction) are established, the specific non-monotonic formulation predicting exposure-level-dependent genetic effect magnitudes with maximum effects at intermediate exposures, mechanistic explanations for the non-monotonicity, and testable predictions about effect reversals (ERAP effects opposite in smokers vs never-smokers) represents a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The relationship between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and immunotherapy response is established in immuno-oncology. The concept that neoantigen load affects immunogenicity is well-recognized. Gene-environment interactions in cancer susceptibility are documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation as a non-monotonic 'interaction law' predicting inverted-U relationships between immune gene effects and exposure level, with maximum genetic effects at moderate mutation burdens and specific, testable, quantitative predictions about where (at what exposure/mutation levels) immune gene associations will be strongest vs weakest, represents a novel framework. The mechanistic explanation for why effects reverse or disappear at extremes (too few neoantigens at low exposure, immune escape/exhaustion at high exposure) integrated with substrate-dependent ERAP function is novel.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Among smokers with equivalent pack-year histories (e.g., 40-60 pack-years) and matched DNA repair genotypes (e.g., wild-type XRCC1 and XPD), those with high HLA-I evolutionary divergence scores (top quartile, calculated as mean divergence across HLA-A, -B, -C loci) will have 40-60% lower lung cancer incidence than those with low divergence scores (bottom quartile), and this effect will be strongest in the moderate-exposure range (40-60 pack-years) and weaker in very heavy smokers (>80 pack-years)</li>
                <li>ERAP1/2 genotype associations with lung cancer risk will show opposite directions in light smokers (<20 pack-years) versus heavy smokers (>60 pack-years), with specific haplotypes (e.g., ERAP1 rs26653C-containing haplotypes) being risk-increasing in heavy smokers but protective or neutral in light smokers; the transition point will occur around 30-50 pack-years</li>
                <li>Ex-smokers who develop lung cancer will show higher rates of HLA class I loss of heterozygosity in their tumors (>50% of tumors with LOH) compared to never-smokers with lung cancer (<30% with LOH), and among ex-smoker cases, those with strong inhibitory KIR-HLA genotypes (e.g., KIR2DL1+ with HLA-C2 homozygosity) will be overrepresented compared to population frequencies</li>
                <li>Heterozygosity at ERAP1 key functional SNPs (rs27044, rs30187) and/or immunoproteasome loci (PSMB9 rs17587) will associate with better objective response rates (ORR) to immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) specifically in smoking-related lung cancers with high tumor mutational burden (>10 mutations/Mb), with heterozygotes showing ~1.5-2x higher ORR than homozygotes</li>
                <li>Peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity (measured by Shannon entropy or Gini coefficient from TCRβ sequencing) will be significantly higher in smokers who remain cancer-free compared to those who develop lung cancer when matched for age, sex, and pack-year exposure (mean difference ~15-25% higher diversity in cancer-free group), and this will correlate positively with HLA evolutionary divergence (r>0.3)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adoptive transfer of allogeneic NK cells from healthy donors with weak inhibitory KIR-HLA genotypes (e.g., absence of KIR2DL2/3 or presence only of activating KIRs) to patients with smoking-related advanced NSCLC showing HLA class I loss will produce better tumor control (progression-free survival, objective response rate) than transfer from donors with strong inhibitory genotypes (e.g., KIR3DL1+ with HLA-Bw4+); if true, this would validate NK surveillance as therapeutically relevant and genotype-dependent, potentially enabling donor selection for NK cell therapy</li>
                <li>Personalized neoantigen vaccination with peptides computationally optimized based on patient-specific ERAP1/2 genotype (predicting which peptide lengths and sequences will be optimally trimmed for the patient's ERAP allotypes and HLA alleles) will induce stronger CD8+ T cell responses (measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT, tetramer staining, and tumor infiltration) than 'one-size-fits-all' vaccines using standard peptide lengths in smokers with pre-malignant lesions or early-stage NSCLC, potentially enabling immune-based prevention or adjuvant therapy; optimal peptide design algorithms would need to incorporate ERAP kinetics</li>
                <li>In a chemoprevention trial enrolling high-risk smokers with dysplastic lesions, treatment with monoclonal antibodies blocking inhibitory KIR-HLA interactions (e.g., lirilumab blocking KIR2DL1/2/3, or IPH2101) will reduce progression from dysplasia to invasive carcinoma significantly more effectively in participants with strong inhibitory KIR-HLA genotypes (who have 'locked' NK cells) compared to those with weak inhibitory genotypes (who already have active NK surveillance); if validated, this would enable genotype-stratified prevention strategies</li>
                <li>CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of patient-derived tumor organoids to change ERAP1 from a risk-associated haplotype to a protective haplotype (e.g., converting rs26653 G>C in smoker tumors, or C>G in never-smoker tumors based on substrate differences) will measurably enhance their susceptibility to autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-mediated killing in vitro (increased killing at lower effector:target ratios), definitively proving the causal role of ERAP genotype in determining immunogenicity; this would require demonstrating that the edited tumors present different peptide repertoires (by mass spectrometry) that better match autologous TCR specificities</li>
                <li>Longitudinal immune monitoring of smokers in a prospective cohort (sampling peripheral blood every 6-12 months) will reveal that those who eventually develop lung cancer show progressive contraction of neoantigen-reactive T cell clones in circulation 1-3 years prior to clinical diagnosis (detectable by decrease in clonal diversity and/or loss of specific clones reactive to predicted mutation-associated neoantigens), and this immune exhaustion signature will be most pronounced in individuals with narrow HLA peptide-binding repertoires (low evolutionary divergence); if validated, this could enable earlier detection via immune surveillance signatures</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that lung cancer incidence is equivalent across all HLA evolutionary divergence quartiles when smokers are strictly stratified by pack-years and DNA repair genotypes would challenge the neoantigen presentation breadth law and suggest HLA diversity does not meaningfully affect immune surveillance capacity in this context</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that ERAP1 genotype effects on lung cancer risk are identical in direction and magnitude in smokers and never-smokers (e.g., same alleles protective in both groups) would contradict the substrate-dependent (mutational-signature-dependent) predictions and suggest ERAP effects are not driven by differential peptide trimming of tobacco-signature vs other mutations</li>
                <li>Showing that tumors with HLA loss of heterozygosity occur at equal frequency in lung cancer patients with weak inhibitory KIR-HLA interactions versus those with strong inhibitory interactions would challenge the NK checkpoint law's prediction that weak inhibition provides selective pressure against HLA loss (because NK cells can still kill HLA-low tumors), while strong inhibition allows HLA loss to confer escape</li>
                <li>Finding that immune gene associations (ERAP1, HLA diversity, immunoproteasome variants) are strongest in the highest smoking exposure groups (>80 pack-years, highest mutation burden) rather than moderate exposure groups (30-60 pack-years) would contradict the immunogenicity-exposure interaction law's prediction of inverted-U relationships and suggest immune surveillance remains fully effective even at very high mutation loads</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that peripheral blood T cell repertoire diversity measures (TCR sequencing), HLA diversity scores, and ERAP genotypes do not differ significantly between smokers who develop lung cancer and pack-year-matched smokers who remain cancer-free in a prospective cohort study would challenge the theory's premise that immune surveillance differences are detectible systemically and predictive of cancer development</li>
                <li>Finding that ERAP1/2 heterozygotes do not show better chemotherapy or immunotherapy responses compared to homozygotes in smoking-related NSCLC would challenge the heterozygote advantage hypothesis and suggest that co-expression of two ERAP variants does not meaningfully broaden peptide repertoires in vivo</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain why specific somatic driver mutations (EGFR activating mutations enriched in never-smokers vs KRAS mutations enriched in smokers) are differentially distributed beyond neoantigen burden differences; EGFR and KRAS mutations may have cell-of-origin differences or different relationships to tobacco exposure mechanisms not addressed here <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Chronic inflammation and cytokine milieu effects (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TGF-β) on promoting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis versus suppressing it are not mechanistically integrated; some inflammatory states may enhance immune surveillance while others promote tumor growth <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.7" class="evidence-link">[e67.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.3" class="evidence-link">[e110.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-110.html#e110.4" class="evidence-link">[e110.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in dampening anti-tumor immunity and their potential interaction with ERAP/HLA genotypes is not addressed; these cells can suppress CTL and NK responses regardless of neoantigen presentation quality </li>
    <li>Tumor microenvironment factors such as hypoxia, metabolic stress (glucose deprivation, lactate accumulation), and acidosis affecting antigen presentation machinery expression and function are not incorporated; these factors can downregulate HLA and antigen processing independent of genotype </li>
    <li>The temporal dynamics of immune surveillance (during initial transformation vs early tumor growth vs established tumors) and clonal evolution are not detailed; the theory focuses on elimination of early transformed clones but does not address later stages where established tumors undergo immunoediting </li>
    <li>Some APM gene polymorphisms (TAP1, TAP2, other components) showed no significant associations with NSCLC risk despite theoretical importance in antigen presentation, suggesting these components may not be rate-limiting or that functional variation at these loci is insufficient in the studied populations <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.2" class="evidence-link">[e70.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Age-related immune senescence effects (thymic involution, reduced naive T cell output, accumulation of exhausted/senescent T cells, NK cell dysfunction) that may interact with or overwhelm genetic differences in older populations (where most lung cancers occur) are not explicitly modeled </li>
    <li>Epigenetic silencing of antigen presentation machinery genes (via promoter methylation) in tumors as an immune evasion mechanism independent of germline genotype is not addressed </li>
    <li>The potential role of non-classical antigen presentation pathways (cross-presentation by dendritic cells, HLA class II presentation activating CD4+ T cells, presentation of non-mutated tumor-associated antigens) that may compensate for deficiencies in classical HLA class I presentation is not incorporated </li>
