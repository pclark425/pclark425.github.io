                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epigenetic-state–coupled mutagenesis creates late-emerging drivers and metastatic competence in driver-negative LUAD (revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A substantial fraction of lung adenocarcinomas classified as RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") by standard coding-driver criteria can still progress because their evolutionary engine is (i) ongoing endogenous mutagenesis that is temporally biased toward subclonal expansion and (ii) epigenetic state–dependent shaping of where/which mutations accumulate, partly via DNA repair capacity. In this view, methylation patterns (especially outside promoters) modulate CpG deamination- and adduct-linked mutation spectra, while APOBEC and other endogenous processes disproportionately generate late (subclonal) variants that can seed metastatic lineages. These processes do not replace discrete drivers; they increase the probability that late-arising functional hits (coding, splice, and potentially noncoding/regulatory) will occur and be selected even when early strong RTK/RAS/RAF coding drivers are absent.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Endogenous signatures are temporally enriched in subclones and predict metastasis risk</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinoma, APOBEC-mediated mutations are statistically enriched among subclonal (later) mutations relative to clonal (earlier) mutations, and higher burdens of endogenous transition-heavy spectra (including C→T transitions and APOBEC contributions) are associated with increased risk of distant metastasis; therefore, ongoing endogenous mutagenesis can act as a late-stage supplier of selectable variants (including potential drivers) that promote progression in tumors lacking early canonical proliferative signaling drivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Primary lung adenocarcinomas analyzed by WES with explicit subclonality inference that adjusts variant allele fractions for tumor purity and excludes regions affected by copy-number amplification/subclonal CNAs; clinical association claims apply to cohorts with metastasis follow-up and comparable covariate adjustment.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Tumors with extensive aneuploidy/whole-genome doubling or complex CNAs can reduce fidelity of VAF-based timing; enrichment should be re-estimated with CNA-aware methods.</li>
                <li>Associations with metastasis risk are observational and may be confounded by unmeasured factors (e.g., treatment, sampling of metastatic vs primary tissue); replication in independent longitudinal/multi-region cohorts is required.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Across 101 LUADs, APOBEC mutations comprised 13.2% of subclonal vs 8.0% of clonal mutations, with extremely strong statistical support for subclonal enrichment (p<2.5×10^-50). <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Endogenous signatures (APOBEC and C→T transitions) were reported as associated with tumor progression/metastasis risk, consistent with a late-stage role for endogenous mutagenesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Higher tumor nonsynonymous mutation burden and higher fraction of transitions (C→T, A→G) were associated with increased distant-metastasis risk, whereas smoking-related C→A transversions were associated more with early/clonal events. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>APOBEC-related signatures were not associated with smoking status, sex, age, or stage, supporting that APOBEC enrichment is not a trivial proxy for these covariates in this dataset. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The cohort included a substantial fraction of tumors lacking nonsynonymous mutations in previously known LUAD drivers (>20%), motivating endogenous/subclonal processes as candidate progression mechanisms in such cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying processes are known, but the theory-like linkage among (i) subclonal enrichment, (ii) metastatic association, and (iii) compensation for absent early canonical drivers is an integrative, driver-negative–centered framing grounded in the cited cohort statistics.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> APOBEC mutagenesis as a cancer mutational process and its tendency to contribute to ongoing/subclonal diversification has prior support across cancers, and transitions such as C→T are classic endogenous processes.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This formulation explicitly elevates endogenous, temporally late mutagenesis into a mechanistic explanation for how ostensibly driver-negative LUADs acquire late selectable lesions that increase metastatic risk, integrating timing (clonal vs subclonal) with clinical outcome.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Methylation landscape modulates mutation burden and spectra via coupled damage/repair</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinoma, genome-wide DNA methylation levels at many CpG loci—especially in open-sea/intergenic contexts—are strongly associated with tumor mutation burden and with fractions of specific mutation types (including C→T and C→A), consistent with a coupled mechanism in which methylation increases susceptibility to (a) 5-methylcytosine deamination (favoring C→T) and (b) carcinogen-adduct formation at methylated CpGs (favoring C→A), with accumulation further modulated by base-excision repair capacity (e.g., TDG/MBD4 activity). This methylation-coupled mutagenesis shapes the mutational substrate from which late functional hits (including noncanonical drivers) can emerge in tumors lacking canonical coding drivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD cohorts with paired tumor DNA methylation microarray profiling (e.g., Illumina 450K) and WES-based somatic mutation calls, evaluated primarily at cohort level via association/meta-analysis; mechanistic interpretation applies to mutational propensity over evolutionary time rather than instantaneous causality at single loci.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Directionality can be bidirectional: mutations and chromatin changes can influence methylation; experimental perturbation is needed to prove methylation→mutation causality.</li>
                <li>Smoking exposure can contribute strongly to C→A; the cited analyses adjust for smoking and still detect methylation associations, but effect sizes may differ by exposure strata.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In 93 EAGLE tumors with both WES and 450K methylation data, and in a combined EAGLE+TCGA meta-analysis (n=486), >1,000 CpG probes were significantly associated with tumor nonsynonymous mutation burden and/or mutation-type fractions at Bonferroni significance (p<1.5×10^-7). <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Associations were enriched for open-sea and intergenic CpG probes (positive associations across multiple mutation types), while CpG islands/promoters were generally depleted for positive associations, indicating context-dependent coupling between methylation state and mutagenesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The proposed mechanism explicitly includes 5mC deamination to thymine (C→T) and enhanced carcinogen-induced adduct formation (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene) at methylated CpGs contributing to C→A, aligning methylation with both endogenous and exposure-linked spectra. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>In TCGA, TDG expression was negatively correlated with C→T mutation frequency (r=-0.26, p≈1×10^-7), consistent with repair capacity modulating accumulation of methylation-linked lesions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>These methylation–mutation associations were reported as adjusted for smoking, age, stage, and sex, reducing (but not eliminating) confounding by these variables. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>EAGLE contained >20% tumors without nonsynonymous mutations in known LUAD drivers, motivating methylation-coupled mutagenesis as a potential contributor to oncogenesis/progression in driver-negative cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Mechanistic components are known, but the scale (thousands of significant CpGs), context specificity (open-sea/intergenic enrichment), and explicit use as an engine for driver-negative evolution is an integrative extension of existing ideas.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> CpG methylation–linked C→T via 5mC deamination is well established, and TDG/MBD4 are known to repair G:T mismatches arising from deamination; smoking-associated C→A is also well characterized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law treats methylation as a genome-wide, quantitative predictor of multiple somatic mutation traits (burden and spectra) and places this coupling into a driver-negative explanatory mechanism (increasing the probability of emergent noncanonical/late drivers).</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In LUADs classified as RTK/RAS/RAF-driver–negative by coding hotspot criteria, higher subclonal APOBEC fraction will correlate with (i) greater inferred branching evolution (more subclones) and (ii) higher probability of later metastatic relapse, even after adjusting for total mutation burden and stage.</li>
                <li>CpG methylation patterns (especially open-sea/intergenic probes identified as positively associated with mutation traits) will predict not only existing TMB but also prospective accrual of C→T and C→A mutations in longitudinally sampled tumors (pre/post progression), conditional on stable exposures.</li>
                <li>Tumors with methylation patterns predicting high C→T burden will show lower TDG (and/or MBD4) expression or functional impairment more often than tumors with low predicted C→T burden.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Inducing APOBEC activity in LUAD organoids lacking canonical drivers will accelerate emergence of growth-factor–independent subclones; the resulting selected driver spectrum will be enriched for transcriptional regulators (e.g., zinc-finger/homeobox factors) and splicing genes rather than classic RTK hotspots.</li>
                <li>CRISPR or pharmacologic modulation of the methylation/BER axis (e.g., TDG/MBD4 knockdown or targeted hypermethylation) in long-term lung epithelial models will shift mutational spectra and alter which classes of drivers emerge under selection (e.g., splicing-factor hotspots vs structural variants), enabling partial control of evolutionary trajectories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If, in independent LUAD cohorts with robust CNA-aware timing, APOBEC signature enrichment is not higher in subclonal vs clonal compartments, the 'temporal shift' component is undermined.</li>
                <li>If the reported association between endogenous transition-heavy spectra/APOBEC and distant metastasis disappears after controlling for stage, purity, and total mutational burden in multiple independent datasets, the 'progression-risk coupling' component is weakened.</li>
                <li>If methylation probes identified as associated with mutation traits fail to predict future mutation accrual in longitudinal sampling (or if demethylation/repair perturbation does not change mutation accumulation in experimental systems), the causal interpretation of methylation as a mutagenic modulator is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Discrete structural and splice drivers that directly activate RTKs (e.g., KIF5B-RET fusion; ROS1 fusions; MET exon 14 skipping; ERBB2 enhancer/super-enhancer activation) are not mechanistically explained beyond being potential endpoints that could also arise stochastically or under different selective regimes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.2" class="evidence-link">[e113.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.1" class="evidence-link">[e113.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.1" class="evidence-link">[e51.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Non-mutational oncogenic programs driven primarily by expression outliers (e.g., HJURP-high) could cause progression without requiring high endogenous mutagenesis; this theory does not fully explain those cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.0" class="evidence-link">[e51.0]</a> </li>
