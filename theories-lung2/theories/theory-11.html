                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Etiologic channel switching (revised): smokers develop lung cancer through multiple molecular routes with different dose dependence</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why only some cigarette smokers develop lung cancer while others do not, despite smoking being a strong risk factor, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Smokers are not a single etiologic category. Tobacco exposure increases lung cancer risk by increasing the probability that airway epithelial clones enter one (or more) of several partially distinct carcinogenic “channels” (routes) characterized by different molecular drivers, mutational processes, and tissue contexts. Some channels are strongly tobacco-dose-dependent (high tobacco mutational signature, high mutation burden, TP53/KRAS/RB1-rich, SCLC/SqCC-like), while others are weakly dose-dependent or can arise with low/no smoking (EGFR/ALK/fusion-driven, smoking-signature-low). Which channel(s) a given smoker is most likely to enter depends on: (i) exposure realization (internal dose/topography and co-exposures), (ii) host susceptibility affecting DNA damage processing and repair (metabolism/repair/inflammation genetics and phenotypes), and (iii) stochastic acquisition/selection of particular driver events. This mixture-of-channels framework explains why only a minority of smokers develop lung cancer (e.g., ~1 in 9), why some smokers develop ‘never-smoker-like’ driver tumors, and why measured pack-years often leave large residual heterogeneity (frailty).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Existence of multiple etiologic channels with smoking-status skew in driver spectra</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Human lung cancers partition into molecularly distinct etiologic channels whose driver spectra are differentially enriched by smoking history: (a) tobacco-driven channels are enriched for smoking-associated mutational patterns and drivers (e.g., KRAS and TP53 abnormalities; RB1 in SCLC), whereas (b) non-/light-smoking channels are enriched for kinase-driver alterations and rearrangements (e.g., EGFR activating mutations and ALK fusions). Therefore, among smokers, lung cancer risk is the mixture probability of entering each channel rather than a uniform scaling of a single carcinogenic pathway.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to human lung cancers (NSCLC and SCLC) characterized by tumor molecular profiling; pertains to etiology and subtype distribution (not directly to treatment response), and to comparisons across smoking history strata (never/light vs heavy/current/former) where smoking exposure is at least categorically assessed.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Driver events are not perfectly exclusive; rare co-alterations (e.g., EGFR+ALK) and multifocal disease can reflect channel mixing, intratumor heterogeneity, or multiple independent primaries.</li>
                <li>Observed channel frequencies depend on detection platform (e.g., RNA availability and assay sensitivity for fusions); platform heterogeneity can mimic etiologic differences.</li>
                <li>Histology and ancestry/sex composition can shift apparent channel proportions (e.g., adenocarcinoma enrichment increases EGFR/ALK prevalence; East Asian ancestry increases EGFR prevalence).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ALK fusions are reported predominantly in never/light smokers and define a distinct NSCLC subset; reported frequencies ~3–7% and enrichment in never/light smokers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.1" class="evidence-link">[e86.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.8" class="evidence-link">[e89.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.2" class="evidence-link">[e87.2]</a> </li>
    <li>EGFR activating mutations are enriched in never-/light-smokers and are common in East Asian cohorts; EGFR-mutant tumors are described as smoking-signature-low and molecularly distinct from tobacco-driven tumors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.6" class="evidence-link">[e89.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.4" class="evidence-link">[e88.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.0" class="evidence-link">[e86.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.11" class="evidence-link">[e88.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.9" class="evidence-link">[e87.9]</a> </li>
    <li>KRAS mutations are described as more frequent in smokers and characteristic of tobacco-associated tumors; KRAS prevalence in adenocarcinoma ~10–25% (review) and is linked mechanistically to tobacco carcinogens (e.g., NNK). <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.3" class="evidence-link">[e87.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.7" class="evidence-link">[e89.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.7" class="evidence-link">[e116.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> </li>
    <li>TP53 abnormalities are common in smoking-associated tumors: review notes p53 abnormalities ~60% of primary lung cancers; TCGA-derived TP53 mutation prevalence high in SqCC (~90%) and substantial in LUAD (~46%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.7" class="evidence-link">[e116.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SCLC and squamous cell carcinoma are associated with heavy smoking history; smoking-associated mutational patterns such as C:G>A:T transversions are emphasized in SCLC (e.g., ~28% transversions in cited sequencing summaries). <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.0" class="evidence-link">[e83.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-81.html#e81.0" class="evidence-link">[e81.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Case-only smoker cohorts show scarcity/absence of ALK fusions, consistent with ALK enrichment in never/light smokers (ecological comparison across studies). <a href="../results/extraction-result-82.html#e82.0" class="evidence-link">[e82.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.1" class="evidence-link">[e86.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.2" class="evidence-link">[e87.2]</a> </li>
    <li>SCLC cohort (Hispanic, small n) shows different somatic mutation prevalence by smoking status: EGFR mutations observed only in never/ever smokers (30% vs 0%), while RB1 enriched in heavy smokers (80% vs 40%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-81.html#e81.0" class="evidence-link">[e81.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Rare EGFR/ALK co-alterations occur and are more frequently observed in multifocal lesions than unifocal in one cohort (4.12% vs 0.83%), indicating imperfect exclusivity and possible multi-channel/multi-primary processes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.2" class="evidence-link">[e86.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.3" class="evidence-link">[e86.3]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 1: Channel entry depends on joint exposure realization (external dose, internal dose, and co-exposures)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Among cigarette smokers, the probability of entering a tobacco-driven etiologic channel increases with effective carcinogen dose to susceptible lung regions, where effective dose is a joint function of (i) external smoking metrics (duration, intensity), (ii) inhalation/topography and cigarette design compensation, and (iii) additional environmental/occupational carcinogens (PM2.5/PAHs, radon, asbestos, biomass smoke). Consequently, smokers with similar pack-years can have different channel-entry probabilities if their internal dose or co-exposures differ.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to cigarette smokers and ex-smokers in population/occupational settings where exposures vary; addresses initiation/etiology (incidence risk) rather than prognosis; does not require a particular driver genotype to be measured.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pack-years and cigarettes/day are imperfect proxies for internal dose due to compensation and inhalation depth; biomarkers (cotinine, metabolites, DNA adducts) would better approximate internal dose but are not consistently available.</li>
                <li>Co-exposure effects may be additive or multiplicative depending on agent and timing; many reviews cited do not quantify interaction terms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>Strong dose–response for smoking: long-term smokers have ~10–30× RR vs nonsmokers; heavy smokers cumulative risk up to ~30%; summary notes ~1 in 9 smokers develop lung cancer. <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.6" class="evidence-link">[e116.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.2" class="evidence-link">[e116.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Smoking duration is highlighted as particularly influential; screening eligibility often uses >30 pack-years and time since quitting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.6" class="evidence-link">[e85.6]</a> </li>

    <li>Radon exposure is a lung cancer risk factor with substantial attributable deaths (~21,000 US deaths cited) and increased incidence at certain residential radon levels (e.g., ~2.7 pCi/L cited). <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.3" class="evidence-link">[e89.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Occupational carcinogens (asbestos, silica, diesel exhaust, metals) increase lung cancer risk and can compound smoking-related risk; diesel exposure meta-analyses show ~30–50% increased risk (reviewed). <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.4" class="evidence-link">[e89.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.6" class="evidence-link">[e116.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.8" class="evidence-link">[e88.8]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 2: Host susceptibility splits into behavior-mediated and biology-mediated channel propensity</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Host genetic variation modifies channel propensity by at least two separable mechanisms: (i) behavior-mediated susceptibility (genotype → nicotine dependence → higher exposure), and (ii) biology-mediated susceptibility that is not explained by measured smoking dose (genotype alters telomere maintenance/apoptosis/DNA damage response), thereby changing channel-entry probability even at similar self-reported exposure.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to germline variants associated with lung cancer risk in humans, especially in populations where smoking behaviors and exposure measures are available; distinguishes mediation by smoking intensity from direct/biologic effects.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Measured smoking intensity (pack-years, cigarettes/day) may be noisy; a variant can appear ‘direct’ if exposure measurement error is large.</li>

            <h3>Statement 3: Latent channel propensity (frailty) yields residual heterogeneity beyond measured covariates</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Even after adjusting for available exposure proxies (smoking status, pack-years) and measured clinical covariates, substantial residual heterogeneity remains that can be modeled as individual-level latent susceptibility (frailty), interpretable as unmeasured channel-propensity differences (e.g., unmeasured internal dose, DNA repair capacity, chronic inflammation, co-exposures). This heterogeneity can produce nonlinear interactions with age and sex in observed hazards and contributes to why only some smokers develop clinically apparent cancer.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to clinical cohorts and survival/recurrence modeling in NSCLC where smoking history is measured but incomplete; conceptually extends to incidence cohorts but frailty estimates in case-only cohorts reflect both initiation selection and progression biology.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Frailty estimated post-diagnosis conflates initiation and progression; incidence cohorts are needed to isolate initiation frailty.</li>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a cohort of smokers with harmonized tumor sequencing and quantitative smoking history, increasing pack-years will primarily increase the fraction of tumors with tobacco mutational signatures and KRAS/TP53/RB1-rich profiles, while the fraction of EGFR/ALK/fusion-driven tumors will show weaker dependence on pack-years (after controlling for histology and ancestry).</li>
                <li>Among smokers matched on pack-years, those with ALK- or EGFR-driven tumors will show lower tumor tobacco-signature burden (molecular smoking signature) than those with KRAS/TP53-driven tumors, consistent with different channel membership.</li>
                <li>Improving fusion detection (RNA-based NGS) in smoker-rich cohorts will increase observed fusion-channel prevalence (ALK/ROS1/RET) and will reduce apparent mutual exclusivity artifacts attributable to under-detection.</li>
                <li>In multivariable risk models for smoker incidence, adding co-exposure histories (radon, PM2.5/traffic, asbestos/diesel) and inhalation/topography proxies will reduce unexplained heterogeneity and improve calibration more than adding small increments of self-reported cigarettes/day.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Prospective airway ‘field of injury’ molecular profiling (methylation/transcriptome) will cluster smokers into pre-diagnostic channel-propensity classes that predict the future driver subtype (tobacco-channel vs EGFR/ALK-channel) with clinically useful discrimination; success would enable channel-specific prevention/screening.</li>
                <li>If internal dose biomarkers (e.g., DNA adduct panels, urinary tobacco carcinogen metabolites) are repeatedly measured longitudinally, they will explain a large portion of frailty variance currently attributed to latent heterogeneity in smoker cohorts; the magnitude is uncertain.</li>
                <li>Anti-inflammatory interventions that reduce COPD-like inflammatory states will preferentially reduce incidence of tobacco-channel cancers (high smoking signature) more than EGFR/ALK/fusion-channel cancers, yielding subtype-specific prevention effects.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>After harmonizing sequencing (including RNA fusions) and using molecular smoking signatures rather than self-report, if driver subtype frequencies (KRAS/TP53 vs EGFR/ALK/fusions) show no relationship to tobacco exposure level in smokers, the channel-mixture smoking skew would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If ALK fusions and EGFR activating mutations are found at similar prevalence in heavy smokers and never-smokers within the same histologic strata and with identical detection methods, the proposed smoking-status skew between channels would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If prospective incidence cohorts with rich covariates show near-zero frailty variance once internal-dose biomarkers, co-exposures, COPD/fibrosis phenotypes, and key germline loci are included, then ‘latent channel propensity’ would largely reduce to measured variables (weakening the need for a latent construct).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory is etiologic and subtype-mixture focused; it does not directly model some treatment/prognostic biomarker phenomena (e.g., ERCC1 tumor expression predicting platinum sensitivity; PD-L1 predicting immunotherapy response) except indirectly through channel membership and mutation burden. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.5" class="evidence-link">[e87.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.10" class="evidence-link">[e87.10]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.4" class="evidence-link">[e87.4]</a> </li>
