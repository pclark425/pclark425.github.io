                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what drives lung adenocarcinomas without known RTK/RAS/RAF pathway driver alterations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in lung adenocarcinomas lacking canonical RTK/RAS/RAF driver mutations or fusions, primary (or major cooperating) tumor-driving events frequently arise from recurrent, mutually exclusive genetic and epigenetic lesions targeting chromatin remodeling complexes (e.g., ARID1A, SMARCA4, SETD2, BRD3), RNA processing/splicing factors (e.g., U2AF1, RBM10), and global transcriptional/epigenomic states such as the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP-high). These events reprogram transcription, alternative splicing, and chromatin states to sustain oncogenic proliferation, survival, immune escape, and differentiation blockade, forming a functionally equivalent 'axis' to classic RTK/RAS/RAF oncogenic programs and defining an 'eleventh hallmark' of LUAD.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Mutually Exclusive Epigenetic/Splicing Disruption Defines Alternative Driver Pathway</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Loss-of-function mutations in chromatin remodelers (e.g., ARID1A, SMARCA4), mutations in splicing factors (e.g., U2AF1 p.S34F, RBM10 truncations), or widespread CpG island methylation (CIMP-high) tend to be mutually exclusive with, and can substitute for, canonical RTK/RAS/RAF pathway alterations as principal drivers in LUAD.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Primary lung adenocarcinomas lacking nonsynonymous point mutations, hotspot fusions, or amplifications of canonical RTK/RAS/RAF-oncogenes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ALK, RET, ROS1, etc.), as detected by exome/genome/transcriptome profiling, with particular enrichment in cases with truncating/functional domain mutations of chromatin remodelers or splicing genes, or global high-level DNA methylation (CIMP-high). Applies to both smokers and never-smokers; may not be universal in all 'driver-negative' tumors.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Epigenetic/splicing alterations may sometimes co-occur with canonical RTK/RAS/RAF drivers as secondary or modifier lesions rather than primary substitutes.</li>
                <li>Not all CIMP-high or chromatin/splicing altered tumors are fully wild-type for all canonical drivers (exceptions occur).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Significant recurrent truncating mutations and loss-of-function events in chromatin remodelers (ARID1A ~8%, SMARCA4 ~15%, SETD2, BRD3) and splicing factors (U2AF1 ~3%, RBM10 ~7%) in LUAD, identified as statistically significant and driver-candidate genes (InVEx), with enrichment of truncating events. Proportion of LUADs affected by these events collectively ranges from 10–22%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.3" class="evidence-link">[e36.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.4" class="evidence-link">[e36.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.7" class="evidence-link">[e36.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.2" class="evidence-link">[e36.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.1" class="evidence-link">[e36.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Mutually exclusive patterns found: MGA LOF mutations are mutually exclusive with MYC amplification, and ZKSCAN1 mutations partition from RTK/RAS/RAF pathway mutations, suggesting parallel, alternative driving axes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-39.html#e39.5" class="evidence-link">[e39.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.0" class="evidence-link">[e41.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DNA methylation profiling (TCGA, other cohorts) reveals a CIMP-high LUAD subgroup (widespread promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressors/WNT pathway genes, often with MYC overexpression). <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.3" class="evidence-link">[e44.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Epigenetic drivers and RNA-processing/splicing mutations mapped as 'eleventh hallmark' of cancer (affecting 10-22% of LUADs); these cases often lack canonical RTK/RAS/RAF drivers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.7" class="evidence-link">[e36.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.8" class="evidence-link">[e36.8]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work (e.g., Imielinski et al. 2012) proposes epigenetic/RNA deregulation as a hallmark, explicit mutual exclusivity and fully substitutive driver-equivalence is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Individual contribution of epigenetic deregulation, chromatin remodeling and spliceosome component mutations to cancer are established; hallmark mapping is recently described.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law conceptualizes the collective, mutually exclusive role of chromatin/splicing/methylation disruption as an independent driver axis, substitutive for (not just additive to) canonical oncogene mutations/fusions in LUAD.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Epigenetic and Splicing Factor Mutations Globally Reprogram Oncogenic Transcriptional State</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Disruption of chromatin remodeling (e.g., ARID1A, SMARCA4, SETD2, BRD3 mutations), global promoter hypermethylation (CIMP-high), and/or splicing factor mutations (e.g., U2AF1 p.S34F hotspot) result in wide-scale reprogramming of gene expression and splicing, affecting proliferation, differentiation, immune response, and survival, sufficient to promote LUAD initiation and maintenance in the absence of RTK/RAS/RAF mutations.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Lung adenocarcinomas lacking canonical RTK/RAS/RAF genetic alterations and harboring any of: truncating/functionally disruptive mutations in chromatin remodelers, significant CIMP-high methylation, or recurrent splicing factor mutations. Applies to both early and late-stage LUAD, including smokers and non-smokers.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>CIMP-high methylation may co-occur with certain genetic drivers, but appears enriched in the absence of them.</li>
                <li>Not all chromatin/remodeler or splicing factor mutations may have equivalent functional consequences due to cellular/environmental context.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Recurrence and functional domain-impact of ARID1A, SMARCA4, SETD2, BRD3 mutations; significant clustering of truncating events; frequent disruption of SWI/SNF complex components. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.3" class="evidence-link">[e36.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.4" class="evidence-link">[e36.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.7" class="evidence-link">[e36.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.2" class="evidence-link">[e31.2]</a> </li>
    <li>CIMP-high LUADs characterized by widespread silencing of tumor suppressors and developmental (e.g., WNT) pathway genes, with MYC overexpression; methylation state correlates with global expression programs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-44.html#e44.3" class="evidence-link">[e44.3]</a> </li>
    <li>U2AF1 p.S34F hotspot (and other splicing factor) mutations are significantly associated with reduced disease-free survival; analogous mutations are oncogenic in myeloid neoplasia and their presence is sufficient to alter large-scale splicing in model systems. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.0" class="evidence-link">[e36.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Splicing factor and chromatin remodeler aberrations are detected in LUAD cases lacking typical RTK/RAS/RAF alterations; 'eleventh hallmark' mapping expands the estimate of non-canonical driver-rich cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.7" class="evidence-link">[e36.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.8" class="evidence-link">[e36.8]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Only aggregative/correlative or functional-tumor-specific studies exist; a unifying, driver-equivalent role is not previously formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Large-scale expression changes from chromatin remodeling or methylation or splicing mutations are individually reported; splicing mutations proven oncogenic in myeloid, presumptive in lung.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Assertion of sufficiency and functional equivalence to canonical drivers for these epigenetic/splicing alterations in forming and maintaining LUAD, in a mutually exclusive fashion, is new.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LUADs with truncating or functionally disruptive mutations in ARID1A, SMARCA4, SETD2, BRD3, U2AF1, or with CIMP-high status will lack canonical activating RTK/RAS/RAF genetic alterations at higher-than-chance frequency (>95%).</li>
                <li>Targeted correction of U2AF1, ARID1A, or SETD2 mutations in established RTK-wildtype LUAD cell lines will trigger broad re-differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, or apoptosis.</li>
                <li>CIMP-high methylation LUAD cases will show transcriptomic upregulation of proliferative programs (e.g., MYC, WNT) comparable in direction and magnitude to RTK-driven LUAD.</li>
                <li>Clinicopathologic and molecular profiling will reveal spatial mutual exclusivity between chromatin/splicing alterations and RTK/RAS/RAF mutations in large multicenter datasets.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demethylating agents or targeted chromatin-modulating drugs (e.g., bromodomain inhibitors, EZH2 inhibitors) will induce tumor regression in a cohort of RTK-driver-negative, chromatin/splice mutant or CIMP-high LUAD tumors, with efficacy comparable to TKIs in RTK-driven tumors.</li>
                <li>RNA-seq analysis will reveal common downstream anti-apoptotic and immune evasion transcriptome programs in epigenetic/splicing-driven LUADs, even when no other known oncogenic driver is present.</li>
                <li>Single-cell multi-omic analysis will reveal that epigenetic/RNA deregulation-driven LUADs have spatial transcriptomic heterogeneity patterns similar to classic RTK-driven tumors despite distinct etiologies.</li>
                <li>Cross-cancer comparative genomics will discover disease-defining, functionally analogous epigenetic/RNA driver axes in other solid tumors previously thought to be 'pan-negative' for known oncogenes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding high frequency of ARID1A, SMARCA4, U2AF1, SETD2, or CIMP-high alterations in LUADs co-occurring (clonally) with canonical RTK/RAS/RAF pathway mutations at non-background rates (>10%) would challenge mutual exclusivity and the driver-equivalence assertion.</li>
                <li>Genomic engineering or CRISPR ablation of chromatin/splicing driver lesions in RTK-driver-negative LUAD cells fails to reverse oncogenic phenotypes (e.g., proliferation, survival) or does not impair tumor growth in vivo.</li>
                <li>Clinical trials targeting DNA methylation or chromatin in RTK-driver-negative, epigenetic/splicing-driver-positive LUAD yield no objective responses.</li>
                <li>Downstream transcriptome analyses reveal no overlap in proliferative or survival gene signatures between epigenetic/RNA-deregulated and RTK-driven LUAD.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Driver-negative LUADs that lack both canonical RTK/RAS/RAF alterations and identifiable chromatin, splicing, or CIMP-high events. Some samples remain unexplained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-32.html#e32.0" class="evidence-link">[e32.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-37.html#e37.5" class="evidence-link">[e37.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Rare cases where epigenetic/splicing alterations co-occur with RTK/RAS/RAF pathway mutations, potentially as modifiers or passengers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.1" class="evidence-link">[e36.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.1" class="evidence-link">[e31.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Other alternative drivers or processes (e.g., fusions, metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment-driven events) not addressed by this axis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.7" class="evidence-link">[e41.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-41.html#e41.9" class="evidence-link">[e41.9]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-40.html#e40.0" class="evidence-link">[e40.0]</a> </li>
