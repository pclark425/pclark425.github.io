                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Convergent PMN Module Selection by Organ Barriers (Barrier-Imposed ‘Minimum Necessary Module’ theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of preferential metastatic organotropism (non-random metastatic spread to specific organs) across cancers (e.g., prostate/breast to bone, lung to brain/adrenals), based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Different organs impose distinct dominant bottlenecks on metastatic success (e.g., BBB integrity in brain, mesothelial barrier in peritoneum, remodeling-dependent retention in bone, fenestrated sinusoids but immune-tolerant myeloid sensing in liver, large endothelial surface area and inflammatory responsiveness in lung). Tumors preferentially metastasize to organs where they can most efficiently activate the ‘minimum necessary’ pre-metastatic niche module(s) required to overcome that organ’s dominant barrier. This yields organotropism as an emergent consequence of barrier type × available EV cargo/host circuitry, rather than solely anatomical flow. The theory predicts that organ-specific metastasis is best explained by identifying which barrier is rate-limiting in each organ and which EV/immune/ECM program is sufficient to lower it.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Barrier dominance law: organotropism tracks the dominant physical/immune barrier and its minimal bypass module</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If an organ’s dominant constraint is a specialized barrier (tight endothelium/BBB, mesothelium, rigid/ECM-rich marrow niche), then metastatic success to that organ will disproportionately depend on tumor or host programs that directly weaken/remodel that barrier (vascular junction disruption, barrier-to-mesenchymal transition, protease-mediated barrier destruction, osteoclast-driven remodeling), and EV cargos that implement these programs will correlate with tropism to that organ.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Late-stage metastasis across diverse primaries where organ barriers differ substantially; applies to brain (BBB), peritoneum (mesothelium), bone (remodeling niche), liver (sinusoidal + macrophage/stellate circuitry), lung (high-surface-area endothelium responsive to inflammation).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>When tumor cells are experimentally delivered past the barrier (e.g., intracerebral injection), barrier-weakening modules become less predictive of colonization compared with immune/metabolic modules.</li>
                <li>Some organs (liver) have permissive physical barriers but strong immune/stromal sensing; the dominant constraint may be immunologic rather than physical.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Brain: EV miR-105 downregulates ZO-1; EV miR-181c alters endothelial actin dynamics; CEMIP+ exosomes induce perivascular inflammatory/vascular remodeling; BBB is emphasized as a major organ-specific barrier in microfluidic BBB models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.5" class="evidence-link">[e163.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-160.html#e160.2" class="evidence-link">[e160.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.4" class="evidence-link">[e165.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.3" class="evidence-link">[e163.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.4" class="evidence-link">[e164.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Peritoneum: GC EV-MMP2 activates ERK in mesothelial cells and induces MMT; GC EV miR-21-5p and miR-106a target SMAD7 to activate TGFβ/Smad and induce MMT; EV lncRNA SNHG12 activates MAPK/ERK via miR-129-5p/E2F7 to induce MMT—direct barrier destruction/remodeling consistent with mesothelial barrier dominance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.6" class="evidence-link">[e159.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.4" class="evidence-link">[e159.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.7" class="evidence-link">[e159.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.5" class="evidence-link">[e159.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Bone: Tumor-primed T cell-derived RANKL induces osteoclastogenesis and pre-metastatic osteolysis (remodeling the bone barrier) and is necessary for bone metastasis in the 4T1 model; systemic OPG/RANKL ratio decreases 10–20 fold in metastatic mice. <a href="../results/extraction-result-218.html#e218.0" class="evidence-link">[e218.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-218.html#e218.2" class="evidence-link">[e218.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Liver: PDAC EV MIF acts through Kupffer cells and stellate activation to deposit fibronectin (a retention/adhesion scaffold) and recruit myeloid cells; liver-chip studies show EV TGFβ1 drives LSEC endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and fibronectin upregulation, consistent with stromal/vascular remodeling as a key permissiveness determinant despite permissive sinusoids. <a href="../results/extraction-result-217.html#e217.0" class="evidence-link">[e217.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.2" class="evidence-link">[e164.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Lung: EVs can disrupt endothelial integrity (dynamin-dependent) and miR-105 can increase microvascular permeability; epithelial sensing (TLR3) recruits neutrophils; lung’s barrier is modulated by inflammation and permeability rather than a specialized tight junction barrier like BBB. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.3" class="evidence-link">[e159.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.5" class="evidence-link">[e163.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.7" class="evidence-link">[e163.7]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> It is a new abstraction that converts a list of organ mechanisms into a barrier-based selection criterion with predictions.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Organ-specific barriers and PMN mechanisms are known; BBB disruption and mesothelial MMT are established in organ-specific metastasis contexts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts a ‘minimum necessary module’ principle: the dominant organ barrier predicts which PMN module must be activated (and which EV cargos will be selected) for successful organotropism, offering a compact selection rule across organs.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Causal sufficiency law: barrier-lowering via EV/immune/ECM reprogramming is sufficient to raise organ permissiveness in model systems</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If an EV cargo (or immune effector axis) directly lowers the dominant organ barrier (structural or immunologic), then pre-exposure (‘education’) of the organ to that factor will be sufficient to increase subsequent tumor cell retention/extravasation/colonization metrics in that organ, even when the tumor cell genotype is unchanged.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Preclinical and microphysiologic model systems where organ ‘education’ can be applied prior to tumor challenge; applies to liver (PDAC exosome education), lung (exosome education, CCL2 axis), bone (T-cell transfer), and in vitro extravasation systems (bone chip).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Education effects can be organ- and route-dependent (brain exosomes systemic vs intraventricular).</li>
                <li>Education can increase early retention without guaranteeing long-term outgrowth if later compatibility factors are missing.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>PDAC: exosome education increases fibronectin deposition, myeloid recruitment, early tumor cell retention at 24h, and later liver macrometastatic burden; MIF knockdown and fibronectin conditional knockout abrogate these effects. <a href="../results/extraction-result-217.html#e217.0" class="evidence-link">[e217.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Breast→lung: exosome education increases lung metastasis in WT but not CCL2-/- mice; lung-specific CCL2 overexpression increases lung metastasis and MDSCs, while CCL2 knockout reduces them. <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.0" class="evidence-link">[e219.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.1" class="evidence-link">[e219.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.3" class="evidence-link">[e219.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Bone: adoptive transfer of tumor-primed T cells plus antigen induces bone loss before tumor cells arrive; RANKL knockdown in T cells prevents osteolysis and bone metastasis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-218.html#e218.0" class="evidence-link">[e218.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Bone extravasation: in microfluidic bone niche, adding CXCL5 increases extravasation and CXCR2 blockade reduces it—direct sufficiency/necessity for an extravasation-facilitating chemokine module. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.1" class="evidence-link">[e164.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> It is a new unifying causal statement over known examples, emphasizing barrier-specific early readouts.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Organ ‘education’ experiments and PMN sufficiency tests exist in multiple organs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law reframes these disparate sufficiency results as a general barrier-lowering sufficiency principle that predicts which quantitative readouts should change first (retention/extravasation vs immune-cell composition vs ECM deposition) depending on barrier type.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Brain-tropic EV cargos that weaken BBB (e.g., miR-105/miR-181c-like activity) will correlate more strongly with early increases in BBB permeability metrics than with immune-cell recruitment metrics; in contrast, Dkk-1-like endothelial programs will correlate more with microglial phenotype shifts than with immediate permeability changes.</li>
                <li>Peritoneal metastasis propensity will be predicted by EV capacity to induce mesothelial MMT markers (α-SMA, fibronectin, vimentin) more strongly than by EV integrin ‘zip codes’, because the dominant barrier is mesothelium not vascular arrest.</li>
                <li>Bone-tropic conditioning will correlate with systemic OPG/RANKL ratio shifts and osteoclast activation markers, and interventions that normalize this ratio will reduce early bone remodeling readouts before affecting detectable tumor burden.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A cross-organ ‘barrier score’ computed from circulating EV cargo classes (BBB-junction miRNAs, fibrotic/ECM modulators, immune-polarizing miRNAs) will outperform anatomical models (blood flow, first-pass) in predicting first metastatic organ across multiple primaries.</li>
                <li>If the dominant organ barrier is experimentally changed (e.g., stiffening/softening ECM, inducing inflammation), metastasis organ distribution will shift toward organs whose barrier is now easier to lower, even without changing tumor genetics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrate a model where strong BBB disruption occurs (measured by tight junction loss/permeability) but brain metastasis does not increase even when tumor cells are delivered hematogenously; this would falsify barrier-dominance for brain in that context.</li>
                <li>Show that peritoneal mesothelial MMT induction by GC EVs is not required for peritoneal implantation in vivo (e.g., implantation proceeds unaffected when MMT is blocked).</li>
                <li>Show bone metastasis proceeds without pre-osteolytic remodeling in a model where RANKL/osteoclastogenesis is disabled yet bone colonization remains unchanged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Fusion-hybrid-mediated organotropism (lung/liver) is not directly explained by barrier-dominance alone; it primarily modifies the tumor-cell side (trafficking/immune evasion) rather than lowering the organ barrier. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.1" class="evidence-link">[e161.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.2" class="evidence-link">[e161.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.0" class="evidence-link">[e161.0]</a> </li>
