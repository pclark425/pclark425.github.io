                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Thymomas cause high rates of autoimmunity through a multi-stage mechanism: (1) disruption of central tolerance in the neoplastic thymus leads to export of autoreactive T cells that escape negative selection due to architectural abnormalities, reduced AIRE expression, and decreased MHC class II presentation; (2) quantitative imbalances in thymic output favor autoreactive over regulatory T cells; (3) thymic and peripheral inflammatory signals (particularly HMGB1/IL-6 axis) amplify autoreactive responses through Th17/Treg dysregulation; (4) formation of ectopic germinal centers provides organized sites for sustained autoantibody production; and (5) long-lived peripheral autoreactive clones persist after thymectomy, explaining variable treatment responses and delayed autoimmune emergence.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Architectural Disruption-Mediated Central Tolerance Failure</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Thymomas exhibit disrupted thymic architecture with reduced medullary regions, decreased AIRE expression, reduced MHC class II presentation by thymic epithelial cells, and absence or dysfunction of thymic myoid cells, resulting in impaired negative selection at multiple checkpoints and allowing autoreactive T cells (both CD4+ and CD8+) to escape into the periphery. This architectural disruption is necessary but not sufficient for autoimmunity, as AIRE deficiency alone does not produce the full autoimmune phenotype.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to thymic epithelial tumors (thymomas) across WHO classification types A, AB, B1, B2, B3, with strongest effects in cortical-type (B2/B3) thymomas that retain thymopoietic capacity and contain significant populations of immature thymocytes. Does not apply to thymic carcinomas (type C) which generally lack functional thymopoiesis and have much lower rates of autoimmunity. Effects are present regardless of whether clinical autoimmunity manifests, suggesting additional factors determine clinical penetrance.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Type A thymomas may have minimal thymopoietic activity and thus lower autoimmune association despite some architectural abnormalities</li>
                <li>AIRE deficiency in thymomas is insufficient alone to produce APS-1 phenotype, unlike germline AIRE mutations</li>
                <li>Thymic carcinomas (type C) generally lack this mechanism due to complete loss of thymopoietic function and normal thymic architecture</li>
                <li>Some thymomas show AIRE deficiency without clinical autoimmunity, indicating requirement for additional factors</li>
                <li>Invasive thymomas may have more severe tolerance defects correlating with stage</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While individual components (AIRE loss, architectural disruption, MHC-II reduction) are separately documented, this law synthesizes them as coordinated necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions that distinguish thymoma autoimmunity from simpler single-defect syndromes like APS-1, providing a more complete mechanistic framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept that thymomas disrupt central tolerance through architectural changes, AIRE deficiency, and impaired negative selection is well-established since the 1990s-2000s work by Marx, Buckley, Scarpino and others.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit mechanistic integration of multiple architectural defects (medullary loss, AIRE reduction, MHC-II downregulation, myoid cell absence) as a coordinated necessary-but-not-sufficient failure mode, and the observation that AIRE deficiency alone is insufficient (unlike APS-1) suggests thymoma autoimmunity requires combinatorial defects rather than single-gene pathology.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Quantitative Imbalance in Thymic T Cell Output</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> MG-associated thymomas export significantly higher numbers of mature naive CD4+ T cells (CD27+CD45RA+ at 24.4±18.9% vs 4.3±2.0% in non-MG thymomas, p<0.0001) that have escaped late-stage negative selection checkpoints, while concomitantly showing profoundly reduced thymic regulatory T cell (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) generation (~3% in MG+ thymomas vs ~10% in normal thymic tissue, p<0.05). This quantitative imbalance creates a high ratio of autoreactive effector to regulatory T cells (>8:1) that overwhelms peripheral tolerance mechanisms and enables clinical autoimmunity. Non-MG thymomas prevent this imbalance through increased apoptosis at the late CD27+ maturation checkpoint.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies specifically to thymomas with retained thymopoietic capacity (primarily types AB, B1, B2, B3) in patients with and without myasthenia gravis and potentially other autoimmune manifestations. Measurements based on intratumoral T cell populations assessed by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, and peripheral blood TREC (T-cell receptor excision circle) levels as markers of recent thymic emigrants. Most clearly demonstrated for MG but likely applicable to other T-cell-mediated autoimmune complications of thymoma.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Non-MG thymomas show increased apoptosis (TUNEL+) at late maturation checkpoints, preventing export of autoreactive CD27+ cells</li>
                <li>Quantitative threshold effects may exist where a certain ratio of autoreactive to regulatory cells (possibly >8:1) is required for clinical autoimmunity</li>
                <li>Peripheral expansion or deletion of exported cells may modify the effective ratio after thymic export</li>
                <li>TREC levels fall after thymectomy but peripheral mature T cell populations persist, indicating long-lived clones</li>
                <li>Tacrolimus treatment can reduce thymic TREC output, potentially modulating autoimmunity</li>

    <li>Thymomatous MG patients show increased peripheral naïve T cells and raised TREC levels (markers of recent thymic emigrants); TREC in thymoma CD4+ subset: 3613±1338 copies/μg DNA vs lower in non-thymomatous MG. <a href="../results/extraction-result-186.html#e186.0" class="evidence-link">[e186.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While altered T cell maturation in thymomas is established, this law provides specific quantitative parameters with statistical validation that distinguish MG+ from MG- thymomas, integrates protective apoptosis mechanisms as an active component, and proposes a quantitative threshold model for clinical autoimmunity that goes beyond descriptive observations.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Individual observations of increased naive T cell export (Buckley 2001) and reduced Treg numbers (Hoffacker 2000) in thymomas have been reported separately in the MG literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit quantitative formulation of the autoreactive/regulatory imbalance with specific numerical thresholds and statistical significance (24% vs 4% mature CD4+, p<0.0001; 3% vs 10% Tregs, p<0.05) as a predictive mechanism for autoimmunity, plus the identification of differential apoptosis checkpoints in MG- thymomas as an active protective mechanism, provides testable quantitative predictions.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Peripheral Amplification through Inflammatory Mediators and Th17/Treg Dysregulation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Thymoma cells, particularly in MG-associated cases, overexpress and secrete inflammatory danger signals (HMGB1 with secretory localization, and potentially other DAMPs) that act through TLR/RAGE pathways to increase IL-6 secretion by tumor and stromal cells. This IL-6 drives peripheral Th17 differentiation (increased from 1.59±0.58% to 2.49±1.54% in MG+ patients) while inhibiting Treg differentiation and function (decreased from 2.84±1.71% to 1.81±0.96%), creating a peripheral inflammatory milieu with elevated Th17/Treg ratios that amplifies the pathogenic effects of centrally-derived autoreactive T cells and supports autoantibody production.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to thymomas associated with autoimmunity, particularly MG and other T-cell-mediated conditions; mechanism most clearly demonstrated in B-type thymomas with active inflammatory signaling. Effects manifest both within thymic tissue (intratumoral) and in peripheral circulation (systemic). The HMGB1/IL-6 axis appears specifically enhanced in MG-associated thymomas with secretory HMGB1 localization. Peripheral Th17/Treg ratios are measurable in blood and correlate with disease activity.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>HMGB1 overexpression and secretory localization appear specifically in MG-associated thymomas rather than all thymomas</li>
                <li>Systemic peripheral effects require secretory localization of HMGB1, not just intracellular expression</li>
                <li>Other inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines like CXCL13, BAFF) may contribute to similar Th17/Treg skewing through parallel or convergent pathways</li>
                <li>In vitro HMGB1 knockdown reverses the Th17/Treg imbalance, suggesting causal relationship</li>
                <li>Checkpoint inhibitor therapy can exacerbate this axis, precipitating severe autoimmunity</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Thymoma+MG patients showed higher HMGB1 expression with secretory localization in tumor tissue; in vitro HMGB1 knockdown in thymoma cells reduced IL-6 secretion and, in co-culture with PBMCs, reduced Th17 and increased Treg frequencies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-182.html#e182.0" class="evidence-link">[e182.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While Th17/Treg imbalance is known in autoimmunity broadly, the specific tumor-derived HMGB1→TLR/RAGE→IL-6→Th17/Treg axis as a thymoma-specific peripheral amplification mechanism with experimental validation (knockdown experiments) represents a mechanistic insight into how the tumor actively drives peripheral immune dysregulation beyond simply exporting autoreactive cells.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The general concept of cytokine dysregulation, Th17/Treg imbalance in autoimmunity, and presence of germinal centers in MG thymomas are well-established in autoimmune disease literature since the 2000s.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific identification of tumor-derived HMGB1 as a danger signal that mechanistically links thymoma to peripheral Th17/Treg imbalance through IL-6, with direct experimental validation showing HMGB1 knockdown reverses the Th17/Treg phenotype in co-culture, provides a novel tumor-specific amplification mechanism distinct from general autoimmune Th17/Treg dysregulation.</p>

            <h3>Statement 3: Ectopic Germinal Center Formation and Sustained Autoantibody Production</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> MG-associated thymomas develop ectopic germinal centers within and around thymic tissue at 3.75-fold higher frequency than non-MG thymomas, providing organized lymphoid structures for local B cell maturation, somatic hypermutation, and sustained autoantibody production. These germinal centers are supported by altered chemokine gradients (particularly CXCL13 and BAFF) and upregulation of high endothelial venule markers (CHST4) that recruit peripheral lymphocytes. Within these structures, autoreactive B cells receive T cell help from thymus-exported autoreactive CD4+ T cells, enabling high-titer autoantibody production that correlates with germinal center abundance.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies primarily to B-type thymomas (especially B1, B2, B3) associated with antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases, most clearly demonstrated in myasthenia gravis but potentially applicable to other autoantibody-positive conditions (polymyositis, pemphigus, autoimmune hepatitis). Germinal centers are found in peritumoral thymic tissue and within tumor margins. Most prominent in cortical-type thymomas with preserved lymphoid architecture and active thymopoiesis. Quantifiable by immunohistochemistry for germinal center markers (CD21+ follicular dendritic cells, Ki67+ proliferating B cells, CXCL13+ regions).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Thymic hyperplasia without thymoma can also show germinal centers but through different mechanisms (preserved normal architecture with hyperplastic response)</li>
                <li>Not all autoantibody-positive thymoma patients show prominent germinal centers, suggesting alternative mechanisms exist</li>
                <li>Germinal center formation may be secondary consequence rather than initial cause of autoimmunity (debated)</li>
                <li>Some thymomas produce autoantibodies spontaneously from tumor cells themselves (e.g., anti-IFN-α, anti-IL-12 reported)</li>
                <li>Germinal centers are more prominent in longstanding disease, suggesting temporal progression</li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While germinal centers in MG thymus are established knowledge, the specific quantification (3.75× increase), the correlation with autoantibody titers, and the molecular recruitment mechanisms (CHST4, CXCL13, BAFF) provide novel mechanistic and predictive insights into how sustained autoantibody production is organized and maintained in thymomas.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Germinal center formation in MG thymomas has been described since Levine & Rosai (1978) and extensively characterized by Schonbeck et al.

            <h3>Statement 4: Persistence of Peripheral Autoreactive Clones Post-Thymectomy</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Autoreactive T and B cell clones exported from thymoma establish long-lived populations in peripheral lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow) that can persist for months to years (documented >10 years) after thymectomy. These mature, antigen-experienced cells are independent of continued thymic output and can maintain or even initiate new autoimmune responses after tumor removal. This persistence explains why thymectomy is variably effective (good response in MG, poor in other autoimmune conditions), why some autoimmune manifestations emerge or worsen after surgery, and why TREC levels fall post-thymectomy while clinical autoimmunity persists.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to all thymoma-associated autoimmune conditions where autoreactive lymphocytes have been exported to periphery prior to thymectomy. Persistence duration and clinical impact vary by disease type (antibody-mediated vs cellular), duration of thymoma presence before resection, stage/extent of autoreactive clone expansion at time of surgery, and specific autoimmune target organ. Most clearly documented in myasthenia gravis and inflammatory myopathies, but conceptually applicable to all thymoma autoimmune complications. Measurable by TREC decline post-surgery with persistent autoantibodies or T cell responses.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>MG shows better response to thymectomy than other autoimmune conditions, possibly due to dual effects on both germinal centers (removed) and T cell export (halted), plus antibody decay kinetics</li>
                <li>Very early thymectomy before extensive autoreactive clone expansion may be more curative</li>
                <li>Transient worsening post-thymectomy may occur due to removal of residual thymic Tregs (temporary decrease in regulatory capacity)</li>
                <li>Some autoimmune conditions (SLE, polymyositis, hepatitis) frequently persist or emerge post-thymectomy, indicating strong peripheral autonomous activity</li>
                <li>Long-lived plasma cells in bone marrow niches may maintain autoantibody production independently for years</li>
                <li>Memory T cells have lifespans exceeding 10 years and may undergo homeostatic proliferation maintaining autoreactive clones</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Exported autoreactive T-lymphocytes can persist in periphery for months to years after thymectomy; thymectomy not consistently curative for non-myasthenic paraneoplastic autoimmune disorders due to peripheral clone persistence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.0" class="evidence-link">[e188.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.2" class="evidence-link">[e188.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Thymoma produces mature, long-lived CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; mature autoreactive T cells exported from thymoma may persist in periphery for more than 10 years after removal. <a href="../results/extraction-result-186.html#e186.0" class="evidence-link">[e186.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.0" class="evidence-link">[e188.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.2" class="evidence-link">[e188.2]</a> </li>
    <li>AIH recurring/relapsing after thymectomy and chemotherapy; biochemical relapse occurred months later after therapy completion, demonstrating autonomous peripheral autoimmunity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.0" class="evidence-link">[e188.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Thymectomy frequently leads to temporary postoperative deterioration of MG (proposed mechanism: removal of residual tumor-associated regulatory T cell pool without immediate benefit from halting autoreactive export). <a href="../results/extraction-result-180.html#e180.0" class="evidence-link">[e180.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Autoimmune disease may appear de novo after thymectomy in some cases; SLE, NMO and other conditions developed after thymectomy in patients treated for MG/thymoma, suggesting peripheral clones can initiate new responses. <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.0" class="evidence-link">[e190.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-192.html#e192.4" class="evidence-link">[e192.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-192.html#e192.5" class="evidence-link">[e192.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.2" class="evidence-link">[e190.2]</a> </li>
    <li>TREC levels (marker of recent thymic emigrants) are elevated in thymomatous MG and fall after thymectomy, but peripheral mature T cell clones and autoantibodies persist, showing thymic-independent maintenance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-186.html#e186.0" class="evidence-link">[e186.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Tacrolimus treatment reduces thymic TREC output but does not eliminate peripheral autoreactive populations already established, confirming peripheral autonomy of exported clones. <a href="../results/extraction-result-186.html#e186.0" class="evidence-link">[e186.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Thymectomy may not reliably resolve non-MG paraneoplastic autoimmune disorders; autoimmune-related adverse events can occur or persist after thymoma removal. <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.2" class="evidence-link">[e188.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-181.html#e181.1" class="evidence-link">[e181.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Case reports document autoimmune manifestations appearing years after thymectomy (e.g., PRCA, SLE, portal hypertension 9 years post-thymectomy), indicating very long-lived autoreactive clones. <a href="../results/extraction-result-192.html#e192.4" class="evidence-link">[e192.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.2" class="evidence-link">[e190.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Peripheral autoreactive B cell clones producing autoantibodies can persist in bone marrow niches; long-lived plasma cells maintain antibody production independent of thymic signals. <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.3" class="evidence-link">[e190.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-185.html#e185.0" class="evidence-link">[e185.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While lymphocyte longevity is established immunology, the specific application to explain thymoma clinical outcomes (variable thymectomy efficacy, post-surgical autoimmune emergence, disease-specific differences) with supporting TREC and temporal data provides a clinically-validated mechanistic framework beyond general principles.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The concept that memory and effector T cells are long-lived (established since 1990s immunology), that thymectomy has variable efficacy, and that B cell clones can persist is well-known in general immunology and clinical thymic surgery literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit integration that thymoma-derived autoreactive clones have documented extended peripheral longevity (>10 years), combined with TREC-based evidence showing thymic-independent persistence, as a unified mechanistic explanation for the clinical paradoxes (post-thymectomy autoimmune persistence and emergence) across multiple autoimmune conditions provides clinical predictive and therapeutic value.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Quantification of the CD4+ mature naive (CD27+CD45RA+)/Treg (CD4+CD25+FoxP3+) ratio in thymoma tissue should predict risk of developing autoimmune complications, with ratios >8:1 associated with clinical autoimmunity and ratios <5:1 protective.</li>
                <li>Peripheral blood TREC levels measured pre-thymectomy in thymoma patients should correlate with active thymic autoreactive T cell export rate and predict which patients are most likely to develop new autoimmune manifestations in the 2-5 years post-diagnosis.</li>
                <li>Measurement of serum HMGB1 levels and peripheral Th17/Treg ratios (particularly Th17/Treg >1.5) should distinguish MG+ from MG- thymoma patients with >75% accuracy and correlate with MG disease severity (MGFA class).</li>
                <li>Enumeration of ectopic germinal centers (CD21+ FDC networks) in resected thymoma tissue should quantitatively correlate with post-operative autoantibody titers (anti-AChR, anti-titin) and predict likelihood of autoimmune disease persistence at 1-year follow-up.</li>
                <li>Time from estimated thymoma development to diagnosis/resection (estimable by tumor size, stage, growth kinetics) should correlate positively with number of peripheral autoreactive clones (measured by TCR sequencing or autoantibody epitope spreading) and negatively with probability of complete autoimmune remission post-thymectomy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Therapeutic blockade of HMGB1 (using neutralizing antibodies or small molecule inhibitors like glycyrrhizin) or IL-6 signaling (tocilizumab, anti-IL-6R antibodies) in thymoma patients might prevent development or progression of autoimmunity without requiring thymectomy, potentially preserving beneficial thymic T cell generation in younger patients or those with early-stage disease.</li>
                <li>Selective depletion of activated Th17 cells (using agents targeting CCR6 or IL-17R) or adoptive transfer of expanded autologous Tregs (ex vivo expanded CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ cells) might restore Th17/Treg balance and resolve autoimmunity in thymoma patients even without tumor removal, offering treatment options for unresectable tumors.</li>
                <li>The specific timing window during which the bulk of autoreactive T cell export occurs (early vs late in tumor development) may define a critical intervention period; very early detection via CT screening and immediate resection might prevent autoimmunity entirely by limiting export duration, but optimal timing window is unknown.</li>
                <li>Germinal center disruption through targeted B cell depletion (rituximab, anti-CD20) or germinal center microenvironment disruption (BAFF/CXCL13 blockade) specifically in thymoma patients might prevent autoantibody-mediated diseases while preserving cellular immunity, but optimal timing (preventive vs therapeutic) and duration are unknown.</li>
                <li>CXCL13 or BAFF antagonism (belimumab, atacicept) might prevent germinal center formation and progression from asymptomatic autoreactivity to clinical autoimmunity in high-risk thymomas (B2/B3 histology with high CXCL13 expression), but whether this would be more effective than current standard treatments is unknown.</li>
                <li>Modulation of late-stage thymic apoptosis checkpoints (the mechanism that protects against autoimmunity in MG- thymomas) through targeted therapy might be able to reduce autoreactive T cell export even in established thymomas, but drugs that could achieve this without causing general immunosuppression are unknown.</li>
                <li>Peripheral autoreactive T cell depletion or tolerance induction protocols (using antigen-specific approaches targeting muscle antigens like AChR, titin, or RyR) applied shortly after thymectomy might eliminate persistent clones and improve cure rates, but feasibility and efficacy are unknown.</li>
                <li>The relative contribution of intratumoral germinal centers vs systemic peripheral germinal center formation (e.g., in lymph nodes) to sustained autoantibody production may determine whether thymectomy alone is sufficient or whether additional B cell targeted therapy is needed, but this has not been systematically evaluated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding thymomas with normal or increased AIRE expression, intact medullary architecture, preserved MHC-II expression, and normal numbers of thymic myoid cells that still produce high rates of autoimmunity would challenge the central tolerance failure model and suggest alternative mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that artificial restoration of Treg numbers and function in thymoma (through adoptive transfer or in vivo expansion) does not reduce autoimmunity rates or Th17 responses would question whether Treg deficiency is causative vs consequence of autoimmunity.</li>
                <li>Showing that thymectomy performed very early (before any detectable autoreactive cell export as measured by normal peripheral TREC, no mature CD4+ T cells in circulation, no autoantibodies) still results in subsequent autoimmunity would challenge the autoreactive export model and suggest an independent mechanism.</li>
                <li>Finding that HMGB1 neutralization or IL-6 receptor blockade has no effect on peripheral Th17/Treg ratios, disease progression, or autoimmunity severity in thymoma patients would question the peripheral amplification mechanism and the causal role of this inflammatory axis.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that MG patients without detectable ectopic germinal centers in resected thymoma tissue have similar autoantibody titers, epitope spreading, and disease severity as those with abundant germinal centers would challenge their pathogenic role and suggest autoantibodies are produced elsewhere.</li>
                <li>Showing that patients with equivalent CD4+ naive/Treg ratios have vastly different autoimmunity rates would challenge the quantitative threshold model and suggest other factors (genetic, environmental, epitope-specific) are more important.</li>
                <li>Finding that autoreactive T cell clones identified in thymoma tissue are absent or different from those found in peripheral blood and target tissues would challenge the thymic export model and suggest peripheral de novo generation of autoreactivity.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that germinal center disruption (B cell depletion with rituximab) in thymoma patients worsens rather than improves autoimmunity would suggest germinal centers have protective regulatory functions not captured by current models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The specific molecular mechanisms explaining why type A thymomas (which retain some thymic architecture and AIRE expression) have much lower autoimmunity rates (~10% with autoimmunity) than B-type thymomas (~40-50%) despite sharing some architectural abnormalities are not fully explained by current architectural and AIRE models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.0" class="evidence-link">[e189.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.0" class="evidence-link">[e191.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-180.html#e180.0" class="evidence-link">[e180.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Why approximately 50-70% of thymoma patients never develop clinically apparent autoimmunity despite similar architectural defects, AIRE deficiency, MHC-II reduction, and Treg deficiency remains unexplained. Genetic susceptibility (HLA types, CTLA4 polymorphisms), threshold effects, or protective mechanisms are incompletely understood. <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.2" class="evidence-link">[e188.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.0" class="evidence-link">[e189.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-180.html#e180.0" class="evidence-link">[e180.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not adequately explain tissue-specific targeting and autoimmune disease heterogeneity: why individual patients develop specific conditions (MG vs hepatitis vs cytopenias vs dermatologic vs neurologic) despite similar thymic defects. Molecular mimicry, antigen-specific T cell repertoires, or organ-specific factors are not addressed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.0" class="evidence-link">[e188.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.7" class="evidence-link">[e190.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-187.html#e187.0" class="evidence-link">[e187.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.6" class="evidence-link">[e188.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.1" class="evidence-link">[e191.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.2" class="evidence-link">[e191.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Good syndrome's characteristic profound B cell depletion (~0.19% B cells), hypogammaglobulinemia, and immunodeficiency phenotype (recurrent infections) is not explained by the central tolerance failure and T cell export model. A distinct pathogenic mechanism involving autoreactive cytotoxic T cells targeting B cells or B cell progenitors has been proposed but is not integrated. <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.4" class="evidence-link">[e191.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.2" class="evidence-link">[e183.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.1" class="evidence-link">[e230.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.2" class="evidence-link">[e230.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Anti-cytokine autoantibodies (neutralizing antibodies against IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ω, IL-12, IL-17 family, IL-22) represent a distinct immunopathology category not fully accounted for by germinal center or conventional T cell-mediated models. These antibodies cause immunodeficiency (CMC, opportunistic infections) rather than typical autoimmune inflammation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.2" class="evidence-link">[e183.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.1" class="evidence-link">[e183.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-185.html#e185.0" class="evidence-link">[e185.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The molecular mimicry hypothesis (thymoma cells aberrantly overexpressing muscle antigens like CHRNA1/AChR, TTN/titin, RYR1/2/3/ryanodine receptors in MG+ cases per TCGA data) provides an alternative or complementary mechanism for MG that is distinct from pure tolerance failure and not fully integrated with the central tolerance model. <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.1" class="evidence-link">[e189.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Why checkpoint inhibitor therapy (anti-PD-1/PD-L1) precipitates severe and rapid-onset autoimmunity (myositis, myocarditis, hepatitis) in thymoma patients at much higher rates (~60-70% severe irAEs) than other cancers is incompletely explained. Pre-existing subclinical autoreactive populations and their rapid activation mechanisms need better characterization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.5" class="evidence-link">[e189.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-191.html#e191.9" class="evidence-link">[e191.9]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.1" class="evidence-link">[e230.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.2" class="evidence-link">[e230.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Specific histotype-dependent pathway differences (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation upregulated in MG+ AB but downregulated in MG+ B2; MacTh1 cluster down in MG+ AB, up in MG+ B2) suggest heterogeneous mechanisms across thymoma types that are not captured by a unified tolerance failure model. <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of genetic susceptibility factors (HLA subtypes like HLA-A24, HLA-B8; CTLA4 polymorphisms; possible AIRE variants) in determining which thymoma patients develop autoimmunity and which specific conditions develop is mentioned but not mechanistically integrated into the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.1" class="evidence-link">[e190.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
