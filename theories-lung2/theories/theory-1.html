                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what drives lung adenocarcinomas that lack known driver alterations in the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A substantial fraction of RTK/RAS/RAF-negative lung adenocarcinomas are driven by coordinated loss of multiple tumor suppressors (TP53, STK11, KEAP1, NF1, CDKN2A) that collectively disinhibit proliferation, evade cell cycle checkpoints, dysregulate metabolism, and enable survival without requiring oncogenic kinase activation. These tumors follow a 'multiple-hit' tumor suppressor model where cumulative loss of negative regulators across multiple pathways achieves transformation, particularly enriched in smoking-associated and aggressive disease.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Multiple Tumor Suppressor Loss Principle</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinomas lacking activating RTK/RAS/RAF mutations, transformation is achieved through concurrent loss-of-function alterations in multiple tumor suppressors spanning different regulatory pathways: TP53 (DNA damage response, 33-46% frequency), STK11/LKB1 (metabolic regulation, 14-17% frequency), KEAP1 (oxidative stress response, ~24% frequency), and CDKN2A (cell cycle control, 19-24% deletion frequency), with these losses showing lower subclonal fractions indicating early truncal events.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to lung adenocarcinomas analyzed by whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing with clonality analysis; frequencies cited are from Western cohorts; smoking-associated tumors show higher rates than never-smoker tumors; applies particularly to tumors lacking EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1, ERBB2, or BRAF alterations.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>TP53 mutations frequently co-occur with oncogenic drivers but at even higher frequencies in driver-negative tumors</li>
                <li>STK11 and KEAP1 mutations are particularly enriched in KRAS-mutant tumors but also occur in driver-negative contexts</li>
                <li>CDKN2A loss can occur through homozygous deletion, point mutation, or epigenetic silencing</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <h3>Statement 1: NF1 Loss as RAS Pathway Surrogate Principle</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In a subset of RTK/RAS/RAF-negative lung adenocarcinomas (~8-11% frequency), loss-of-function mutations in NF1 (neurofibromin, a RAS-GAP) provide constitutive RAS pathway activation functionally equivalent to oncogenic KRAS mutations, with ~70% of NF1-mutant tumors lacking other canonical drivers and NF1-mutant patients showing similar clinical characteristics and prognosis to KRAS-mutant patients.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to lung adenocarcinomas with comprehensive mutation profiling for both NF1 and canonical RTK/RAS/RAF drivers; NF1 is a large gene requiring adequate sequencing coverage; frequencies of 8.3% (TCGA) and 11% (other cohorts) reported; ~15% co-occurrence with KRAS when both altered; primarily in smoker-associated tumors.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>NF1 is a large gene and some mutations may be passengers; functional loss-of-function should be confirmed</li>
                <li>NF1 germline mutations cause neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome with cancer predisposition</li>
                <li>NF1 loss may have distinct downstream effects from oncogenic KRAS despite both activating RAS</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>NF1 mutated at 11% as negative regulator of RAS signaling contributing to pathway activation, significantly depleted in mutation spectrum cluster 1 and co-occurring with U2AF1 mutations <a href="../results/extraction-result-26.html#e26.10" class="evidence-link">[e26.10]</a> </li>
    <li>NF1 loss-of-function mutations detected at 8.3% (TCGA) and ~11% (cBioPortal) with ~70% of NF1-mutant lung cancers exhibiting no other somatic alteration; NF1-mutant patients have similar clinical characteristics and prognosis to KRAS-mutant patients with ~15% co-occurrence <a href="../results/extraction-result-25.html#e25.5" class="evidence-link">[e25.5]</a> </li>
    <li>NF1 included in mutually exclusive RTK/RAS/RAF gene set (with EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, MET, ZKSCAN1) covering ~60.3% of pooled patients in MEGS analysis <a href="../results/extraction-result-12.html#e12.4" class="evidence-link">[e12.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-26.html#e26.10" class="evidence-link">[e26.10]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> NF1 loss in lung cancer is established, but the specific characterization as a KRAS-equivalent alteration in driver-negative tumors with quantitative co-occurrence and clinical similarity data represents an incremental but meaningful refinement.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> NF1 as a tumor suppressor and RAS-GAP is well-established; NF1 mutations in lung cancer have been reported in multiple genomic studies including TCGA.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The quantitative characterization of NF1 loss as a functional surrogate for KRAS mutations in a specific subset (~70%) of NF1-mutant tumors lacking other drivers, with clinical and prognostic similarity to KRAS-mutant disease, represents a refined understanding of NF1's role.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: KEAP1-NRF2 Pathway Dysregulation Principle</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> KEAP1 loss-of-function mutations (~24% frequency) in lung adenocarcinomas stabilize NRF2 transcription factor, leading to constitutive activation of antioxidant response pathways that promote survival under oxidative stress, enhance metabolic adaptation, prevent apoptosis through TRAF2-NF-κB signaling activation, and contribute to therapy resistance, functioning as an oncogenic driver particularly in combination with other tumor suppressor losses.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to lung adenocarcinomas with mutation profiling for KEAP1; frequency of ~24% observed in Western cohorts; KEAP1 mutations show early clonality suggesting truncal driver role; associated with smoking history; particularly relevant in KRAS-mutant contexts but also driver-negative tumors; co-occurs with STK11 loss and associated with aggressive biology.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>KEAP1 mutations are loss-of-function leading to NRF2 stabilization (gain-of-function outcome)</li>
                <li>Alternative mechanisms of NRF2 activation include NFE2L2 (NRF2 gene) activating mutations</li>
                <li>KEAP1 loss associated with resistance to chemotherapy and potentially immunotherapy</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>KEAP1 mutated at 23.8% in EAGLE cohort with significantly lower subclonal fraction (FSM) (p=0.012) suggesting early/tumor-initiation role <a href="../results/extraction-result-12.html#e12.9" class="evidence-link">[e12.9]</a> </li>
    <li>KEAP1 mutations activate TRAF2-NF-κB signaling to prevent apoptosis in lung cancer cells, indicating mechanistic oncogenic function <a href="../results/extraction-result-5.html#e5.0" class="evidence-link">[e5.0]</a> </li>
    <li>KEAP1 mutations listed among core co-mutated genes with KRAS associated with aggressive phenotype and early metastatic dissemination, implicated in poor outcomes to standard therapies <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.13" class="evidence-link">[e22.13]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> KEAP1's role is established but the mechanistic insights (TRAF2-NF-κB activation) and clonality/timing data in driver-negative tumors represent incremental advances.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> KEAP1 as a negative regulator of NRF2 and tumor suppressor is established; KEAP1 mutations in lung cancer and their role in oxidative stress response are well-characterized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The specific mechanistic link between KEAP1 mutations and TRAF2-NF-κB signaling activation as an anti-apoptotic mechanism, and the characterization of KEAP1 as an early truncal event (low FSM) driving transformation in driver-negative contexts.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Driver-negative lung adenocarcinomas with combined TP53, STK11, and KEAP1 mutations will show higher proliferation rates and metastatic potential than tumors with single tumor suppressor loss</li>
                <li>NF1-mutant driver-negative tumors will show activated RAS pathway signaling (elevated ERK phosphorylation) comparable to KRAS-mutant tumors</li>
                <li>KEAP1-mutant tumors will show elevated NRF2 target gene expression and increased resistance to oxidative stress compared to KEAP1 wild-type tumors</li>
                <li>Tumors with ≥3 tumor suppressor losses will have higher tumor mutational burden and chromosomal instability than tumors with 0-1 losses</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether therapeutic inhibition of NRF2 in KEAP1-mutant driver-negative tumors will show clinical efficacy comparable to targeting oncogenic kinases</li>
                <li>Whether restoration of tumor suppressor function (e.g., p53 reactivation, LKB1 replacement) in driver-negative tumors with multiple losses will reverse transformation</li>
                <li>Whether specific combinations of tumor suppressor losses predict differential responses to immunotherapy versus chemotherapy</li>
                <li>Whether NF1 loss predicts response to MEK inhibitors in driver-negative tumors similarly to KRAS mutations</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that KEAP1 knockdown in lung cancer cells does not activate NRF2 target genes or provide survival advantage would contradict the KEAP1-NRF2 driver mechanism</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that NF1-mutant tumors do not show elevated RAS pathway activity compared to NF1 wild-type tumors would challenge the RAS pathway surrogate model</li>
                <li>Showing that driver-negative tumors with multiple tumor suppressor losses do not show higher proliferation or transformation capacity than single-loss tumors would contradict the cumulative loss model</li>
                <li>Finding that TP53, STK11, or KEAP1 mutations occur predominantly as late subclonal events rather than early truncal events would challenge their role as primary drivers</li>
