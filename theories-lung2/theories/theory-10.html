                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Etiologic branching: smokers diverge into distinct molecular pathways with different dependence on tobacco dose</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why only some cigarette smokers develop lung cancer while others do not, despite smoking being a strong risk factor, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Smokers do not share a single carcinogenic pathway; instead, smoking exposure increases the probability of entering multiple molecularly distinct tumorigenic routes. Some routes are strongly tobacco-mutagen driven (high mutation burden, tobacco signatures, KRAS/TP53-rich landscapes), whereas others reflect rearrangement/RTK-driven programs more typical of never/light smokers (EGFR, ALK). Which route a smoker follows depends on (i) dose and deposition patterns, (ii) host susceptibility (repair/inflammation), and (iii) stochastic acquisition/selection of specific driver events. Thus, among smokers with similar exposure, only those who enter a high-propensity route (e.g., tobacco-signature-high with genomic instability) develop clinically apparent cancer, while others either do not initiate, initiate but are cleared, or initiate low-propensity routes that do not progress.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Route mixture law (multiple latent etiologic components)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Overall lung cancer risk among smokers is a mixture of latent etiologic routes with different driver spectra and different dependence on tobacco-derived mutational processes. The probability of cancer is the sum over routes: P(cancer | smoker) = Σ_k P(enter route k | exposure, host context)·P(progress | route k, host context). Routes enriched in smokers tend to show tobacco-associated driver patterns (e.g., KRAS/TP53 and high mutation burden), while routes enriched in never/light smokers show RTK mutations/fusions (e.g., EGFR, ALK).</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to lung cancers broadly (NSCLC and SCLC concepts) where tumor molecular subtyping is available; intended to explain heterogeneity across smokers and between smokers and never-smokers at the level of pathway prevalence, not to replace quantitative dose–response models.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Apparent pathway prevalence depends on detection platform (fusion detection requires RNA and sensitive methods).</li>
                <li>Histology strongly constrains feasible routes (e.g., SCLC has near-uniform TP53/RB1 loss).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>EGFR mutations are enriched in never-smokers and East Asian populations; ALK fusions are enriched in never/light smokers and younger patients, indicating distinct etiologic routes less dependent on tobacco dose. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.6" class="evidence-link">[e89.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.0" class="evidence-link">[e86.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.1" class="evidence-link">[e86.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.8" class="evidence-link">[e89.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.2" class="evidence-link">[e87.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.4" class="evidence-link">[e88.4]</a> </li>
    <li>KRAS mutations are more frequent in smokers and define a distinct subset; tobacco carcinogens induce characteristic mutation patterns (e.g., NNK→KRAS; benzo[a]pyrene→TP53) consistent with tobacco-driven routes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.3" class="evidence-link">[e87.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.7" class="evidence-link">[e89.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.7" class="evidence-link">[e116.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SCLC and squamous cancers are described as heavy-smoking associated and show high mutational loads and characteristic tobacco signatures; SCLC has near-uniform TP53/RB1 inactivation, consistent with a specific high-propensity route in heavy smokers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.0" class="evidence-link">[e83.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-81.html#e81.0" class="evidence-link">[e81.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Platform sensitivity affects observed route frequencies (e.g., fusions under-detected without RNA/NGS), implying that route mixture estimation depends on measurement quality. <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.6" class="evidence-link">[e86.6]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Subtype heterogeneity exists; the explicit mixture formulation creates testable predictions about how exposure and host factors shift route proportions and about which biomarkers predict route entry vs progression.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Distinct molecular subtypes of lung cancer by smoking status (EGFR/ALK in never-smokers vs KRAS/TP53-heavy in smokers) are well known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Casting susceptibility among smokers explicitly as a mixture-of-routes process where risk differences reflect differential route entry probabilities and route-specific progression probabilities—linking epidemiologic heterogeneity to tumor-genomic mixture modeling.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Within-patient multi-lesion heterogeneity implies field processes and stochastic route selection</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> When multiple primary lesions occur, driver mutations and TMB can differ substantially across lesions within the same individual, implying that carcinogenesis proceeds through multiple semi-independent initiation events within an exposed field, and that progression to clinically dominant disease depends on stochastic acquisition/selection of route-defining drivers rather than exposure alone.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to patients with multifocal lung adenocarcinoma or multiple lesions undergoing multi-region or multi-lesion sequencing; informs why exposure-matched smokers can diverge in outcomes.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Multifocal disease may include both independent primaries and intrapulmonary metastases; interpretation requires clonality assessment.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In early-stage multifocal LUAD, targeted sequencing of 66 lesions shows extensive inter-/intra-patient heterogeneity: EGFR present in ~70% lesions but different EGFR mutation types can occur across lesions in same patient; TMB differs across lesions in most patients (26/30). <a href="../results/extraction-result-78.html#e78.0" class="evidence-link">[e78.0]</a> </li>
    <li>EGFR/ALK co-alterations are more frequent in multifocal than unifocal LUAC (4.12% vs 0.83%), suggesting field/multi-initiation contexts influence detectable pathway complexity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.2" class="evidence-link">[e86.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.3" class="evidence-link">[e86.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The evidence exists for heterogeneity; the specific linkage to route-selection probability among smokers is a synthesis that yields predictions about lesion-level biomarkers and prevention targeting.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Field cancerization and intratumor heterogeneity are established concepts in smoking-exposed airways.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Using multi-lesion heterogeneity as direct evidence for stochastic route selection within the same host and exposure background, thereby explaining why similar-exposure smokers can have diverging cancer outcomes and pathway types.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Among heavy smokers with similar pack-years, tumor subtype/driver route proportions will differ systematically by co-exposure profiles (e.g., higher PM2.5/PAH exposure shifting toward adenocarcinoma-like peripheral routes) and by inhalation topography proxies (filter/low-yield use).</li>
                <li>In prospective cohorts, biomarkers that reflect route entry (e.g., tobacco mutational signature markers in airway samples) will predict development of smoking-signature-high tumors better than they predict RTK-fusion-driven tumors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A joint model that predicts (i) route entry (driver class) and (ii) progression separately will outperform single-stage risk models for smokers; especially, adding route-proxy biomarkers (airway methylation/expression field signatures) could enable early identification of which smokers are on a high-propensity route.</li>
                <li>Some smokers who never develop cancer will still show high rates of subclinical initiation events (field mutations) but will exhibit stronger immune surveillance signatures that prevent route progression; demonstrating this requires longitudinal airway sampling.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If comprehensive, platform-harmonized sequencing shows no meaningful differences in driver-route prevalence by smoking status (after controlling for histology/age/sex/ancestry), the route-mixture premise would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If multifocal-lesion sequencing with clonality correction shows that lesions are mostly clonal metastases rather than independent initiations, the inference about stochastic multi-initiation would be less general.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>This theory explains heterogeneity in terms of route mixtures but does not, by itself, quantify why some smokers never enter any route (requires internal dose/repair/inflammation mechanisms as in the two-stage model). </li>
