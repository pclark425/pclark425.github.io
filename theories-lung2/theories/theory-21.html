                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Many lung adenocarcinomas labeled RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative (or clinically 'driver-negative') are better interpreted as (i) assay-negative for canonical coding hotspots rather than biologically driverless, and (ii) driven by a mixture of hard-to-detect structural/regulatory alterations (fusions, in-frame exon-level SVs, enhancer/super-enhancer hijacking, splice alterations) and large-scale copy-number/expression programs that substitute for canonical MAPK addiction by enforcing survival (anti-apoptosis), proliferation (G1/S), and mitotic competence. This theory predicts that comprehensive WGS+RNA-seq+copy-number profiling will reclassify a substantial fraction of 'driver-negative' LUAD into actionable or mechanistically coherent subgroups, while leaving a residual fraction driven by non-RTK mechanisms (chromatin/splicing dysregulation, endogenous mutagenesis).</p>

            <h2>Theory (Statement/Laws)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Driver-negative-by-panel is often driver-positive-by-modality expansion</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinomas classified as RTK/RAS/RAF-driver–negative based primarily on absence of canonical coding hotspots (and sometimes focal high-level amplifications) in a limited oncogene list, expanding measurement to RNA fusion detection and/or WGS structural-variant calling (plus explicit splice/SV-aware analysis) will increase the detected prevalence of oncogenic pathway-activating events, because a non-trivial subset of true drivers are fusions, exon-skipping/splice alterations, in-frame multi-exon rearrangements, or enhancer/super-enhancer–mediated regulatory activation that are systematically under-detected by WES-only or hotspot panels.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Lung adenocarcinoma (primary or metastatic). Applies specifically to tumors labeled 'driver-negative' under definitions that rely on coding hotspot SNVs/indels and/or limited amplification calls (e.g., EGFR/KRAS/BRAF/ALK/ROS1/RET/MET-focused panels or WES-only workflows without robust SV/splice calling).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>RNA-seq can miss driver fusions if the fusion transcript is not expressed, is expressed only in minor subclones, or RNA quality is poor (e.g., low RIN).</li>
                <li>WGS can miss or miscall SVs in low purity samples or highly repetitive breakpoints; orthogonal validation (PCR/FISH) may be required.</li>
                <li>Some 'driver-negative' tumors may truly lack major SV/regulatory RTK activation and instead be driven primarily by chromatin/splicing alterations or endogenous mutational processes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In the 183-LUAD cohort, only 47% had mutations in known proliferative signaling drivers and ~53% lacked such mutations; including high-level focal amplifications increased driver-positive to 55% (leaving ~45% still negative), motivating search beyond canonical coding mutations/amplifications. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
    <li>WGS identified an oncogenic in-frame EGFR ex25-26 deletion (structural variant) with ligand-independent signaling and erlotinib sensitivity in vitro—an example of a driver mechanism not captured by standard hotspot SNV testing alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
    <li>WGS in the same 183-LUAD study reported in-frame multi-exon duplications in kinases (SIK2 duplication validated by qPCR; ROCK1 duplication) in tumors described as lacking canonical oncogene mutations, illustrating SV driver candidates that WES/hotspot panels can miss. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.1" class="evidence-link">[e54.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.2" class="evidence-link">[e54.2]</a> </li>
    <li>RNA-seq fusion discovery in EAGLE showed 24/80 (30%) tumors had ≥1 fusion, and 10/11 tested candidate fusions validated by PCR+sequencing, demonstrating frequent SV-derived transcripts not discoverable by WES alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.5" class="evidence-link">[e53.5]</a> </li>
    <li>KIF5B-RET fusion was discovered/validated in tumors negative for EGFR, KRAS, and EML4-ALK by clinical testing, with recurrence in replication sets (2/20 in replication), proving that clinically 'triple-negative' cases can harbor actionable RTK fusions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> </li>
    <li>A referenced mechanism in LUAD 'without clinically actionable genetic alterations' describes ERBB2 overexpression via super-enhancer formation with genomic structural abnormalities (enhancer hijacking/regulatory activation), exemplifying noncoding/structural activation without canonical coding drivers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.1" class="evidence-link">[e51.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Reviews emphasize that additional actionable drivers beyond the most common ones include MET exon 14 skipping and ROS1 fusions, which are specifically highlighted as events that reduce the pool of initially driver-negative cases when tested for. <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.1" class="evidence-link">[e113.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.2" class="evidence-link">[e113.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The ingredients are known, but packaging them into a single quantitative/operational claim about classification error and its predictable correction across modalities is a synthesis rather than a standard named LUAD theory.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is established that fusions (ALK/ROS1/RET), MET exon 14 skipping, and some SV/regulatory drivers can be missed by limited testing and that RNA-seq/WGS improves detection.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The novel contribution is an explicit, falsifiable detection-conditioned law for LUAD: 'driver-negative' status is systematically biased by assay choice, and modality expansion should measurably increase driver discovery particularly via SV/regulatory classes, unifying fusions, exon-level SVs, enhancer hijacking, and splice alterations as one explanatory class.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: CNA-based substitute-driver modules: PI3K survival + RB/CCND1 cell-cycle + mitotic competence</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In RTK/RAS/RAF-driver–negative (or EGFR/ALK-negative–enriched) lung adenocarcinomas, tumor fitness can be maintained by substitute-driver modules composed of coordinated copy-number and expression alterations that (i) activate PI3K/AKT signaling via PTEN loss and/or PIK3CA gain, (ii) accelerate G1/S progression via CCND1 gain coupled to CDKN2A loss and/or RB1 loss, and (iii) reinforce mitotic/spindle programs via amplification/overexpression of mitotic regulators (e.g., TPX2) and sometimes anti-apoptotic genes (e.g., BCL2L1); these modules may co-occur as correlated CNA patterns and function as primary drivers or strong co-drivers in the absence of canonical RTK/MAPK coding oncogenes.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD cohorts enriched for driver-negative status by limited oncogene screening (e.g., EGFR/ALK-negative cohorts) and/or tumors with appreciable copy-number alteration burden. Most applicable when copy-number profiling is available (qPCR CN, SNP array, aCGH, WES/WGS CN).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>RB1 loss can biologically limit dependence on CCND1/CDK4/6 (i.e., CCND1 gain may not imply CDK4/6 inhibitor sensitivity when RB1 is inactive).</li>
                <li>Small cohorts and correlation-based CNA modules can be inflated by outliers; module claims require replication in larger, well-powered datasets.</li>
                <li>In tumors dominated by fusion RTKs or strong MAPK drivers, these modules may be secondary rather than substitute primary drivers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In EGFR/ALK-negative microdissected LUAD (n=10), PTEN showed significant copy-number reduction (mean T/N index 1.73; p=0.0371) with significantly reduced mRNA in tumors and strong CN–mRNA correlation (R^2=0.827; p=0.003), consistent with functional PTEN loss enabling PI3K pathway activation without canonical RTK/MAPK drivers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In the same cohort (n=10), RB1 had significantly reduced copy number (mean index 1.67; p=0.0010) and reduced RB1 mRNA in tumors, consistent with G1/S checkpoint impairment as an alternative proliferative mechanism. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.1" class="evidence-link">[e52.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Copy-number correlations across the 10 EGFR/ALK-negative tumors showed near-perfect co-variation among EMSY, CCND1, and PIK3CA (r=0.994, 0.919, 0.913; all p<0.0001) and strong anticorrelation of CCND1 with CDKN2A (r=-0.927; p<0.0001), supporting coordinated selection for PI3K + cell-cycle activation modules rather than isolated single-gene events. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.4" class="evidence-link">[e52.4]</a> </li>
    <li>A focal 20q11.2 amplicon in NSCLC (including at least one primary adenocarcinoma) encompassed TPX2 and BCL2L1; TPX2 displayed strong copy-number-driven overexpression and was nominated as likely target, implying a mitotic-spindle/cell-cycle reinforcement route. <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.1" class="evidence-link">[e111.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Within the same 20q11.2 amplicon, BCL2L1 showed modest copy-number-driven overexpression and was proposed as an anti-apoptotic oncogenic candidate, consistent with a survival module that can complement or substitute for upstream RTK/MAPK activation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.2" class="evidence-link">[e111.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The pathways are known, but interpreting correlated CNAs as a modular substitute-driver program specifically explaining driver-negative LUAD is a higher-level synthesis supported by the provided EGFR/ALK-negative CNA correlation evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> PI3K activation via PTEN loss/PIK3CA gain and RB pathway deregulation via CCND1/CDKN2A/RB1 are established oncogenic mechanisms; TPX2/BCL2L1 amplifications are known in some cancers.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The novel aspect is the explicit substitute-driver 'module' framing for driver-negative LUAD, coupled to a testable CNA correlation architecture predicting co-selection (PIK3CA–CCND1–EMSY co-gain; CCND1–CDKN2A anticorrelation) as a recurring alternative-driver logic rather than strict mutual exclusivity.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a rigorously defined RTK/RAS/RAF-driver–negative LUAD cohort (negative for EGFR/KRAS/BRAF/MET/ERBB2 alterations and ALK/ROS1/RET fusions by standard testing), adding WGS+RNA-seq will identify SV/regulatory drivers (fusions, exon-level in-frame SVs, enhancer hijacking, splice events) in a measurable fraction, reducing the 'driver-negative' pool.</li>
                <li>Driver-negative LUADs with CCND1–PIK3CA co-gain and CDKN2A loss will show higher PI3K activity readouts (e.g., pAKT signatures) and higher E2F/G2M transcriptional programs than driver-negative tumors without these CNA patterns.</li>
                <li>20q11.2-amplified tumors (TPX2/BCL2L1 region) will show elevated mitotic-spindle gene expression and greater chromosomal instability/aneuploidy metrics relative to non-amplified tumors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Noncoding enhancer/super-enhancer activation events of RTKs (e.g., ERBB2) will occur at higher prevalence in genomically 'driver-negative' LUAD than appreciated from WES/panels, and these tumors will respond to matched RTK-targeted therapies comparably to coding-driver tumors.</li>
                <li>Combined inhibition of PI3K-pathway signaling and anti-apoptotic dependency (e.g., PI3K/AKT inhibitor plus a BCL-xL–targeting strategy) will show synergy selectively in driver-negative LUAD with PTEN loss/PIK3CA gain plus 20q11.2/BCL2L1 amplification.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Perform WGS+RNA-seq on a large, well-powered cohort stringently defined as RTK/RAS/RAF-driver–negative by comprehensive clinical-grade DNA+RNA testing; if SV/regulatory driver prevalence is not higher than in matched driver-positive controls (controlling for purity, sequencing depth, and RNA quality), the detection-conditioned enrichment claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>In tumors with the EMSY/CCND1/PIK3CA CNA correlation pattern, test whether pathway outputs are elevated (phosphoproteomics: pAKT; cell-cycle: pRB/E2F) and whether perturbations match the module logic; failure to observe functional pathway activation would challenge the module-substitution statement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Endogenous late-stage mutational processes (APOBEC and C→T transitions) enriched in subclonal mutations and associated with metastasis risk are not mechanistically derived from the structural/CNA module framework, beyond potentially generating additional alterations later in evolution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Chromatin remodeler/splicing-factor loss-of-function drivers (e.g., ARID1A, RBM10, U2AF1) can drive tumorigenesis without being captured by a mainly SV/CNA module framing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.5" class="evidence-link">[e54.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.4" class="evidence-link">[e54.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> </li>
