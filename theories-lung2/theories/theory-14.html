                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why only some cigarette smokers develop lung cancer while others do not, despite smoking being a strong risk factor, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Smokers are a mixture of at least two etiologic regimes: (A) tobacco-mutagenesis–dominated tumors characterized by smoking-associated mutational processes and driver spectra enriched in smokers (e.g., KRAS, TP53 patterns), and (B) 'intrinsic/driver-led' tumors whose key initiating events are less dependent on smoking dose (e.g., telomere maintenance/TERT variation, apoptosis response/CLPTM1L, and certain oncogenic fusion-driven subtypes typically enriched in never/light smokers). Some smokers develop cancers via regime B despite smoking, which contributes to the observation that not all heavy smokers get cancer while some lighter smokers do.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Existence of smoking-dose-independent germline susceptibility</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> A subset of lung-cancer risk in the population is mediated by germline susceptibility loci whose associations persist after adjustment for smoking dose and are observed across never-, ex-, and current smokers; these loci shift baseline susceptibility independent of measured smoking behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to common-variant germline susceptibility loci identified in GWAS with smoking-adjusted models in predominantly European-ancestry datasets.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Residual confounding remains possible because smoking exposure is self-reported and biomarkers of internal dose were not measured in the GWAS.</li>
                <li>Lead SNPs may tag causal variants via LD; functional mechanisms remain to be validated.</li>
            </ol>

    <li>GWAS at 5p15.33 (TERT/CLPTM1L): rs402710 per-allele OR ~1.19 after pack-year adjustment; association across never-, ex-, and current smokers; rs402710 not associated with cigarettes/day among controls (p=0.74), supporting non-mediation by measured smoking intensity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-105.html#e105.0" class="evidence-link">[e105.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The locus is known; the mixture framing is a synthesis that yields predictions about subtype distributions among smokers.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Smoking-adjusted GWAS loci (TERT/CLPTM1L) are established findings in lung cancer genetics.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Using these loci to argue explicitly for a mixture of etiologic regimes within smokers (dose-driven vs intrinsic/driver-led) provides a conceptual model for heterogeneous smoker outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Smoking status stratifies somatic driver pathway prevalence (distinct regimes)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Somatic driver spectra differ systematically by smoking history: fusions and EGFR-driven tumors are enriched in never/light smokers (and thus represent an etiology less dependent on heavy tobacco mutagenesis), whereas KRAS/TP53-heavy landscapes and certain tumor suppressor inactivation patterns are more characteristic of smoking-associated tumors.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to NSCLC and SCLC tumor molecular epidemiology; strongest for adenocarcinoma driver differences and for SCLC/SqCC being smoking-associated histologies.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Assay platform differences (NGS vs FISH/IHC; DNA vs RNA availability) can distort observed prevalence of fusions and co-alterations.</li>
                <li>Some co-occurrence of canonical drivers exists at low frequency, so exclusivity is not absolute.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>ALK fusions are reported predominantly in never/light smokers (~3–7% of lung tumors) and considered not correlated with smoking-associated mutation patterns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.1" class="evidence-link">[e86.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.8" class="evidence-link">[e89.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.2" class="evidence-link">[e87.2]</a> </li>
    <li>EGFR activating mutations are enriched in never-smokers and East Asian patients; KRAS mutations are more frequent in smokers; reviews summarize these contrasts as distinct etiologic pathways. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.6" class="evidence-link">[e89.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.4" class="evidence-link">[e88.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.0" class="evidence-link">[e86.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.3" class="evidence-link">[e87.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-89.html#e89.7" class="evidence-link">[e89.7]</a> </li>
    <li>SCLC shows smoking-associated mutational patterns (e.g., C:G>A:T transversions) and near-universal TP53/RB1 loss in many series, indicating a tobacco-mutagenesis-heavy regime; tumor-type associations with heavy smoking are emphasized. <a href="../results/extraction-result-104.html#e104.0" class="evidence-link">[e104.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.0" class="evidence-link">[e83.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-81.html#e81.0" class="evidence-link">[e81.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Methodological review notes that detection platform and sample type influence reported fusion prevalence and co-alteration frequencies, affecting apparent regime mixture estimates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.6" class="evidence-link">[e86.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.8" class="evidence-link">[e86.8]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a novel framing built from established molecular epidemiology facts.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Driver prevalence differences by smoking status (EGFR/ALK in never-smokers; KRAS in smokers) are widely known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit use of these differences as a mixture model to explain smoker heterogeneity (some smokers developing 'never-smoker-like' driver cancers) and to predict subtype composition conditional on germline baseline risk is a conceptual advance.</p>

                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Among smokers who develop lung cancer, those carrying higher baseline-risk germline variants (e.g., 5p15.33 risk alleles) will be overrepresented among lower pack-year cases compared with smokers without those alleles, consistent with an intrinsic susceptibility regime.</li>
                <li>In smoker case series, the fraction of ALK/EGFR-driven tumors will be higher among lighter smokers and among women/Asian-ancestry groups, consistent with regime mixing and demographic modifiers noted in reviews.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A formal latent-class model that uses germline susceptibility loci plus exposure and co-exposure metrics will identify at least two separable incidence-risk components with different dose–response slopes (steep for tobacco-mutagenesis class, shallow for intrinsic class).</li>
                <li>In longitudinal airway sampling of smokers (without cancer at baseline), those who later develop 'intrinsic/driver-led' tumors will show weaker smoking-signature field changes but stronger telomere/replicative stress signatures pre-diagnosis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If large datasets show that smoking-adjusted germline loci (e.g., 5p15.33) actually fully attenuate after using biomarker-verified internal dose, then the 'intrinsic' component may be largely exposure mismeasurement rather than a separate regime.</li>
                <li>If driver prevalence differences by smoking vanish after controlling for histology, age, sex, and detection methods, the mixture-regime interpretation would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Very large COPD/fibrosis-associated risk elevations (OR ~11.6 for COPD in one study) are not directly explained by a driver-mixture model without adding inflammatory/tissue-context mechanisms. <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.5" class="evidence-link">[e116.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.2" class="evidence-link">[e85.2]</a> </li>
