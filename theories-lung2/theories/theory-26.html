                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A major component of RTK/RAS/RAF-negative LUAD biology is not a single early initiating oncogene but a progression engine: epigenetic state (DNA methylation patterns and chromatin regulation) modulates local and genome-wide mutation accumulation (methylation-associated CpG deamination; smoking-adduct interactions; repair capacity via TDG/MBD4), while APOBEC and other endogenous signatures preferentially generate subclonal mutations later in evolution. Selection then amplifies subclones carrying functionally advantageous hits (including noncanonical drivers in diverse genes/pathways). This engine explains why some tumors appear driver-negative at diagnosis by exome criteria yet later acquire metastasis-associated subclonal driver events and why methylation and repair context predicts mutation spectra and burden.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Methylation–mutation coupling law (epigenetic mutagenesis field)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In LUAD, tumor DNA methylation levels at specific CpG loci (especially open-sea and intergenic probes) are strongly associated with total nonsynonymous mutation burden and with specific mutation fractions (notably C→T transitions and smoking-related C→A), consistent with methylation and repair context creating a mutagenic field that shapes the probability of generating oncogenic mutations in otherwise driver-negative tumors.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD tumors with paired methylome (e.g., 450K) and somatic mutation data (WES), with associations evaluated after adjusting for key covariates (smoking, age, sex, stage).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Associations may partly reflect reverse causation (mutations affecting methylation) or shared confounders (cell-of-origin composition); causal direction requires perturbation.</li>
                <li>Probe-level associations can be context-dependent (promoters/islands often depleted for positive associations).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Meta-analysis combining EAGLE and TCGA (n=486) identified >1,000 CpG probes significantly associated with TNSM and mutation fractions (Bonferroni p<1.5×10^-7), indicating robust methylation–mutation coupling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Open-sea and intergenic CpG probes were enriched for positive associations with multiple mutation types; CpG island/promoter probes were generally depleted for associations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Mechanistic plausibility described: 5-methylcytosine deamination produces C→T; methylated CpGs can enhance adduct formation (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene) contributing to C→A; reduced TDG/MBD4 repair exacerbates accumulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>TDG expression negatively correlated with C→T mutation frequency in TCGA (r=-0.26, p≈1e-7), consistent with repair capacity modulating methylation-associated mutagenesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Mechanisms are known; the novelty is the explicit predictive coupling at scale and its role in explaining driver-negative tumor evolution.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> CpG methylation and spontaneous deamination are established mechanisms for C→T mutations; repair enzymes like TDG/MBD4 are known to influence mutation accumulation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law asserts tumor-specific, genome-wide, probe-level methylation states as quantitative predictors of LUAD mutation burden and spectra in large integrated cohorts, framing methylation as a driver-negative-enabling mutagenic field rather than merely a biomarker.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Late subclonal endogenous mutagenesis law (APOBEC progression driver generator)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In LUAD, endogenous mutational processes—particularly APOBEC-mediated cytosine deamination and other transition-heavy signatures (e.g., C→T)—are enriched among subclonal mutations relative to clonal mutations and are associated with increased metastasis risk, implying these processes act preferentially in later tumor evolution to generate progression-driving variants that may substitute for missing early canonical RTK/RAS/RAF drivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD with sufficient sequencing depth and analytic correction for purity/CNA to infer clonality/subclonality and mutational signatures; applies to progression/metastasis risk in observational cohorts.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>APOBEC signature presence does not guarantee functional driver mutations; effect depends on target genes hit and selection.</li>
                <li>Some early driver-positive tumors also exhibit APOBEC late; the law concerns enrichment/temporal shift rather than exclusivity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>APOBEC mutations comprised 13.2% of subclonal versus 8.0% of clonal mutations (p<2.5×10^-50), showing strong subclonal enrichment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Higher TNSM and higher fraction of transitions (C→T, A→G) were associated with increased risk of distant metastasis; smoking-related C→A transversions were associated with early/clonal events rather than progression. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Endogenous signatures (APOBEC, C→T) were implicated in later-stage progression and metastasis risk; APOBEC signatures were not associated with smoking, sex, age, or stage, supporting an endogenous rather than exposure-driven late process. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>
    <li>EAGLE noted that >20% of samples lacked nonsynonymous mutations in known LUAD drivers, motivating the idea that late endogenous mutagenesis could generate functional driver events in such cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.4" class="evidence-link">[e53.4]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Builds on established APOBEC biology but extends it into a driver-negative evolution framework with specific temporal and clinical predictions.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> APOBEC mutagenesis as a cancer mutational process is well established; subclonal enrichment has been reported in multiple tumor types.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit mechanistic role proposed here for RTK/RAS/RAF-negative LUAD: endogenous, late-acting mutational processes as a compensatory driver generator linked to metastasis risk.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Among LUADs lacking RTK/RAS/RAF coding drivers, those with high APOBEC subclonal fractions will show higher rates of metastatic recurrence and greater intratumor heterogeneity than APOBEC-low cases, even after controlling for stage and smoking.</li>
                <li>Methylation-defined regions with high CpG methylation and low TDG/MBD4 expression will show localized enrichment of C→T mutations and higher probability of generating truncating mutations in tumor suppressors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Targeted demethylation or restoration of TDG/MBD4 activity (experimental systems) will measurably reduce ongoing mutation accumulation and delay emergence of resistant/metastatic subclones in LUAD models, implying a preventive/anti-evolution therapeutic strategy.</li>
                <li>APOBEC-high subclonal LUAD will exhibit predictable vulnerabilities to DNA damage response inhibitors (e.g., specific synthetic lethalities) that outperform RTK inhibitors in true driver-negative disease.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If clonality-aware signature analyses in independent LUAD cohorts do not reproduce APOBEC enrichment in subclonal mutations or do not associate endogenous signatures with metastasis risk, then the late-mutagenesis progression engine is undermined.</li>
                <li>If methylation–mutation associations disappear after rigorous control for tumor purity, cell-type composition, and regional mutation-rate covariates (replication with orthogonal methylome assays), then the epigenetic mutagenesis-field claim is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>This theory does not directly explain specific recurrent structural driver events (e.g., RET/ROS1 fusions, EGFR exon deletions) except as possible downstream consequences of genomic instability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.2" class="evidence-link">[e113.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
