                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what drives lung adenocarcinomas without known RTK/RAS/RAF pathway driver alterations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) lacking canonical RTK/RAS/RAF driver gene alterations, or following inhibition of such pathways (e.g., EGFR inhibition), tumor cells adaptively upregulate FGFR2 and FGFR3 via rapid, chromatin-mediated transcriptional de-repression. This compensatory response is not dependent on FGFR gene amplification or mutation, but arises through loss of EGFR→MEK/c-Src signaling that normally represses FGFR2/3 transcription. As a result, autocrine or microenvironmental (paracrine) FGF ligands (notably FGF2 and FGF7) can then signal through the newly upregulated FGFR2/3 to restore ERK/MAPK activation and growth, providing a rapid, non-genetic adaptive bypass that enables survival and proliferation even in the absence or inhibition of dominant RTK drivers.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Rapid Chromatin-Mediated De-repression of FGFR2/3 Compensates for Loss of Dominant RTK Signaling</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Upon pharmacologic or genetic suppression/loss of active EGFR signaling, a subset of NSCLC cells that previously relied on EGFR (including those lacking activating RTK/RAS/RAF pathway mutations at the time) rapidly upregulate FGFR2 and FGFR3 mRNA and protein through loss of EGFR→MEK/c-Src–mediated transcriptional repression, thereby permitting FGF-dependent ERK pathway reactivation and cellular growth.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to NSCLC (predominantly LUAD) cell lines and tumors with functional EGFR signaling prior to inhibition/loss—specifically in the period following acute EGFR pathway blockade (e.g., with TKIs or anti-EGFR antibodies), and particularly in tumors currently lacking other activating RTK/RAS/RAF genetic alterations. Not applicable in inherently EGFR-null or resistant lines.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>This adaptive bypass does not occur in NSCLC cell lines or tumors that naturally lack EGFR expression/action (i.e., EGFR-null or intrinsically EGFR-inhibitor-resistant), or those unable to induce FGFR2/3 transcription (e.g., due to chromatin inaccessibility).</li>
                <li>FGFR2/3 upregulation is necessary but requires co-occurrence of FGF ligand (autocrine or paracrine) for downstream ERK/MAPK activation and growth rescue.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>EGFR inhibition by gefitinib or cetuximab in sensitive NSCLC cell lines (e.g., H322c, HCC827, HCC4006) leads to rapid (<72 h) induction of FGFR2 and FGFR3 mRNA and protein, as measured by microarray, qRT-PCR, Western blot, and promoter-luciferase assays. Constitutively active MEK or c-Src can block this induction, and MEK or c-Src inhibition phenocopies EGFR inhibition, supporting a pathway from EGFR→MEK/c-Src→FGFR2/3 repression. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.0" class="evidence-link">[e107.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.1" class="evidence-link">[e107.1]</a> </li>
    <li>FGFR2/3 induction is not observed in EGFR-null NSCLC cell lines (H661, H520) or in intrinsic EGFR TKI–resistant lines (H226), confirming this bypass requires a pre-existing EGFR signaling context. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.0" class="evidence-link">[e107.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Timecourse of FGFR2/3 upregulation is ~24–72 hours—too rapid for gene amplification; no FGFR2/3 copy number alterations are observed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.0" class="evidence-link">[e107.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Review of analogous literature describes chromatin-mediated, reversible drug-tolerant states in other cancers, providing mechanistic plausibility for rapid epigenetic reprogramming. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.4" class="evidence-link">[e107.4]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While conceptually closely related to known adaptive resistance and bypass mechanisms, the specific demonstration and mechanistic pathway involving EGFR→MEK/c-Src repression and FGFR2/3 de-repression in LUAD is a significant expansion of known biology.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Genetic bypass via MET amplification or IGF-1R activation is established in EGFR inhibitor resistance; chromatin-mediated adaptive resisters are known in other contexts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit mechanistic link between acute EGFR suppression, rapid chromatin-mediated transcriptional upregulation of FGFR2/FGFR3 without gene amplification/mutation, and resultant alternative RTK dependence is newly defined for LUAD and is a plausible non-genetic resistance mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Paracrine FGF Signals from Microenvironment Synergize with FGFR2/3 Upregulation to Sustain Tumor Growth after EGFR Loss</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Once FGFR2/3 are transcriptionally upregulated following EGFR inhibition, cells previously dependent on EGFR become dependent on FGF signaling from the tumor microenvironment (or autocrine loops): exogenous FGF2/FGF7, including from stromal fibroblasts, acts via upregulated FGFR2/3 to restore ERK activation and promote anchorage-independent and clonogenic growth; these effects are suppressed by FGFR inhibition.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to LUAD in vitro models and, by extension, in vivo tumors in which EGFR pathway inhibition has triggered compensatory FGFR2/3 induction and a supportive microenvironment supplies FGF ligands. Not present in EGFR-independent lines or where microenvironmental FGF is absent.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Rescue by FGF2/FGF7 is abolished by pan-FGFR inhibition (RO4383596, AZ12908010), confirming FGFR-dependence.</li>
                <li>Co-culture with FGF-secreting fibroblasts recapitulates the microenvironmental effect, while monoculture in absence of exogenous FGF shows only limited rescue.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Exogenous FGF2 or FGF7 stimulation and co-culture with human fibroblasts can fully rescue ERK phosphorylation, clonogenicity, and anchorage-independent colony formation after EGFR inhibitor treatment in sensitive lines. FGFR inhibition abrogates this rescue. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.2" class="evidence-link">[e107.2]</a> </li>
    <li>FGFR inhibitor alone in absence of EGFR inhibition does not suppress growth significantly, indicating FGFR-dependence only emerges following EGFR pathway loss. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.2" class="evidence-link">[e107.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the concept of paracrine rescue is known, the tightly integrated adaptive switch in RTK dependency on a rapid timescale in LUAD is a non-trivial new element.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Roles for paracrine FGFs and microenvironmental crosstalk in lung cancer have been reported; bypass resistance mechanisms via genetic change are known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Transformation of RTK dependence (from EGFR to induced FGFR2/3) through an epigenetically plastic, rapid switch and explicit functional repurposing of microenvironmental FGF is newly mechanistically delineated here.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: FGFR2/3-Driven Compensatory Growth Is Reversible and Chromatin-Dependent</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The transition to FGFR dependence after EGFR inhibition is rapidly reversible upon withdrawal of EGFR inhibition or restoration of EGFR signaling, consistent with a chromatin- or transcriptional state switch rather than fixed genetic change.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to EGFR-dependent NSCLC cell populations after transient pharmacologic inhibition; reversibility is observed in in vitro systems, and plausibly in vivo, subject to chromatin dynamics.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If EGFR inhibition is sustained but chromatin modifiers are manipulated (e.g., HDAC inhibition), adaptation may be prevented or reversed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>FGFR2/3 upregulation in response to EGFR inhibition is immediate and reversible, and analogous mechanisms involving chromatin state changes are supported by literature on drug-tolerant states. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.0" class="evidence-link">[e107.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.4" class="evidence-link">[e107.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Integrates established reversible epigenetic resistance with direct evidence in LUAD.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Chromatin-based reversible tolerance to targeted therapy is established in other settings.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicit application of reversible chromatin-mediated FGFR induction following EGFR inhibition in lung adenocarcinoma is newly supported here.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Short-term combined EGFR and FGFR blockade in LUAD models will inhibit compensatory survival and anchorage-independent growth even in the presence of FGF-secreting stromal cells.</li>
                <li>Rapid increase of open chromatin/histone acetylation at FGFR2/FGFR3 promoter loci will be seen in ATAC-seq or ChIP-seq after EGFR inhibition.</li>
                <li>Clinically, patient tumors showing relapse on first-line EGFR TKI therapy but lacking T790M/MET amplification will exhibit elevated FGFR2/3 mRNA and/or protein by RNA-seq/IHC relative to pre-treatment biopsy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In early-stage LUAD in vivo models, transient environmental or metabolic stresses (e.g., hypoxia, cytokine environment) may further modulate chromatin accessibility at FGFR loci, influencing population-level adaptability, variability, and therapy responses.</li>
                <li>Pharmacologic targeting of chromatin regulators (e.g., use of BET inhibitors or HDAC inhibitors) in conjunction with EGFR inhibitors will prevent induction of FGFR2/3 and extend therapeutic efficacy, but magnitude and durability in patients are unknown.</li>
                <li>In some tumors, microenvironmental suppression of FGF ligand (for example with FGF-neutralizing antibodies) may abrogate adaptive resistance after EGFR loss, but net benefit in vivo (given systemic roles of FGF) is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If combined EGFR and FGFR inhibition fails to block survival/growth rescue in RTK-driver-negative LUAD or if compensation still occurs via other RTKs, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If FGFR2/3 upregulation cannot be blocked by chromatin remodeling inhibitors, the chromatin-mediated model is challenged.</li>
                <li>If clinical biopsies of relapsed, driver-negative EGFR-inhibitor–treated tumors fail to show FGFR2/3 upregulation, this adaptive pathway is unlikely to be clinically relevant.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
