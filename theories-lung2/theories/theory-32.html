                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Antigen-processing Polymorphism Flip-Flop Hypothesis: Smoking Alters Directionality of Immune-genetic Risk</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why only some cigarette smokers develop lung cancer, despite smoking being a strong risk factor, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that genetic variants in the antigen-processing and presentation machinery—particularly ERAP1/2 and related pathways—have context-dependent effects on lung cancer risk: in never-smokers (with lower tumor mutational burden), such variants can be protective or increase risk depending on how they affect neoantigen processing and immune surveillance, but in smokers (with high tumor mutational burden and frequent immune escape via HLA LOH), the same variants may have the opposite effect. This direction 'flip' arises because heavy smoking dramatically alters the tumor's antigenic landscape, overwhelming the immune system, provoking immune-editing, and selecting for tumor clones that evade typical immune detection. Polymorphisms that enhance or restrict peptide trimming/presentation interact differently with this altered context, and thus their effect direction can invert depending on environmental exposure and resultant tumor biology.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Context-dependent Effect Inversion Law for ERAP/Antigen Presentation Variants</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> The influence of antigen-processing gene polymorphisms (notably ERAP1 and ERAP2, including specific haplotypes) on lung cancer risk reverses with smoking status: in never-smokers, variants that support effective neoantigen processing and optimal HLA class I presentation act protectively, whereas in smokers, the same or similar variants may become risk alleles or neutral as massive tumor mutational burden (from tobacco-induced DNA damage) and resultant immune evasion (e.g., HLA LOH) reshape antigenicity and enable immune escape.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Adults of any ancestry stratified by smoking status (never/rare vs current/heavy/former smoking), with a focus on populations where both smoking prevalence and germline variation in antigen-processing and HLA genes exist. Most robust where tumor mutational burden and HLA LOH data are available in both subgroups.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Light/former smokers or those with significant non-tobacco mutagenic exposure (e.g., heavy air pollution, coal smoke) may show intermediate or shifting effect modulations.</li>
                <li>Other non-ERAP antigen-processing or non-HLA variants may not exhibit such effect inversion.</li>
                <li>Aggressive tumor immune-escape (e.g., early HLA LOH or TCR suppression) could mask the impact of antigen-processing variation entirely.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Polish NSCLC study demonstrates ERAP1 SNPs (e.g., rs26653 CC) and ERAP1/2 haplotypes changing direction: risk allele in smokers, protective or neutral in never-smokers, with inversion among some haplotypes (e.g., rs26653G-rs26618C-rs2287987T-rs30187C-rs27044C-rs2248374G shows OR=3.71 in never-smokers vs OR=0.56 in smokers). <a href="../results/extraction-result-127.html#e127.0" class="evidence-link">[e127.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Relevant antigen presentation—immune escape interaction: HLA-I evolutionary divergence is protective (higher breadth enhances surveillance), especially when combined with high tumor mutational burden (as in smokers), but this also selects for HLA LOH (immune escape), more common in smokers than never-smokers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.6" class="evidence-link">[e132.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.3" class="evidence-link">[e132.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Genomic studies reveal that smokers' tumors display much higher mutational burden, selection for HLA LOH, and immune-escape mechanisms, indicating that classic immune-genetic 'risk' alleles may not operate in the same direction as in never-smoker/low-burden contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.3" class="evidence-link">[e132.3]</a> </li>
    <li>APM (antigen-presenting machinery) SNP associations—including ERAP1—show opposite, sometimes paradoxical, effects in never- vs ever-smokers (e.g., DNA repair SNPs protective in heavy smokers but increasing risk in never/light smokers), supporting that tobacco-induced genotoxicity can overwhelm or reverse genetic effect direction. <a href="../results/extraction-result-127.html#e127.0" class="evidence-link">[e127.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Broader immunogenetic studies indicate that the predictive value of immune-genetic variation (e.g., HLA/KIR divergence, ERAP1/2) is strongest when the tumor microenvironment is not dominated by immune-escape (e.g., no HLA LOH), supporting the idea that immune-editing context flips allele effects. <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.6" class="evidence-link">[e132.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.7" class="evidence-link">[e132.7]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Gene-environment interactions in cancer risk are acknowledged, but the direction-reversal ('flip-flop') driven by the interaction of a specific mutational process (cigarette-induced DNA damage) and immune-genetic context for ERAP/HLA is newly formalized here in this explicit, mechanistic context.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Associations between ERAP/HLA variants and cancer, and gene-environment interaction in cancer epidemiology, are established. Some reports note population- or exposure-specific differences.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit, mechanistically justified inversion ('flip-flop') of genetic risk effect direction for antigen-processing variants by smoking status and mutation burden is rarely formulated or formalized for cancer and is not established in the literature.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Never-smokers carrying 'protective' ERAP1/ERAP2 genotypes will exhibit lower lung cancer risk than those with risk genotypes, and this same genotype will show attenuated or reversed association among heavy smokers.</li>
                <li>Tumors from smokers with 'protective' antigen-processing genotypes will have higher prevalence of HLA LOH and other immune-escape features; this will be less frequent in never-smokers with the same genotypes.</li>
                <li>Immunotherapy responsiveness (e.g., neoantigen vaccine, checkpoint inhibitor) stratified by ERAP/HLA genotype will be more predictable in never-smokers than in heavy smokers due to context-dependent immune editing.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introduction of preventive immune modulation (e.g., ERAP1/2 gene therapy) will be effective only in never/light smokers and could increase risk or have no effect in heavy smokers.</li>
                <li>In environmental exposure contexts (e.g., coal smoke, high air pollution), similar context-dependent directionality flipping of immune-genetic risk alleles will be observed if the exposure also increases mutational burden.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal immune monitoring in smokers transitioning to ex-smoking will show a shift in ERAP/HLA genotype effect as mutational burden declines/plateaus.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Failure to replicate effect-direction inversion between smokers and never-smokers for ERAP/HLA genotypes in large, adequately powered, well-phenotyped cohorts.</li>
                <li>Finding no modulation in immune-escape (e.g., absence of HLA LOH) in smoker tumors regardless of antigen-processing genotype.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the ERAP/HLA genotype associations persist in the same risk direction regardless of mutational context or exposure history.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Effect of antigen-processing variants on lung cancer risk in subtypes driven by non-tobacco–related mutational signatures (e.g., ALK fusions, EGFR-driven tumors), where overall mutation burden may be lower or immune-escape mechanisms different. <a href="../results/extraction-result-133.html#e133.9" class="evidence-link">[e133.9]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-133.html#e133.7" class="evidence-link">[e133.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.4" class="evidence-link">[e132.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Other genetically mediated risk factors acting independently of immune surveillance, such as metabolic/detoxification variants (CYP, GST, etc.) and DNA repair loci, which may not show directionality flip by smoking status. <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.5" class="evidence-link">[e132.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-130.html#e130.4" class="evidence-link">[e130.4]</a> </li>
