                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Noncanonical oncogenic control circuits substitute for RTK/RAS/RAF in driver-negative LUAD</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Driver-negative LUADs frequently exploit alternative, non-RTK/RAS/RAF control circuits to achieve the same cancer hallmarks: sustained proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, and genomic/epigenomic plasticity. These circuits include (i) chromatin-remodeling and histone-modifying alterations (e.g., ARID1A loss; WHSC1L1 amplification), (ii) RNA-splicing dysregulation (RBM10 truncation; U2AF1 S34F), and (iii) mitotic/centromere and cell-cycle programs (TPX2 amplification; RB1 loss/CCND1 gain; HJURP overexpression). The unifying mechanism is that these alterations reprogram transcription and RNA processing to create growth autonomy, tolerance of replication stress, and adaptability—functionally substituting for upstream MAPK activation and enabling tumor maintenance even when canonical pathway drivers are absent.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Epigenetic regulator loss/gain reprograms transcription to enable oncogenesis without RTK/RAS/RAF activation</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Loss-of-function mutations in SWI/SNF components (e.g., ARID1A truncations) and focal amplifications of chromatin enzymes (e.g., WHSC1L1) are recurrent in LUAD and can act as alternative drivers by shifting chromatin accessibility/histone marks, thereby reprogramming transcriptional states toward proliferation/survival even without canonical RTK/RAS/RAF coding-driver activation.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD cohorts assessed by exome/genome sequencing and copy-number profiling where epigenetic regulators are evaluated for truncation enrichment or focal high-level amplification and where canonical driver negativity may be based on hotspot mutation/focal amplification criteria.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Chromatin alterations may cooperate with (rather than replace) canonical oncogenes; co-occurrence is possible and can blur attribution.</li>
                <li>Copy-number amplification targets require high-resolution mapping to exclude bystanders (e.g., FGFR1 excluded from the focal 8p MCR).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ARID1A truncating mutations were recurrent (~8%) and significantly enriched for loss-of-function patterns (CGC LOF InVEx p=0.027), consistent with tumor-suppressor selection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.5" class="evidence-link">[e54.5]</a> </li>
    <li>WHSC1L1 resides in a focal 8p12-p11.2 amplicon (MCR ~0.14 Mb) with copy-number–driven overexpression; siRNA knockdown reduced soft-agar colony formation in an amplified cell line but not in a non-amplified line, supporting functional dependency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.0" class="evidence-link">[e111.0]</a> </li>
    <li>FGFR1 was specifically tested and excluded as the target of this focal 8p amplicon via mapping, expression, sequencing, and siRNA with no colony phenotype, underscoring that the driver is the epigenetic gene (WHSC1L1) rather than an RTK in that region. <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.3" class="evidence-link">[e111.3]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Each alteration is known, but the theory organizes them as a coherent substitute-oncogene class explaining driver-negative LUAD biology.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Chromatin regulators as cancer drivers/tumor suppressors are widely recognized; SWI/SNF loss is established across cancers.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit substitution principle—chromatin-state reprogramming as a primary proliferative/survival driver module in LUADs lacking RTK/RAS/RAF drivers—ties disparate lesions (ARID1A loss and WHSC1L1 gain) into a single driver-negative mechanism.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Spliceosome disruption provides an alternative driver axis linked to clinical aggressiveness</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Recurrent spliceosome-factor alterations in LUAD (including U2AF1 p.S34F hotspot and truncating RBM10) constitute an alternative driver axis in which perturbed splice-site recognition and RNA processing generate oncogenic isoform programs and stress tolerance, and such alterations can associate with worse clinical outcomes even in the absence of canonical proliferative signaling drivers.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD cohorts with WES/WGS sufficient to detect recurrent hotspot and truncating mutations in splicing factors, and with survival/progression data for outcome association.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Some splice-factor mutations co-occur with canonical oncogenes (e.g., KRAS), so the splice alteration may be a modifier rather than sole driver in those tumors.</li>
                <li>Mechanistic targets (mis-spliced genes) can be context-specific and require transcriptome/splice-junction profiling for confirmation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>U2AF1 p.S34F was recurrent (~3% of 183), highly significant by InVEx (p=2.0×10^-6), and associated with reduced progression-free survival (log-rank p=0.00011). Several U2AF1-mutant tumors lacked known oncogene drivers, though one co-occurred with KRAS p.Q61H. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> </li>
    <li>RBM10 truncating mutations occurred in ~7% (12/183) with strong truncation enrichment (InVEx p=0.00042), consistent with selection for loss-of-function in an RNA-binding/splicing regulator; some co-occurred with KRAS/EGFR/PIK3CA, consistent with modifier/parallel driver roles. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.4" class="evidence-link">[e54.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The specific LUAD evidence is older but the integrative framing as a driver-negative substitute axis remains only partially established and still testable.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Splicing-factor mutations as drivers are established in hematologic malignancies and increasingly recognized in solid tumors.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The statement emphasizes spliceosome disruption as a distinct substitute driver axis in LUAD with documented progression impact (PFS association for U2AF1) relevant to driver-negative cases.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>RTK/RAS/RAF-negative LUADs enriched for chromatin/splicing alterations (ARID1A, RBM10, U2AF1) will display more transcriptome-wide isoform dysregulation and higher expression variance (cell-state plasticity) than RTK-driven tumors at similar purity/stage.</li>
                <li>WHSC1L1-amplified tumors will show consistent histone-mark/transcriptional footprints (e.g., enhancer activation at proliferation programs) across samples with the focal 8p MCR, whereas tumors with broader 8p gains will not show the same dependency.</li>
                <li>U2AF1 S34F–mutant LUAD will show reproducible junction usage changes in a subset of growth-control genes and a measurable signature that can classify tumors from RNA-seq.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Driver-negative LUADs with spliceosome-factor mutations will exhibit selective sensitivity to spliceosome modulators or synthetic lethal interactions with DNA-damage response inhibitors, distinct from RTK-driven tumors.</li>
                <li>WHSC1L1 amplification will confer dependency on specific methyltransferase catalytic activity that is druggable; pharmacologic inhibition will reverse a defined transcriptional program and suppress tumor growth in vivo.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If perturbing WHSC1L1 in multiple independent WHSC1L1-amplified LUAD models does not reduce clonogenic growth (controlling for off-target effects), WHSC1L1 may be a bystander or context-limited dependency.</li>
                <li>If U2AF1 S34F tumors do not show consistent splicing alterations relative to matched wild-type controls when controlling for confounders (cell composition, tumor purity), the causal splice-program component is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Clear RTK fusion drivers (RET/ROS1) and RTK splice/amplification drivers (MET ex14, MET amp) are not explained as substitutes; they represent canonical signaling activation rather than epigenetic/splicing substitution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.2" class="evidence-link">[e113.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.1" class="evidence-link">[e113.1]</a> </li>
