                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Subclonal Evolutionary Plasticity Theory of Driver-Negative LUAD Progression</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what drives lung adenocarcinomas without known RTK/RAS/RAF pathway driver alterations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that, in the absence of dominant clonal drivers (RTK/RAS/RAF), lung adenocarcinomas evolve via a process of ongoing subclonal evolutionary plasticity, fueled by regionally and temporally localized mutational and microenvironmental pressures (including endogenous mutagenesis, genome doubling/CIN, and immune selection). This leads to a state where no single oncogenic process is universally required, but rather, subclones with diverse, context-dependent growth or immune-escape mechanisms transiently dominate, resulting in high heterogeneity and rapid adaptation.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Evolutionary Branching and High Intratumor Heterogeneity in Driver-Negative Tumors</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Driver-negative LUADs are characterized by highly branched subclonal evolution, with regional subclones acquiring private driver mutations (e.g., PIK3CA, TGFBR1, chromatin modifiers), copy-number changes, or fusion events, often arising via chromosomal instability and mutational bursts subsequent to genome doubling or chromoanagenesis.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to human lung adenocarcinomas defined as lacking clonal RTK/RAS/RAF driver mutations/fusions, especially in advanced-stage disease or at sites of metastasis, and in both smokers and nonsmokers.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In early-stage tumors or low-burden cases, evolutionary diversification may be less pronounced, with some subclonal events not yet fixed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Multiregion sequencing reveals pronounced spatial and temporal diversity in driver architecture, with subclonal mutations and private CNAs/fusions (e.g., PIK3CA E542K, TGFBR1, EP300, SIK2/ROCK1 rearrangements, chromoanagenesis impacting FANCM/NF1). <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.0" class="evidence-link">[e112.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.2" class="evidence-link">[e112.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.3" class="evidence-link">[e112.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.4" class="evidence-link">[e112.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.5" class="evidence-link">[e112.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.5" class="evidence-link">[e36.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Wave of genome doubling and subsequent CIN precede and fuel subclonal diversification, producing regionalized driver events and rapid adaptation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.5" class="evidence-link">[e38.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-112.html#e112.1" class="evidence-link">[e112.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.2" class="evidence-link">[e45.2]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Multi-region sequencing has documented heterogeneity, but the explicit proposal that evolutionary plasticity itself (rather than any fixed molecular lesion) is the defining feature of driver-negative LUAD is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Branched evolution and intratumor heterogeneity are well documented in NSCLC and many cancers.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This theory postulates that in driver-negative cases, plasticity itself is not a byproduct but the fundamental mode of oncogenesis, in which the lack of a clonal trunk driver necessitates a continuously evolving adaptive landscape.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Microenvironmental and Immune Selection Pressures Dynamically Shape Subclonal Architecture</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> Microenvironmental cues (e.g., localized immune activation, fibroblast-derived growth factors, metabolic gradients) and immune selection (HLA LOH, promoter methylation of neoantigens, selection for B2M/NLRC5 disruption) act as dynamic, region-specific pressures that select for diverse immune-escape or growth-promoting strategies in subclonal populations.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Lung adenocarcinomas with substantial immune cell infiltration, variable stroma, and/or regions of hypoxia/nutrient variation, with a pronounced lack of canonical oncogenic drivers.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Some tumor regions may remain immunologically ‘cold’ or microenvironmentally inert, reducing selection pressure and resulting in persistence of ancestral clones.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Allele-specific HLA LOH, B2M mutation, and promoter hypermethylation of neoantigen-encoding genes are enriched in subclones with high APOBEC-driven mutational and neoantigen burden, and these events often emerge in parallel in different regions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-108.html#e108.0" class="evidence-link">[e108.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-108.html#e108.1" class="evidence-link">[e108.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-108.html#e108.3" class="evidence-link">[e108.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.7" class="evidence-link">[e38.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-108.html#e108.5" class="evidence-link">[e108.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-108.html#e108.4" class="evidence-link">[e108.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Microenvironmental rescue of growth during targeted therapy via paracrine FGFs, cGAMP gap-junction transfer with astrocytes, and metabolic reprogramming via cancer-derived succinate are only regionally required and act through different subclones. <a href="../results/extraction-result-107.html#e107.2" class="evidence-link">[e107.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.7" class="evidence-link">[e45.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.4" class="evidence-link">[e45.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Immune-escape and microenvironmental contributions are individually studied, but their central, dynamic role as the 'driver' of high plasticity in classical driver-negative lung cancer is not established.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Immune and microenvironmental influences on cancer evolution are increasingly appreciated, and experiments have shown immune-escape mechanisms can arise.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit statement that these selection pressures continually shape and re-shape subclonal populations in driver-negative LUAD, rather than simply selecting for resistant clones, is a new concept.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Driver-negative tumors will show pronounced heterogeneity in regional mutation, CNA, and fusion landscapes, with little overlap in regional driver events, as compared to driver-positive tumors.</li>
                <li>Immune escape events (HLA LOH, B2M, neoantigen methylation) will arise as late, region-specific, and sometimes parallel (convergent) events in driver-negative LUAD.</li>
                <li>Regions of tumor with distinct microenvironmental features (e.g., fibrosis, astrocyte proximity, or hypoxia) will harbor private subclones with adaptive transcriptomic or genetic alterations (e.g., FGFR induction, gap-junction/cGAMP signaling, or metabolic reprogramming signatures).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Therapies targeting single subclonal events (e.g., regionally private fusions or mutations) will generate only partial responses, whereas combination therapies (e.g., immune checkpoint plus epigenetic modifier) may limit subclonal adaptation and induce more durable remissions.</li>
                <li>Dynamic single-cell and spatial sequencing in driver-negative LUADs will reveal ongoing, therapy-induced emergence of new subclonal drivers in response to shifting selection pressures.</li>
                <li>Longitudinal monitoring with cell-free DNA or multi-region biopsy will show continued emergence of new private subclonal drivers after initial therapy, but rarely emergence of classical RTK/RAS/RAF drivers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If driver-negative tumors do not display more regional diversity in mutation/fusion/CNA profiles than driver-positive tumors, the central postulate is challenged.</li>
                <li>Failure to observe late-arising immune-escape events, or finding that immune escape is strictly truncal rather than subclonal and regionally restricted, would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>If in-depth spatial analysis reveals that microenvironmental adaptation (paracrine signaling, metabolic shifts) is uniform rather than regionally or temporally variable, the dynamic selection model is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some driver-negative LUADs may display minimal heterogeneity and limited apparent evolutionary branching despite lacking clonal drivers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.5" class="evidence-link">[e38.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-38.html#e38.6" class="evidence-link">[e38.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-43.html#e43.10" class="evidence-link">[e43.10]</a> </li>
