                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A substantial subset of RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative LUAD are driven not by upstream kinase activation but by dysregulation of gene-expression control layers: chromatin remodeling (SWI/SNF), histone modification, and RNA splicing/processing. These alterations create oncogenic cell states (proliferation, stress tolerance, altered differentiation) that can substitute for MAPK addiction and can also increase evolvability by reshaping transcriptional/splicing programs. This theory unifies recurrent loss-of-function mutations in epigenetic/splicing factors and focal amplification of chromatin modifiers as mechanistically convergent 'state-setting drivers'.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Loss-of-function in chromatin remodelers/splicing factors can be sufficient driver logic in oncogene-negative LUAD</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinoma lacking canonical RTK/RAS/RAF driver oncogenes, recurrent loss-of-function alterations in chromatin remodeling and RNA splicing/processing genes (e.g., ARID1A, RBM10, U2AF1) are positively selected and can act as primary or enabling drivers by reprogramming transcription/splicing networks toward oncogenic phenotypes, independent of direct RTK/MAPK activation.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD cases that are negative for canonical proliferative oncogenes by hotspot+fusion testing, as well as broader LUAD cohorts where these alterations occur with or without canonical oncogenes (as co-drivers/enablers). Applies to coding LOF events (nonsense/frameshift/splice-site) and recurrent splicing-factor hotspots.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Some splicing/chromatin alterations co-occur with canonical oncogenes (e.g., RBM10 with KRAS/EGFR/PIK3CA; U2AF1 with KRAS), implying co-driver/enabler roles rather than strict substitution.</li>
                <li>Functional consequences depend on tissue context and the specific downstream targets mis-spliced or misregulated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>ARID1A truncating mutations occurred in ~8% of LUAD (183-cohort) with enrichment consistent with tumor-suppressor selection (LOF InVEx p=0.027), implicating SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling loss. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.5" class="evidence-link">[e54.5]</a> </li>
    <li>RBM10 had recurrent truncating mutations (~7%, 12/183) with strong enrichment (InVEx p=0.00042), nominating RNA-binding/splicing dysregulation as a selected hallmark; RBM10 mutations co-occurred with KRAS, EGFR, and PIK3CA in some tumors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.4" class="evidence-link">[e54.4]</a> </li>
    <li>U2AF1 p.S34F hotspot occurred in ~3% (5/183) with strong statistical significance (InVEx p=2.0×10^-6) and was associated with reduced progression-free survival, supporting an oncogenic splicing-factor driver role; co-occurrence with KRAS p.Q61H observed in one case and statistical co-occurrence with NF1 reported (p=0.0011). <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.3" class="evidence-link">[e54.3]</a> </li>
    <li>WHSC1L1, a SET-domain histone methyltransferase family member, is the likely target of a focal 8p12-p11.2 amplification; copy-number-driven overexpression and siRNA knockdown reduced soft-agar colony formation in an amplified line, supporting epigenetic regulator amplification as a driver mechanism. <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.0" class="evidence-link">[e111.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Mechanisms are known, but positioning them as a coherent alternative driver axis for oncogene-negative LUAD is a synthesis grounded in recurrent LOF/hotspot evidence in LUAD.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Epigenetic and splicing alterations as cancer mechanisms are widely recognized; individual genes (ARID1A, U2AF1) are known cancer genes in other contexts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The novelty is the explicit claim that these alterations form a parallel driver axis particularly explanatory for RTK/RAS/RAF-negative LUAD, with a 'state-setting driver' role rather than merely passenger or secondary alterations.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Epigenetic state can modulate mutagenesis and thereby create driver opportunity in driver-negative tumors</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In LUAD, specific DNA methylation states at CpG loci are statistically associated with somatic mutation burden and mutation spectra (notably C→T and smoking-associated C→A), implying that epigenetic configuration can increase the rate and locality of mutation acquisition (via 5mC deamination/adduct formation and/or impaired repair), thereby increasing the probability that RTK/RAS/RAF-negative tumors acquire noncanonical driver events over time.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUAD tumors with paired methylation-array and exome sequencing data; associations apply at cohort level and are most interpretable after adjusting for smoking, age, sex, stage, tumor purity/CN effects. Mechanistic interpretation pertains to CpG methylation-associated mutagenesis and repair capacity (TDG/MBD4).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Associations are observational; causality can be bidirectional (mutations can alter methylation).</li>
                <li>Effects may be stronger in open-sea/intergenic regions (enriched for positive associations) and weaker in promoters/CpG islands (depleted for most mutation types).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Integrated EAGLE methylation+WES analysis (93 samples; meta-analysis with TCGA totaling n=486) identified >1,000 CpG probes significantly associated with TNSM and mutation fractions (Bonferroni p<1.5×10^-7), supporting methylation–mutagenesis coupling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Mechanistic plausibility noted: hypermethylated CpGs are prone to spontaneous 5mC→T deamination and enhanced carcinogen-adduct formation (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene), enriching for C→T and C→A mutations at these loci. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Repair linkage: in TCGA, TDG expression negatively correlated with C→T mutation frequency (r=-0.26, p≈1e-7), supporting a model where reduced repair capacity exacerbates methylation-associated mutagenesis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.3" class="evidence-link">[e53.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Mechanism is known broadly, but the LUAD-specific, genome-wide association framing as a driver-negative evolvability explanation is a synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> 5-methylcytosine deamination and repair-mediated modulation of C→T mutations are established concepts; methylation can correlate with mutation distribution.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The novel element is elevating methylation state as an evolvability mechanism specifically relevant to explaining how some driver-negative LUAD may generate noncanonical drivers, grounded in large-scale CpG–mutation statistical coupling in LUAD cohorts.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>RTK/RAS/RAF-driver–negative LUAD will be enriched for truncating/splice-factor alterations (ARID1A/RBM10/U2AF1-class) relative to RTK-driven tumors, after controlling for TMB and smoking status.</li>
                <li>U2AF1 S34F and RBM10 LOF tumors will show reproducible aberrant splicing signatures (junction usage changes) in RNA-seq, including mis-splicing of cell-cycle and DNA-damage response genes.</li>
                <li>WHSC1L1-amplified tumors will exhibit a consistent epigenetic/transcriptional program (e.g., histone methylation-linked expression shifts) distinguishable from RTK-driven LUAD.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Epigenetic therapies (e.g., chromatin-modifying inhibitors) will show selective efficacy in WHSC1L1-amplified or ARID1A-mutant LUAD subsets even without RTK/MAPK drivers.</li>
                <li>Correcting specific splicing aberrations (via splice-switching oligos or spliceosome-modulating drugs) will be synthetically lethal in U2AF1 S34F LUAD that lack canonical RTK/RAS/RAF drivers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If driver-negative LUAD (stringently defined) does not show higher prevalence of chromatin/splicing driver alterations than driver-positive LUAD once detection is equalized, the 'parallel driver axis' claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If U2AF1 S34F LUAD lack consistent splicing changes compared to matched controls, the mechanistic driver interpretation would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Direct, clinically validated kinase drivers in some initially driver-negative contexts (e.g., fusions, MET ex14) are not explained by epigenetic/splicing mechanisms, though they can co-exist across the broader LUAD population. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.1" class="evidence-link">[e113.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-113.html#e113.2" class="evidence-link">[e113.2]</a> </li>
