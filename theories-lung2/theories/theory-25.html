                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hidden-driver architecture: noncoding/SV/CNA and process-level oncogenesis in RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative LUAD</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what molecular alterations and mechanisms drive RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") lung adenocarcinomas, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Many LUADs labeled RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative ("driver-negative") by exome-centric or hotspot-focused testing are not truly driverless; instead, they are driven by (i) structural and regulatory alterations that activate RTKs or kinases without canonical coding hotspots (e.g., fusions, in-frame exon deletions/duplications, enhancer hijacking/super-enhancers), (ii) pathway-level copy-number programs that activate PI3K and cell-cycle axes, and (iii) late-arising endogenous mutational processes (APOBEC, methylation-associated C→T) that generate subclonal functional drivers during progression. This theory predicts that expanding detection to WGS+RNA-seq+CNA+regulatory epigenomics will markedly shrink the apparent driver-negative fraction and reveal convergent pathway outputs (RTK, PI3K, cell cycle, immune escape) achieved by diverse alteration classes.</p>

            <h3>Statement 0: Assay-expansion law for driver-negative LUAD</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In lung adenocarcinoma classified as RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative by coding-hotspot mutation panels or WES-only analyses, the probability of identifying an oncogenic driver increases substantially when adding (a) RNA-seq fusion detection and (b) WGS-grade structural-variant discovery and (c) high-resolution copy-number profiling; these additional modalities reveal driver classes (fusions, in-frame exon deletions/duplications, enhancer/super-enhancer activation, focal amplifications) that are systematically under-detected by exome-only approaches.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Primary and metastatic LUAD where the initial 'driver-negative' call is based on limited driver catalogs (hotspots) and/or exome-centric assays; applies to clinical and research settings comparing WES/panel testing versus WGS+RNA-seq+CNA/regulatory assays.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If a cohort already includes comprehensive WGS+RNA-seq and deep CNA/SV calling, the incremental yield of additional assays is smaller.</li>
                <li>Some detected fusions/SVs may be passengers; oncogenicity depends on reading frame, domain retention, and expression.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>A large fraction of LUAD lacked known proliferative signaling drivers by hotspot/amplification criteria (only 47% had a known proliferative signaling driver by hotspot mutation; 55% when including high-level amplifications), motivating search for SVs and other mechanisms. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
    <li>RNA-seq in EAGLE detected gene fusions in 24/80 tumors (30%) and experimentally validated 10/11 tested fusions, showing that fusions are common and can be missed without transcriptome assays. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.5" class="evidence-link">[e53.5]</a> </li>
    <li>WGS identified a novel in-frame EGFR C-terminal deletion (Δex25-26) with oncogenic behavior and erlotinib sensitivity in vitro; such rearrangements require SV-aware discovery rather than standard hotspot-only mutation testing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> </li>
    <li>WGS identified in-frame kinase/effector duplications (SIK2 duplication validated by qPCR; ROCK1 19-exon duplication) in tumors described as lacking canonical oncogene mutations, indicating SV drivers beyond point mutations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.1" class="evidence-link">[e54.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.2" class="evidence-link">[e54.2]</a> </li>
    <li>A transforming KIF5B-RET fusion was discovered by WGS+RNA-seq in an index tumor clinically negative for EGFR/KRAS/EML4-ALK, and recurred in additional clinically driver-negative primaries. <a href="../results/extraction-result-102.html#e102.0" class="evidence-link">[e102.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ERBB2 overexpression via super-enhancer formation with genomic structural abnormalities is cited as occurring in LUAD without clinically actionable genetic alterations, exemplifying regulatory/SV activation not captured by exonic hotspot catalogs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.1" class="evidence-link">[e51.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Arm-level CNAs and HLA LOH are described as increasingly frequent during LUAD development, consistent with a landscape where large-scale genomic events contribute to progression/fitness beyond canonical point drivers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.2" class="evidence-link">[e51.2]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The components (fusions, SVs, CNAs) are known; the novelty is the unified, explicitly predictive assay-expansion law tied to the driver-negative label and incorporating regulatory activation mechanisms as co-equal to classic fusions.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is well established that WGS and RNA-seq can uncover gene fusions and structural variants missed by WES, and that broad profiling reduces the 'unknown driver' category in LUAD.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly frames 'driver-negative' LUAD as a measurement/assay-class artifact with predictable shrinkage under multi-modal profiling, integrating regulatory super-enhancers, in-frame exon SVs, and pathway-level CN programs as major hidden driver reservoirs.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Convergent pathway-output law in driver-negative LUAD</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> In RTK/RAS/RAF-pathway–negative LUAD, diverse noncanonical alteration classes (copy-number programs, chromatin/splicing dysregulation, endogenous mutagenesis, immune-evasion allelic loss) converge on a limited set of selectable pathway outputs—enhanced survival (anti-apoptosis/PI3K), accelerated cell-cycle progression (CCND1/CDKN2A/RB1 and mitotic modules), invasive capacity (Rho/ROCK/cytoskeleton), and immune escape (HLA LOH)—thereby achieving malignant fitness without canonical MAPK-activating point mutations.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> LUADs lacking canonical RTK/RAS/RAF coding alterations by standard assays; includes both early-stage primaries and progressed/metastatic disease where noncanonical mechanisms may dominate.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Some tumors will still show cryptic RTK/MAPK activation through undetected mechanisms (e.g., rare kinase fusions), which would move them out of true pathway-negative status once discovered.</li>
                <li>Convergence does not imply equal therapeutic tractability; some outputs are harder to target directly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Coordinated copy-number correlations among EMSY, CCND1 and PIK3CA and strong anticorrelation between CCND1 and CDKN2A in EGFR/ALK-negative LUAD suggest a coupled PI3K + G1/S cell-cycle driver module. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.4" class="evidence-link">[e52.4]</a> </li>
    <li>PTEN shows significant copy-number reduction with concordant mRNA reduction and strong copy number–expression correlation, implying PI3K pathway activation by tumor-suppressor loss in EGFR/ALK-negative LUAD. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> </li>
    <li>RB1 shows significant copy-number reduction and reduced mRNA in EGFR/ALK-negative LUAD, consistent with G1/S checkpoint bypass as a non-RTK driver route. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.1" class="evidence-link">[e52.1]</a> </li>
    <li>TPX2 and BCL2L1 reside in a focal 20q11.2 amplicon with copy-number-driven overexpression (TPX2 stronger), nominating mitotic spindle/Aurora A module and anti-apoptosis as selectable outputs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.1" class="evidence-link">[e111.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-111.html#e111.2" class="evidence-link">[e111.2]</a> </li>
    <li>ROCK1 multi-exon duplication and ASEF mutations implicate cytoskeletal/migration programs as alternative selective routes in tumors lacking canonical oncogene mutations (ROCK1) or in a driver-negative-enriched cohort (ASEF discovery in EAGLE). <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.2" class="evidence-link">[e54.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.2" class="evidence-link">[e53.2]</a> </li>
    <li>HLA LOH is cited as a recurrent LUAD event contributing to immune evasion; together with arm-level CNAs it supports noncoding/non-point-mechanism contributions to fitness. <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.2" class="evidence-link">[e51.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Self-Evaluation of Law Novelty (produced by the generation model)</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The pathways are established; novelty is the integrative mapping of driver-negative LUAD to a constrained set of pathway outputs spanning survival, cell-cycle, invasion, and immune escape using the specific evidence set provided.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Pathway convergence (e.g., PI3K activation via PTEN loss or PIK3CA gain; cell-cycle activation via CCND1/CDKN2A/RB1) is well known in oncology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit claim that RTK/RAS/RAF-negative LUAD is best explained as convergence on these outputs via noncanonical alteration classes (including mutation processes and immune allelic loss), rather than absence of drivers, with concrete expected outputs.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In LUAD cases called RTK/RAS/RAF-negative by WES/panels, adding RNA-seq will identify a nontrivial fraction with actionable fusions or aberrant kinase transcripts; the yield will be highest in never/light smokers and younger patients (fusion-enriched clinical phenotype).</li>
                <li>WGS-grade SV calling in exome-negative LUAD will enrich for in-frame multi-exon deletions/duplications affecting kinases or cytoskeletal regulators (e.g., EGFR tail deletions, ROCK1-like duplications).</li>
                <li>CNA-driven 'cell-cycle + PI3K' module tumors (CCND1/PIK3CA/PTEN/RB1) will show transcriptional signatures of E2F targets and PI3K/AKT activation even in the absence of RTK/MAPK coding drivers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Regulatory activation events (super-enhancers/enhancer hijacking) of ERBB2 or other RTKs will be disproportionately represented among the residual cases negative by WGS coding/SV/fusion calls, and will predict sensitivity to RTK-targeted therapy despite no coding driver.</li>
                <li>Driver-negative LUADs with arm-level CNA burden and HLA LOH will show lower neoantigen presentation and reduced response to immune checkpoint blockade relative to similarly high-TMB tumors without HLA LOH.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If comprehensive profiling (WGS + RNA-seq + deep CNA + regulatory epigenomics) of a large RTK/RAS/RAF-negative LUAD cohort fails to reduce the driver-negative fraction or fails to reveal recurrent noncanonical driver classes, then the assay-expansion law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If tumors with the CCND1/PIK3CA/PTEN/RB1 CNA module do not show measurable PI3K and cell-cycle pathway activation by phosphoproteomics/transcriptomics, the convergence-on-output claim is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not directly explain the specific recurrent coding mutations in transcription factors (e.g., POU4F2, ZKSCAN1) and their mutual exclusivity with RTK/RAS/RAF genes beyond treating them as additional noncanonical routes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.1" class="evidence-link">[e53.1]</a> </li>
