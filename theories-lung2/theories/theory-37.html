                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sequential Gate-and-Key Organotropism (EV zip-codes → organ gating → niche execution) — revised</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of preferential metastatic organotropism (non-random metastatic spread to specific organs) across cancers (e.g., prostate/breast to bone, lung to brain/adrenals), based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Preferential metastatic organotropism is generated by an ordered set of partially separable constraints (“gates”). Gate 1 is organ-selective delivery/uptake of long-range conditioning signals (often EVs) by specific organ-resident recipient cells, determined by EV surface features (e.g., integrin ‘zip codes’), vascular access, and organ microanatomy. Gate 2 is execution of organ-specific pre-metastatic niche (PMN) programs by those recipient cells, which can be decomposed into modules: immune recruitment/immunosuppression, ECM/fibrosis and mechanics remodeling, vascular barrier weakening, and metabolic resource priming. Gate 3 is CTC arrest/extravasation/colonization, which is amplified by Gate-2 conditioning and can be enhanced or partially substituted by tumor–myeloid fusion that grants leukocyte-like trafficking and immune evasion. This framework explains (i) why a primary can show multi-organ spread (multiple Gate-1/2 programs), (ii) why interventions can shift organ distribution rather than total burden (gate compensation), and (iii) why route of delivery (systemic vs barrier-bypassing) can invert local niche outputs (recipient identity changes the executed module).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements/Laws</h3>
            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Gate 1: Recipient-cell-specific EV uptake is a primary organ filter</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If circulating tumor- or host-derived EVs display molecular determinants that preferentially dock to and are internalized by a particular organ’s accessible recipient cell types (parenchymal, endothelial, or resident immune/stromal cells), then early organ conditioning will occur predominantly in that organ and bias subsequent metastatic seeding toward it; conversely, if EV uptake is prevented in those recipients, downstream PMN readouts and organ-specific metastasis promotion will be reduced even if tumor cells retain intrinsic metastatic capability.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Hematogenous dissemination settings where EVs circulate systemically and interact with distal organs before/independent of overt tumor cell arrival; supported here for lung (AEC II), liver (Kupffer cells/LSECs/stellate axis), brain (brain microvascular endothelium), and peritoneum (mesothelial cells). Does not assert EVs are the only determinant of organotropism; anatomical drainage and direct implantation routes may dominate in specific contexts.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Route-of-access changes the identity of first recipient cells and can invert downstream niche effects (e.g., systemic exposure engages BBB endothelium; intraventricular delivery bypasses BBB and engages parenchymal immune cells directly).</li>
                <li>Some apparent organotropism in experimental metastasis is inflated by first-pass filtration or portal drainage; Gate 1 predictions should be tested in spontaneous/orthotopic settings where feasible.</li>
                <li>Host-derived EVs can constitute the Gate-1 signal source (not only tumor-derived EVs).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Breast tumor-derived exosomes in vivo preferentially co-localize with SP-C+ alveolar epithelial type II cells (AEC II) and AEC II respond with niche cytokine induction; other lung cell types tested (fibroblasts/endothelium) were less responsive for CCL2 induction. <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.2" class="evidence-link">[e219.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.0" class="evidence-link">[e219.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PDAC exosomes preferentially accumulate in liver; labeled PDAC exosomes are taken up predominantly by Kupffer cells (>80% of exosome+ liver cells are F4/80+), whereas normal pancreas exosomes do not show the same pattern; this uptake precedes fibronectin deposition and myeloid recruitment. <a href="../results/extraction-result-217.html#e217.0" class="evidence-link">[e217.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Systemic (retro-orbital) lung-cancer exosomes localize around CD31+ cerebral vessels and are taken up by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), positioning BMECs as primary recipients of systemic exosomes in brain conditioning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.1" class="evidence-link">[e157.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.0" class="evidence-link">[e157.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Exosomal integrin profiles are linked to organ-specific EV uptake/conditioning (lung: β6β4/β6β1; liver: αvβ5; brain: β3 or αvβ3 cited), providing a plausible molecular ‘zip-code’ layer for selective EV delivery to organ recipients. <a href="../results/extraction-result-158.html#e158.5" class="evidence-link">[e158.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.0" class="evidence-link">[e163.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-160.html#e160.4" class="evidence-link">[e160.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.0" class="evidence-link">[e165.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.0" class="evidence-link">[e162.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Breast cancer EVs show liver tropism and condition liver sinusoidal endothelial cells in microfluidic/tissue-slice systems; EV liver targeting is attributed in part to CXCL12 gradients in a liver–kidney chip context. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.2" class="evidence-link">[e164.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Melanoma-derived exosomes injected intravenously preferentially accumulate in organs that are common melanoma metastatic sites (lung, spleen, bone marrow, liver), consistent with organ-selective EV biodistribution as an early filter. <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.1" class="evidence-link">[e165.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Gastric cancer EV cargos (e.g., miR-21-5p, miR-106a, SNHG12, EV-MMP2) are delivered to peritoneal mesothelial cells (a surface ‘recipient’), driving mesothelial remodeling that enables implantation—an EV recipient specificity analog for non-hematogenous spread. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.4" class="evidence-link">[e159.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.7" class="evidence-link">[e159.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.5" class="evidence-link">[e159.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.6" class="evidence-link">[e159.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Host-derived EVs can target and activate organ-resident stromal cells: bone-marrow-derived EV miR-92a activates hepatic stellate cells and increases liver ECM deposition to promote lung-cancer liver metastasis (host EVs as Gate-1 signals). <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.4" class="evidence-link">[e162.4]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> It recombines known EV organotropism findings into an ordered-gate causal dependency claim, adding intervention-focused and cross-route generalization not typically stated as a single law.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Organ-selective EV biodistribution, integrin ‘zip codes’, and recipient-cell reprogramming in PMN formation are established concepts in metastasis biology.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes recipient-cell-selective EV uptake as an explicitly separable first ‘gate’ with predictive intervention logic (blocking uptake in the dominant recipient cell should collapse downstream PMN modules even if later extravasation machinery remains intact), and explicitly extends the gate concept to host-derived EVs and surface-metastasis (peritoneum) as recipient-specific conditioning.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Gate 2: Recipient cells execute a small set of reusable PMN modules that determine permissiveness</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If Gate-1 delivery/uptake occurs, then organ-resident recipients will execute one or more reusable PMN modules—(M1) immune recruitment/immunosuppression, (M2) ECM/fibrosis and mechanics remodeling, (M3) vascular barrier weakening/perivascular remodeling, and (M4) metabolic resource priming—and the specific module combination enacted in that organ predicts which step of metastasis is preferentially facilitated there (e.g., immune escape vs extravasation vs outgrowth).</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Cancers where PMN-like preconditioning is observed in distal organs prior to overt colonization, across lung, liver, brain, bone, and peritoneal surfaces. Does not require all modules in all organs; allows tumor- vs host-derived EV triggers and non-EV triggers (cytokines, inflammation, mechanical cues).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Module outputs can be recipient- and route-dependent (same EVs can elicit different immune outcomes depending on whether they contact endothelium vs parenchyma/immune cells).</li>
                <li>Some modules can be dispensable or redundant in specific models (e.g., certain cytokines elevated but not required).</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Lung (M1): Breast cancer exosomal miR-200b-3p taken up by AEC II induces CCL2 and niche-associated cytokines, recruiting CCR2+ myeloid cells/MDSCs; CCL2 knockout reduces lung MDSCs and lung metastasis, while lung-specific CCL2 overexpression increases lung metastasis and MDSCs; exosome education increases lung metastasis in WT but not in CCL2-/- mice. <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.2" class="evidence-link">[e219.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.1" class="evidence-link">[e219.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.3" class="evidence-link">[e219.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.0" class="evidence-link">[e219.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.4" class="evidence-link">[e219.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Lung (M1/M3): Tumor exosomal RNAs can activate alveolar epithelial TLR3 to induce chemokines and recruit neutrophils (lung PMN inflammatory module). <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.7" class="evidence-link">[e163.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-160.html#e160.1" class="evidence-link">[e160.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Lung (M3): Gastric cancer EVs disrupt pulmonary endothelial integrity via a dynamin-dependent pathway, increasing vascular leakage and transendothelial migration to promote lung metastasis; breast exosomal miR-105 similarly targets endothelial ZO-1 to increase permeability (lung/brain microvascular endothelia). <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.3" class="evidence-link">[e159.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.5" class="evidence-link">[e163.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Lung (M2): Breast cancer-derived EVs can reprogram lung fibroblasts/ECM and measurably alter lung tissue mechanics (stiffness/elasticity), consistent with a mechanics/ECM PMN module. <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.6" class="evidence-link">[e162.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Liver (M2/M1): PDAC exosomal MIF → Kupffer cell TGFβ → hepatic stellate activation → fibronectin deposition → recruitment of bone-marrow-derived macrophages; fibronectin conditional knockout, TGFβ receptor inhibition, or CD11b+ cell depletion abrogates the pro-metastatic effect and reduces early tumor cell retention and later liver metastasis burden. <a href="../results/extraction-result-217.html#e217.0" class="evidence-link">[e217.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.2" class="evidence-link">[e165.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-160.html#e160.0" class="evidence-link">[e160.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Liver (M2/M3): Breast cancer-derived EVs in human liver-chip models activate liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition), upregulate fibronectin via EV-carried TGFβ1, and create a more adhesive/colonization-permissive niche; liver-specific chemokine gradients (CXCL12) contribute to EV/cell tropism in tissue-slice chip models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.2" class="evidence-link">[e164.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Liver (M2 via host EVs): Bone-marrow-derived EV miR-92a activates hepatic stellate cells and increases ECM deposition, promoting a hepatic PMN supporting lung-cancer liver metastasis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.4" class="evidence-link">[e162.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Brain (M1/M3): Lung-cancer exosomes induce BMEC secretion of Dkk-1 after systemic exposure; endothelial Dkk-1 suppresses microglial activation and shifts microglia toward an M2-like phenotype; Dkk-1 siRNA in BMECs prevents the microglial shift; microglial AMPK phosphorylation is associated with this conversion (Wnt/β-catenin negligible). <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.0" class="evidence-link">[e157.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.1" class="evidence-link">[e157.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.2" class="evidence-link">[e157.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Brain (M3/M1): Tumor EVs and factors disrupt BBB integrity and reprogram astrocytes/microglia: breast EV miR-105 downregulates ZO-1; EV miR-181c alters actin dynamics via PDPK1/cofilin; astrocyte-conditioned media promotes tumor migration via MMPs and MMP inhibition reverses this; exosomal CEMIP induces pro-inflammatory vascular niche signals (Ptgs2/TNF/CCL/CXCL). <a href="../results/extraction-result-160.html#e160.2" class="evidence-link">[e160.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.4" class="evidence-link">[e165.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.4" class="evidence-link">[e164.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.3" class="evidence-link">[e163.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-162.html#e162.3" class="evidence-link">[e162.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Bone (M2/M1): Tumor-primed CD4+ T cells deliver RANKL to bone marrow, inducing osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption before tumor cell arrival; shRNA knockdown of RANKL in T cells prevents osteolysis and bone metastasis; systemic OPG/RANKL ratio decreases 10–20 fold in metastatic 4T1 mice vs non-metastatic 67NR. <a href="../results/extraction-result-218.html#e218.0" class="evidence-link">[e218.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-218.html#e218.2" class="evidence-link">[e218.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Bone (extravasation-supporting chemokine module): In a microfluidic bone-perivascular model, host-derived CXCL5 increases breast cancer extravasation (37.6±7.3%→78.3±9.7%), and tumor CXCR2 blockade reduces extravasation (77.5±3.7%→45.8±5.4%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.1" class="evidence-link">[e164.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Peritoneum (surface barrier module): Gastric cancer EV cargos (EV-MMP2; miR-21-5p; miR-106a; lncRNA SNHG12) induce mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition via ERK or TGFβ/Smad-axis mechanisms (e.g., Smad7 targeting), destroying the mesothelial barrier and enabling peritoneal implantation/metastasis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.6" class="evidence-link">[e159.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.4" class="evidence-link">[e159.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.7" class="evidence-link">[e159.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.5" class="evidence-link">[e159.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Non-essential module component example (boundary): IL-17F is elevated in metastatic 4T1-bearing mice but neutralization/shRNA did not prevent osteoclastogenesis or pre-metastatic bone loss, indicating not all elevated cytokines are necessary PMN drivers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-218.html#e218.1" class="evidence-link">[e218.1]</a> </li>

            <h3>Statement 2: Gate 3: Colonization probability scales with (PMN permissiveness × tumor trafficking capacity), with fusion as a trafficking substitute</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> For a given organ, metastatic colonization probability increases with the product of (A) local permissiveness created by Gate-2 PMN modules and (B) tumor-cell trafficking/extravasation competence; if tumor–myeloid fusion occurs, hybrids can increase (B) by acquiring leukocyte-like adhesion/chemotaxis and immune-evasive traits, thereby increasing colonization especially in organs where ICAM/VCAM, CXCL12, and CSF1 axes are active or where ‘first-filter’ hemodynamics provide high encounter rates.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Applies to experimental metastasis and (where validated) spontaneous metastasis contexts involving hematogenous dissemination; strongest support here is for lung and liver colonization in murine models and for clinical prognostic association of circulating hybrids. The quantitative ‘product’ form is a conceptual scaling relationship (mixed qualitative/quantitative) rather than a fully parameterized equation.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Experimental IV/intrasplenic models bypass intravasation and can overestimate the effect of trafficking traits; interpret scaling qualitatively unless validated in spontaneous models.</li>
                <li>Fusion hybrids can preferentially persist in lymphoid organs depending on acquired programs; organ bias is not necessarily limited to lung/liver.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>B16F10 melanoma–myeloid fusion hybrids produce larger/more extensive lung metastases than parental cells after IV injection, demonstrating that altered cell state can amplify lung colonization in a first-pass/first-filter organ. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.2" class="evidence-link">[e161.2]</a> </li>
    <li>MC38 colon cancer–macrophage fusion hybrids generate more liver metastatic foci after intrasplenic injection and show chemotaxis to CSF1 and SDF1 and upregulation of Itga4 (VLA-4), consistent with acquired leukocyte-like trafficking and adhesion advantages in liver seeding contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.1" class="evidence-link">[e161.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Clinical association: In PDAC patients, circulating CD45+/pan-CK+ hybrid cells are ~10-fold more abundant than classical CTCs and predict worse overall survival (HR 8.31; P=0.0029), consistent with enhanced dissemination fitness in circulation (though organ specificity not directly measured). <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.5" class="evidence-link">[e161.5]</a> </li>
    <li>General extravasation substrates: Rolling/adhesion/transmigration involve selectins, integrins (including β1/β2 families), and ICAM-1/VCAM-1, plus chemokines (e.g., CXCL12); thus, acquisition of leukocyte integrins/chemokine responsiveness (as in hybrids) provides a plausible mechanism to increase extravasation competence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.0" class="evidence-link">[e164.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.0" class="evidence-link">[e161.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PMN permissiveness increases seeding/retention: PDAC exosome education increases early tumor cell retention and later liver macrometastatic burden; fibronectin depletion or macrophage ablation reverses this. Breast exosome education increases lung metastasis in a CCL2-dependent manner. <a href="../results/extraction-result-217.html#e217.0" class="evidence-link">[e217.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.0" class="evidence-link">[e219.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> It is a new integrative dependency statement linking PMN modules and fusion-hybrid trafficking as multiplicative/compensatory factors rather than parallel anecdotes.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Metastasis is multi-step; PMN conditioning can facilitate later seeding; fusion hybrids can be metastatic and immune-evasive; adhesion cascade biology is known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law introduces an explicit compensatory/substitutive relationship: fusion-derived leukocyte traits can partially substitute for missing tumor-intrinsic trafficking adaptations, and predicts synergy between chemokine-rich PMNs (Gate 2) and hybrid chemotaxis/adhesion traits (Gate 3).</p>

                <li>Cell-type-specific blockade of EV uptake in the dominant Gate-1 recipient cell will collapse organ-specific PMN markers: e.g., selectively impairing AEC II uptake of breast tumor EVs (without globally reducing EV production) will reduce lung CCL2 induction and lung MDSC recruitment and decrease later lung metastatic burden (while leaving primary tumor growth largely unchanged).</li>
                <li>In liver PMN models driven by PDAC exosomal MIF, Kupffer-cell-specific inhibition of exosome uptake will phenocopy MIF knockdown: decreased KC TGFβ, reduced stellate activation/αSMA, reduced fibronectin deposition, reduced recruited F4/80+ BM-derived macrophages, and reduced early tumor cell retention in liver.</li>
                <li>Route switching will change brain niche outputs: systemic delivery of the same lung-cancer exosomes will favor BMEC Dkk-1 induction and microglial suppression, whereas intraventricular exposure will favor direct microglial activation; measured by opposite-direction changes in Iba1+ counts and M1/M2 marker ratios.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>‘Organotropism inversion’ under single-gate blockade: selectively blocking a dominant lung PMN module (e.g., CCL2–CCR2 axis) will not necessarily reduce total metastatic burden but will redistribute metastases toward alternative organs whose gates remain open (e.g., liver), producing a predictable shift in organ distribution rather than uniform reduction.</li>
                <li>A combined circulating-EV signature panel that includes (i) Gate-1 zip codes (integrin patterns) and (ii) Gate-2 module class (immune vs vascular vs fibrosis vs metabolic cargo) will predict not only the first metastatic organ but also the dominant lesion phenotype (e.g., BBB-disruptive vs perivascular-inflammatory brain lesions) better than tumor genomics alone.</li>
                <li>Fusion-hybrid enrichment will correlate with dependence on chemokine-rich PMNs: tumors with high circulating hybrid cell fractions will show stronger reduction in metastasis when CXCL12/CXCR4 or CSF1 pathways are blocked, compared with tumors with low hybrid fractions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Block organ-preferential EV uptake (e.g., by interfering with candidate EV surface determinants or recipient uptake pathways) and show no reduction in early PMN readouts in that organ (chemokines, fibronectin, immune recruitment). This would contradict Gate-1→Gate-2 ordering.</li>
                <li>Induce robust PMN modules (e.g., fibronectin deposition and myeloid recruitment) in an organ, then deliver viable tumor cells directly into that organ’s inflow circulation; if metastasis does not increase vs non-conditioned control, the claim that PMN permissiveness is a limiting factor for Gate 3 would be weakened.</li>
                <li>Engineer fusion hybrids that lack key leukocyte-like adhesion/chemotaxis traits (e.g., reduced integrin/chemokine receptor expression) and show they still enhance organ colonization equivalently; this would weaken the fusion-as-traffic-substitute premise.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Clinical association of exosomal integrin β3 levels with intracranial failure/survival in lung cancer patients with established brain metastases fits an EV–organ course association but is not cleanly placed as Gate-1 (risk) vs later (disease burden/treatment response) within this framework without additional mechanistic linkage. <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.9" class="evidence-link">[e163.9]</a> </li>
