                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reciprocal Organ Instruction (revised): organ-resident 'admission control' selects compatible disseminating phenotypes</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of preferential metastatic organotropism (non-random metastatic spread to specific organs) across cancers (e.g., prostate/breast to bone, lung to brain/adrenals), based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Preferential metastatic organotropism arises because target organs are not passive recipients. Prior to overt seeding, organ-resident parenchymal, endothelial, stromal, and resident immune cells can be reprogrammed by tumor- and host-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and systemic inflammatory factors into an 'admission control' state that: (i) emits chemotactic/retention fields; (ii) tunes physical barriers (tight junctions, cytoskeleton, mesothelial transition); (iii) deposits docking matrices and changes mechanics; and (iv) biases local immunity toward tolerance. This organ-side program selectively increases the entry probability and post-entry survival of tumor (or tumor–myeloid hybrid) phenotypes whose receptors/traits match the induced organ cues, thereby producing non-random patterns beyond circulation anatomy alone.</p>

            <hr/>
            <h3>Statement 0: Chemokine-field admission law (direct and indirect selection)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If an organ is primed to increase local chemokine/chemoattractant signals (e.g., CXCL5, CXCL12, CCL2), then (a) tumor cells expressing the cognate receptors (e.g., CXCR2, CXCR4) will show increased extravasation/colonization probability in that organ, and/or (b) recruited CCR2+ myeloid populations (via CCL2) will create an immunosuppressive, pro-retention environment that indirectly increases tumor seeding and outgrowth; blocking the relevant receptor–ligand axis reduces these organ-specific entry/retention effects.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Hematogenous dissemination settings where (i) chemokine gradients or chemokine-rich microenvironments are present in the target tissue, (ii) tumor or hybrid cells express corresponding chemokine receptors, and (iii) extravasation/early colonization can be measured (e.g., microfluidic extravasation devices, experimental metastasis assays, organ-specific overexpression/knockout). Applies most directly to bone and lung evidence here; also extends to liver/lymphoid homing when CXCL12/SDF1 and CSF1 cues are relevant.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Chemokine effects can be predominantly indirect (immune recruitment) rather than directly increasing tumor transendothelial migration.</li>
                <li>Endothelial permeability alone may not predict extravasation frequency; chemokine cues and stromal mechanics can dominate.</li>
                <li>Experimental metastasis (IV/intrasplenic) bypasses intravasation and early selection; chemokine-field effects may be over- or under-estimated relative to spontaneous metastasis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Bone microfluidic perivascular model: bone-derived CXCL5 increased MDA-MB-231 extravasation; adding CXCL5 increased extravasation from 37.6±7.3% to 78.3±9.7%; blocking tumor CXCR2 reduced extravasation from 77.5±3.7% to 45.8±5.4%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.1" class="evidence-link">[e164.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Lung: breast-tumor exosomes taken up by AEC II induce CCL2 and niche cytokines; exosome education increases lung MDSCs and metastasis in vivo. <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.2" class="evidence-link">[e219.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.0" class="evidence-link">[e219.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.3" class="evidence-link">[e219.3]</a> </li>
    <li>CCL2 causality and organ-locality: lung-specific CCL2 overexpression increased lung metastatic burden and lung MDSCs without affecting primary tumor growth; CCL2 knockout reduced lung metastasis and lung MDSC recruitment; exosome-education effects were lost in CCL2-/- mice. <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.1" class="evidence-link">[e219.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.0" class="evidence-link">[e219.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-219.html#e219.3" class="evidence-link">[e219.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Lung microfluidic model: CXCL12–CXCR4 axis is functionally implicated; CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 reduced colony area in a dose-dependent manner. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.3" class="evidence-link">[e164.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Fusion hybrids (MC38–macrophage) show chemotaxis to CSF1 and SDF1/CXCL12 and yield increased liver metastatic foci after intrasplenic injection; hybrids upregulate Itga4 (VLA-4 component), consistent with preferential response to organ chemoattractant/adhesion fields. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.1" class="evidence-link">[e161.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Tumor–myeloid hybrid framework: hybrids can acquire leukocyte trafficking/adhesion programs (e.g., β2 integrins, VLA-4) and chemotaxis responsiveness, implying stronger selection by organ chemokine/adhesion landscapes. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.0" class="evidence-link">[e161.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.2" class="evidence-link">[e161.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.3" class="evidence-link">[e161.3]</a> </li>
    <li>General extravasation cascade review supports that chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) and inflammatory upregulation of adhesion molecules contribute to capture/adhesion/transmigration; receptor/pathway perturbations (β1 integrin, HIF-1α) alter extravasation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.0" class="evidence-link">[e164.0]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Mechanistic parts are known; novelty is the cross-context selection framing (organ admission control) and explicit unification of direct tumor chemotaxis with indirect immune-gated selection including hybrid-cell phenotypes.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Chemokine-guided homing/extravasation and immune recruitment (e.g., CXCL12–CXCR4, CXCL5–CXCR2, CCL2–CCR2) are established components of metastasis biology and PMN formation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Elevates chemokine gradients as an organ-side 'admission control' selector that integrates (i) direct receptor matching (CXCL5–CXCR2) with (ii) organ-local immune recruitment dependence (CCL2-driven MDSC gating), and explicitly predicts stronger selection for tumor–myeloid fusion hybrids as high-responsiveness seeds.</p>

            <h3>Statement 1: Barrier-tuning admission law (endothelial/BBB/mesothelial)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If a target organ’s barrier cells (vascular endothelium, BBB endothelium, or mesothelium) are primed by EVs or organ-derived signals to weaken junctional integrity and/or reorganize cytoskeleton (or undergo mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition), then the probability of tumor (or hybrid) entry into that organ increases; conversely, perturbations that prevent EV-driven barrier remodeling reduce transendothelial/mesothelial crossing and downstream colonization.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Organs where barrier function is rate-limiting for entry: brain (BBB), lung microvasculature, and peritoneal mesothelium; also applies to liver/lung endothelial remodeling in CRC. Includes EV-mediated miRNA/protein signaling, endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and cytoskeleton/junction modulation measurable in vitro (organ-on-chip, Transwell) or in vivo permeability/niche assays.</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Liver sinusoids are structurally permissive (fenestrated); in liver, stromal/ECM and immune modules (fibronectin deposition, macrophage/stellate activation) may dominate over junctional barrier weakening.</li>
                <li>Route-of-access matters: bypassing the BBB (intraventricular/intracerebral exposure) can produce different immune outcomes than systemic exposure via BMECs, implying barrier interaction is part of the causal chain rather than an interchangeable exposure method.</li>
                <li>Barrier weakening may be necessary but not sufficient; chemokine/ECM/immune programs can still be required for stable colonization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Breast cancer exosomal miR-105 targets endothelial tight junction protein ZO-1, disrupting microvascular endothelial barriers and increasing permeability in lung/brain endothelia, promoting metastasis (summarized). <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.5" class="evidence-link">[e163.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-158.html#e158.3" class="evidence-link">[e158.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-160.html#e160.2" class="evidence-link">[e160.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.4" class="evidence-link">[e165.4]</a> </li>
    <li>CRC exosomal miR-25-3p remodels endothelium of liver/lung by upregulating VEGFR2 and downregulating tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin, Claudin5) via KLF2/KLF4 suppression, increasing permeability and angiogenesis (summarized). <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.6" class="evidence-link">[e163.6]</a> </li>

    <li>Brain barrier/niche: microfluidic BBB studies show astrocyte-conditioned media increases tumor migration; MMP inhibition reverses effects (barrier-adjacent paracrine remodeling). <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.4" class="evidence-link">[e164.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Peritoneal barrier: gastric cancer EV-associated MMP2 induces mesothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (MMT) via ERK activation; GC exosomal miR-21-5p and miR-106a target SMAD7 to activate TGF-β/Smad and induce MMT; GC EV lncRNA SNHG12 sponges miR-129-5p to increase E2F7 and activate MAPK/ERK, inducing MMT and promoting peritoneal dissemination. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.6" class="evidence-link">[e159.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.4" class="evidence-link">[e159.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.7" class="evidence-link">[e159.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.5" class="evidence-link">[e159.5]</a> </li>
    <li>EV-associated proteases (MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP, uPA, EMMPRIN) are broadly implicated in ECM and barrier remodeling facilitating invasion/extravasation at secondary sites (review synthesis). <a href="../results/extraction-result-165.html#e165.6" class="evidence-link">[e165.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Route dependence at BBB interface: systemic lung-cancer exosomes are taken up by brain microvascular endothelial cells and induce endothelial Dkk-1 with downstream effects; intraventricular exosome administration (bypassing endothelial interface) produces different microglial responses, indicating BBB-endothelial interaction is a distinct gating step. <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.0" class="evidence-link">[e157.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-157.html#e157.1" class="evidence-link">[e157.1]</a> </li>

        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is an integrative conceptual law across barrier types rather than a newly discovered molecular pathway.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> EV-driven BBB disruption (miR-105/miR-181c), endothelial leakiness, and mesothelial transition (MMT) are established mechanisms in organ-specific metastasis contexts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Unifies vascular/BBB and mesothelial remodeling into a single 'barrier-tuning admission' principle that treats barrier state as an organ-controlled gate interacting with EV route-of-access, and predicts that changing barrier set-points can redirect organotropism even without altering tumor intrinsic adhesiveness.</p>

            <h3>Statement 2: Matrix-and-mechanics admission law (docking and growth permissiveness)</h3>
            <p><strong>Statement:</strong> If organ-resident stromal cells are primed to increase docking matrix (e.g., fibronectin/laminin) and/or alter tissue mechanics (stiffness/EMT-like stromal transitions), then early retention/adhesion and subsequent outgrowth probability for arriving tumor cells increases in that organ; blocking the stromal activation axis reduces retention and metastatic burden.</p>
            <p><strong>Domain/Scope:</strong> Premetastatic niche contexts where ECM deposition/mechanics are experimentally measured and perturbed; applies strongly to liver and lung (fibronectin and mechanical remodeling) and conceptually to bone (osteolytic surfaces acting as a dynamic 'matrix' niche).</p>
            <h4>Special Cases</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In bone, 'matrix' includes mineralized matrix and osteoclast-driven remodeling; cues can be biochemical (growth factors released from resorption) and physical (rigidity), not just fibronectin/laminin.</li>
                <li>Dormancy vs outgrowth can depend on matrix stiffness; softer scaffolds may increase dormancy in liver-like systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>PDAC exosomal MIF primes liver: Kupffer cell uptake induces TGF-β, activates hepatic stellate cells, increases fibronectin deposition, recruits BM-derived macrophages; fibronectin conditional knockout or CD11b+ cell depletion abrogates exosome-driven metastasis; exosome education increases early tumor cell retention and later macrometastatic burden. <a href="../results/extraction-result-217.html#e217.0" class="evidence-link">[e217.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Breast cancer EVs prime liver in microphysiologic systems: EV-carried TGF-β1 activates liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and induces fibronectin; EVs show liver tropism; stiffness influences dormancy fraction in long-term liver culture. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.2" class="evidence-link">[e164.2]</a> </li>

            <h2>Theory (Additional Details)</h2>
                        <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bone: In bone-on-chip devices, imposing a CXCL5 gradient or engineering bone stromal cells to overexpress CXCL5 will preferentially increase extravasation of CXCR2-high breast cancer subclones; anti-CXCR2 will selectively blunt this enrichment (not merely reduce overall extravasation).</li>
                <li>Lung: Selective blockade of AEC II exosome uptake (e.g., receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibitors targeted to AEC II) will reduce lung CCL2 induction and MDSC recruitment and will blunt exosome-education-enhanced lung metastasis without necessarily changing primary tumor growth.</li>
                <li>Peritoneum: Inhibiting ERK signaling in mesothelial cells (or blocking EV-MMP2 activity) will reduce EV-induced MMT and decrease peritoneal implantation efficiency even when tumor cell inoculum is unchanged.</li>
                <li>Liver: In PDAC exosome education models, partial suppression of stellate-cell fibronectin induction (e.g., via TGF-β receptor inhibition) will reduce early 24 h tumor cell retention in liver more strongly than it reduces primary tumor size, indicating a niche-local retention mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Decoy-organ engineering: Creating an artificial, non-essential vascular bed with high CXCL12/CXCL5 and fibronectin (a 'decoy sink') will divert chemokine-responsive CTCs/hybrids away from brain/lung/bone, reducing lethal organ metastases; could fail if diversion increases total metastatic burden.</li>
                <li>BBB-gate tightening: Brain-endothelium-specific stabilization of tight junction networks (e.g., targeted restoration of ZO-1 or actin-junction coupling) will reduce brain metastasis incidence but might redirect metastasis to leptomeninges or non-CNS organs due to altered trafficking.</li>
                <li>Hybrid-specific admission: Tumor–myeloid hybrid cells will show disproportionately higher sensitivity to organ-side admission cues (chemokines + VCAM/ICAM expression) compared with non-hybrid tumor cells, causing a measurable shift in organotropism when admission cues are experimentally modulated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chemokine falsification: In bone microfluidic models with robust CXCL5 gradients, show that CXCR2 blockade does not change extravasation rate or subclone enrichment; would contradict chemokine-field admission as a selector in that context.</li>
                <li>Barrier falsification: In BBB or lung endothelial models, demonstrate that large EV-induced changes in permeability/junctional markers (e.g., ZO-1 reduction) do not change tumor transmigration frequency; would weaken barrier-tuning admission.</li>
                <li>Matrix falsification: In PDAC exosome liver education, conditional fibronectin depletion (or TGF-β pathway inhibition) does not change early tumor cell retention or later metastasis; would contradict matrix/ECM docking admission in liver.</li>
                <li>Route falsification: Show that systemic vs intraventricular exosome delivery produces identical downstream brain immune/barrier outcomes; would challenge the claimed gating role of BMEC interaction/route-of-access.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some organotropism arises from tumor–myeloid fusion hybrids' intrinsic trafficking/immune-escape phenotypes; while admission control predicts they will be strongly selected by organ cues, the theory does not uniquely explain why certain hybrids localize to spleen/lymph nodes long-term after tail-vein injection (lymphoid retention mechanisms are underspecified here). <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.3" class="evidence-link">[e161.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Purely anatomical first-pass filtration and hemodynamics can contribute strongly to lung seeding; admission control asserts organ-side selection can dominate but does not quantitatively partition contributions of flow vs organ instruction with the provided evidence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-161.html#e161.2" class="evidence-link">[e161.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.3" class="evidence-link">[e164.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.0" class="evidence-link">[e164.0]</a> </li>
