This leads to abnormal survival and export of autoreactive T cells—particularly CD3+ subsets—that should otherwise be eliminated by central tolerance. The theory holds that molecular alteration of the p53–MDM4 axis acts as a paraneoplastic autoimmunity switch, distinguishing this syndrome from classical tolerance breakdown and providing a genetic/molecular signature for especially high-risk thymomas. Distinct from common AIRE/MHCII/tolerance-related mechanisms alone, this axis is postulated to underlie specific clinicopathological forms of multiorgan (predominantly hepatic and myocardial) autoimmunity, temporally and reversibly linked to the presence of the tumor.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

This dual deficit permits both the peripheral egress of autoreactive T cells/B cells and local autoantibody production, with syndrome specificity determined by the interplay between neoplastic histotype and stromal transcriptomic context. Neither central tolerance loss nor microenvironmental changes alone is typically sufficient, but their combination dramatically increases the risk and breadth of paraneoplastic autoimmunity in thymomas.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

Instead, GS autoimmunity is proposed to be maintained primarily by a T-cell–dominant immune state: (1) quantitative and qualitative failure of regulation (reduced circulating Tregs and broader CD4 compartment defects), (2) effector skewing toward cytotoxic/terminal-effector T-cell phenotypes (including expanded terminal-effector γδ T cells and CD8-biased memory/effector distributions), and (3) a systemic inflammatory cytokine/chemokine milieu (IL-15, IL-6, IP-10/CXCL10, GM-CSF, MIP-1α, VEGF) that supports activation, survival, and tissue trafficking of these effector populations. This configuration can generate autoimmune tissue injury even when B cells are nearly absent, while also predisposing to infections (immunodeficiency) and persistence of immune dysfunction after thymectomy. The theory is explicitly scoped to GS (not all thymoma-associated autoimmunity) and emphasizes the paradox: autoimmunity with B-cell absence.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

                    <td><b>Name:</b> Checkpoint-Stage Apoptosis as a Protective Deletional Switch in MG(-) Thymomas (refined)<br><b>Description:</b> Some thymomas avoid triggering paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis (MG) not by restoring full thymic medullary tolerance programs (e.g., AIRE/TRA expression) but by engaging a quantitatively stronger deletional (apoptotic) program at a specific late CD4 thymocyte maturation checkpoint. This "deletional switch" reduces the accumulation (and inferred export potential) of terminally mature naive CD4 thymocytes (CD4+CD27+CD45RA+). In the Strobel et al. cohort, MG(+) thymomas show a permissive phenotype at this checkpoint (low apoptosis and high mature-naive CD4 accumulation), whereas MG(-) thymomas show heightened apoptosis and low mature-naive CD4 accumulation. Importantly, this deletional protection can coexist with markedly reduced intratumoral thymus-derived Treg output; thus, MG protection is modeled as a disease-specific outcome of strong deletion overwhelming the MG-driving autoreactive-helper pool, while other autoimmune phenotypes may still occur via alternative pathways (different antigen sets, B-cell germinal center dynamics, checkpoint blockade, cytokine milieus, or systemic Good syndrome biology).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

High PD-L1 expression on thymic epithelium/tumor cells indicates reliance on this buffer. When the buffer is removed—through PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or other immune-activating contexts—pre-existing autoreactive pools rapidly trigger severe autoimmunity (irAEs) that can co-occur with antitumor response. This theory explains unusually high and early irAE rates in thymoma ICI trials, and why autoimmunity can emerge even when B-cell/GC signatures are minimal.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

Autoantibody-dominant syndromes (e.g., MG) are amplified by the GC module (often peritumoral), whereas primarily T-cell–mediated syndromes (e.g., some PRCA cases) can occur with little/no GC activity and may persist after thymectomy because pathogenic clones are maintained in the periphery. The model explicitly allows that checkpoint blockade (PD-1/PD-L1) can bypass the need for a strong GC module by acutely unleashing pre-existing autoreactive T cells, explaining ICI-triggered irAEs in thymoma even when intratumoral B cells/GCs are sparse.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

In thymoma, residual thymopoiesis persists (immature thymocytes are abundant), but medullary antigen-flow and/or migration cues are distorted, creating ‘antigen shadow’ gaps—self-antigen classes that are underrepresented in the selection synapse. The result is selective escape of autoreactive T cells to particular antigen categories (e.g., neuromuscular junction/muscle, skin adhesion molecules), explaining why certain organ-specific syndromes (MG, PNP/pemphigus variants, PRCA) are enriched and why histotype (thymopoietic AB/B types) matters.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: green; font-weight: bold;'>new</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

Many patients remain clinically “buffered” because strong inhibitory signaling (notably PD-1/PD-L1 in the tumor/thymic niche and periphery) and residual regulation keep autoreactive clones subclinical. When this buffering layer is removed (PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) or when baseline regulatory capacity is low (low Tregs; possibly inflammatory cytokine milieus such as IL-6/IL-15 in GS/TET-AD), rapid and severe autoimmunity emerges. This theory aims to explain both classical thymoma-associated autoimmunity (e.g., MG) and the unusually high incidence/early onset of severe irAEs in thymoma patients treated with ICIs.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

Endothelial Dkk-1 then acts as a paracrine/juxtacrine immune-silencing signal that suppresses microglial activation and biases microglia toward an M2-like, pro-tumor phenotype. This conversion is associated with increased microglial AMPK phosphorylation and negligible change in canonical Wnt/β-catenin readouts (Wnt-independent signaling). Functionally, the BMEC Dkk-1 program also increases tumor cell transendothelial migration across a BBB-like barrier in vitro; Dkk-1 knockdown in BMECs abolishes these microglial and transmigration effects. A key boundary condition is route: BBB-proximal systemic delivery (retro-orbital) yields microglial suppression, while direct intraventricular delivery (BBB-bypassing) can directly activate microglia, demonstrating that organotropism depends on which brain-resident cell type first receives tumor EV signals (BMECs vs parenchymal microglia).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

Malignancy occurs only when the combined effect crosses the individual's 'carcinogenic trigger zone', accounting for why most heavily exposed smokers do not develop lung cancer, and explaining observed epidemiology, genetics, and molecular pathobiology.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-4.1-2025-04-14</td>

Thus, among smokers with similar exposure, only those who enter a high-propensity route (e.g., tobacco-signature-high with genomic instability) develop clinically apparent cancer, while others either do not initiate, initiate but are cleared, or initiate low-propensity routes that do not progress.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

Cancer emerges when cumulative (internal dose) × (failure to neutralize/repair/eliminate damaged clones) exceeds a threshold over time. This explains why pack-years alone is an imperfect predictor: (i) genetic variants can change smoking behavior (exposure), (ii) metabolic variants can change internal dose per cigarette (activation/detox), (iii) repair/surveillance/inflammation can change the probability that damage is fixed and expands into a malignant clone, and (iv) co-exposures (PM2.5, radon, asbestos, biomass smoke) shift internal dose at the same smoking history.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> openai/gpt-5.2-2025-12-11</td>

This epigenetic state is heritable through cell divisions, amplifies the carcinogenic consequences of tobacco-induced DNA mutations, and is only slowly and incompletely reversible with smoking cessation (explaining persistent elevated risk and gradual risk reduction after quitting). Individual susceptibility to establishing this epigenetic state varies based on genetic background (metabolic enzyme polymorphisms, DNA repair capacity), intensity and duration of exposure, and co-exposures (PM2.5, occupational carcinogens).<br><b>Self-classification:</b> closely-related-to-existing<br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>

Polymorphisms in antigen-processing machinery (ERAP1/2, immunoproteasome subunits PSMB8/PSMB9, TAP transporters), HLA class I/II diversity (evolutionary divergence affecting peptide repertoire breadth), and NK cell inhibitory receptor-ligand interactions (KIR-HLA) determine whether tobacco-induced neoantigens are efficiently presented and recognized. Tumors that arise in smokers represent 'immune escape variants' that evaded elimination; individuals with robust antigen presentation (broad peptide repertoires via diverse HLA alleles and optimal ERAP trimming) and weak NK inhibitory signaling eliminate transformed clones before clinical cancer develops, while those with narrow peptide repertoires, suboptimal trimming, or strong inhibitory interactions permit escape. The effects are exposure-dependent: ERAP and other immune gene associations differ between smokers and never-smokers because the substrate peptides (derived from different mutational signatures) differ, and the relative importance of immune surveillance varies with mutational burden.<br><b>Self-classification:</b> <span style='color: orange; font-weight: bold;'>somewhat-related-to-existing</span><br><b>Version:</b> built-theory-from-results-single-theory-reflection3-dec10-2025<br><b>Model:</b> claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929</td>
