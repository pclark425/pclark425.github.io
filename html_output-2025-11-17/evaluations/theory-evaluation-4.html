            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>CCoToM used a zero‐shot prompting method with GPT‑3.5‑Turbo (175B) to improve accuracy on BigToM by up to 41.5 points, directly supporting that larger models trained on diverse data have enhanced ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-139.html#e139.0" class="evidence-link">[e139.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Flan‑PaLM (540B) achieved near‑human performance on MoToMQA and showed that fine‑tuned large models benefit from diverse, instruction‑based data, which aligns with the theory’s claim. <a href="../results/extraction-result-125.html#e125.1" class="evidence-link">[e125.1]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‑3 (175B) demonstrated improved false‑belief task performance (around 55–60% accuracy) with diverse training data, supporting the positive correlation between model size and ToM task performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-140.html#e140.0" class="evidence-link">[e140.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‑4 (175B) attained performance on false‑belief tasks comparable to that of 7–10‑year‑old children, reinforcing that larger models with varied training data achieve above‑child‑level ToM results. <a href="../results/extraction-result-116.html#e116.0" class="evidence-link">[e116.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Another GPT‑4 result (175B) recorded approximately 75% accuracy on false‑belief tasks, further evidencing the role of model scale and training data diversity in boosting ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-130.html#e130.0" class="evidence-link">[e130.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Qwen2.5 experiments showed that larger versions (e.g., 7B models) achieved 94.5% accuracy on 4th‑order ToM tasks, clearly supporting a positive effect of scaling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-120.html#e120.0" class="evidence-link">[e120.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SPHINX‑X results demonstrated that increasing parameters (from 1.1B up to 56B) consistently boosts multi‑modal understanding and reasoning, which parallels the claims about increased model size and diverse training data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-135.html#e135.0" class="evidence-link">[e135.0]</a> </li>
    <li>o3‑mini, built on GPT‑3 architecture, showed over 90% accuracy on first‑order ToM tasks, underscoring that with sufficient scale and diverse data, strong ToM performance is achievable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-133.html#e133.0" class="evidence-link">[e133.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Additional GPT‑4 evidence (via a Sally‑Anne test) demonstrated that with proper prompting, large models attain robust first‑order ToM performance, reinforcing the theory’s core claims. <a href="../results/extraction-result-140.html#e140.1" class="evidence-link">[e140.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Claude‑3.5‑Sonnet achieved 67.0% accuracy on behavior prediction tasks while struggling with applied judgment questions, indicating that although larger models tend to perform better, the relationship may be task‑dependent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-134.html#e134.1" class="evidence-link">[e134.1]</a> </li>
    <li>DynToM found that while larger models like GPT‑4o (70B) perform better in tracking dynamic mental states, performance degrades significantly with increasing task complexity, suggesting that the size–performance relationship can be moderated by task demands. <a href="../results/extraction-result-132.html#e132.0" class="evidence-link">[e132.0]</a> </li>
    <li>One GPT‑4 study on a faux pas test reported notably lower‑than‑human performance, implying that despite the benefits of larger size and diverse training, certain nuances of social reasoning remain challenging. <a href="../results/extraction-result-124.html#e124.0" class="evidence-link">[e124.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In perceived behavior recognition tasks, GPT‑4 showed high accuracy with vanilla prompts but was brittle under perturbations, highlighting limitations in robustness even among large models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-136.html#e136.0" class="evidence-link">[e136.0]</a> </li>
    <li>NegotiationToM benchmarks revealed substantial performance gaps between GPT‑4 and humans, hinting that increased model size and data diversity alone may not capture all nuances of applied ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-137.html#e137.0" class="evidence-link">[e137.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‑3.5’s variable performance on false‑belief tasks under zero‑shot and few‑shot conditions indicates that while larger models and diverse data help, outcomes are sensitive to prompt conditions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-127.html#e127.0" class="evidence-link">[e127.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Video‑ChatGPT improved its ToM video question‐answering accuracy from 39.61% to 47.15% after fine‑tuning on ToM‑specific datasets, suggesting that training data specificity can partially drive performance improvements. <a href="../results/extraction-result-138.html#e138.0" class="evidence-link">[e138.0]</a> </li>
    <li>XToM results showed that although scaling improves fact consistency, performance on belief questions lags, suggesting that increasing model size does not uniformly enhance all facets of ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-123.html#e123.0" class="evidence-link">[e123.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLaMA2‑70B initially outperformed humans on a faux pas test, but later analyses questioned the validity of this high accuracy, implying mixed outcomes regarding the impact of scale. <a href="../results/extraction-result-124.html#e124.1" class="evidence-link">[e124.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi‑ToM’s multilingual evaluation found that while larger models fare better on simpler ToM tasks, they still struggle with complex belief inference, indicating that the benefits of scale may be context‑dependent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-131.html#e131.0" class="evidence-link">[e131.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLAMA‑2 70B, evaluated on a Rock, Paper, Scissors task, achieved a regret of 0.857 ± 0.142, indicating that while model scale coupled with diverse training data can improve performance, there remains significant room for improvement in functional ToM tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-121.html#e121.0" class="evidence-link">[e121.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In the 'Pick the Right Stuff' task, smaller LLMs outperformed larger ones, directly challenging the assumption that larger model size consistently translates into better ToM performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-119.html#e119.0" class="evidence-link">[e119.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MeTHanol, a modularized model with only 8B parameters fine‑tuned on annotated thought data, achieved 98.2%–99.4% accuracy on ToM benchmarks, outperforming much larger models like GPT‑4 and contradicting the necessity of large scale for high performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-129.html#e129.0" class="evidence-link">[e129.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ToMAP, employing a 3B model augmented with specialized ToM modules, outperformed larger models such as GPT‑4o in persuasion tasks by 39.4%, contradicting the idea that larger models are inherently superior for ToM tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-118.html#e118.0" class="evidence-link">[e118.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>ExploreToM demonstrated that fine‑tuning on adversarially generated, complex ToM data can yield substantial performance improvements, suggesting that targeted training regimes may alter the simple size–performance relationship. <a href="../results/extraction-result-122.html#e122.0" class="evidence-link">[e122.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MetaMind’s multi‑agent framework, which integrates metacognitive and structured social reasoning approaches, indicates that architectural modifications and alternative training strategies can critically influence ToM performance, beyond just model size and raw data diversity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-126.html#e126.0" class="evidence-link">[e126.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Revise the theory to acknowledge that targeted fine-tuning and specialized training methods can enable smaller models (even below 10B parameters) to achieve high first-order ToM performance.</li>
                <li>Incorporate the concept of diminishing returns, where increases in model size yield less benefit on more complex or dynamic ToM tasks.</li>
                <li>Expand the theory to include additional factors—such as architectural modifications, multi-agent frameworks, and advanced prompting techniques—that can substitute for mere scale in enhancing ToM capabilities.</li>
                <li>Reassess the assertion that smaller models perform near chance on first-order ToM tasks, given evidence that with proper optimization they can perform competitively.</li>
