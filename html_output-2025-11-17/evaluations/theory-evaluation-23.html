            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>All new studies report no sim-to-real transfer experiments (sim_to_real_transfer: false across all entries), confirming the theory's core claim that 'no direct sim-to-real transfer experiments for circuits are present' and that minimal fidelity requirements for transfer 'remain speculative and require empirical validation' <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.0" class="evidence-link">[e2058.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.3" class="evidence-link">[e2055.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.1" class="evidence-link">[e2058.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.2" class="evidence-link">[e2058.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.3" class="evidence-link">[e2058.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.1" class="evidence-link">[e2055.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.2" class="evidence-link">[e2055.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Digital circuits and RF circuits remain completely absent from the evidence base, confirming the theory's identification of these as significant gaps </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AUTOCIRCUIT-RL uses Ngspice with simplified fixed-parameter models (no explicit parasitics, thermal effects, noise, process corners, or aging) for power converter topology generation, consistent with the theory's observation that detailed fidelity requirements for transfer are not established <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.0" class="evidence-link">[e2058.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.1" class="evidence-link">[e2058.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The new evidence confirms that physics-informed approaches are not universally adopted—GLOVA and Q-learning placement use simulator-in-the-loop evaluation rather than physics-informed reward design, supporting the theory's observation that the role of physics constraints is not fully established <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multiple analog circuit examples with detailed applications are now present (Current Mirror, Comparator, OTA, sense amplifiers, strongARM latch, floating inverter amplifier, DRAM core), directly contradicting the theory's statement that 'no analog/digital/RF circuit examples' exist in the evidence base <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.3" class="evidence-link">[e2055.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GLOVA explicitly compares three circuit simulator fidelity levels (corner-only with 30 simulations, corner+local MC with 3,000 simulations, corner+global-local MC with 6,000 simulations) and documents their verification capabilities, directly contradicting the theory's claim that 'no fidelity comparisons' are present in the dataset <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Detailed studies of circuit simulator fidelity are now present, including GLOVA's comprehensive documentation of industrial SPICE with foundry PDK models, PVT corners (TT/SS/FF/SF/FS, voltage 0.8V/0.9V, temperature -40°C/27°C/80°C), hierarchical global/local mismatch modeling, and post-layout parasitic extraction via Calibre, contradicting the claim of 'no detailed studies of circuit simulator fidelity' <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.2" class="evidence-link">[e2055.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Post-layout extraction with parasitic modeling (via Calibre) is used in analog placement optimization, showing that parasitic effects are modeled in some circuit simulation workflows for ML training, partially contradicting the theory's statement that parasitic modeling requirements are speculative, though minimal requirements for successful transfer remain unvalidated <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.2" class="evidence-link">[e2055.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GLOVA demonstrates that corner-only simulation (30 sims) captures global process variation but misses statistical worst-cases revealed by Monte Carlo, while hierarchical global-local MC (6,000 sims) is necessary for robust industrial verification, establishing that high-fidelity simulation with PVT+MC is required for verification accuracy—however, this addresses verification fidelity rather than minimal fidelity for transferable learning, suggesting the theory should distinguish between these two requirements <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GLOVA shows that RL agents can be trained efficiently using small sampled subsets (N'=2-5) of high-fidelity simulations with ensemble critics to estimate worst-case bounds, achieving up to 80.5× sample efficiency improvement, then verified with full MC—this suggests a two-phase approach where training uses reduced-fidelity sampling but verification requires full fidelity, which should be incorporated into the theory <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The new evidence substantially expands the scope beyond power system control to include analog circuit sizing and placement optimization tasks (transistor sizing for performance metrics, layout placement for mismatch/offset reduction), suggesting the theory scope should be broadened to encompass analog design automation while maintaining the distinction from power systems <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GLOVA explicitly states that effects NOT modeled include aging, electromigration, and full 3D electromagnetic coupling, providing concrete examples of fidelity boundaries in current industrial practice for analog circuit ML applications <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The evidence shows different fidelity approaches for different circuit domains: power converters use simplified Ngspice models with fixed parameters, while analog sizing/placement uses industrial SPICE with foundry PDKs, PVT corners, and post-layout extraction—suggesting that fidelity requirements may be domain-specific and the theory should account for this variation <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.0" class="evidence-link">[e2058.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain randomization is explicitly used in GLOVA (hierarchical global/local mismatch sampling, PVT corner enumeration) for analog circuit sizing, providing concrete evidence of randomization strategies, though their sufficiency for sim-to-real transfer remains unvalidated <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Revise the theory title and description to acknowledge that the evidence base has expanded significantly for analog circuits, while maintaining that transfer requirements remain unvalidated due to absence of sim-to-real experiments</li>
                <li>Add a critical distinction between two types of fidelity requirements: (1) verification fidelity—the simulation accuracy needed to reliably predict real-world performance (addressed by GLOVA's MC analysis), and (2) transfer learning fidelity—the minimal simulation fidelity needed to train models that successfully transfer to real hardware (still unvalidated)</li>
                <li>Update the theory to document that analog circuit sizing and placement optimization are now represented in the evidence base with detailed fidelity specifications (industrial SPICE, foundry PDKs, PVT corners, hierarchical mismatch modeling, post-layout parasitic extraction)</li>
                <li>Add explicit fidelity boundaries documented in the evidence: GLOVA shows that aging, electromigration, and full 3D EM coupling are NOT included in current industrial practice for analog circuit ML applications</li>
                <li>Incorporate the finding that different circuit domains use different fidelity levels: power converter topology generation uses simplified models (Ngspice with fixed parameters), while analog sizing/placement uses high-fidelity industrial SPICE with comprehensive PVT and mismatch modeling</li>
                <li>Add the two-phase training approach as a documented strategy: GLOVA demonstrates training with small sampled subsets (N'=2-5) using ensemble critics, followed by full MC verification (N=1000), achieving 80× sample efficiency gains</li>
                <li>Maintain and emphasize the core limitation that no sim-to-real transfer experiments exist for any circuit type, so claims about minimal fidelity for transferable learning remain speculative and require empirical validation</li>
                <li>Update the 'unaccounted_for' section to reflect that analog circuits are now represented but digital and RF circuits remain absent</li>
                <li>Add domain randomization strategies documented in GLOVA (hierarchical mismatch sampling, PVT enumeration) as concrete examples, while noting their transfer efficacy is unvalidated</li>
