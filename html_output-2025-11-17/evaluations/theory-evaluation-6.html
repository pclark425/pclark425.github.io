            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>ChainLM demonstrates that sophisticated chain‐of‐thought prompting boosts multi‐step reasoning performance (from 45.81% to 63.23% on GSM8K), supporting the idea that explicit reasoning scaffolds enhance performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-166.html#e166.0" class="evidence-link">[e166.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‑3’s chain-of-thought prompting on GSM8K leads to a marked performance improvement (from 15.6% to 46.9%), underscoring the benefit of explicit reasoning steps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.0" class="evidence-link">[e169.0]</a> </li>
    <li>A survey of GPT‑3’s emergent abilities using chain-of-thought shows substantial boosts in multi-step reasoning tasks, aligning with the theory’s claim. <a href="../results/extraction-result-174.html#e174.0" class="evidence-link">[e174.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DeepSeek-R1 employs chain-of-thought scaffolding to significantly enhance performance on Theory-of-Mind tasks, demonstrating that explicit reasoning guides improve mental state inferences. <a href="../results/extraction-result-183.html#e183.0" class="evidence-link">[e183.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‑4 achieves a approximately 15% increase in correct inferences on Theory-of-Mind tasks when using chain-of-thought prompting, confirming the value of explicit reasoning scaffolds. <a href="../results/extraction-result-182.html#e182.0" class="evidence-link">[e182.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Instruction tuning methods, as reported, lead to better alignment of model outputs with human intent, thereby supporting the theory that instruction tuning enhances ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-174.html#e174.1" class="evidence-link">[e174.1]</a> </li>
    <li>MeTHanol’s incorporation of a dedicated thinking layer using explicit chain-of-thought prompting dramatically improves performance on ToM benchmarks, directly supporting the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-164.html#e164.0" class="evidence-link">[e164.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Medprompt leverages structured chain-of-thought and few-shot prompting to boost MedQA accuracy from 78.9% to 90.2%, illustrating the power of explicit instruction tuning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-172.html#e172.1" class="evidence-link">[e172.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Nash CoT uses role-based explicit prompts and multi-path inference to achieve performance improvements that align with the theory’s emphasis on explicit reasoning scaffolds. <a href="../results/extraction-result-177.html#e177.0" class="evidence-link">[e177.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Process Reward Model (PRM) provides step-level feedback that significantly increases multi-step reasoning accuracy on ToM related tasks, further reinforcing the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-190.html#e190.1" class="evidence-link">[e190.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct shows a dramatic accuracy jump on GSM8K (from 41.69% to 95.38%) when using instruction-guided, explicit prompts, strongly supporting the benefits of explicit scaffolding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-175.html#e175.0" class="evidence-link">[e175.0]</a> </li>
    <li>R2-Reasoner improves Theory-of-Mind task performance via explicit task decomposition, which supports the claim that structured reasoning prompts enhance multi-step inference. <a href="../results/extraction-result-189.html#e189.0" class="evidence-link">[e189.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demonstrates that pairing chain-of-thought prompting with retrieval strategies improves ToM task accuracy by around 10%, consistent with the benefits of explicit scaffolding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-188.html#e188.0" class="evidence-link">[e188.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ReviewAgents employs a multi-agent structured reasoning process that produces academic reviews with high semantic consistency, providing evidence that explicit, multi-step reasoning scaffolds align model outputs closer to human-like ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-173.html#e173.0" class="evidence-link">[e173.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Sequential Instruction Tuning (SIT) significantly enhances adherence to complex multi-step instructions and boosts accuracy on CommonsenseQA, paralleling improvements observed in ToM tasks with explicit scaffolding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-181.html#e181.0" class="evidence-link">[e181.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ShortcutQA shows that heuristic explicit prompting can yield a 22% performance boost on arithmetic tasks, underlining the general advantage of explicit reasoning scaffolds. <a href="../results/extraction-result-185.html#e185.1" class="evidence-link">[e185.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The Thought-Like-Pro framework, through explicit chain-of-thought prompting, increases GSM8K accuracy from 79.6% to 87.81%, further bolstering the argument that clear, step-by-step reasoning enhances complex problem-solving. <a href="../results/extraction-result-176.html#e176.0" class="evidence-link">[e176.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GPT‑4o Mini demonstrates improved belief tracking using step-by-step reasoning, yet it falls short in fully handling multi-agent interactions, indicating that while explicit prompts help, there are limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-179.html#e179.1" class="evidence-link">[e179.1]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT‑3.5’s chain-of-thought approach on Theory-of-Mind tasks yields 10–15% accuracy improvements, though overly complex prompts can sometimes lead to confusion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-178.html#e178.0" class="evidence-link">[e178.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ChatGPT shows only a slight performance improvement on CommonsenseQA with chain-of-thought prompting (75.18% vs. 74.94%), and in some tasks like StrategyQA, performance even drops, suggesting that the benefit of explicit prompting can be modest or task-dependent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-185.html#e185.0" class="evidence-link">[e185.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Reflect Chain-of-Thought, which incorporates a reflective step after initial reasoning, produces mixed results—helping in some contexts while offering little benefit in others—indicating variable effectiveness of reflective scaffolding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-186.html#e186.1" class="evidence-link">[e186.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The Self-Ask method improves multi-hop reasoning by decomposing questions, but a persistent compositionality gap indicates that its benefits are not fully comprehensive. <a href="../results/extraction-result-169.html#e169.1" class="evidence-link">[e169.1]</a> </li>
    <li>SimToM, using perspective-taking prompts, achieves only a modest (approximately 2%) improvement in multi-interaction tasks while also increasing hallucination risks, suggesting that its benefits are limited. <a href="../results/extraction-result-179.html#e179.0" class="evidence-link">[e179.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Chain-of-Thought prompting with Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct in MCQA boosts accuracy (from 90.50 to 97.67) but also obscures token-level hallucination cues, partially contradicting claims that explicit scaffolding consistently reduces hallucinations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-187.html#e187.0" class="evidence-link">[e187.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>DOTS (Dynamic Optimal Reasoning Trajectories Search) outperforms static prompting methods by dynamically selecting reasoning actions, suggesting that the theory might be expanded to include dynamic, adaptive scaffolding techniques. <a href="../results/extraction-result-171.html#e171.0" class="evidence-link">[e171.0]</a> </li>
    <li>OpenAI's o1-preview model integrates internal chain-of-thought reasoning to outperform externally prompted models, implying that future architectures may internalize reasoning processes and thus modify the reliance on explicit scaffolds. <a href="../results/extraction-result-172.html#e172.0" class="evidence-link">[e172.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Revise the theory to acknowledge that the effectiveness of explicit reasoning scaffolds is influenced by prompt complexity and model architecture, with certain approaches (e.g., dynamic or internalized reasoning) offering alternative benefits.</li>
                <li>Include a note that while explicit prompting generally enhances multi-step and ToM reasoning, it may sometimes obscure error signals (such as hallucinations) and may not fully address challenges in multi-agent interactions.</li>
