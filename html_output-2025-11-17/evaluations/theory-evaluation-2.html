            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Composable Arithmetic Execution Framework (CAEF) demonstrates that algorithmic prompting enables LLaMA 3.1-8B to simulate arithmetic algorithms internally with near-perfect accuracy on complex tasks, supporting the theory's claim that detailed step-by-step algorithmic prompting improves arithmetic performance and generalization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple GPT-4 studies show that algorithmic prompting combined with chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves arithmetic accuracy, reduces systematic errors, and enhances generalization to complex and out-of-distribution problems, directly supporting the theory's core claims. <a href="../results/extraction-result-54.html#e54.0" class="evidence-link">[e54.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-48.html#e48.0" class="evidence-link">[e48.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-58.html#e58.0" class="evidence-link">[e58.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-64.html#e64.1" class="evidence-link">[e64.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.1" class="evidence-link">[e68.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Codex's dynamic program prompting, an algorithmic prompting variant, outperforms chain-of-thought prompting by enabling internal simulation of arithmetic algorithms, reducing errors, and improving generalization, consistent with the theory's statements. <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Skills-in-Context (SKiC) prompting method, which grounds reasoning on foundational skills with explicit stepwise instructions, achieves near-perfect accuracy and strong compositional generalization, supporting the theory's claim that explicit procedural guidance enhances arithmetic algorithm execution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.0" class="evidence-link">[e45.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Re-Tuning, a recursive prompting method, improves arithmetic accuracy and out-of-distribution generalization by breaking problems into subproblems and solving them stepwise, aligning with the theory's emphasis on step-by-step algorithmic prompting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-61.html#e61.0" class="evidence-link">[e61.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Progressive Rectification Prompting (PRP) uses iterative verify-then-rectify steps to improve arithmetic accuracy significantly over chain-of-thought prompting, demonstrating that detailed algorithmic prompting reduces systematic errors and improves reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-62.html#e62.0" class="evidence-link">[e62.0]</a> </li>
    <li>NanoGPT achieves 100% accuracy on addition tasks using detailed step-by-step scratchpad formats, showing that even small models benefit from explicit algorithmic prompting, supporting the theory's prediction about smaller models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-55.html#e55.0" class="evidence-link">[e55.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLaMA-7B improves arithmetic performance through self-improvement prompting involving iterative feedback and stepwise corrections, consistent with the theory's emphasis on procedural guidance and prompt sensitivity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-50.html#e50.0" class="evidence-link">[e50.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategy consistently improves arithmetic accuracy and generalization by encouraging intermediate reasoning steps, supporting the theory's claim that stepwise algorithmic prompting enhances performance over few-shot prompting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-49.html#e49.0" class="evidence-link">[e49.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Cognitive Prompting method, which structures reasoning into explicit cognitive operations, improves arithmetic problem-solving and generalization, supporting the theory's emphasis on structured, stepwise procedural guidance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-65.html#e65.0" class="evidence-link">[e65.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Question Analysis Prompting (QAP) strategy, which requires the model to explain the problem before solving, improves arithmetic accuracy and generalization, consistent with the theory's focus on detailed, structured prompting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-68.html#e68.0" class="evidence-link">[e68.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Compositional Arithmetic Execution Framework (CAEF) and other algorithmic prompting methods show that prompt correctness is critical, with errors in prompt structure leading to performance degradation, supporting the theory's statement on prompt sensitivity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-52.html#e52.0" class="evidence-link">[e52.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-49.html#e49.0" class="evidence-link">[e49.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 models show improvements with structured prompting strategies like Plan-and-Solve and zero-shot Chain-of-Thought, but still exhibit limitations in semantic understanding and generalization to complex tasks, partially supporting the theory while highlighting challenges. <a href="../results/extraction-result-46.html#e46.0" class="evidence-link">[e46.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-4o and LLaMA-3.3 models demonstrate strong arithmetic capabilities with chain-of-thought prompting and structured prompts, but some errors and limitations in complex or linguistic contexts remain, partially supporting the theory's claims. <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.0" class="evidence-link">[e67.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Evolutionary Pre-Prompt Optimization (EPPO) improves arithmetic performance by optimizing few-shot chain-of-thought prompts, supporting the theory's emphasis on prompt quality but focusing more on prompt selection than explicit algorithmic stepwise instructions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-63.html#e63.0" class="evidence-link">[e63.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The Little-Endian Fine-Tuning (LEFT) approach improves arithmetic accuracy by changing digit representation and combining it with step-by-step prompting, partially supporting the theory but suggesting that data representation also plays a critical role. <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.0" class="evidence-link">[e60.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>GPT-3.5 and Claude models show performance degradation on more complex or longer arithmetic tasks despite chain-of-thought prompting, indicating limitations in the ability of algorithmic prompting alone to fully overcome systematic errors and generalization challenges. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.1" class="evidence-link">[e53.1]</a> </li>
    <li>MathPrompter, which uses zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting combined with external tool integration (Python eval), achieves high accuracy but relies on external computation, suggesting that algorithmic prompting alone may not fully replace external tools for complex arithmetic. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.0" class="evidence-link">[e59.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Several studies (e.g., MathPrompter, LEFT, EPPO) indicate that factors such as training data composition, digit representation, and prompt optimization algorithms significantly influence arithmetic performance, suggesting the theory could be expanded to incorporate these aspects beyond just algorithmic prompting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-59.html#e59.0" class="evidence-link">[e59.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-60.html#e60.0" class="evidence-link">[e60.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-63.html#e63.0" class="evidence-link">[e63.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Evidence from MACM and RCoT suggests that multi-agent systems and fine-grained feedback mechanisms can further enhance arithmetic reasoning beyond standard algorithmic prompting, indicating potential extensions to the theory to include interactive or iterative prompting frameworks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-47.html#e47.0" class="evidence-link">[e47.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-51.html#e51.0" class="evidence-link">[e51.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some evidence (e.g., CAEF, SKiC) points to the possibility of automating or learning prompting strategies, which the original theory lists as unknown; this suggests the theory could be updated to reflect emerging research on prompt automation and self-adaptive prompting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-56.html#e56.0" class="evidence-link">[e56.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-45.html#e45.0" class="evidence-link">[e45.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-67.html#e67.1" class="evidence-link">[e67.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Expand the theory to explicitly include the influence of training data composition and data representation (e.g., digit order) on the effectiveness of algorithmic prompting for arithmetic tasks.</li>
                <li>Incorporate the role of prompt optimization techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms and multi-agent systems, as complementary methods to enhance arithmetic reasoning beyond static algorithmic prompts.</li>
                <li>Add consideration of iterative and feedback-based prompting methods (e.g., Progressive Rectification Prompting, Reversing Chain-of-Thought) that improve error correction and reasoning robustness.</li>
                <li>Update the theory to acknowledge emerging evidence that algorithmic prompting strategies can potentially be automated or learned by models themselves, suggesting a pathway for reducing manual prompt engineering.</li>
                <li>Clarify that while algorithmic prompting significantly improves arithmetic performance, it may not fully replace external tool integration for all complex arithmetic tasks, indicating a boundary condition for the theory.</li>
