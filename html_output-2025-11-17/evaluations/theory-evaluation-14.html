                <p><strong>Overall Support or Contradict Explanation:</strong> The evidence strongly supports the theory's core claims that task-dependent critical parameter subsets exist, selective high-fidelity modeling of critical parameters enables successful transfer, and this approach provides substantial computational efficiency gains. However, the evidence also reveals important scope limitations (theory applies primarily when actuator dynamics matter) and implementation details (learned models may be more practical than explicit parameters for complex actuators) that should be incorporated to strengthen the theory.</p>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>UAN demonstrates that for high-acceleration arm manipulation with harmonic drives, explicitly modeling actuator-specific nonlinearities (lag, friction, hysteresis) through learned residuals is critical for transfer, while domain randomization suffices for other parameters. This directly validates the theory's core claim that task-dependent critical parameter subsets exist (here: transmission dynamics for athletic manipulation) and that selective high-fidelity modeling enables successful transfer while maintaining efficiency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.0" class="evidence-link">[e1966.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Bolt bipedal locomotion identifies joint friction and actuation delay as critical parameters requiring explicit modeling for zero-shot transfer, with omission causing immediate collapse, while other parameters (mass, inertia) are secondary. This validates the theory's predictions that (1) dynamic tasks (τ_task < 0.1s) have critical sets including friction and bandwidth-related parameters, (2) critical parameters exhibit high sensitivity (catastrophic failure when omitted), and (3) sensitivity analysis can identify critical parameters. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1919.html#e1919.0" class="evidence-link">[e1919.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DexCtrl demonstrates that per-joint PD controller parameters (stiffness K_P and damping K_D) are critical for contact-rich dexterous manipulation, with sensitivity analysis showing K_P scales monotonically with object mass and task-dependent joint-specific patterns. This validates the theory's claims that (1) contact-rich tasks require compliance and damping in the critical set, (2) critical parameters exhibit high task-performance sensitivity (∂Performance/∂p), and (3) sensitivity can be determined through analysis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1946.html#e1946.0" class="evidence-link">[e1946.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1946.html#e1946.1" class="evidence-link">[e1946.1]</a> </li>
    <li>DexNDM shows that joint-wise actuator dynamics modeling with object-loaded data is critical for in-hand rotation transfer, while free-hand actuator models fail completely despite capturing actuator behavior in isolation. This validates that (1) critical parameters are task-dependent and must be evaluated under task-relevant conditions (object loads for manipulation), (2) for contact-rich tasks (>30% contact time), compliance and friction parameters are always critical, and (3) actuator dynamics couple with task characteristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1971.html#e1971.0" class="evidence-link">[e1971.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1971.html#e1971.1" class="evidence-link">[e1971.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1971.html#e1971.2" class="evidence-link">[e1971.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Balboa balancing experiment demonstrates that viscous damping parameters and equivalent controller gains are critical for transfer, with sensitivity analysis (parameter sweeps, contour maps) identifying critical parameters and showing that gain-constrained domain randomization prevents exploitation of unrealistic actuator capabilities. This validates the theory's claims that (1) sensitivity analysis can identify critical parameters with 80-90% accuracy, (2) constraining parameters to realistic ranges is important, and (3) quasi-static tasks (τ_task > 1s) have damping in their critical set. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1929.html#e1929.0" class="evidence-link">[e1929.0]</a> </li>
    <li>CEM parameter optimization shows that tuning a small subset of physics parameters (friction, damping, armature) can improve fit and reduce overshoot, but cannot capture full nonlinear harmonic-drive behavior, validating that (1) selective parameter modeling can provide partial improvements, (2) the critical set concept is valid (some parameters matter more), but (3) for complex actuators, the parametric form matters and learned models may be needed to achieve sufficient fidelity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.2" class="evidence-link">[e1966.2]</a> </li>
    <li>IKER tasks achieve ~5-minute training times in simulation with domain randomization, demonstrating computational efficiency gains of 10-100x compared to methods requiring extensive real-world data collection or uniformly high-fidelity modeling. This supports the theory's claim that selective fidelity enables 2-10x (or greater) more efficient simulation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.0" class="evidence-link">[e1954.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.1" class="evidence-link">[e1954.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.2" class="evidence-link">[e1954.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.3" class="evidence-link">[e1954.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Actuator Net (supervised) ablation shows that capturing lag alone is insufficient without modeling harmonic-drive nonlinearities, and the approach diverged on long rollouts and transferred worse than UAN. This validates that for high-reduction actuators, multiple parameters (friction, hysteresis, lag) are in the critical set and must all be modeled with sufficient fidelity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.1" class="evidence-link">[e1966.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Default and DR baselines failing for athletic arm tasks while succeeding for leg locomotion validates the theory's claim that critical parameter sets are task-dependent: high-acceleration arm manipulation requires harmonic-drive-specific modeling (C_task = {friction, hysteresis, lag}), while leg locomotion can use broader randomization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.3" class="evidence-link">[e1966.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.5" class="evidence-link">[e1966.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>PALO achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for quadruped locomotion by modeling PD-actuated control with randomization of actuator parameters (PD gains, action delay, motor torque), supporting the theory's approach of identifying and modeling critical actuator parameters. However, the study doesn't provide quantitative sensitivity analysis or specify which parameters are most critical versus secondary, limiting validation of the theory's sensitivity-based identification method. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1923.html#e1923.0" class="evidence-link">[e1923.0]</a> </li>
    <li>JT-Perturb demonstrates that state-dependent torque perturbations can capture unmodeled actuator dynamics better than finite-parameter randomization, supporting the theory's claim that critical dynamics must be modeled but suggesting that for some actuator types, expressive learned models may be more practical than explicit parameter identification. This partially supports the theory while suggesting an alternative implementation approach. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1921.html#e1921.0" class="evidence-link">[e1921.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Spot navigation study validates that identifying command-to-velocity mapping (actuator dynamics) improves transfer, supporting the theory's core premise. However, stopping latency and minimum action duration (temporal characteristics) caused failures, suggesting the theory's actuator parameter list may need expansion to include temporal/sequential characteristics beyond bandwidth. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1949.html#e1949.0" class="evidence-link">[e1949.0]</a> </li>
    <li>BB (BumbleBee) achieves transfer using PD-level control with cluster-specific delta-action models trained on real rollouts, without explicit high-fidelity actuator modeling. This supports the theory's concept of selective modeling (cluster-specific rather than uniform) but uses data-driven compensation rather than physics-based parameter identification, suggesting alternative approaches to achieving selective fidelity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1927.html#e1927.0" class="evidence-link">[e1927.0]</a> </li>
    <li>IKER shoe placement and pushing tasks achieve reasonable transfer (80-85% success) using kinematic end-effector control with domain randomization of object properties but no explicit joint-actuator dynamics modeling. This is consistent with the theory's prediction that slow quasi-static tasks (pick-and-place with >2s movement duration) may not require high-fidelity actuator modeling, though the theory could be more explicit about when actuator dynamics can be omitted entirely from the critical set. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.0" class="evidence-link">[e1954.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.1" class="evidence-link">[e1954.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multiple humanoid manipulation tasks (CupPnP, C2S-PnP, C2C-PnP) achieved strong sim-to-real transfer (80-95% success) with task-aware simulation and visual alignment, with explicit dynamics alignment producing no improvement (CupPnP: 95% success with or without dynamics alignment). This directly contradicts the theory's claim that high-fidelity actuator modeling is necessary for successful transfer in contact-rich manipulation tasks, suggesting that for some manipulation regimes, actuator dynamics are not in the critical set at all. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.0" class="evidence-link">[e1955.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.1" class="evidence-link">[e1955.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.2" class="evidence-link">[e1955.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.3" class="evidence-link">[e1955.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.4" class="evidence-link">[e1955.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.5" class="evidence-link">[e1955.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.6" class="evidence-link">[e1955.6]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>BSR (Best of Sim and Real) achieves successful sim-to-real transfer for contact-rich manipulation by training control with privileged state and progressive domain randomization (including control delays and dynamics randomization) but emphasizes that perception is the dominant domain-specific factor requiring adaptation. While this doesn't directly contradict the theory (which focuses on actuator dynamics when they matter), it suggests the theory may overstate the relative importance of actuator fidelity compared to perceptual factors for some manipulation tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1926.html#e1926.0" class="evidence-link">[e1926.0]</a> </li>
    <li>BimanualPnP shows that behavioral pattern consistency (correct bimanual vs single-arm behavior) is more critical than actuator-level fidelity for transfer, with task-agnostic simulation causing failures despite potentially accurate actuator modeling. This partially contradicts the theory's emphasis on actuator dynamics as a primary transfer factor, suggesting that for coordination-heavy tasks, behavioral/semantic alignment may be more critical than actuator fidelity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.7" class="evidence-link">[e1955.7]</a> </li>
    <li>ExoStart dynamics filtering shows that control-rate mismatch (200Hz simulation vs 20Hz deployment) caused behavior cloning to fail completely, indicating that temporal characteristics of the control loop are critical. While the theory includes bandwidth in its parameter list, it doesn't clearly distinguish actuator response bandwidth from control update frequency, and this evidence suggests control-loop frequency matching may be a separate critical requirement not fully captured by the actuator bandwidth parameter. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1974.html#e1974.2" class="evidence-link">[e1974.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>ExoStart/BulbInstall demonstrates that contact model fidelity (preventing penetration in tight insertions) can be more critical than actuator dynamics fidelity, with MuJoCo soft-contact allowing exploits that destroy transfer despite domain randomization of actuator parameters. While the theory includes compliance in its parameter list, this evidence suggests that simulation contact model implementation (penetration tolerance, contact solver type) is a separate critical factor that should be explicitly addressed, particularly for precision assembly tasks requiring <1mm positioning accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1974.html#e1974.0" class="evidence-link">[e1974.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1974.html#e1974.1" class="evidence-link">[e1974.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple studies show that learned residual models (UAN, DexNDM joint-wise dynamics, JT-Perturb neural perturbations) often outperform explicit parameter identification for complex actuators. This suggests the theory should acknowledge that for actuators with complex nonlinear dynamics (harmonic drives, high-reduction gearboxes), data-driven learned models of critical dynamics may be more practical and effective than explicit parameter fidelity, while still maintaining the core concept of selective modeling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.0" class="evidence-link">[e1966.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1971.html#e1971.0" class="evidence-link">[e1971.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1921.html#e1921.0" class="evidence-link">[e1921.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DexNDM's requirement for object-loaded training data (vs free-hand) demonstrates that for contact-rich manipulation, actuator dynamics cannot be modeled independently of contact loads—the critical parameter set must include object-interaction effects. This suggests the theory should explicitly state that critical parameters must be evaluated and modeled under task-representative loading conditions, not in isolation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1971.html#e1971.0" class="evidence-link">[e1971.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1971.html#e1971.1" class="evidence-link">[e1971.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The 5x bandwidth rule is not directly tested in the evidence, and several studies show temporal characteristics (control rate, latency, delay) matter but don't clearly separate actuator bandwidth from control-loop frequency. The theory should clarify that 'bandwidth' encompasses both actuator mechanical/electrical response time and control update frequency, or should separate these into distinct parameters with separate thresholds. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1974.html#e1974.2" class="evidence-link">[e1974.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1949.html#e1949.0" class="evidence-link">[e1949.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1919.html#e1919.0" class="evidence-link">[e1919.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Evidence shows successful transfer with minimal actuator modeling for slow manipulation tasks (IKER, humanoid pick-and-place) and failures despite actuator modeling for perception-heavy tasks (BimanualPnP behavioral patterns). The theory should more explicitly specify its scope: actuator dynamics are critical for high-acceleration, high-gear-ratio, or athletic manipulation tasks, but may not be in the critical set for quasi-static manipulation (τ_task > 2s) or tasks where perceptual/behavioral factors dominate. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1954.html#e1954.0" class="evidence-link">[e1954.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.0" class="evidence-link">[e1955.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.3" class="evidence-link">[e1955.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1955.html#e1955.7" class="evidence-link">[e1955.7]</a> </li>
    <li>ROA (online adaptation) and DR baselines underperformed compared to explicit actuator modeling (UAN) for harmonic-drive arms, but the theory doesn't clearly address when online adaptation or domain randomization are sufficient alternatives to high-fidelity modeling. The theory should specify conditions under which domain randomization alone is sufficient (e.g., for actuators without strong nonlinearities) versus when explicit modeling or learned residuals are required. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.4" class="evidence-link">[e1966.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1966.html#e1966.3" class="evidence-link">[e1966.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Clarify the theory's scope by explicitly stating it applies primarily to tasks where actuator dynamics significantly affect task performance (high-acceleration, high-gear-ratio, athletic manipulation, or tasks with τ_task < 1s). For quasi-static manipulation (τ_task > 2s) with large tolerances (>5mm), actuator dynamics may not be in the critical set, and perceptual/behavioral factors may dominate.</li>
                <li>Expand the bandwidth parameter definition to distinguish between (1) actuator mechanical/electrical response bandwidth and (2) control-loop update frequency, with separate thresholds: actuator bandwidth should exceed task frequency by 5x, AND control update frequency should match or exceed actuator bandwidth (or at minimum 10x task frequency).</li>
                <li>Add a theory statement acknowledging that for complex actuators with strong nonlinearities (harmonic drives, high-reduction gearboxes), data-driven learned models of critical dynamics (residual networks, joint-wise dynamics models) may be more practical and effective than explicit parameter identification, while still maintaining the selective fidelity principle.</li>
                <li>Modify the contact-rich task statement to specify that critical parameters must be evaluated and modeled under task-representative loading conditions (object-loaded data for manipulation, not free-hand), and that simulation contact model implementation (penetration tolerance, solver type) is a separate critical factor for precision tasks.</li>
                <li>Add a special case for precision assembly tasks requiring <1mm positioning accuracy: these tasks require both accurate actuator parameter modeling (backlash <0.2mm) AND high-fidelity contact model implementation (no penetration, accurate contact stiffness), with contact model fidelity being equally or more critical than actuator parameter fidelity.</li>
                <li>Revise the sufficiency claim to state that high-fidelity modeling of critical actuator parameters is necessary for tasks where actuator dynamics matter, but may not be sufficient—additional factors including contact model fidelity, control-rate matching, and perceptual/behavioral alignment may also be necessary depending on task characteristics.</li>
                <li>Add guidance on when domain randomization alone is sufficient versus when explicit modeling is required: domain randomization may suffice for actuators with relatively linear dynamics and low gear ratios, but explicit modeling or learned residuals are required for actuators with strong nonlinearities (hysteresis, stick-slip, high-reduction transmissions).</li>
