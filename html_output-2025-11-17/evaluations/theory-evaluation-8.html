                <p><strong>Overall Support or Contradict Explanation:</strong> The new evidence strongly supports the core theory, with extensive examples of computational-only validation, validation cascades, multifidelity gap-reduction approaches, and domain-dependent proxy quality. AlphaFold remains a notable exception in a mature physics-based domain with abundant training data, and some successful translations exist but are framed as noteworthy achievements, confirming systematic proxy-to-ground-truth gaps across most discovery domains as predicted by the theory.</p>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multiple computational-only studies with no experimental validation: Oyedara AcrB efflux pump study (71 phytochemicals, 3 candidates, 0 validated), Ahmed LpxC inhibitors (3 candidates, 0 validated), Elbaramawi MetRS study (computational only), Aurora B ML repurposing (computational only), AutoPepVax (computational only), PTML and HINT/SPOT frameworks (no quantitative experimental validation in review). This supports the theory's prediction about economic incentives to defer ground-truth validation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.2" class="evidence-link">[e1875.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.5" class="evidence-link">[e1875.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.4" class="evidence-link">[e1875.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.4" class="evidence-link">[e1874.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.3" class="evidence-link">[e1874.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.10" class="evidence-link">[e1876.10]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.8" class="evidence-link">[e1876.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Studies showing validation cascades with proxy→ground-truth stages: Benzoquinazoline study (docking+MD→in vitro XTT assay, 60% improvement vs antibiotics), Coumarin study (docking→broth microdilution+checkerboard synergy), Medicinal plants AcrAB-TolC (docking→microdilution+biofilm assay), Halicin (neural network→in vitro→in vivo), BenevolentAI baricitinib (ML→in vitro→clinical), Insilico Mpro (generative ML→synthesis→biochemical assays). These demonstrate the multi-stage validation pattern predicted by the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.0" class="evidence-link">[e1875.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.1" class="evidence-link">[e1875.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.3" class="evidence-link">[e1875.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.1" class="evidence-link">[e1877.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.2" class="evidence-link">[e1877.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.0" class="evidence-link">[e1877.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multifidelity and proxy-bias correction approaches explicitly addressing the gap: Buterez GNN transfer learning integrating low-fidelity HTS with high-fidelity confirmatory assays, Chemprop logP model trained to emulate QM calculations (MAE 0.34-0.44 log units vs QM reference), Rufa hybrid ML/MM reducing RMSE from 0.97 to 0.47 kcal/mol (still leaving significant error). These support the theory's prediction that multifidelity approaches can reduce but not eliminate gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1878.html#e1878.0" class="evidence-link">[e1878.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.4" class="evidence-link">[e1877.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.3" class="evidence-link">[e1877.3]</a> </li>
    <li>GA-based reference compound optimization study explicitly demonstrates that ML models show 'markedly lower' predictive performance (AUC, F1, accuracy) on GA-optimized diverse test sets versus random test sets, illustrating how proxy evaluation metrics can be optimistic when test sets don't reflect true diversity/difficulty. This directly supports the theory's claim about systematic bias in proxy evaluation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1872.html#e1872.0" class="evidence-link">[e1872.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1872.html#e1872.1" class="evidence-link">[e1872.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple mentions of computational tools and frameworks (DeepChem, DeepTox, ORGANIC, DeltaVina, admetSAR, etc.) with review cautioning about 'lack of standardized parameterization, false positives, false negatives, and complexity of clinical translation for AI/ML tools', supporting the theory's claims about proxy failure modes and the need for experimental validation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.7" class="evidence-link">[e1875.7]</a> </li>
    <li>MOBO-SPM study explicitly discusses proxy failure modes: phase reward weakness on samples lacking step edges (only ~3% of pixels contribute), tip-sample distance reward confounded by sample tilt, and similarity metric having narrow dynamic range. The study uses Pareto-front analysis to validate reward definitions, demonstrating the need for careful proxy design and validation even in real-time experimental systems. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.0" class="evidence-link">[e1871.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.1" class="evidence-link">[e1871.1]</a> </li>
    <li>AlphaFold quality assessment study explicitly identifies cases where AlphaFold predictions diverge from experimental structures and argues for hybrid computational-experimental validation, supporting the theory even in this mature physics-based domain. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.0" class="evidence-link">[e1874.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Medical imaging ML models (brain-age classifier 88-92% accuracy, COVID-Net 93.3% accuracy) are evaluated against dataset labels rather than prospective clinical outcomes, representing a proxy-to-ground-truth gap where computational performance on curated datasets may not reflect real-world clinical utility. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.1" class="evidence-link">[e1873.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.0" class="evidence-link">[e1873.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Successful computational→experimental translations (Halicin, baricitinib, DSP-1181, Vemurafenib) are highlighted as notable achievements and successes, suggesting they are exceptions rather than the norm. This implicitly supports the theory by framing successful translations as noteworthy rather than routine, though the evidence doesn't quantify false positive rates or overall success rates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.1" class="evidence-link">[e1877.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.2" class="evidence-link">[e1877.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.1" class="evidence-link">[e1876.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.9" class="evidence-link">[e1877.9]</a> </li>
    <li>Network pharmacology study (Nigella sativa) and in silico→experimental antimicrobial pipeline show computational target/pathway prediction followed by experimental validation, demonstrating the validation cascade but without quantitative gap measurements or false positive rates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.2" class="evidence-link">[e1874.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.1" class="evidence-link">[e1874.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification and confidence scoring emerging in some systems (AlphaFold 3 per-residue confidence, MOBO-SPM Gaussian process uncertainty, COVID-Net GSInquire auditing, QSAR conformal prediction) support the theory's emphasis on uncertainty quantification for managing proxy-to-ground-truth gaps, though calibration statistics are not always provided. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.2" class="evidence-link">[e1873.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.0" class="evidence-link">[e1871.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.0" class="evidence-link">[e1873.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.9" class="evidence-link">[e1876.9]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AlphaFold and AlphaFold 3 continue to be described as achieving 'high accuracy' and being 'transformative in structural biology', representing a domain where the proxy-to-ground-truth gap is small despite being purely computational. However, even quality assessment studies note some failures, and the domain has mature physics-based foundations (first-principles quantum mechanics and extensive experimental training data), which the theory predicts should show smaller gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.0" class="evidence-link">[e1876.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.2" class="evidence-link">[e1873.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.0" class="evidence-link">[e1874.0]</a> </li>
    <li>ChemBERTa/ProtBert transformer embeddings show 2-4% ROC-AUC improvement over fingerprint baselines and AUC=0.973 for DTI prediction on benchmarks, suggesting that advanced ML representations can achieve high proxy performance. However, no experimental validation gap is measured, and performance is on computational benchmarks rather than prospective experimental validation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1878.html#e1878.5" class="evidence-link">[e1878.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Domain-specific factors strongly influence proxy quality and gap size: protein structure prediction (AlphaFold) shows small gaps with mature physics-based modeling and abundant training data, while drug activity prediction and antimicrobial discovery show larger gaps with less mature proxies. The theory could be strengthened by more explicit domain categorization with predicted gap ranges: (1) mature physics-based domains (protein structure, molecular dynamics) 5-20% gaps, (2) semi-empirical domains (binding affinity, ADMET) 20-50% gaps, (3) complex phenotypic domains (drug activity, clinical outcomes) 40-80% gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.0" class="evidence-link">[e1876.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.2" class="evidence-link">[e1873.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1874.html#e1874.0" class="evidence-link">[e1874.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.0" class="evidence-link">[e1875.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.1" class="evidence-link">[e1875.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.2" class="evidence-link">[e1875.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.1" class="evidence-link">[e1877.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.2" class="evidence-link">[e1877.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multifidelity approaches are more diverse than initially characterized: (a) computational emulation of higher-fidelity computation (Chemprop→QM), (b) integration of experimental data at multiple fidelities (Buterez HTS→confirmatory), (c) real-time experimental feedback loops (MOBO-SPM). The theory could distinguish between these multifidelity strategies and their different gap-reduction mechanisms and effectiveness. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.4" class="evidence-link">[e1877.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1878.html#e1878.0" class="evidence-link">[e1878.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.0" class="evidence-link">[e1871.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Validation cascade complexity varies significantly across domains: some have simple two-stage cascades (computational→experimental), while others involve multi-stage cascades (computational→in vitro→in vivo→clinical). The theory could be enhanced by characterizing cascade depth and cumulative error propagation or filtering at each stage. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.1" class="evidence-link">[e1877.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.2" class="evidence-link">[e1877.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.0" class="evidence-link">[e1877.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.9" class="evidence-link">[e1877.9]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.0" class="evidence-link">[e1875.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.1" class="evidence-link">[e1875.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Ultra-large library screening (Lyu docking of billions of compounds, V-SYNTHES reducing 11 billion to 2 million, AI-Accelerated VS of multi-billion libraries) represents a scale regime where proxy evaluation is essentially mandatory due to experimental infeasibility. This creates a distinct category where the proxy-to-ground-truth gap is accepted as unavoidable and managed through prioritization strategies rather than gap elimination. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.5" class="evidence-link">[e1877.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.3" class="evidence-link">[e1876.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.4" class="evidence-link">[e1876.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Generative chemistry tools (ORGANIC, MolFilterGAN, RAscore, DiffDock) introduce 'meta-proxies': synthetic feasibility and drug-likeness scores that gate experimental validation. The theory could be extended to include these meta-proxies that filter computational predictions before experimental testing, creating an additional layer in the validation cascade. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.7" class="evidence-link">[e1877.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1878.html#e1878.4" class="evidence-link">[e1878.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1875.html#e1875.7" class="evidence-link">[e1875.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification maturity varies across domains and may affect gap management: domains with mature UQ practices (AlphaFold confidence scores, MOBO Gaussian processes, conformal prediction in QSAR) may show better gap management even if raw gap size remains large. The theory could incorporate UQ maturity as a factor affecting how well gaps can be characterized and managed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1873.html#e1873.2" class="evidence-link">[e1873.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.0" class="evidence-link">[e1871.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.9" class="evidence-link">[e1876.9]</a> </li>
    <li>Some studies explicitly design proxies to be interpretable and chemically grounded (Akabayov RNA ML using chemically interpretable descriptors, PTML using perturbation theory concepts), suggesting that proxy design philosophy (interpretability, chemical grounding, theoretical foundation) may influence gap size beyond just physical grounding and domain maturity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1877.html#e1877.6" class="evidence-link">[e1877.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1876.html#e1876.10" class="evidence-link">[e1876.10]</a> </li>
    <li>MOBO-SPM demonstrates real-time experimental validation integrated with computational optimization, where proxy rewards are computed from measured data and validated against full experimental scans. This represents a paradigm where the proxy-ground-truth loop is tightened through continuous experimental feedback, potentially reducing cumulative gap effects compared to batch computational→experimental workflows. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.0" class="evidence-link">[e1871.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1871.html#e1871.1" class="evidence-link">[e1871.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add explicit domain categorization with predicted gap ranges: (1) mature physics-based domains (protein structure, molecular dynamics) with 5-20% gaps due to first-principles grounding and abundant training data, (2) semi-empirical domains (binding affinity, ADMET) with 20-50% gaps, (3) complex phenotypic domains (drug activity, clinical outcomes) with 40-80% gaps due to emergent phenomena and limited mechanistic understanding.</li>
                <li>Distinguish between multifidelity strategy types with different gap-reduction mechanisms: (a) computational emulation of higher-fidelity computation (e.g., ML→QM), (b) integration of experimental data at multiple fidelities (e.g., HTS→confirmatory assays), (c) real-time experimental feedback loops (e.g., autonomous labs), each with different effectiveness and applicability.</li>
                <li>Incorporate uncertainty quantification maturity as a factor affecting gap management: domains with mature UQ practices (confidence scores, conformal prediction, Bayesian approaches) can better characterize and manage gaps even if raw gap size remains large, enabling more informed experimental prioritization.</li>
                <li>Add 'meta-proxy' concept: synthetic feasibility, drug-likeness, and other filtering proxies that gate experimental validation represent a distinct proxy type that affects which computational predictions reach experimental testing, creating an additional validation cascade layer.</li>
                <li>Characterize validation cascade depth and cumulative effects: distinguish between simple two-stage cascades and complex multi-stage cascades (computational→in vitro→in vivo→clinical), with predictions about whether errors accumulate, cancel, or are filtered at each stage.</li>
                <li>Add special case for ultra-large library screening: when experimental validation of all candidates is infeasible (billions of compounds), proxy evaluation becomes mandatory and the focus shifts from gap elimination to prioritization strategies that maximize hit rate within experimentally feasible validation budgets.</li>
                <li>Refine the 'economic incentive' mechanism: evidence shows computational-only studies are common, but successful translations are highlighted as notable achievements, suggesting the incentive structure involves both cost deferral and risk aversion (avoiding experimental validation of uncertain predictions), with publication incentives potentially favoring computational-only work.</li>
                <li>Add proxy design philosophy as a factor: interpretability, chemical grounding, and theoretical foundation of proxy design (beyond just physical grounding) may influence gap size and the ability to diagnose and correct proxy failures.</li>
