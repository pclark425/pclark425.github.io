            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The fitness supremum model demonstrates that randomly sampled programs of larger size have worse expected fitness (higher RSE), providing theoretical grounding for the theory's claim that excessive bloat reduces executability and evaluation efficiency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.1" class="evidence-link">[e1983.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Linear genome representation shows specific bloat dynamics with structural introns that differ from tree-based representations, confirming the theory's statement that 'The relationship between bloat and these outcomes is representation-dependent, with tree-based representations showing stronger bloat effects than linear genomes.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.0" class="evidence-link">[e1983.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.2" class="evidence-link">[e1983.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The recommendation to initialize with small programs demonstrates that bloat control timing matters for search effectiveness, supporting the theory's emphasis on adaptive and appropriately-timed bloat management strategies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.3" class="evidence-link">[e1983.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Introns (neutral code) are shown to protect useful exon code and facilitate building block reuse via register values, supporting the theory's claim that 'bloat can protect functional code segments from disruption, serving a functional role beyond neutral variation.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.0" class="evidence-link">[e1983.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.2" class="evidence-link">[e1983.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Mutation-only freemut operator produces bloat even with balanced 50/50 add/remove rates, confirming the theory's acknowledgment (in conflicting evidence) that mutation-only systems can produce bloat, though typically less than crossover-based systems. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.0" class="evidence-link">[e1983.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Neutral bloating factors (Ω) grow exponentially with added instructions, quantitatively showing that neutral variation increases with program size. While this supports the theory's claim that bloat provides neutral variation space, the new evidence doesn't directly measure population diversity metrics to confirm the bloat-diversity relationship. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.2" class="evidence-link">[e1983.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-instruction mutation with moderate step sizes (u=3-9) improves search performance by increasing constructive move probability, partially supporting the theory's emphasis on operator design for balancing bloat control with search effectiveness, though the specific mechanism (mutation step size) is not explicitly covered in the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.0" class="evidence-link">[e1983.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.3" class="evidence-link">[e1983.3]</a> </li>

<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The fitness supremum model based on editing distance provides a complementary theoretical framework for understanding why bloat emerges (additions more likely to reduce editing distance than deletions), which could be integrated alongside the building-block protection narrative to provide a more complete mechanistic understanding at multiple levels of analysis. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.1" class="evidence-link">[e1983.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The exponential growth of neutral bloating factors with program size provides quantitative bounds (Lemmas 3 and 4) that could inform more precise predictions about when bloat will be beneficial versus harmful, potentially allowing the theory's adaptive bloat control recommendations to be made more mathematically rigorous. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.2" class="evidence-link">[e1983.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-instruction mutation step size affects the bloat-executability trade-off by changing constructive move probability, suggesting the theory could be extended to explicitly consider mutation step size (or more generally, operator 'strength') as a factor in bloat dynamics alongside operator type (crossover vs. mutation). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.0" class="evidence-link">[e1983.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1983.html#e1983.3" class="evidence-link">[e1983.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add editing distance dynamics as a complementary theoretical mechanism: bloat emerges because additions are more likely than deletions to reduce editing distance to optima, creating local selection pressure for growth even with balanced operator rates.</li>
                <li>Extend the theory to explicitly discuss mutation step size (or operator strength more generally) as a factor affecting bloat dynamics and the bloat-executability trade-off.</li>
                <li>Incorporate quantitative theoretical bounds (neutral and non-neutral bloating factors) as a framework for making more precise predictions about optimal bloat levels in different contexts.</li>
                <li>Expand the discussion of linear genome bloat dynamics to include register-based building block reuse and the specific role of structural introns in protecting exons while maintaining identifiability.</li>
                <li>Add a theory statement about initialization strategy: starting with small programs reduces expected editing distance to optima and improves search effectiveness, though long-term bloat may still emerge from operator dynamics.</li>
