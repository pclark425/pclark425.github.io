                <p><strong>Overall Support or Contradict Explanation:</strong> The evidence strongly supports the core insight that vision-language pretraining facilitates transfer to embodied tasks through semantic grounding, with consistent demonstrations of improved performance, sample efficiency, and action grounding across dozens of models. However, the theory requires refinement to: (1) broaden from 'text-world' to multimodal pretraining, (2) incorporate geometric information as complementary to semantic grounding, (3) account for the need for explicit grounding stages, and (4) acknowledge the fragility of pretrained representations during adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Theory Evaluation (Components)</h2>

            <h3>Fully Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Vision-language pretraining consistently improves manipulation performance and sample efficiency. RT-2 achieves high success with web-scale knowledge transfer, OpenVLA+ shows 78.46% vs 35.03% baseline, AcTOL achieves 42.6% vs 11.7% for CLIP at 5 demos, and LaVA-Man demonstrates improved few-shot learning. This directly supports the theory's claim that language pretraining facilitates transfer. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1934.html#e1934.0" class="evidence-link">[e1934.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1907.html#e1907.0" class="evidence-link">[e1907.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Semantic alignment between pretraining and target tasks correlates with performance. Models show better results when object categories and action verbs overlap with pretraining distributions (LYRA skill learning, T-Rex toolkit selection, multiple VLA evaluations). This supports the theory's prediction that transfer effectiveness depends on semantic overlap. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1911.html#e1911.0" class="evidence-link">[e1911.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1901.html#e1901.0" class="evidence-link">[e1901.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1934.html#e1934.0" class="evidence-link">[e1934.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1970.html#e1970.1" class="evidence-link">[e1970.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Action grounding evidence demonstrates language maps to spatial affordances and motor outputs. FSD generates visual traces from language instructions, HAMSTER produces 2D end-effector trajectories, Gondola creates per-view segmentation masks, and AcTOL shows language-conditioned dense rewards accurately localize action boundaries. This supports Action-Perception Binding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1920.html#e1920.0" class="evidence-link">[e1920.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1928.html#e1928.1" class="evidence-link">[e1928.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1916.html#e1916.0" class="evidence-link">[e1916.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Embedding space analyses show semantic organization consistent with attractor basins. OpenVLA+ t-SNE visualizations show tighter, more separable clusters after preservation training, AcTOL shows improved temporal continuity and semantic clustering, and multiple models demonstrate that semantically similar concepts cluster together in joint embedding spaces. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1952.html#e1952.3" class="evidence-link">[e1952.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1907.html#e1907.2" class="evidence-link">[e1907.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Language conditioning guides attention and feature selection toward task-relevant regions. ReFineVLA shows broader contextual attention with language, attention mechanisms in vision-language models focus on semantically relevant regions, and ablations removing language features consistently degrade performance on semantic tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1970.html#e1970.1" class="evidence-link">[e1970.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1920.html#e1920.0" class="evidence-link">[e1920.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1901.html#e1901.0" class="evidence-link">[e1901.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Partially Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Hierarchical processing exists but is primarily implemented through architectural design rather than emergent from language structure. Models separate high-level planning (VLM) from low-level control (action experts), and this separation improves performance, but it's engineered rather than arising automatically from language scaffolding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1928.html#e1928.1" class="evidence-link">[e1928.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1904.html#e1904.0" class="evidence-link">[e1904.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1939.html#e1939.0" class="evidence-link">[e1939.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1913.html#e1913.0" class="evidence-link">[e1913.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1924.html#e1924.0" class="evidence-link">[e1924.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Transfer effectiveness depends on semantic overlap but also critically requires geometric/spatial information. Models incorporating 3D point clouds (FP3), depth (DepthVLA), or explicit spatial representations (VLMaps) often achieve better performance, suggesting semantic grounding is necessary but not sufficient. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1912.html#e1912.0" class="evidence-link">[e1912.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1924.html#e1924.0" class="evidence-link">[e1924.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1945.html#e1945.0" class="evidence-link">[e1945.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1952.html#e1952.0" class="evidence-link">[e1952.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory's prediction about perceptual modality providing sufficient information to activate semantic attractors is partially supported but requires qualification. Models often need explicit grounding stages (OE-VLA Stage-1, Vlaser grounding data) to bridge web pretraining and embodied domains, suggesting automatic activation is limited. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1935.html#e1935.0" class="evidence-link">[e1935.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1930.html#e1930.3" class="evidence-link">[e1930.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1922.html#e1922.1" class="evidence-link">[e1922.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1910.html#e1910.0" class="evidence-link">[e1910.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Sample complexity gains are observed but depend on multiple factors beyond semantic alignment: geometric information, action discretization, temporal structure, and preservation strategies during adaptation. The theory's formula captures the general trend but oversimplifies the mechanisms. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1912.html#e1912.0" class="evidence-link">[e1912.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1939.html#e1939.0" class="evidence-link">[e1939.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1935.html#e1935.0" class="evidence-link">[e1935.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Fully Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<p class="empty-note">No evidence provided.</p>            <h3>Partially Contradicting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory's emphasis on 'text-world' pretraining doesn't match actual practice. Successful models use vision-language pretraining on image-text pairs (CLIP-style) rather than pure text worlds. While this may be a terminology issue, the theory's framing around 'text-world entities' suggests a focus on linguistic representations that doesn't capture the multimodal nature of effective pretraining. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1934.html#e1934.0" class="evidence-link">[e1934.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.0" class="evidence-link">[e1906.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1952.html#e1952.3" class="evidence-link">[e1952.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1930.html#e1930.1" class="evidence-link">[e1930.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Pretrained semantic structures are more fragile than the theory's 'attractor basin' metaphor suggests. OpenVLA+ requires careful preservation strategies (frozen encoders, string tokenization, co-training) to avoid representation collapse during fine-tuning. Naive adaptation disrupts pretrained features, contradicting the notion of stable attractors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.3" class="evidence-link">[e1906.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1935.html#e1935.0" class="evidence-link">[e1935.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory underspecifies critical modalities beyond vision and language. Tactile information (TLA), depth (DepthVLA), 3D geometry (FP3), audio (AVLMaps), and temporal dynamics (AcTOL, GR-1) all provide essential grounding that language-vision alignment alone cannot supply. The theory's scope is too narrow. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1934.html#e1934.7" class="evidence-link">[e1934.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1924.html#e1924.0" class="evidence-link">[e1924.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1912.html#e1912.0" class="evidence-link">[e1912.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1952.html#e1952.4" class="evidence-link">[e1952.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1913.html#e1913.3" class="evidence-link">[e1913.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory's claim that hierarchical language structure provides scaffolding for perceptual features lacks direct empirical support. While hierarchical processing improves performance, it's achieved through architectural design (separate planning and control modules) rather than emergent organization from language structure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1928.html#e1928.1" class="evidence-link">[e1928.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1939.html#e1939.0" class="evidence-link">[e1939.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1913.html#e1913.0" class="evidence-link">[e1913.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1904.html#e1904.0" class="evidence-link">[e1904.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Potentially Modifying Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory should explicitly incorporate multimodal pretraining beyond text-vision. Successful models integrate depth prediction (DepthVLA, QDepth-VLA), 3D point clouds (FP3), tactile signals (TLA), audio (AVLMaps), and temporal dynamics (AcTOL). The 'text-world' framing should be expanded to 'multimodal pretraining with language grounding.' <a href="../results/extraction-result-1912.html#e1912.0" class="evidence-link">[e1912.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1924.html#e1924.0" class="evidence-link">[e1924.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1945.html#e1945.0" class="evidence-link">[e1945.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1934.html#e1934.7" class="evidence-link">[e1934.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1952.html#e1952.4" class="evidence-link">[e1952.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory should incorporate explicit grounding stages as a necessary component rather than assuming automatic transfer. Multiple models require intermediate grounding tasks (OE-VLA Stage-1, Vlaser grounding datasets, RoboFAC fine-tuning) to bridge web pretraining and embodied domains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1935.html#e1935.0" class="evidence-link">[e1935.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1930.html#e1930.3" class="evidence-link">[e1930.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1922.html#e1922.1" class="evidence-link">[e1922.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1910.html#e1910.0" class="evidence-link">[e1910.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The 'semantic attractor basin' concept should be refined to account for fragility during adaptation. Evidence shows pretrained representations require careful preservation (freezing strategies, LoRA, regularization) to maintain their structure during fine-tuning, suggesting attractors are more fragile than the theory implies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.3" class="evidence-link">[e1906.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1935.html#e1935.0" class="evidence-link">[e1935.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1939.html#e1939.0" class="evidence-link">[e1939.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The hierarchical feature alignment mechanism should distinguish between architectural hierarchy (engineered separation of planning and control) and representational hierarchy (emergent from language structure). Evidence primarily supports the former, suggesting the theory should focus on how language enables modular architectural design. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1928.html#e1928.1" class="evidence-link">[e1928.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1939.html#e1939.0" class="evidence-link">[e1939.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1913.html#e1913.0" class="evidence-link">[e1913.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1904.html#e1904.0" class="evidence-link">[e1904.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1924.html#e1924.0" class="evidence-link">[e1924.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The sample complexity formula should be expanded to account for: (1) geometric information availability, (2) action space discretization quality, (3) temporal structure preservation, (4) adaptation strategy effectiveness, and (5) domain gap magnitude. Current formula is too simplified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1912.html#e1912.0" class="evidence-link">[e1912.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1906.html#e1906.2" class="evidence-link">[e1906.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1902.html#e1902.0" class="evidence-link">[e1902.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1939.html#e1939.0" class="evidence-link">[e1939.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1935.html#e1935.0" class="evidence-link">[e1935.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory should add boundary conditions specifying when language grounding is most vs. least effective: strongest for object-centric manipulation with semantic overlap, weaker for fine-grained motor control, dynamics-heavy tasks, contact-rich manipulation, or tasks requiring modalities absent from pretraining. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1912.html#e1912.0" class="evidence-link">[e1912.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1934.html#e1934.7" class="evidence-link">[e1934.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1913.html#e1913.3" class="evidence-link">[e1913.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1924.html#e1924.0" class="evidence-link">[e1924.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Suggested Revisions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Replace 'text-world pretraining' with 'multimodal vision-language pretraining' to accurately reflect that successful models use image-text pairs, often augmented with depth, 3D, temporal, or other modalities</li>
                <li>Add explicit role for geometric information (depth, 3D point clouds, spatial maps) as a complementary grounding mechanism that works synergistically with semantic information</li>
                <li>Incorporate intermediate grounding stages as a necessary component: models require domain adaptation tasks (grounding datasets, Stage-1 training) to bridge web pretraining and embodied tasks</li>
                <li>Refine 'semantic attractor basin' concept to acknowledge fragility: attractors exist but require careful preservation during adaptation (freezing, regularization, specialized tokenization)</li>
                <li>Distinguish architectural hierarchy (engineered separation of VLM planning and action control) from representational hierarchy (emergent feature organization), with evidence primarily supporting the former</li>
                <li>Expand the sample complexity formula to: ΔN ∝ log(D_original/D_semantic) × α_alignment × β_geometric × γ_preservation × δ_temporal, where additional terms capture geometric information, preservation strategy quality, and temporal structure</li>
                <li>Add boundary conditions: theory applies best to object-centric manipulation with semantic overlap; less applicable to fine-grained motor control, dynamics-heavy tasks, contact-rich manipulation requiring tactile feedback, or tasks involving modalities absent from pretraining</li>
                <li>Modify transfer condition (c) from 'perceptual modality provides sufficient information' to 'perceptual modality provides sufficient information AND explicit grounding stages bridge domain gaps'</li>
                <li>Add new theory statement: 'Pretrained semantic structures are fragile and require preservation strategies (selective freezing, regularization, specialized adaptation) to maintain their organization during task-specific fine-tuning'</li>
