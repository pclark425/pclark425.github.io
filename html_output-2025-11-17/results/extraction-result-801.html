                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Recently, text world games have been proposed to enable artificial agents to understand and reason about real-world scenarios. These text-based games are challenging for artificial agents, as it requires an understanding of and interaction using natural language in a partially observable environment. Agents observe the environment via textual descriptions designed to be challenging enough for even human players. Past approaches have not paid enough attention to the language understanding capability of the proposed agents. Typically, these approaches train from scratch, an agent that learns both textual representations and the gameplay online during training using a temporal loss function. Given the sample-inefficiency of RL approaches, it is inefficient to learn rich enough textual representations to be able to understand and reason using the textual observation in such a complicated game environment setting. In this paper, we improve the semantic understanding of the agent by proposing a simple RL with LM framework where we use transformer-based language models with Deep RL models. We perform a detailed study of our framework to demonstrate how our model outperforms all existing agents on the popular game, Zork1, to achieve a score of 44.7, which is 1.6 higher than the state-of-the-art model. Overall, our proposed approach outperforms 4 games out of the 14 text-based games, while performing comparable to the state-of-the-art models on the remaining games.</p>

<p>Pre-trained Language Models as Prior Knowledge for Playing Text-based Games</p>
<p>Recently, text world games have been proposed to enable artificial agents to understand and reason about real-world scenarios. These text-based games are challenging for artificial agents, as it requires an understanding of and interaction using natural language in a partially observable environment. Agents observe the environment via textual descriptions designed to be challenging enough for even human players. Past approaches have not paid enough attention to the language understanding capability of the proposed agents. Typically, these approaches train from scratch, an agent that learns both textual representations and the gameplay online during training using a temporal loss function. Given the sampleinefficiency of RL approaches, it is inefficient to learn rich enough textual representations to be able to understand and reason using the textual observation in such a complicated game environment setting. In this paper, we improve the semantic understanding of the agent by proposing a simple RL with LM framework where we use transformer-based language models with Deep RL models. We perform a detailed study of our framework to demonstrate how our model outperforms all existing agents on the popular game, Zork1, to achieve a score of 44.7, which is 1.6 higher than the state-of-theart model. Overall, our proposed approach outperforms 4 games out of the 14 text-based games, while performing comparable to the state-of-the-art models on the remaining games.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Artificial autonomous agents suffer from a number of challenges during training, such as reward, goal, or task under-specification(s). Most approaches design a specific reward function for a given environment and task, which is not generalizable to any other setting. The reward specification gets more complicated with complex environments and tasks. Most agents are trained to do specific tasks or achieve specific goals, as there are not many efficient ways for specifying multiple or complex goals for a given agent. In this scenario, being able to utilize language as an interface between a user and an artificial agent simplifies a number of these challenges. A setting where an agent understands and communicates using natural language is more efficient for rewarding the agent online or via a text description, as opposed to using an expert-designed reward function. Moreover, it is easier to specify complicated tasks or instructions for the agent via the natural language.</p>
<p>Text-based Interactive Fiction (IF) [7] games provide such an environment where the agent learns to consume and produce natural language-based inputs and outputs. IF games require an artificial agent to learn policies and operate in a real-world environment created using natural language. These games are designed such that a player receives a textual observation consisting of information about the environment such as a description of the surroundings, objects available for interaction, and states of objects. Based on this information, the player takes an action such as interacting with one of the objects, moving around. etc. A short example of a game-play is shown in Figure 1. The textual setting of the games in terms of the observations given to and the actions taken by the agent requires solid language understanding and reasoning. Such a setting has been promoted to develop essential skills required by intelligent agents for various real-life use-cases, including dialogue systems and personal digital assistants. IF games, such as Zork1, have been created to be challenging for human players and consist of texts with dramatic and artful narratives. The game engine, in the case of IF games, generates human-level sophistication and diversity in textual descriptions (as can be seen in the example in Figure  1) in contrast to games using template-generated synthetic texts. Consequently, such games provide an ideal test-bed for artificial agents that interact with the real-world environment using natural language. Given the setting, agents trained using IF games can be deployed in real-world user-centered robotics applications.</p>
<p>IF games present several challenges for artificial agents as these cover the real world settings. It requires an agent to understand the textual state description, handle combinatorial textual action space, and learn a policy in a partially observable environment to maximize the game score. The key challenge is to decipher the long textual observations, extract reward cues from them, and generate a semantically rich representation such that the policy learned on top of it is well informed. Most of the existing works learn textual representations from scratch during the RL training [1,2,7,[23][24][25], except [6] which uses pre-trained GloVe embeddings [14]. Online reinforcement learning is known to be sample-inefficient [19]. The reward-based temporal difference objective used for training is proposed for learning the gameplay, and it does not necessarily reinforce the agent to learn the semantics of the game. Therefore, learning textual representations solely from the game-generated text during online learning does not provide rich enough representation to be able to handle such complicated decision-making tasks. In addition, these games also need some prior knowledge about the functioning of the world to be able to make correct decisions efficiently. For example, as shown in Figure 1, if it is dark and the agent has a lantern, it should turn it on.</p>
<p>Given the requirements for IF games, we propose a pre-trained transformer-based [20] language model (LM) as a candidate for equipping the RL agent with both language understanding capabilities and real-world knowledge. Transformer-based LMs such as BERT [5], ALBERT [10], RoBERTa [11] have produced state-of-theart performance on a plethora of natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. The routine for using the transformer models includes arXiv:2107.08408v2 [cs.CL] 23 Dec 2021 with a great e ort, the rug is moved to one side of the room, revealing the dusty cover of a closed trap door Open case you are in the living room. there is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a large oriental rug in the center of the room. above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity. a battery powered brass lantern is on the trophy case. [ there is a doorway to the east, a wooden door with strange gothic lettering to the west, which appears to be nailed shut, a trophy case, and a closed trap door at your feet. above the trophy case hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity.] The aim is to solve puzzles and collect 19 treasures in the trophy case, but the agent is not aware of the goal and learns from rewards. Each white box is a state of the game at a step; the green and orange boxes are the action taken, and the reward received correspondingly. The state contains location if visible (underlined), current observation (black), inventory with the player (red), and the current location description (blue). In this example, location, inventory, and description are only mentioned when it changes, while the complete state information is provided to the agent during gameplay. This example shows how our model is able to perform better by learning to use the egg and the lantern in the correct way, as highlighted.</p>
<p>pre-training on large generic English corpora, followed by finetuning on a specific downstream task-specific corpus. Moreover, Petroni et al. [15] have shown that pre-trained LMs can act as knowledge bases containing relational and factual knowledge, comparable in utility with other NLP methods having access to oracle knowledge.</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a simple approach that performs better than previously proposed complex approaches. We deploy a pre-trained LM with the existing game agents, namely Deep Reinforcement Relevance Network (DRRN) [8] and Template-Deep Q-Network (TDQN) [7], used in the recently proposed Jericho IF game-suite [7]. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize pre-trained LMs for IF games. We use DistilBERT [17] (hereafter referred to as DBERT) as the LM owing to its compact size, thereby computing rich text encoding efficiently. We fine-tune DBERT on an independent set of human gameplay transcripts to add a game sense to the pre-trained LM. This set of transcripts contain games other than those in the evaluation game-suite to test the generalizability of the proposed approach. We test both DBERT-DRRN and DBERT-TDQN setup on Zork1, and additionally, we also evaluate DBERT-DRRN on a set of other games from Jericho to test the generalization capability of the model. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on 4 out of 14 games while getting comparable performance on others relative to the past approaches (section 2) utilizing sophisticated attention models and knowledge graphs, indicating that pre-trained LMs could be employed as a key component in text-based reinforcement learning models. We release the implementation code via GitHub 1 . The transcripts (generated when the agent is playing the game) is included in the appendix.</p>
<p>RELATED WORK</p>
<p>Recently, there have been attempts to model real world settings via text based environments. The TextWorld environment [4] proposes procedurally generated interactive fiction games, with control over difficulty, and description language. Recently, Hausknecht et al. [7] proposed a learning environment (Jericho) that supports a set of 32 human-written IF games. These games are written to be challenging for human players, thereby providing a more realistic test-bed for training intelligent agents. [7] also present performance results for choice-based (DRRN) and parser-based (TDQN) agents (see section 3.2 for details), where the former performed better on average across most of the games. Jericho also provides certain handicaps such as action templates, determining valid actions by detecting world state change, commands to check current items with the agent (inventory) or in the current state (look). We propose models for solving the games in the Jericho environment.</p>
<p>Many of the recent approaches [1,2,23] use a dynamically updated Knowledge Graph (KG) to represent the current state of the universe (game). KG-A2C [1] is the first such proposal. One of the SOTA methods by Xu et al. [23], in addition to KG-A2C architecture, reasons on the KG using low and high-level attention on sub-components of the graph and on the complete graph, respectively, to compute a representation of the game state. Next, they select the actions via recurrent decoding using GRUs, conditioned on the computed game state representation. Similar to KG-A2C approach, they train the agent via the Advantage Actor Critic (A2C) method with a supervised auxiliary task of "valid action prediction" using the action templates handicap. Q * BERT [2] presents an open domain QA method to update the KG with more information and an additional intrinsic motivation reward to enable structured exploration. Our agent outperforms all the above agents without an explicit knowledge graph or any additional reward-based supervision or sophisticated reasoning. We show that better language understanding capabilities and appropriate utilization of the world knowledge in game-plays are comparable (and sometimes better) than using explicit KGs.</p>
<p>Multi-Paragraph Reading Comprehension Deep Q-Network [6] (MPRC-DQN) breaks down the problem into two challenges: the partial observability of the environment and large natural language action space. They solve the partial observability by object-centric retrieval of relevant past observations, and an attention mechanism is deployed to focus on the most relevant context. Template actions from Jericho are filled up in question answering (QA) format to generate candidate actions. In contrast, CALM [25] generates the next set of possible action by fine-tuning a GPT-2 model [16]. These actions, which are essentially a subset of valid actions, are then fed to a DRRN [8] agent to compute the Q-values. CALM asserts that the action generation model provides linguistic priors to the RL agent. However, since they do not send any feedback to the action generation model and the model only replaces the valid action set 1 https://github.com/Exploration-Lab/IFG-Pretrained-LM by its subset, the RL agent may not necessarily benefit from the linguistic priors. On the other hand, we extract representations from the pre-trained LM and feed them to the DRRN agent for incorporating linguistic priors. With a better observation understanding augmented with the world knowledge via the pre-trained LM, our model also solves the challenge of partial observability to some extent.</p>
<p>Yao et al. [24] investigate to what extent semantic information is utilized by the DRRN agent. They show that even in the complete absence of text, the "DRRN + valid action handicap" setup is able to achieve significant scores, indicating the underlying overfitting to the reward system and memorization tendency of DRRN. They use an inverse-dynamics loss function to regularize the DRRN representation space for improving the semantics.</p>
<p>Transformers [20] are a new class of feed-forward neural networks architectures that use a self-attention mechanism to effectively learn short/long-term relationships between tokens in the text. Transformers have been shown to have SOTA performance on almost all the NLP tasks [18,21]. Transformers are trained using language modeling objective and its variants (e.g., masked language modeling); based on the training objective a number of variants of transformer architectures have been proposed e.g., BERT [5], DistilBERT [17], ALBERT [10], RoBERTa [11]. There have been several transformer-based approaches for both text-based games and RL in general [3,9,12,22], but these approaches train a transformer from scratch, which is inefficient given that transformers are data-intensive and online RL is sample-inefficient. Xu et al. [22] and Parisotto et al. [12] modify the transformer structure to add gates and make it light-weight for online training, while Chen et al. [3] and Janner et al. [9] use a smaller transformer but only for offline learning. Using a pre-trained LM brings an additional set of linguistic priors and world knowledge to the RL agent, and in this paper, we propose a way to do so. We chose DistilBERT [17] for our framework. DistilBERT is a lighter and faster version of BERT trained by knowledge-distilling BERT base with masked language modeling on Toronto Book Corpus and Wikipedia, thus providing us a computationally efficient solution to integrate in the RL setup.</p>
<p>METHOD 3.1 Problem Statement</p>
<p>A text-based game can be formulated as a partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) defined by ( , , , , ). An agent interacts with the game environment to receive textual observations ∈ at the interaction step . The latent states ∈ correspond to along with player, item locations, and inventory contents. The agent interacts with the environment by executing an action ∈ that changes the game state according to a mostlydeterministic but latent transition function ( ′ | , ), and the agent receives rewards from an unknown reward function ( , ) defined by the game designers. The objective of an RL agent is to take a series of actions that maximize expected cumulative discounted rewards E ∞ = at any time . Value-based RL models estimate this reward by learning a Q-function, ( , ) i.e., the expected return when taking an action , given the observation . The problem statement presents several challenges for the agent: understanding long sophisticated textual state descriptions, extracting reward cues, handling combinatorial textual action space, reasoning-based decision-making, and learning a value function in a partially observable environment to maximize the game score.</p>
<p>RL Agents</p>
<p>We build our model on top of existing RL agents. We select the following two agents as these are base architectures [7] on which all other subsequent works build on. DRRN: Deep Reinforcement Relevance Network (DRRN) [7] uses four GRU encoders to encode the state and each of the actions from the valid action handicap, concatenate the representations, and pass it through an MLP layer to estimate the Q-values ( ( , )| =1... ), where ∈ A (valid action set). The next action is chosen by softmax sampling the predicted Q-values. The DRRN is trained using tuples ( , , , +1 ) sampled from a prioritized experience replay buffer with the traditional temporal difference (TD) loss:
L TD ( ) = + max ∈A ( +1 , ) − ( , ) 2
where represents the overall DRRN parameters, is the reward at -th time step, and is the discount factor. TDQN: Template Deep Q-Network (TDQN) [7] like DRRN uses GRU encoders to encode information that consists of the state and previous action in this case. It performs template-based action generation using three Q-values based on the observation : ( , ) for all action templates ∈ , ( , 1 ) and ( , 2 ) for all vocabulary ∈ . 1 , 2 fill-up the blanks in the template to generate candidate actions. The authors used a supervised binary-cross entropy loss to train the model for valid actions in addition to the TD loss.</p>
<p>Language Modeling (LM)</p>
<p>The textual modality of the IF games comes with additional challenges for an RL agent. Since the modality of the games is natural language, the modeling of the text-based observations and states becomes important, and this problem has not been explored in-depth in the RL research community. We employ DBERT [17] to address this in our model. We fine-tune DBERT to model the language of games. We take inspiration from one of the language modeling techniques, masked language modeling (MLM), used to pre-train DBERT. Given a pair of observation and action composed of tokens [CLS], 1 , 2 , ..., , [SEP], 1 , 2 , ..., , random tokens are masked by a special token, [MASK]. Here is the length of the observation, and is the length of the action. The masked tokens are predicted from the vocabulary of the model. For example, given sequence "[CLS] Yes, there is a diorama at one end of the [MASK], but you find yourself unable to [MASK] on it with that fascinating statue sitting in the middle of the room. Once you figure out how it moves, you'll be able to concentrate on the [MASK] parts of the room.</p>
<p>[SEP] remove boots", the correct predictions would be "room", "concentrate" and "other" respectively. A softmax activation function is used for masked token prediction. Cross entropy loss function is used to learn the parameters, i.e.,
= CrossEntropy * , ( [MASK] | )
where * is the ground truth, [MASK] is the predicted token, is the masked sentence, and ( [MASK] | ) is the predicted distribution over the vocabulary. This training enables DBERT to tune its prior knowledge in the language of games.</p>
<p>RL with Pre-trained LM</p>
<p>We use the fine-tuned DBERT to model the input for the requisite RL agent. We encode the state and the actions separately using DBERT and feed the representations to the respective GRUs in DRRN and TDQN agent. The agents are then trained as described in 3.2 (Figure 2a and 2b). In this way, the trained DBERT is able to transfer its prior knowledge about the world to different agents across different games. The agents, in turn, learn more informed policies on the top of DBERT optimized for specific games. We use a single instance of the trained DBERT and do not fine-tune DBERT further for specific games to keep the language model general and adaptable to any RL agent or game.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p>We evaluate how the addition of a pre-trained LM facilitates different agents and games. We also present ablation studies to demonstrate the need for training the pre-trained LM. Lastly, we present a study on how our model is able to achieve new state-of-the-art results on Zork1.</p>
<p>LM training</p>
<p>We use the ClubFloyd dataset [25] for fine-tuning DBERT. It is a collection of human game-play trajectories on 590 games. These are not the optimal trajectories, but it does impart a general gameplay sense. We pre-process this data to obtain around 217K pairs of observation and action, ( , ). The transcripts are from games not included in our evaluation (section 4.2) to keep our approach general. We use a 768-dimensional vanilla DBERT (base cased) model pre-trained on English Wikipedia and Toronto Book Corpus. We train this model for 2 epochs on pre-processed ClubFloyd dataset using the MLM technique.</p>
<p>RL Training</p>
<p>Jericho Environment: We evaluate our agent on 14 games with different difficulty levels 2 using the Jericho framework, and use the same Jericho handicaps as in the respective DRRN and TDQN baselines [7]. The states are observations ( ) concatenated with items in possession of the player and its current location description provided by the game engine using commands inventory and look. We also use valid actions and action templates for DBERT-DRRN and DBERT-TDQN respectively, following the baselines. A single game episode runs for 100 environment steps at max, or gets terminated before the game is over or won. Training Setup: We test our framework on two RL models: DRRN ( Figure 2a) and TDQN (Figure 2b). The GRUs used in the agents have an embedding dimension of 768 features and a hidden dimension of 128 features. Similar to [7,25] we collect interaction data for DBERT-DRRN and DBERT-TDQN on 8 parallel game environment instances and use a prioritized experience replay buffer to store trajectories with best scores. We sample transitions from this priority buffer with a priority fraction of 0.5, while taking the remaining training data from a general replay buffer. Most importantly, we train our agents for a maximum of 5×10 4 steps, which is less than half of the training steps used in most other baselines, and achieve SOTA and comparable scores on different games. Each training step makes an interaction with the environment in all 8 instances, therefore we only use half the amount of interaction data for training in comparison to the baselines. We use a softmax exploration policy and a learning rate of 10 −4 , along with other presets the same as the baseline. We report the average of scores on the last 100 finished episodes as the score on a game run. We train two independent runs for each model and game, and report the average of their scores as the final (raw) score, along with the average maximum score seen by the runs. The maximum seen scores are a measure of the exploration ability, while the raw scores are that of the learning ability of an agent. We report the learning curves for Zork1 in Figure 3.</p>
<p>RESULTS AND ANALYSIS</p>
<p>We performed a detailed analysis of our method. We present overall game-scores as compared to baseline models across a set of games. We also present an ablation study of our model done on Zork1, along with a semantic understanding analysis. Finally, to actually interpret the agent from inside beyond numbers, we also present a qualitative analysis of our model on Zork1 via a case study discussing the factors leading to higher score. Table 1 reports the final scores of our best performing model (trained DBERT with DRRN) in comparison with 7 existing baselines on 14 games. We report raw or maximum or both the scores as given in original papers. Different baselines achieve SOTA scores on different games. Our model achieves SOTA results on 4 games: Zork1, Inhumane, Snacktime, and Jewel, while being second best or comparable on most of the other games. We present the learning curves for Zork1, Inhumane, and Jewel in Figures 3, 4, and 5 respectively. INV-DY [24] uses additional loss objectives inspired from curiosity-driven exploration [13]. While it helps them achieve higher maximum scores on Zork1, but are not able to learn the high score trajectories. On the other hand, our agent efficiently learns the max score trajectories explored by it, thereby indicating that with a better exploration strategy our model has the potential to achieve better scores. None of the other agents, with a max score of 55, are able to stably reach a score as high as our model, that maintains a margin of 6.4 from the best model [6]. Our agent explores higher max score on Inhumane, but more importantly, it is able to learn the best-explored trajectories, thereby plateauing closer to the max scores for many games (Inhumane, Jewel, Omniquest, Zork1), indicating that the trained DBERT is an important learning component, and it also facilitates the exploration to some extent. We also report the normalized score (raw score as a factor of max possible score collected from human-written optimal walk-through) averaged across all games. We get an overall norm of 15.7%, followed by 14.2% achieved by MPRC-DQN [6]. Our model does not suffer a lot on any game, while the second best (MPRC-DQN) gets 0 scores on Inhumane and Snacktime, and notably higher scores on others (Ludicorp, Spirit, Zork3). It indicates both the generalization tendency and the necessity of the pre-trained LM deployed in our model. When compared to the average norm of 18.9% for INV-DY evaluated on 6 of the 14 games they reported, we get 21.1%. The average norm is also a measure of human-machine gap for textbased games, indicating that IF games are at best only 15.7% solved. Hence, it is a good benchmark for developing language understanding agents. We have included the learning curves for independent runs on Zork1 and its game transcripts in the Appendix. Table 1: Final (raw) and max scores seen by agents (available via prior work) comparing trained DBERT-DRRN with all the current SOTA baselines across a set of games from Jericho game-suite. For the baselines, we use the results reported in the original papers. The missing scores not in the previous work are denoted as '-'. Max denotes the maximum possible scores based on human-written optimal walkthroughs for winning the game without the step limit of 100. Note that our model (DBERT-DRRN) is trained for less than half of the training steps used in other baselines. Bold scores denote the best score, blue<em> scores denote the second best. DBERT-DRRN gets an avg. norm of 15.7% on all games, and 21.1% on 6 games reported for INV-DY. </em>the games with rising learning curve for DBERT-DRRN till the last training step. (possible/easy), (difficult), (extreme) refers to game difficulty level as given in [7]. </p>
<p>Overall Scores</p>
<p>DBERT Training Ablation</p>
<p>Our framework includes a DBERT trained on human trajectories from different games. This training induces a language acquaintance with games. We tested empirically how this affected the model. We obtain runs on both DRRN and TDQN based models for the vanilla DBERT and DBERT pretrained on games from ClubFloyd dataset. We present the results in Figure 3 where we see DRRN with pretrained DBERT outperforms DRRN with vanilla DBERT with a final score of 44.72 compared to 34.73. The TDQN based models do not exhibit much difference, but pretrained version still has a higher score of 10.35, whereas vanilla DBERT version of the framework obtains 9.85. It indicates the importance of acquainting the pre-trained LM with the game language, so that it can transfer its prior knowledge appropriately to the agents.</p>
<p>Semantic Understanding: Transfer</p>
<p>Yao et al. [24] show that "TD loss + valid action handicap" setup with mostly deterministic rewards can lead to overfitting and memorization, thus, hindering the actual goal of understanding and learning to operate in natural language. Therefore, we also test whether an agent trained for one game can transfer its learning to other similar games to see if the agent is learning the semantics or memorizing the trajectories. We train an agent on Zork1 and test it without any training on Zork3, as these are the two most similar games in the Jericho game-suite. The average episode score over 300 episodes was 0.06 for DBERT-DRRN and 0.007 for DRRN. These scores are not as high as achieved by training fresh agents on Zork3; however, DBERT-DRRN is able to transfer its knowledge better than DRRN.</p>
<p>Avoiding being eaten by a grue and thereafter</p>
<p>We compare scores over an episode for (vanilla and trained) DBERT-DRRN and DRRN. We sample 100 random episodes from the last few hundred episodes during the training, and plot the average scores over an episode in Figure 6. An episode is set to terminate after 100 steps or before (if the game is over or won). The goal in Zork1 is to collect 19 treasures in the trophy case, which agents are not aware of, and they learn via in-game rewards. Existing agents traverse the Forest for the Egg (1st treasure), followed by Kitchen, Cellar, and Gallery for the painting (next treasure), while solving various puzzle and escaping the grue. In DRRN, the agent gets to the Kitchen with a reward of +10 at around step-10 and then to the Cellar with a reward of +25 around step-15 as we can see in precious jewels, apparently scavenged by a childless songbird. the egg is covered with fine gold inlay,.. ". Ammanabrolu et al. [2] use an intrinsic motivation reward in addition to the rewards provided by the game engine, in order to get past when stuck in the game, i.e., when the observations do not change. This motivation also helps them provide rewards to add dependencies to their KG for the Egg. However, the LM in trained DBERT-DRRN guesses that the Egg is important without any extra supervision, and takes it around step-10, hence, achieving higher scores later on. Moreover, trained DBERT-DRRN avoids being eaten by a grue in the Cellar which says "the trap door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it. it is pitch black. you are likely to be eaten by a grue. " by instantly turning on the lantern without any reward, while DRRN takes random actions at this point and dies. Then our agent finds the way to the gallery, and gets the painting for +4 points. Thus, merely improving the understanding of the agent enables it to take better actions without any additional supervision. A part of a sample episode transcript is shown in Figure 1, and the complete episode is provided in the Appendix.</p>
<p>In summary, the pre-trained LM enables the DBERT-DRRN agent to extract reward cues from the observations as well as use its priors on world sense and game sense to get past the grue. We observed that the Vanilla-DBERT is only as good as the base DRRN agent. Training it on a set of gameplays is improving the model considerably, indicating the importance of this training, which is essentially channeling the world sense of Vanilla-DBERT into a gameplay mode. The DBERT-DRRN agent understands that a "jewel encrusted egg appearing extremely fragile" should be taken, and should not be thrown, or if it's dark the lantern should be turned on. Trained DBERT-DRRN assigns reasonably high Q-values to such actions in the valid action set, while DRRN assigns similar values when rewards are absent for the same (as can be seen in the trajectories provided in the Appendix). Both DBERT-DRRN and all other baselines are able to reach the gallery. Our agent does so more often as it escapes the grue in the Cellar using the lantern. Moreover, it extracts intermediate rewards cues and ends up with a higher score at the end of an episode. The baselines with a score around 39 or less are the ones which could not learn these aspects of the game. After getting the painting, the agents explore several options, but none of them, including ours, are able to find and learn to find the third treasure. Moving past trained DBERT-DRRN score will likely require a more intelligent agent with better exploration and learning strategies.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION</p>
<p>This paper proposes using a pre-trained LM fine-tuned on game dynamics for RL agents trained for text-based games. It provides three-fold benefits to the RL agent: linguistic priors, world sense priors, and game sense priors. It facilitates the agent to achieve SOTA results on several text-based games, even though being a simpler approach than all other baselines. The proposed approach indicates the importance of using pre-trained LMs for RL agents in text-based games. Through this work, we want to draw the research community's attention and motivate research in this direction to create even better priors using pre-trained LM for language understanding agents, such as distilling its knowledge to agents with better architectures. Such unsupervised components for exploration and learning will also be more useful in real-life scenarios where there are no explicit determinate rewards than reward-based representation learning. We have shown that training RL agents for text-based games in the absence of a prior is inefficient. The two key reasons are: learning language from scratch using the limited text data with a TD loss or related objective does not produce rich enough representations, and the agent has no source of world knowledge to be able to take appropriate actions given the state. The agents thus trained are not really understanding their state in the game, leading to the suspicion that the agents are simply memorizing the best-explored trajectories [24].</p>
<p>IF games are still far from solved. We need agents with better exploration strategies (for instance curiosity-driven learning [13]) to find high score trajectories, as well as learning architectures and objectives that can facilitate learning these trajectories while efficiently leveraging priors from pre-trained language models. Current results show the performance of the agents trained on the same game environments. Another line of future work is to test trained agents on unseen games. This will require a strong understanding of the world functioning and generalized training strategies to be able to acquire skills from multiple games and transfer them to the unseen test environments. This will also be a robust test-bed for semantic understanding of the agent, as memorization will no longer make any points in unseen games. Leveraging commonsense knowledge for text-based game agents can be another interesting direction for improving the knowledge priors. Many actions taken during these games are associated with object affordances.
