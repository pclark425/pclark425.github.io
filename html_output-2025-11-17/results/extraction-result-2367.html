Coordination Over Multi-Agent Networks With Unmeasurable States and Finite-Level Quantization
1Index Terms-Multi-agent systemCooperatabilityFinite-level quan- tizationQuantized observer
In this note, the coordination of linear discrete-time multiagent systems over digital networks is investigated with unmeasurable states in agents' dynamics. The quantized-observer based communication protocols and Certainty Equivalence principle based control protocols are proposed to characterize the inter-agent communication and the cooperative control in an integrative framework. By investigating the structural and asymptotic properties of the equations of stabilization and estimation errors, which are nonlinearly coupled by the finite-level quantization scheme, some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions are given for the existence of such communication and control protocols to ensure the inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization. It is shown that these conditions come down to the simultaneous stabilizability and the detectability of the dynamics of agents and the structure of the communication network.</p>
<p>algorithm was then further generalized to the cases with directed and time-varying topologies ([6]- [7]), the case with time delays ( [8]), the case with general linear agent dynamics with full measurable states ( [15]) and the case with second-order integrator dynamics with partially measurable states ( [12]). Recent works in this direction can be found in [9] for ternary information exchange, the continuous-time dynamics ( [10]) and consensus over finite fields ([11]).</p>
<p>All the above literature ( [2]- [12]) focused on designing specific communication and control protocols and analyzing the closed-loop performances for specific systems. However, a fundamental problem of the coordination of multi-agent systems over digital networks is for what kinds of dynamic networks, there exist proper communication and control protocols which can guarantee the objectives of the interagent communication and cooperative control jointly. The coordination of digital multi-agent networks consists of two fundamental factors, one is the inter-agent state observation by communication among agents, and the other one is the cooperative control by each agent to achieve given coordination objectives. The inter-agent state observation is the objective of the inter-agent communication and is the basis of designing the cooperative control laws. This is similar in spirit to that the state observation is the basis of the feedback control design for single-agent systems with unmeasurable states. It is of theoretical and practical significance to characterize the inter-agent state observation and the cooperative control of multi-agent systems in an integrative framework. In this framework, one needs to first give the conditions for the existence of communication and control protocols to ensure both the communication and control objectives. For the case with precise communication, the consentability of linear multi-agent systems were studied. The concept of consentability was first proposed by [13]- [14]. It was shown that the controllability of agent dynamics and the connectivity of the communication topology graph have a joint influence on the consentability. You and Xie [15] and Gu et.al. [16] studied the consentability of single-input linear discrete-time systems and sufficient conditions were given with respect to (w. r. t.) relative state feedback control protocols in [15] and w. r. t. filtered relative state feedback control protocols in [16], respectively.</p>
<p>In this note, motivated by [12]- [15], we consider the cooperatability of linear discrete-time multi-agent systems with unmeasurable states and finite communication data rate. We propose a class of communication protocols based on quantized-observer type encoders and decoders and a class of control protocols based on the relative state feedback control law and the Certainty Equivalence principle. The closed-loop dynamics of the cooperative stabilization and the state estimation errors are coupled by the nonlinearities generated by the finite-level quantization scheme. By investigating the structural and asymptotic properties of the overall closed-loop equations, we give some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for achieving inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization jointly w. r. t. the proposed classes of communication and control protocols. It is shown that the cooperatability of multi-agent systems is related to the simultaneous stabilizability and the detectability of the dynamics of agents and the structure of the communication graph.</p>
<p>Different from [15] for the case with fully measurable states, we consider the case with unmeasurable states and the finite communication data rate. The quantized-observer type encoding/decoding scheme proposed for second-order integrators in [12] is generalized for the case with general linear dynamics. Compared with [15] and [16] which focused on sufficient conditions, we show that the simultaneous stabilizablility of (A, λi(L)B), i = 2, · · · , N and the detectability of (A, C) are sufficient, and also necessary in some sense, for the cooperatability of the linear multi-agent systems over digital networks, where A, B and C are the system matrix, the input matrix and the output matrix, respectively, of each agent and λi(L), i = 2, · · · , N , are nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix L of the communication graph. We also show that the stabilizability of (A, B)(detectability of (A, C)) is necessary for the cooperative stabilization (inter-agent state observation), regardless of whether the inter-agent state observation (cooperative stabilization) is required.</p>
<p>The following notation will be used. Denote the column vectors or matrices with all elements being 1 and 0 by 1 and 0, respectively. Denote the identity matrix with dimension n by In. Denote the sets of real numbers, positive real numbers and conjugate numbers by R, R + and C, respectively, and R n denotes the n-dimensional real space. For any given vector X ∈ R n or matrix X = [xij] ∈ R n×m , its transpose is denoted by X T , and its conjugate transpose is denoted by X * . Denote the Euclidean norm of X by X and the infinite norm of X by X ∞. Denote the kth element of vector X by [X] k . Denote the spectral radius of square matrix X by ρ(X). Define B n×m r = {X ∈ R n×m | X &lt; r} and B n r = {X ∈ R n | X ∞ &lt; r}, r ∈ R + {+∞}. The Kronecker product is denoted by ⊗.</p>
<p>II. PROBLEM FORMULATION</p>
<p>The dynamics of each agent is given by
xi(t + 1) = Axi(t) + Bui(t), yi(t) = Cxi(t), t = 0, 1, · · · ,(1)
where A ∈ R n×n , B ∈ R n×m and C ∈ R p×n . Here, xi(t), yi(t) and ui(t) are the state, the output and the control input of agent i. The overall communication structure of the network is represented by a directed graph G = {V, E , A }, where V = {1, · · · , N } is the node set and each node represents an agent; E denotes the edge set and there is an edge (j, i) ∈ E if and only if there is a communication channel from j to i, then, agent i is called the receiver and agent j is called the sender, or i's neighbor. The set of agent i's neighbors is denoted by Ni = {j ∈ V |(j, i) ∈ E }. We denote A = [aij] ∈ R N ×N as the weighted adjacent matrix of G , aij &gt; 0 if and only if j ∈ Ni. Here we assume aii = 0. Denote degi = N j=1 aij as the in-degree of node i and D = diag(deg1, · · · , degN ) is called the degree matrix of G . The Laplacian matrix L of G is defined as L = D − A , and its eigenvalues in an ascending order of real parts are denoted by λ1(L) = 0, λi(L), i = 2, · · · , N . The agent dynamics (1) together with the communication topology graph G is called a dynamic network 1 and is denoted by (A, B, C, G ).</p>
<p>For real digital networks, only finite bits of data can be transmitted at each time step, therefore, each agent needs to first quantize and encode its output into finite symbols before transmitting them. Each pair of adjacent agents uses an encoding-decoding scheme to exchange information: For each digital communication channel (j, i), there is an encoder/decoder pair, denoted by Hji = (Θj, Ψji), associate with it. Here, Θj denotes the encoder maintained by agent j and Ψji denotes the decoder maintained by agent i. For the dynamic network (A, B, C, G ), the set {Hji, i = 1, · · · , N, j ∈ Ni|Hji = (Θj, Ψji)} of encoder-decoder pairs over the whole network is called a communication protocol, and the collection of such communication protocols is denoted by the communication protocol set H .</p>
<p>In this note, we propose the following communication protocol set:</p>
<p>H ( , LG) = H(γ, α, αu, L, Lu, G), γ ∈ (0, ), α ∈ (0, 1], 1 The concept of dynamic network of agents without output equations was defined in [17].
αu ∈ (0, 1], L ∈ N, Lu ∈ N, G ∈ B n×p L G ,(2)
where H(γ, α, αu, L, Lu, G) = {Hji, i = 1, · · · , N, j ∈ Ni|Hji = (Θj, Ψji), }. Here the constants LG ∈ R + {+∞}, ∈ (0, 1] are given parameters of the communication protocol set, while γ, α, αu, L, Lu and G are parameters of a specific communication protocol. For each digital channel (j, i), the encoder is given by
Θj =                       x j (0) =xj0,ûj(0) =ûj0, sj(t) = Qα,L yj(t − 1) − Cxj(t − 1) γ t−1 , xj(t) = Axj(t − 1) + γ t−1 Gsj(t) + Bûj(t − 1), uj(t) =ûj(t − 1) + γ t−1 su,j(t), su,j(t) = Qα u ,Lu uj(t) −ûj(t − 1) γ t−1 .(3)
and the decoder is given by
Ψji =     x ji(0) =xj0,ûji(0) =ûj0, xji(t) = Axji(t − 1) + γ t−1 Gsj(t) + Bûji(t − 1), uji(t) =ûji(t − 1) + γ t−1 su,j(t),(4)
where Qp,M (·) with p ∈ (0, 1] and M = 1, 2, ... is a finite-level uniform quantizer. For vector inputs, the definition is applied to each component.
Qp,M (y) =          ip, ip − p 2 ≤ y &lt; ip + p 2 , i = 0, 1, ..., M − 1 M p, y ≥ M p − p 2 , − Qp,M (−y), y &lt; − p 2 .
At each time step t, agent j generates the symbolic data sj(t) and su,j(t) by the encoder Θj and sends them to agent i through the channel (j, i). After sj(t), su,j(t) are received, by the decoder Ψji, agent i calculatesxji(t) as an estimate of xj(t). Denote Eji(t) = xj(t)−xji(t) as the state estimation error. From (3) and (4), we have Eji(t) = xj(t) −xj(t), and is denoted by Ej(t) for short. Here, we say that the dynamic network achieves inter-agent state observation if lim t→∞ (xj(t) −xji(t)) = 0, i = 1, · · · , N, j ∈ Ni.</p>
<p>For the case with precise communication, Olfati-Saber and Murray [17] proposed a class of relative state feedback control protocols :
ui(t) = K N j=1 aij(xj(t) − xi(t)), i = 1, · · · , N.(5)
Based on (5) and the Certainty Equivalence principle, we propose the following control protocol set:
U (LK ) = {U (K), K ∈ B m×n L K }, where U (K) = ui(t), t = 0, 1, · · · , i = 1, ..., N | ui(t) = K j∈N i aij(xji(t) −xi(t)) .(6)
The constant LK ∈ R + {+∞} is the given parameter of the control protocol set and the gain matrix K is the parameter of a control protocol to be designed. We say that the dynamic network (A, B, C, G ) is locally cooperatable if for any given positive constants C1, C2, C3, there exist communication and control protocols H ∈ H and U ∈ U , such that for any xi(0) ∈ B n C 1 ,xi0 ∈ B n C 2 , andûi0 ∈ B m C 3 , i ∈ 1, · · · , N , the closed-loop system achieves inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization. that is,
(a) lim t→∞ Ej(t) = 0, j = 1, · · · , N. (b) lim t→∞ (xi(t) − xj(t)) = 0, i, j = 1, · · · , N.
The dynamic network is called globally cooperatable if there exist communication and control protocols H ∈ H and U ∈ U , such that for any given initial condition, the closed-loop system achieves inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization. Remark 1. Different from [15] and [16], we consider the cooperatability of linear multi-agent systems with unmeasurable states and finite data rate. A quantized-observer based encoding-decoding scheme is proposed to estimate neighbors' states while decoding. From (4), the decoder has a similar structure as the Luenberger observer. For the case with precise communication, the quantizers degenerate to identical functions and the decoders degenerate to the Luenberger observers.</p>
<p>Remark 2. (i) Our quantized observer is based on the quantized innovation of yi(t) but not yi(t) itself. This type of observer is also called differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) in the communication community, which can save the bandwidth of the communication channel significantly [5], [12]. (ii) In a single-agent system, the controller and observer are usually located on the same side, which means the exact value of the control input can be used to design the observer directly. However, for the inter-agent state observation of multi-agent systems, the observers for neighbors' states are located faraway from the neighbors' controllers, which means the exact values of neighbors' control inputs are not available. Therefore, the estimations of neighbors' control inputs are added into our encoding-decoding schemes. (iii) For second-order integrator agents, the special dynamic structure makes it feasible to reconstruct neighbors' control inputs by differencing the delayed positions and velocities without explicitly estimate neighbors' control inputs ( [12]) However, for general linear dynamics, the method in [12] can not be used here. Here, we propose the Luenberger form decoders (4) with explicit estimations of neighbors' control inputs.</p>
<p>Remark 3.</p>
<p>Here, as a preliminary research, the definition of cooperatability focus on the ability of multi-agent systems to achieve interagent state observation and cooperative stabilization. The cooperative stabilization (synchronization) is the most basic cooperation of multiagent systems and forms the foundation of many other kinds of cooperative controls, such as formation and distributed tracking. The concept of cooperatability can be further expanded for more general coordination behaviors. One may wonder that to achieve synchronization, why we do not use the decentralized state feedback control law ui(t) = −Kxi(t) for each agent, then all agents' states will go to zero without any inter-agent communication. We do not use the decentralized state feedback control law but (6) mainly for two points. (i) The decentralized state feedback control law leads to the trivial case, i. e. all agents' states will go to zero. Here, the closed-loop system can achieve more general behavior. One may see that all agents' states will approach the weighted average initial values multiplied by the exponent of the system matrix under the control protocol (6) (see also Remark 4). This gives more flexibility to achieve complex coordination behavior by adjusting control and system parameters. (ii) The control protocol (6) is more flexible than the decentralized state feedback control law. One may further extend it for the formation control based on relative state vectors ( [18]):
ui(t) = K j∈N i aij(xji(t) −xi(t) − bij), i = 1, ..., N,(7)
or the distributed tracking problem:
ui(t) = K1 j∈N i aij(xji(t) −xi(t)) +K2bi0(x0i(t) −xi(t)), i = 1, ..., N.(8)</p>
<p>III. MAIN RESULTS</p>
<p>In this section we give some necessary conditions and sufficient conditions which ensure (A, B, C, G ) to be cooperatable. The following assumptions will be used. A1) There exists K ∈ R m×n such that the eigenvalues of A − λi(L)BK, i = 2, · · · , N are all inside the open unit disk of the complex plane.
A2) (A, C) is detectable. Denote ∆j(t − 1) = y j (t−1)−Cx j (t−1) γ t−1 − sj(t) and ∆u,j(t − 1) = u j (t)−û j (t−1) γ t−1 − su,j(t)
as the quantization errors of Qα,L(·) and Qα u ,Lu (·), respectively. Denote
∆(t) = (∆ T 1 (t), · · · , ∆ T N (t)) T , ∆u(t) = (∆ T u,1 (t), · · · , ∆ T u,N (t)) T . Denote X(t) = (x T 1 (t), · · · , x T N (t)) T ,X(t) = (x T 1 (t), · · · ,x T N (t)) T , U (t) = (u T 1 (t), · · · , u T N (t)) T ,Û (t) = (û T 1 (t), · · · ,û T N (t)) T . Denote E(t) = X(t) −X(t), H(t) = U (t) −Û (t),X(t) = ( 1 1 T π 1π T ⊗ In)X(t), δ(t) = X(t) −X(t),
where π T is the nonnegative left eigenvector w. r. t. the eigenvalue 0 of L and it can be verified that π T has at least one nonzero element. Here, δ(t) is called the cooperative stabilization error. Denote the lower triangular Jordan canonical of L by diag(0, J2, · · · , JN ) where Ji is the Jordan chain with respect to λi(L). We know that there is Φ ∈ R N ×N , consisting of the left eigenvectors and generalized left eigenvectors of L, such that (4) and (6), we have
ΦLΦ −1 = diag(0, J2, · · · , JN ). Let Φ = (π, φ2, · · · , φN ) T . DenoteJ(K) = IN−1 ⊗ A − diag(J2, · · · , JN ) ⊗ BK, J(G) = diag(A − GC, · · · , A − GC)nN×nN . From (1), (3),X(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ A)X(t) − (L ⊗ BK)X(t).(9)
and
E(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ (A − GC))E(t) + (IN ⊗ B)H(t) γ t (IN ⊗ G)∆(t).(10)
Note that π T L = 0, from (9) it is known thatX(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ A)X(t). Thus, from (9), the definition of E(t), δ(t) and noting that L1 = 0, we have
δ(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ A − L ⊗ BK)δ(t) + (L ⊗ BK)E(t). (11) Denote F (t) = U (t+1)−Û (t) γ t .</p>
<p>By (3) and the definition of H(t), we have
H(t + 1) = U (t + 1) −Û (t) − γ t Qα u ,Lu U (t + 1) −Û (t) γ t = γ t (F (t) − Qα u,Lu (F (t))) = γ t ∆u(t).(12)
From (6), (10) and (11) we can see that
F (t) = (L ⊗ K − L ⊗ KA + L 2 ⊗ KBK) δ(t) γ t + (L ⊗ K(A − GC) − L 2 ⊗ KBK − L ⊗ K) E(t) γ t + (ImN + L ⊗ KB) H(t) γ t + (L ⊗ KG)∆(t)(13)
Thus, we have the following equations:
                                   E(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ (A − GC))E(t) + (IN ⊗ B)H(t) + γ t (IN ⊗ G)∆(t), δ(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ A − L ⊗ BK)δ(t) + (L ⊗ BK)E(t),H(t + 1) = γ t (F (t) − Qα u ,Lu (F (t))), F (t) = (L ⊗ K − L ⊗ KA + L 2 ⊗ KBK) δ(t) γ t + (L ⊗ K(A − GC) − L 2 ⊗ KBK − L ⊗ K) E(t) γ t + (ImN + L ⊗ KB) H(t) γ t + (L ⊗ KG)∆(t).(14)
We have the following theorems. The proofs of Theorems 1, 2, 4 and 5 are put in Appendix. 
sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ ≤ W and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ ≤ Wu. Remark 4. It can be verified thatX(t + 1) = (IN ⊗ A)X(t), t = 0, 1, 2, · · · . Since limt→∞ δ(t) = 0, we have lim t→∞ xi(t) − A t N i=1 πixi(0) N i=1 πi = 0, i = 1, · · · , N.
So all agents' states will finally approach the trajectory
A t N i=1 π i x i (0) N i=1 π i
. If the control protocol (6) is replaced by
ui(t) = K1xi(t) + K2 j∈N i aij(xji(t) −xi(t)), t = 0, 1, · · · , i = 1, ..., N.(15)
which combines the decentralized state feedback and the distributed quantized relative output feedback, then the closed-loop states ap-
proach (A + BK1) t N i=1 π i x i (0) N i=1 π i
. For this kind of control protocols, one may choose K1 to achieve more complex coordination behavior.</p>
<p>Remark 5. Intuitively, Assumption A1) contains the requirement on the agent dynamics (A, B) and the communication topology graph G . If ρ(A) &lt; 1, cooperative stabilization can be achieved by taking K = 0 (leading to a trivial case), which makes A − λi(L)BK = A, i = 2, · · · , N all stable even G has no spanning tree (λ2(L) = 0). If ρ(A) ≥ 1, then Assumption A1) requires that λ2(L) = 0, which implies that G contains a spanning tree [19].</p>
<p>For single input discrete-time systems, [15] gave a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure A1) if all of A's eigenvalues are on or outside the unit circle of the complex plane, which was a intuitional explanation of A1). In fact, for single input agents, a sufficient condition to ensure A1) can be given:
A1 ) (A, B) is stabilizable and j |λ u j (A)| &lt; 1 inf ω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − ωλj(L)| .
Here, λ u j (A), 1 ≤ j ≤ n denote the unstable eigenvalues of A. If ρ(A) &lt; 1, then j |λ u j (A)| is defined as 0. What's more, if the communication topology graph is undirected, it was shown in [15] that 1 inf ω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1−ωλ j (L)| = 1+λ 2 /λ N 1−λ 2 /λ N and thus the eigenvalue-ratio λ2/λN plays an important part in the cooperatability of linear multi-agent systems.</p>
<p>The following theorem shows that Assumption A1 ) implies A1).</p>
<p>Theorem 2. For single input agents, if Assumption A1 ) holds, then Assumption A1) holds.</p>
<p>Theorem 1 shows that Assumptions A1) and A2) are sufficient conditions for the cooperatability of (A, B, C, G ). Furthermore, we find that they are also necessary conditions if &lt; 1.

Cû , the closed-loop system achieves inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization under H and U , and the quantization errors satisfy sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ ≤ W and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ ≤ Wu, where W and Wu are positive constants independent of γ, α, αu, L, Lu, G and K. Then Assumptions A1) and A2) hold.</p>
<p>Proof: We will use reduction to absurdity. Suppose that for any positive Cx, Cx, Cû, there exist a communication protocol H(γ, α, αu, L, Lu, G) ∈ H ( , LG) and a control protocol U (K) ∈ U (LK ) such that under these protocols, for any X(0) ∈ B nN Cx ,X(0) ∈ B nN Cx andÛ (0) ∈ B mN Cû , the closed-loop system satisfies limt→∞ E(t) = 0, limt→∞ δ(t) = 0, sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ ≤ W and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ ≤ Wu, however, A1) or A2) would not hold.

Cû such that under any communication protocol in (2) and control protocol in (6), the dynamic network can not achieve inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization jointly, which leads to the contradiction. Denoteδ(t) = (Φ ⊗ In)δ(t). DenoteΦ = (φ2, · · · , φN ) T , and denoteδ2(t) = (Φ ⊗ In)δ(t). From (14), it follows that
E(t + 1) δ2(t + 1) = A(K, G) E(t) δ2(t) + InN 0 (IN ⊗ B) · H(t) + InN 0 (IN ⊗ G)γ t ∆(t),(17)
where
A(K, G) = J(G) 0 (Φ ⊗ In)(L ⊗ BK)J(K)
. Since A1)</p>
<p>and A2) would not hold simultaneously, we have ρ(A(K, G)) ≥ 1 under any communication protocol in (2) and control protocol in (6). Transform A(K, G) to its Schur canonical, that is, select a unitary matrix P (P * = P −1 ) such that
P * A(K, G)P =    λ1(A(K, G)) 0 × . . . × × λ (2N −1)n (A(K, G))    .
Here, λ1(A(K, G)), · · · , λ (2N −1)n (A(K, G)) are eigenvalues of A(K, G) with |λ1(A(K, G))| = ρ(A(K, G)), and × represents the elements below the diagonal of the Schur canonical.</p>
<p>Denote 
Z(t) = P * [E T (t),δ T 2 (t)] T . From (17) we know that [Z(t + 1)]1 = λ t+1 1 (A(K, G))[Z(0)]1 + t i=1 λ t−i 1 (A(K, G)) P * [InN , 0 T ] T (IN ⊗ B)H(i) 1 + t i=0 λ t−i 1 (A(K, G))γ i P * [InN , 0 T ] T (IN ⊗ G)∆(i) 1 + λ t 1 (A(K, G)) P * [InN , 0 T ] T (IN ⊗ B)H(0) 1 .(18)Let P = [P T 1 , P T 2 ] T with P1 ∈ R nN ×n(2N −1) and P2 ∈ R n(N −1)×n(2N −1) . Take X(0) = (Φ −1 ⊗ In)[0 T , a T P T 2 ] T where a = a1 ∈ R n(2N −1) and 0 ∈ R n , then X(0) ∞ ≤ n(2N − 1)a Φ −1 P2 . Note that P2 ≤ P = 1, we have X(0) ∞ ≤ n(2N − 1)a Φ −1 &lt; Cx, implying X(0) ∈ B nN Cx . TakeX(0) = X(0) −1 + t i=0 λ t−i 1 (A(K, G))g(i) P * [InN , 0 T ] T (IN ⊗ G)∆(i) 1 ≤ 2Wu B √ mN 1 − + 2LGW √ nN 1 − |λ1(A(K, G))| t+1 &lt; a 2 |λ1(A(K, G))| t+1 .(19)
From (18), (19) and noting that H(0) = 0, we have
[Z(t + 1)]1 ≥ |λ1(A(K, G))| t+1 a − a 2 |λ1(A(K, G))| t+1 = a 2 |λ1(A(K, G))| t+1 .
By the invertibility of P , we know that [E T (t), δ T (t)] T does not vanish as t → ∞. This is in contradiction with that the dynamic network achieves inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization. So, A1) and A2) hold.</p>
<p>Remark 6. Actually, the communication protocol parameter γ can represent the convergence speed of the cooperative coordination (for both inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization). The smaller γ is, the faster the convergence will be. The constant is an upper bound of γ, so it is a uniform upper bound of the convergence speed. Theorem 3 shows that if (A, B, C, G ) is locally cooperatable with a uniform exponential convergence speed, then A1) and A2) hold.</p>
<p>Remark 7.</p>
<p>Sundaram and Hadjicostis ( [20]) showed that a linear system is structurally controllable and observable over a finite field if the graph of the system satisfies certain properties and the size of the field is large enough. They also applied this result into the control of multi-agent systems over finite fields. Compared with [20], this note has the following differences. (i) [20] focused on the controllability and observability of linear systems over finite fields, and the closure property of the finite field plays an important role in getting their results. In this note we study the quantized coordination of linear multi-agent systems over real number field, so the closure and invertible properties can not be used. (ii) The system matrix A of the linear system in [20] corresponds to the graph structure of the whole network, and the dynamics of each agent is actually in some integrator form. What is more, the elements of the system matrices A, B and C are restricted in finite fields. In this note, the affect of the graph topology is decided by the Laplacian matrix, and each agent has the general linear dynamics (see (1)), where the system matrices A, B and C are arbitrary real matrices.</p>
<p>As preliminary research, this note is concerned with inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization of multi-agent systems over digital networks. It is an interesting topic for further investigation that whether our results can be combined with the methodology of [20] to study the controllability of multi-agent networks under quantized communication.</p>
<p>At present, we still do not know whether A1) and  , such that for any X(0) ∈ R nN ,X(0) ∈ R nN andÛ (0) ∈ R mN , the closedloop system achieves inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization under H and U , and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ &lt; ∞ and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ &lt; ∞, then Assumptions A1) and A2) hold.</p>
<p>From the following theorems, we can see that the stabilizability of (A, B) is necessary for (A, B, C, G ) to achieve cooperative stabilization no matter whether the inter-agent state observation is required, and similarly, the detectability of (A, C) is necessary for (A, B, C, G ) to achieve inter-agent state observation regardless of the cooperative stabilization.  </p>
<p>The communication network is a directed 0-1 weight graph given by Figure 1. We take the initial values of the agents randomly in the square: of agents' states. Figure 3 shows the Euclidean norm of the state estimation error associated with each digital channel. From Figures  2 and 3, it can be seen that the closed-loop system achieves both cooperative stabilization and inter-agent state observation. </p>
<p>V. CONCLUSION</p>
<p>In this note, we studied the inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization of discrete-time linear multi-agent systems with unmeasurable states over bandwidth limited digital networks. We proposed a class of quantized-observer based communication protocols and a class of Certainty Equivalence principle based control protocols. We showed that the simultaneous stabilizability condition and the detectability condition of agent dynamics are sufficient for the existence of communication and control protocols to ensure both the inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization. Furthermore, we proved that they are also necessary for the local and global cooperatability in some sense. The theoretic results are also verified by numerical simulations.</p>
<p>As a preliminary research, we focus on the conditions on the dynamics of agents and the network structure to ensure the existence of finite data rate inter-agent communication and control protocols. An interesting topic for future investigation is whether there is a lower bound, which is independent of the number of agents, for the communication data rate required just as the small channel capacity theorems established in [5], [6], [8] and [12]. Note that the independency of the number of agents implies good scalability for large scale networks. The problem is more challenging. Also, Due to the time-delay, link failure or packet dropouts in networks, how to design communication and control protocols for linear multiagent systems to ensure both the cooperative stabilization and interagent state observation with finite data rate, communication delay and packet dropouts is an interesting and challenging problem.</p>

<p>Lemma A.1. [15] Assuming A ∈ R n×n , B ∈ R n×1 , λ2, · · · , λN , i = 2, · · · , N are nonzero complex numbers. Assume that all the eigenvalues of A are on or outside the unit circle of the complex plane. Then there exists K ∈ R 1×n such that ρ(A − λjBK) &lt; 1, ∀ j = 2, · · · , N if and only if:
(a) (A, B) is controllable. (b) j |λj(A)| &lt; 1 min ω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1−ωλ j | Lemma A.2. [21]
For any A ∈ C n×n and ε &gt; 0, we have
A k ≤ M η k , ∀ k ≥ 0, where M = √ n(1 + (2/ε)) n−1 , η = ρ(A) + ε A .
Proof of Theorem 1: According to whether the state matrix A is asymptotically stable, we prove the theorem for two cases, respectively. Case (i) ρ(A) ≥ 1. For this case, since A1) holds, we can see that 0 is a single eigenvalue of the Lapalacian matrix L. Take K ∈ B m×n +∞ such that ρ(J(K)) &lt; 1. Take G ∈ B n×p +∞ such that ρ(J(G)) &lt; 1. Take ε &gt; 0 andε1 &gt; 0 such that η = ρ(J(G)) + ε J(G) &lt; 1 andη1 = ρ(J(K)) +ε1 J (K) &lt; 1. Denote M = √ nN (1 + (2/ε)) nN −1 andM1 = n(N − 1)(1 + (2/ε1)) n(N −1)−1 . Take γ ∈ (max{η,η1}, 1) and α, αu
∈ (0, 1]. Let W (B, K) = diag(J2, · · · , JN ) ⊗ BK, and denote R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) = max √ nN M (Cx + Cx), α √ pN M G 2(γ−η)

Select the number of quantization levels L &gt; 1 α L(K, G, γ, Cx, Cx, Cû, α, αu) − 1 2</p>
<p>and Lu &gt; 1 αu Lu(K, G, γ, Cx, Cx, Cû, α, αu)-1 2 . Next we prove that with the parameters γ, α, αu, L, Lu, G of the communication protocol and the parameter K of the control protocol selected as above, the dynamic network will achieve the inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization, and the quantization errors will be uniformly bounded.</p>
<p>We first prove that by selecting the parameters γ, L, Lu, α, αu, G of the communication protocol and the parameter K of the control protocol as above, the quantizers Qα,L(·) and Qα u ,Lu (·) will never be saturate.
Denoteδ(t) = (Φ ⊗ In)δ(t) andẼ(t) = (Φ ⊗ In)E(t). Letδ(t) = [(δ T 1 (t)), (δ T 2 (t))] T , whereδ1(t) is the first n elements ofδ(t). Soδ1(t) = (π T ⊗ In)δ(t) = 0. Let E(t) = [(Ẽ T 1 (t)), (Ẽ T 2 (t))] T , whereẼ1(t)
is the first n elements ofẼ(t). From (14), the definition ofJ(K), W (B, K), J(G), and H(t + 1) = γ t (F (t) − Qα u,Lu (F (t)) = γ t ∆u(t), we havẽ δ2(k + 1) =J(K)δ2(k) + W (B, K)Ẽ2(k)
= (J(K)) k+1δ 2(0) + k i=0 (J(K)) k−i W (B, K) ·Ẽ2(i), k = 0, 1, ...,(A.1)
and
E(k + 1) = (J(G)) k+1 E(0) + k i=1 (J(G)) k−i (IN ⊗ B)γ i−1 · ∆u(i) + k i=0 (J(G)) k−i (IN ⊗ G)∆(i) + (J(G)) k · (IN ⊗ B)H(0), k = 0, 1, ... (A.2) By Lemma A.2, we know that (J(G)) i ≤ M η i , i = 0, 1, .... Note that U (0) = −(L ⊗ K)X(0), Û (0) ∞ ≤ Cû and H(0) = U (0) −Û (0), we have H(0) ≤ Cx √ N n L ⊗ K + √ mN Cû. Then from (A.2), we have E(k + 1) ≤ M η k+1 √ nN (Cx + Cx) + k i=1 M η k−i B · γ i−1 √ mN ∆u(i) ∞ + k i=0 M η k−i G γ i · pN ∆(i) ∞ + M η k B Cx √ N n L ⊗ K + Cû √ mN . (A.3) At the initial time k = 0, it is known that (IN ⊗ C)E(0) ∞ ≤ C ∞ E(0) ∞ ≤ C ∞(Cx + Cx).
Then noting that
C ∞(Cx + Cx) ≤ C ∞ √ nN M (Cx + Cx)≤ R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) &lt; αL + α 2 , we know that Qα,L(·)
is not saturate at the initial time k = 0, which means ∆(0) ∞ ≤ α 2 . It can be seen that that δ(0) ∞ ≤ 2Cx. Then from (14), we get that
F (0) ∞ ≤ 2Cx √ N n L ⊗ K − L ⊗ KA + L 2 ⊗ KBK + √ N n L ⊗ K(A − GC) − L 2 ⊗ KBK − L ⊗ K · (Cx + Cx) + α √ pN L ⊗ KG 2 + ImN + L ⊗ KB · √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû &lt; αuLu + αu 2 .
Thus we know that Qα u,Lu (·) is also not saturate at k = 0, which means ∆u(0) ∞ ≤ αu 2 . Assume that Qα,L(·) and Qα u ,Lu (·) are not saturate at k = 0, 1, ..., t, which implies, max 0≤k≤t ∆(k) ∞ ≤ α 2 and max 0≤k≤t ∆u(k) ∞ ≤ αu 2 . Now consider the time k = t + 1. From (A.3), we have
(IN ⊗ C)E(t + 1) γ t+1 ∞ ≤ C ∞ E(t + 1) γ t+1 ≤ C ∞ max √ N nM (Cx + Cx) γ t+1 , α √ pN M G 2(γ − η)γ t+1 · γ t+1 + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) · γ t − η t γ t + M η t B ( √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû) γ t+1 ≤ C ∞ R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ nN L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû &lt; αL + α 2 .
So Qα,L(·) is not saturate at k = t + 1. By (A.3), and noting that Qα,L(·) and Qα u,Lu (·) are not saturate at k = 0, · · · , t, we have
E(k) ≤ γ k R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû , 0 ≤ k ≤ t + 1. (A.4)
Next we will prove that Qα u ,Lu (·) is not saturate at the time k = t + 1.
Since max 0≤k≤t ∆u(k) ∞ ≤ αu 2 , we have H(k + 1) = γ k ∆u(k) ≤ γ k √ mN ∆u(k) ∞ ≤ αu √ mN γ k 2 , 0 ≤ k ≤ t.
Then from (A.1), (A.4), Lemma A.2, and note thatδ1(t) = 0, we have
δ (k + 1) = δ 2(k + 1) ≤ (J(K)) k+1 Φ δ(0) + k i=0 (J(K)) k−i · W (B, K) Φ E(i) ≤ 2 √ N n Φ CxM1η k+1 1 + Φ M 1 W (B, K) (γ k+1 −η k+1 1 ) (γ −η1) · R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû ≤ γ k+1 Φ max 2 √ N nCxM1,M 1 W (B, K) (γ −η1) · R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû = γ k+1 Φ Γ(K, G, γ, Cx, Cx, Cû, α, αu), 0 ≤ k ≤ t. (A.5)
Thus, from H(t + 1) = γ t ∆u(t), (14), (A.4) and (A.5), we know that
F (t + 1) ∞ ≤ Φ −1 ⊗ In Φ ⊗ In L ⊗ K − L ⊗ KA + L 2 ⊗ KBK · Γ(K, G, γ, Cx, Cx, Cû, α, αu) + L ⊗ K(A − GC) − L 2 ⊗ KBK − L ⊗ K R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû + αu √ mN ImN + L ⊗ KB 2γ + α √ pN L ⊗ KG 2 ≤ Lu(K, G, γ, Cx, Cx, Cû) &lt; αuLu + αu 2 .
So Qα u ,Lu (·) is not saturate at k = t + 1. By induction, Qα,L(·) and Qα u ,Lu (·) are not saturate at any time.</p>
<p>Thus, under the selected communication protocol and control protocol, we have sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ ≤ 1/2 and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ ≤ 1/2. Now we prove that the dynamic network will achieve inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization. Similar to (A.4) and noting that sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ ≤ 1 2 and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ ≤ 1 2 , we have
E(t) ≤ γ t R(G, γ, Cx, Cx, α) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ N n L ⊗ K Cx + √ mN Cû , t = 0, 1, ..., (A.6)
which means limt→∞ E(t) = 0, that is, the dynamic network achieves inter-agent state observation. Similar to (A.5), by (A.1) and (A.6), we have
δ(t) ≤ Φ −1 ⊗ In δ (t) = Φ −1 δ 2(t) ≤ Φ −1 Φ Γ(K, G, γ, Cx, Cx, Cû, αu)γ t , t = 0, 1, ...,
which implies δ(t) ∞ → 0, that is, the dynamic network achieves cooperative stabilization. Case (ii) ρ(A) &lt; 1. Take K = 0 and G = 0, then we havē
J(K) = IN−1 ⊗ A, J(G) = IN ⊗ A and W (B, K) = 0. Take α and αu ∈ (0, 1]. Denote L(γ, Cx, Cx, Cû) = C ∞ √ N nM (Cx + Cx) + αu √ mN M B 2γ(γ − η) + 1 γ M B √ mN Cû ,
and
Lu(γ, Cx, Cx, Cû) = max √ mN Cû, αu √ mN 2γ . Select L &gt; 1 α L(γ, Cx, Cx, Cû) − 1 2
and Lu &gt; 1 αu Lu(γ, Cx, Cx, Cû) − 1 2 , then similar to Case (i), one can prove that the dynamic network will achieve inter-agent state observation and cooperative stabilization, and the quantization errors are uniformly bounded under the communication protocol and control protocol selected above.</p>
<p>Proof of Theorem 2:</p>
<p>Case(i) ρ(A) ≥ 1. Firstly, we use the reduction to absurdity to prove that λj(L) = 0, j = 2, ..., N . If not, there is an integer k0 ∈ [2, N ] such that λ k 0 (L) = 0. It can be seen that infω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − ωλj(L)| ≥ infω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − |ω||λj(L)||. Denote max j∈{2,··· ,N } |λj(L)| by p. Since λ k 0 (L) = 0, we know that min j∈{2,··· ,N } |λj(L)| = 0, thus, one get that
max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − |ω||λj(L)|| = max{|1 − |ω| max j |λj(L)||, |1 − |ω| min j |λj(L)||} = max{1, |1 − |ω||p|} =    −ωp − 1 ω &lt; − 2 p , 1 − 2 p ≤ ω ≤ 2 p , ωp − 1 ω &gt; 2 p . (A.7)
From (A.7), we know that infω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − |ω||λj(L)|| = 1. So infω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − ωλj(L)| ≥ minω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1 − |ω||λj(L)|| = 1. Then by A1 ), we know that j |λ u j (A)| &lt; 1 inf ω∈R max j∈{2,··· ,N } |1−ωλ j (L)| ≤ 1, which means ρ(A) &lt; 1. However, ρ(A) ≥ 1 for case (1), so λj(L) = 0, j = 2, · · · , N .</p>
<p>Next we prove that there exists K ∈ R 1×n such that A − λi(L)BK, i = 2, · · · , N are all asymptotically stable. Denote the block diagonal matrix which consists of the stable Jordan blocks of A as As ∈ R ns×ns , ns ≥ 0, and the block diagonal matrix which consists of the other Jordan blocks of A as Au ∈ R nu×nu , nu ≥ 0.</p>
<p>For this case, since ρ(A) ≥ 1, we know that nu &gt; 0. Thus, there exists an invertible matrix T such that
T −1 AT = As 0 0 Au . (A.8) Let T −1 B = B T 1 , B T 2 T , where B1 ∈ R ns×1 and B2 ∈ R nu×1 .
Now we prove that the matrix pair (Au, B2) is controllable. If not, transform (Au, B2) into its controllable canonical, that is, there is an invertible matrix R such that
R −1 AuR = Au1 Au2 0 Au3 , R −1 B2 = B21 0 , (A.9)
where Au1 ∈ R n u1 ×n u1 , Au3 ∈ R n u3 ×n u3 and Au3 is unstable. Then we know that
A = T In s 0 0 R   As 0 0 0 Au1 Au2 0 0 Au3   In s 0 0 R −1 · T −1 , B = T In s 0 0 R B T 1 , (B21, 0) T T .
(A.10)</p>
<p>For any given K ∈ R 1×n , let KT
In s 0 0 R = (K1,K2,K3),
whereK1 ∈ R 1×ns ,K2 ∈ R 1×n u1 andK3 ∈ R 1×n u3 , we can see that
A + BK = T In s 0 0 R   As 0 0 0 Au1 Au2 0 0 Au3   +   B1 B21 0   (K1,K2,K3) In s 0 0 R −1 T −1 = T In s 0 0 R ·   As + B1K1 B1K2 B1K3 B21K1 Au1 + B21K2 Au2 + B21K3 0 0 Au3   · In s 0 0 R −1 T −1 . (A.11)
Since Au3 is unstable, we know that there is no matrix K such that A + BK is stable, which is in contradiction with that (A, B) is stabilizable. So we know that (Au, B2) controllable.</p>
<p>Since λi(L) = 0, i = 2, · · · , N , from Lemma A.1, we know that there exist aK ∈ R 1×nu such that ρ(Au − λi(L)B2K) &lt; 1, i = 2, · · · , N . TakeK = [0 T ,K] and take K =KT −1 , since
T −1 AT = As 0 0 Au , T −1 B = B1 B2 ,
we know that
A − λi(L)BK = T As −λi(L)B1K 0 Au − λi(L)B2K T −1 , i = 2, · · · , N.
So ρ(A − λi(L)BK) &lt; 1, i = 2, · · · , N . So A1 ) suffices for A1). Case (ii) ρ(A) &lt; 1. For this case, take K = 0 T , then A1) holds.</p>
<p>Proof of Theorem 4: Denote sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆j(t) ∞ by W and sup t≥0 max 1≤j≤N ∆u,j(t) ∞ by Wu. Noting that here, different from Theorem 3, W and Wu may depend on the parameters γ, α, αu, L, Lu, G and K. Select a constant a satisfying
a &gt; 4 B √ mN Wu |λ1(A(K, G)) − γ| + 4 G W √ nN |λ1(A(K, G)) − γ| . (A.12)
Take X(0) = (Φ −1 ⊗ In)[0 T , a T P T 2 ] T where a = a1 ∈ R n(2N −1) and 0 ∈ R n . TakeX(0) = X(0) − P1a,Û (0) = −(L ⊗ K)X(0), thus E(0) = X(0)−X(0) = X(0)−(X(0)−P1a) = P1a, and H(0) = U (0) −Û (0) = −(L ⊗ K)X(0) + (L ⊗ K)X(0) = 0. Thus Z(0) = a and [Z(0)]1 = a. Then similar to the proof of Theorem3, we have the conclusion.</p>
<p>Proof of Theorem 5: We use the reduction to absurdity to prove this theorem. Suppose that (A, B) is unstabilizable, then there exists an invertible matrix T1, such that T −1 1 AT1 = As 1 A12 0 Au4 and
T −1 1 B = B T 3 , 0 T T ,
where Au4 ∈ R n u4 ×n u4 is unstable. Here nu4 is a positive integer. Take Cx &gt; √ n Φ −1 T1 . Take Cx &gt; 1 and Cû &gt; 1. Next we prove that for any given communication protocol in (2) and control protocol in (6), there exist X(0) ∈ B nN Cx ,X(0) ∈ B nN Cx andÛ (0) ∈ B mN Cû , such that the dynamic network can not achieve cooperative stabilization, which leads to the contradiction. Denote the first n elements ofẼ2(t) andδ2(t) byẼ21(t) andδ21(t) whereẼ2(t) andδ2(t) are defined in the proof of Theorem 1. From (14), we havẽ δ21(t + 1) = (A − λ2(L)BK)δ21(t) + λ2(L)BKẼ21(t). (A.13) Denoteδ21(t) = T −1 1δ 21(t), and let KT1 = (K3,K4) whereK3 ∈ R m×(n−n u4 ) ,K4 ∈ R m×n u4 . Thus, from (A.13), we havê
δ21(t + 1) = As1 − λ2(L)B3K3 × 0 Au4 δ 21(t) + λ2(L)B3K3 λ2(L)B3K4 0 0 T −1 1Ẽ21 (t).
(A.14) Denote the last nu4 elements ofδ21(t + 1) byδ21 n u4 (t + 1), thus from (A.14), we haveδ21 n u4 (t + 1) = Au4δ21 n u4 (t). Take X(0) = (Φ −1 ⊗ In) 0 T , [T11] T T , then X(0) ∞ ≤ √ n Φ −1 T1 &lt; Cx. By the definition of δ(t), and noting that π T is the first row of Φ, we have δ(0) = (Φ −1 ⊗ In) 0 T , [T11] T T . Thus,δ21(0) = 1n andδ21 n u4 (0) = 1n u4 . TakeX(0) = 1nN ,Û (0) = 1mN , then we have X (0) ∞ &lt; Cx and Û (0) ∞ &lt; Cû . Sinceδ21 n u4 (0) = 0, δ(t) does not vanish, which draws the contradiction.</p>
<p>Proof of Theorem 6: We use the reduction to absurdity to prove this theorem. If (A, C) was not detectable, then there would exist x0 ∈ R n , such that CA l x0 = 0, l = 0, 1, 2, ...,, and A t x0 does not go to zero as t → ∞. Take Cx &gt; x0 , Cx &gt; 0 and Cû &gt; 0. Next we will prove that for any given communication protocol H ∈ H (1, +∞) and control protocol U ∈ U (+∞), there exist X(0) ∈ B nN Cx ,X(0) ∈ B nN Cx andÛ (0) ∈ B mN Cû , such that the dynamic network can not achieve inter-agent state observation, which leads to the contradiction. Take x1(0) = x0 and xj = 0, j = 2, · · · , N . Then X(0) ∈ B nN Cx . By Cx0 = 0, we have yj(0) = 0, j = 1, 2, ..., N . TakeX(0) = 0 andÛ (0) = 0, soX(0) ∈ B nN Cx andÛ (0) ∈ B mN Cû . By (6), we know that U (0) = 0. By (3), (4), noting that yj(0) = 0, j = 1, 2, ..., N , we know that sj(1) = 0, j = 1, 2, ..., N , which together withX(0) = 0 andÛ (0) = 0 lead toX(1) = 0. Then by (3), (4) and (6), it follows that U (1) = 0, andÛ (1) = 0. Then by (1) and CAx0 = 0, we have yj(1) = 0, j = 1, 2, ..., N . Suppose that up to time t, t = 2, 3, ..., U (k) =Û (k) = 0, andX(k) = 0, k = 0, 1, ..., t − 1. Then By (1), we have x1(t − 1) = A t−1 x0, xj(t − 1) = 0, j = 2, 3, ..., N . Noting that CA t−1 x0 = 0, it follows that yj(t − 1) = 0, j = 1, 2, ..., N . And by (3), (4) and (6), we know thatX(t) = 0 and U (t) =Û (t) = 0. Then by mathematical induction, we haveX(t) ≡ 0 and U (t) ≡ 0, which together with (1) gives x1(t) = A t x0, and x2(t) = · · · = xN (t) ≡ 0. Noting that A t x0 does not go to zero as t → ∞, butX(t) ≡ 0, it follows that E(t) = X(t) −X(t) does not go to zero as t → ∞, which leads to the contradiction.</p>

By the definition of E(t) and H(t), we know that E(0) = X(0) −X(0) = X(0) − (X(0) − P1a) = P1a, and H(0) = U (0)−Û (0) = −(L⊗K)X(0)+(L⊗K)X(0) = 0. Since Z(0) = P * [E(0) T ,δ T 2 (0)] T , we have Z(0) = a and [Z(0)]1 = a. From (16), we know that t i=1 λ t−i 1 (A(K, G)) P * [InN , 0 T ] T (IN ⊗ B)H(i)</p>
