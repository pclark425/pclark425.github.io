Abstract
Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) integrates the label swapping forwarding paradigm with network layer routing. To deliver reliable service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on different paths. This requires that the label switching routers (LSRs) support fault detection, fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling support the configuration of recovery. With these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery. Restart issues are not included in this framework.</p>

13. IntroductionThis memo describes a framework for MPLS-based recovery. We providea detailed taxonomy of recovery terminology, and discuss themotivation for, the objectives of, and the requirements for MPLS-basedrecovery. We outline principles for MPLS-based recovery, andalso provide comparison criteria that may serve as a basis forcomparing and evaluating different recovery schemes.</p>
<p>At points in the document, we provide some thoughts about the operation or viability of certain recovery objectives. These should be viewed as the opinions of the authors, and not the consolidated views of the IETF. The document is informational and it is expected that a standards track document will be developed in the future to describe a subset of this document as to meet the needs currently specified by the TE WG.</p>
<h1>1.1. Background</h1>
<p>Network routing deployed today is focused primarily on connectivity, and typically supports only one class of service, the best effort class. Multi-protocol label switching [RFC3031], on the other hand, by integrating forwarding based on label-swapping of a link local label with network layer routing allows flexibility in the delivery of new routing services. MPLS allows for using such media-specific forwarding mechanisms as label swapping. This enables some sophisticated features such as quality-of-service (QoS) and traffic engineering [RFC2702] to be implemented more effectively. An important component of providing QoS, however, is the ability to transport data reliably and efficiently. Although the current routing algorithms are robust and survivable, the amount of time they take to recover from a fault can be significant, in the order of several seconds (for interior gateway protocols (IGPs)) or minutes (for exterior gateway protocols, such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)), causing disruption of service for some applications in the interim. This is unacceptable in situations where the aim is to provide a highly reliable service, with recovery times that are in the order of seconds down to 10's of milliseconds. IP routing may also not be able to provide bandwidth recovery, where the objective is to provide not only an alternative path, but also bandwidth equivalent to that available on the original path. (For some recent work on bandwidth recovery schemes, the reader is referred to [MPLSBACKUP].) Examples of such applications are Virtual Leased Line services, Stock Exchange data services, voice traffic, video services etc, i.e., every application that gets a disruption in service long enough to not fulfill service agreements or the required level of quality.</p>
<p>MPLS recovery may be motivated by the notion that there are limitations to improving the recovery times of current routing algorithms. Additional improvement can be obtained by augmenting these algorithms with MPLS recovery mechanisms [MPLS-PATH]. Since MPLS is a possible technology of choice in future IP-based transport networks, it is useful that MPLS be able to provide protection and restoration of traffic. MPLS may facilitate the convergence of network functionality on a common control and management plane. Further, a protection priority could be used as a differentiating</p>
<p>mechanism for premium services that require high reliability, such as Virtual Leased Line services, and high priority voice and video traffic. The remainder of this document provides a framework for MPLS based recovery. It is focused at a conceptual level and is meant to address motivation, objectives and requirements. Issues of mechanism, policy, routing plans and characteristics of traffic carried by recovery paths are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<h1>1.2. Motivation for MPLS-Based Recovery</h1>
<p>MPLS based protection of traffic (called MPLS-based Recovery) is useful for a number of reasons. The most important is its ability to increase network reliability by enabling a faster response to faults than is possible with traditional Layer 3 (or IP layer) approaches alone while still providing the visibility of the network afforded by Layer 3. Furthermore, a protection mechanism using MPLS could enable IP traffic to be put directly over WDM optical channels and provide a recovery option without an intervening SONET layer or optical protection. This would facilitate the construction of IP-over-WDM networks that request a fast recovery ability (Note that what is meant here is the transport of IP traffic over WDM links, not the Generalized MPLS, or GMPLS, control of a WDM link).</p>
<p>The need for MPLS-based recovery arises because of the following:
I. Layer 3 or IP rerouting may be too slow for a core MPLS network that needs to support recovery times that are smaller than the convergence times of IP routing protocols.
II. Layer 3 or IP rerouting does not provide the ability to provide bandwidth protection to specific flows (e.g., voice over IP, virtual leased line services).
III. Layer 0 (for example, optical layer) or Layer 1 (for example, SONET) mechanisms may be wasteful use of resources.
IV. The granularity at which the lower layers may be able to protect traffic may be too coarse for traffic that is switched using MPLS-based mechanisms.
V. Layer 0 or Layer 1 mechanisms may have no visibility into higher layer operations. Thus, while they may provide, for example, link protection, they cannot easily provide node protection or protection of traffic transported at layer 3. Further, this may prevent the lower layers from providing restoration based on the traffic's needs. For example, fast restoration for traffic that needs it, and slower restoration (with possibly more optimal use of resources) for traffic that does not require fast</p>
<p>restoration. In networks where the latter class of traffic is dominant, providing fast restoration to all classes of traffic may not be cost effective from a service provider's perspective.
VI. MPLS has desirable attributes when applied to the purpose of recovery for connectionless networks. Specifically that an LSP is source routed and a forwarding path for recovery can be "pinned" and is not affected by transient instability in SPF routing brought on by failure scenarios.
VII. Establishing interoperability of protection mechanisms between routers/LSRs from different vendors in IP or MPLS networks is desired to enable recovery mechanisms to work in a multivendor environment, and to enable the transition of certain protected services to an MPLS core.</p>
<h1>1.3. Objectives/Goals</h1>
<p>The following are some important goals for MPLS-based recovery.
I. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms may be subject to the traffic engineering goal of optimal use of resources.
II. MPLS based recovery mechanisms should aim to facilitate restoration times that are sufficiently fast for the end user application. That is, that better match the end-user's application requirements. In some cases, this may be as short as 10 s of milliseconds.</p>
<p>We observe that I and II may be conflicting objectives, and a trade off may exist between them. The optimal choice depends on the enduser application's sensitivity to restoration time and the cost impact of introducing restoration in the network, as well as the end-user application's sensitivity to cost.
III. MPLS-based recovery should aim to maximize network reliability and availability. MPLS-based recovery of traffic should aim to minimize the number of single points of failure in the MPLS protected domain.
IV. MPLS-based recovery should aim to enhance the reliability of the protected traffic while minimally or predictably degrading the traffic carried by the diverted resources.
V. MPLS-based recovery techniques should aim to be applicable for protection of traffic at various granularities. For example, it should be possible to specify MPLS-based recovery for a portion of the traffic on an individual path, for all traffic</p>
<p>on an individual path, or for all traffic on a group of paths. Note that a path is used as a general term and includes the notion of a link, IP route or LSP.
VI. MPLS-based recovery techniques may be applicable for an entire end-to-end path or for segments of an end-to-end path.
VII. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to take into consideration the recovery actions of lower layers. MPLS-based mechanisms should not trigger lower layer protection switching nor should MPLS-based mechanisms be triggered when lower layer switching has or may imminently occur.
VIII. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to minimize the loss of data and packet reordering during recovery operations. (The current MPLS specification itself has no explicit requirement on reordering.)
IX. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to minimize the state overhead incurred for each recovery path maintained.
X. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to minimize the signaling overhead to setup and maintain recovery paths and to notify failures.
XI. MPLS-based recovery mechanisms should aim to preserve the constraints on traffic after switchover, if desired. That is, if desired, the recovery path should meet the resource requirements of, and achieve the same performance characteristics as, the working path.</p>
<p>We observe that some of the above are conflicting goals, and real deployment will often involve engineering compromises based on a variety of factors such as cost, end-user application requirements, network efficiency, complexity involved, and revenue considerations. Thus, these goals are subject to tradeoffs based on the above considerations.
2. Overview</p>
<p>There are several options for providing protection of traffic. The most generic requirement is the specification of whether recovery should be via Layer 3 (or IP) rerouting or via MPLS protection switching or rerouting actions.</p>
<p>Generally network operators aim to provide the fastest, most stable, and the best protection mechanism that can be provided at a reasonable cost. The higher the levels of protection, the more the</p>
<p>resources consumed. Therefore it is expected that network operators will offer a spectrum of service levels. MPLS-based recovery should give the flexibility to select the recovery mechanism, choose the granularity at which traffic is protected, and to also choose the specific types of traffic that are protected in order to give operators more control over that tradeoff. With MPLS-based recovery, it can be possible to provide different levels of protection for different classes of service, based on their service requirements. For example, using approaches outlined below, a Virtual Leased Line (VLL) service or real-time applications like Voice over IP (VoIP) may be supported using link/node protection together with preestablished, pre-reserved path protection. Best effort traffic, on the other hand, may use path protection that is established on demand or may simply rely on IP re-route or higher layer recovery mechanisms. As another example of their range of application, MPLSbased recovery strategies may be used to protect traffic not originally flowing on label switched paths, such as IP traffic that is normally routed hop-by-hop, as well as traffic forwarded on label switched paths.</p>
<h1>2.1. Recovery Models</h1>
<p>There are two basic models for path recovery: rerouting and protection switching.</p>
<p>Protection switching and rerouting, as defined below, may be used together. For example, protection switching to a recovery path may be used for rapid restoration of connectivity while rerouting determines a new optimal network configuration, rearranging paths, as needed, at a later time.</p>
<h3>2.1.1 Rerouting</h3>
<p>Recovery by rerouting is defined as establishing new paths or path segments on demand for restoring traffic after the occurrence of a fault. The new paths may be based upon fault information, network routing policies, pre-defined configurations and network topology information. Thus, upon detecting a fault, paths or path segments to bypass the fault are established using signaling.</p>
<p>Once the network routing algorithms have converged after a fault, it may be preferable, in some cases, to reoptimize the network by performing a reroute based on the current state of the network and network policies. This is discussed further in Section 3.8.</p>
<p>In terms of the principles defined in section 3, reroute recovery employs paths established-on-demand with resources reserved-ondemand.</p>
<h1>2.1.2 Protection Switching</h1>
<p>Protection switching recovery mechanisms pre-establish a recovery path or path segment, based upon network routing policies, the restoration requirements of the traffic on the working path, and administrative considerations. The recovery path may or may not be link and node disjoint with the working path. However if the recovery path shares sources of failure with the working path, the overall reliability of the construct is degraded. When a fault is detected, the protected traffic is switched over to the recovery path(s) and restored.</p>
<p>In terms of the principles in section 3, protection switching employs pre-established recovery paths, and, if resource reservation is required on the recovery path, pre-reserved resources. The various sub-types of protection switching are detailed in Section 4.4 of this document.</p>
<h3>2.2. The Recovery Cycles</h3>
<p>There are three defined recovery cycles: the MPLS Recovery Cycle, the MPLS Reversion Cycle and the Dynamic Re-routing Cycle. The first cycle detects a fault and restores traffic onto MPLS-based recovery paths. If the recovery path is non-optimal the cycle may be followed by any of the two latter cycles to achieve an optimized network again. The reversion cycle applies for explicitly routed traffic that does not rely on any dynamic routing protocols to converge. The dynamic re-routing cycle applies for traffic that is forwarded based on hop-by-hop routing.</p>
<h3>2.2.1 MPLS Recovery Cycle Model</h3>
<p>The MPLS recovery cycle model is illustrated in Figure 1. Definitions and a key to abbreviations follow.
<img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1. MPLS Recovery Cycle Model</p>
<p>Sharma \&amp; Hellstrand Informational</p>
<p>The various timing measures used in the model are described below.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>T1 Fault Detection Time
T2 Fault Hold-off Time
T3 Fault Notification Time
T4 Recovery Operation Time
T5 Traffic Recovery Time
</code></pre></div>

<p>Definitions of the recovery cycle times are as follows:
Fault Detection Time
The time between the occurrence of a network impairment and the moment the fault is detected by MPLS-based recovery mechanisms. This time may be highly dependent on lower layer protocols.</p>
<p>Fault Hold-Off Time
The configured waiting time between the detection of a fault and taking MPLS-based recovery action, to allow time for lower layer protection to take effect. The Fault Hold-off Time may be zero.</p>
<p>Note: The Fault Hold-Off Time may occur after the Fault
Notification Time interval if the node responsible for the
switchover, the Path Switch LSR (PSL), rather than the detecting LSR, is configured to wait.</p>
<p>Fault Notification Time
The time between initiation of a Fault Indication Signal (FIS) by the LSR detecting the fault and the time at which the Path Switch LSR (PSL) begins the recovery operation. This is zero if the PSL detects the fault itself or infers a fault from such events as an adjacency failure.</p>
<p>Note: If the PSL detects the fault itself, there still may be a Fault Hold-Off Time period between detection and the start of the recovery operation.</p>
<p>Recovery Operation Time
The time between the first and last recovery actions. This may include message exchanges between the PSL and PML (Path Merge LSR) to coordinate recovery actions.</p>
<p>Traffic Recovery Time
The time between the last recovery action and the time that the traffic (if present) is completely recovered. This interval is intended to account for the time required for traffic to once again arrive at the point in the network that experienced disrupted or degraded service due to the occurrence of the fault (e.g., the PML). This time may depend on the location of the fault, the recovery mechanism, and the propagation delay along the recovery path.</p>
<h1>2.2.2 MPLS Reversion Cycle Model</h1>
<p>Protection switching, revertive mode, requires the traffic to be switched back to a preferred path when the fault on that path is cleared. The MPLS reversion cycle model is illustrated in Figure 2. Note that the cycle shown below comes after the recovery cycle shown in Fig. 1.
<img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2. MPLS Reversion Cycle Model
The various timing measures used in the model are described below.
T7 Fault Clearing Time
T8 Clear Hold-Off Time
T9 Clear Notification Time
T10 Reversion Operation Time
T11 Traffic Reversion Time
Note that time T6 (not shown above) is the time for which the network impairment is not repaired and traffic is flowing on the recovery path.</p>
<p>Definitions of the reversion cycle times are as follows:
Fault Clearing Time
The time between the repair of a network impairment and the time that MPLS-based mechanisms learn that the fault has been cleared. This time may be highly dependent on lower layer protocols.</p>
<p>Clear Hold-Off Time
The configured waiting time between the clearing of a fault and MPLS-based recovery action(s). Waiting time may be needed to ensure that the path is stable and to avoid flapping in cases where a fault is intermittent. The Clear Hold-Off Time may be zero.</p>
<p>Note: The Clear Hold-Off Time may occur after the Clear Notification Time interval if the PSL is configured to wait.</p>
<h1>Clear Notification Time</h1>
<p>The time between initiation of a Fault Recovery Signal (FRS) by the LSR clearing the fault and the time at which the path switch LSR begins the reversion operation. This is zero if the PSL clears the fault itself.</p>
<p>Note: If the PSL clears the fault itself, there still may be a Clear Hold-off Time period between fault clearing and the start of the reversion operation.</p>
<p>Reversion Operation Time
The time between the first and last reversion actions. This may include message exchanges between the PSL and PML to coordinate reversion actions.</p>
<p>Traffic Reversion Time
The time between the last reversion action and the time that traffic (if present) is completely restored on the preferred path. This interval is expected to be quite small since both paths are working and care may be taken to limit the traffic disruption (e.g., using "make before break" techniques and synchronous switch-over).</p>
<p>In practice, the most interesting times in the reversion cycle are the Clear Hold-off Time and the Reversion Operation Time together with Traffic Reversion Time (or some other measure of traffic</p>
<p>disruption). The first interval is to ensure stability of the repaired path and the latter one is to minimize disruption time while the reversion action is in progress.</p>
<p>Given that both paths are available, it is better to wait to have a well-controlled switch-back with minimal disruption than have an immediate operation that may cause new faults to be introduced (except, perhaps, when the recovery path is unable to offer a quality of service comparable to the preferred path).</p>
<h1>2.2.3 Dynamic Re-routing Cycle Model</h1>
<p>Dynamic rerouting aims to bring the IP network to a stable state after a network impairment has occurred. A re-optimized network is achieved after the routing protocols have converged, and the traffic is moved from a recovery path to a (possibly) new working path. The steps involved in this mode are illustrated in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Note that the cycle shown below may be overlaid on the recovery cycle shown in Fig. 1 or the reversion cycle shown in Fig. 2, or both (in the event that both the recovery cycle and the reversion cycle take place before the routing protocols converge), and occurs if after the convergence of the routing protocols it is determined (based on online algorithms or off-line traffic engineering tools, network configuration, or a variety of other possible criteria) that there is a better route for the working path.
<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3. Dynamic Rerouting Cycle Model
The various timing measures used in the model are described below.
T12 Network Route Convergence Time
T13 Hold-down Time (optional)
T14 Switchover Operation Time
T15 Traffic Restoration Time</p>
<p>Network Route Convergence Time
We define the network route convergence time as the time taken for the network routing protocols to converge and for the network to reach a stable state.</p>
<p>Holddown Time
We define the holddown period as a bounded time for which a recovery path must be used. In some scenarios it may be difficult to determine if the working path is stable. In these cases a holddown time may be used to prevent excess flapping of traffic between a working and a recovery path.</p>
<p>Switchover Operation Time
The time between the first and last switchover actions. This may include message exchanges between the PSL and PML to coordinate the switchover actions.</p>
<p>Traffic Restoration Time
The time between the last restoration action and the time that traffic (if present) is completely restored on the new preferred path.
2.2.4 Example Recovery Cycle</p>
<p>As an example of the recovery cycle, we present a sequence of events that occur after a network impairment occurs and when a protection switch is followed by dynamic rerouting.
I. Link or path fault occurs
II. Signaling initiated (FIS) for the detected fault
III. FIS arrives at the PSL
IV. The PSL initiates a protection switch to a pre-configured recovery path
V. The PSL switches over the traffic from the working path to the recovery path
VI. The network enters a semi-stable state
VII. Dynamic routing protocols converge after the fault, and a new working path is calculated (based, for example, on some of the criteria mentioned in Section 2.1.1).
VIII. A new working path is established between the PSL and the PML (assumption is that PSL and PML have not changed)
IX. Traffic is switched over to the new working path.</p>
<h1>2.3. Definitions and Terminology</h1>
<p>This document assumes the terminology given in [RFC3031], and, in addition, introduces the following new terms.</p>
<h3>2.3.1 General Recovery Terminology</h3>
<p>Re-routing
A recovery mechanism in which the recovery path or path segments are created dynamically after the detection of a fault on the working path. In other words, a recovery mechanism in which the recovery path is not pre-established.</p>
<p>Protection Switching
A recovery mechanism in which the recovery path or path segments are created prior to the detection of a fault on the working path. In other words, a recovery mechanism in which the recovery path is pre-established.</p>
<p>Working Path
The protected path that carries traffic before the occurrence of a fault. The working path can be of different kinds; a hop-by-hop routed path, a trunk, a link, an LSP or part of a multipoint-topoint LSP.</p>
<p>Synonyms for a working path are primary path and active path.
Recovery Path
The path by which traffic is restored after the occurrence of a fault. In other words, the path on which the traffic is directed by the recovery mechanism. The recovery path is established by MPLS means. The recovery path can either be an equivalent recovery path and ensure no reduction in quality of service, or be a limited recovery path and thereby not guarantee the same quality of service (or some other criteria of performance) as the working path. A limited recovery path is not expected to be used for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Synonyms for a recovery path are: back-up path, alternative path, and protection path.</p>
<p>Protection Counterpart
The "other" path when discussing pre-planned protection switching schemes. The protection counterpart for the working path is the recovery path and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Path Switch LSR (PSL)
An LSR that is responsible for switching or replicating the traffic between the working path and the recovery path.</p>
<p>Path Merge LSR (PML)
An LSR that is responsible for receiving the recovery path traffic, and either merging the traffic back onto the working path, or, if it is itself the destination, passing the traffic on to the higher layer protocols.</p>
<p>Point of Repair (POR)
An LSR that is setup for performing MPLS recovery. In other words, an LSR that is responsible for effecting the repair of an LSP. The POR, for example, can be a PSL or a PML, depending on the type of recovery scheme employed.</p>
<p>Intermediate LSR
An LSR on a working or recovery path that is neither a PSL nor a PML for that path.</p>
<p>Path Group (PG)
A logical bundling of multiple working paths, each of which is routed identically between a Path Switch LSR and a Path Merge LSR.</p>
<p>Protected Path Group (PPG)
A path group that requires protection.
Protected Traffic Portion (PTP)
The portion of the traffic on an individual path that requires protection. For example, code points in the EXP bits of the shim header may identify a protected portion.</p>
<p>Bypass Tunnel
A path that serves to back up a set of working paths using the label stacking approach [RFC3031]. The working paths and the bypass tunnel must all share the same path switch LSR (PSL) and the path merge LSR (PML).</p>
<p>Switch-Over
The process of switching the traffic from the path that the traffic is flowing on onto one or more alternate path(s). This may involve moving traffic from a working path onto one or more recovery paths, or may involve moving traffic from a recovery path(s) on to a more optimal working path(s).</p>
<p>Switch-Back
The process of returning the traffic from one or more recovery paths back to the working path(s).</p>
<p>Revertive Mode
A recovery mode in which traffic is automatically switched back from the recovery path to the original working path upon the restoration of the working path to a fault-free condition. This assumes a failed working path does not automatically surrender resources to the network.</p>
<p>Non-revertive Mode
A recovery mode in which traffic is not automatically switched back to the original working path after this path is restored to a fault-free condition. (Depending on the configuration, the original working path may, upon moving to a fault-free condition, become the recovery path, or it may be used for new working traffic, and be no longer associated with its original recovery path, i.e., is surrendered to the network.)</p>
<p>MPLS Protection Domain
The set of LSRs over which a working path and its corresponding recovery path are routed.</p>
<p>MPLS Protection Plan
The set of all LSP protection paths and the mapping from working to protection paths deployed in an MPLS protection domain at a given time.</p>
<h1>Liveness Message</h1>
<p>A message exchanged periodically between two adjacent LSRs that serves as a link probing mechanism. It provides an integrity check of the forward and the backward directions of the link between the two LSRs as well as a check of neighbor aliveness.</p>
<p>Path Continuity Test
A test that verifies the integrity and continuity of a path or path segment. The details of such a test are beyond the scope of this document. (This could be accomplished, for example, by transmitting a control message along the same links and nodes as the data traffic or similarly could be measured by the absence of traffic and by providing feedback.)
2.3.2 Failure Terminology</p>
<p>Path Failure (PF)
Path failure is a fault detected by MPLS-based recovery mechanisms, which is defined as the failure of the liveness message test or a path continuity test, which indicates that path connectivity is lost.</p>
<p>Path Degraded (PD)
Path degraded is a fault detected by MPLS-based recovery mechanisms that indicates that the quality of the path is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Link Failure (LF)
A lower layer fault indicating that link continuity is lost. This may be communicated to the MPLS-based recovery mechanisms by the lower layer.</p>
<p>Link Degraded (LD)
A lower layer indication to MPLS-based recovery mechanisms that the link is performing below an acceptable level.</p>
<p>Fault Indication Signal (FIS)
A signal that indicates that a fault along a path has occurred. It is relayed by each intermediate LSR to its upstream or downstream neighbor, until it reaches an LSR that is setup to perform MPLS recovery (the POR). The FIS is transmitted</p>
<p>periodically by the node/nodes closest to the point of failure, for some configurable length of time or until the transmitting node receives an acknowledgement from its neighbor.</p>
<p>Fault Recovery Signal (FRS)
A signal that indicates a fault along a working path has been repaired. Again, like the FIS, it is relayed by each intermediate LSR to its upstream or downstream neighbor, until is reaches the LSR that performs recovery of the original path. The FRS is transmitted periodically by the node/nodes closest to the point of failure, for some configurable length of time or until the transmitting node receives an acknowledgement from its neighbor.

3. MPLS-based Recovery Principles</p>
<p>MPLS-based recovery refers to the ability to effect quick and complete restoration of traffic affected by a fault in an MPLSenabled network. The fault may be detected on the IP layer or in lower layers over which IP traffic is transported. Fastest MPLS recovery is assumed to be achieved with protection switching and may be viewed as the MPLS LSR switch completion time that is comparable to, or equivalent to, the 50 ms switch-over completion time of the SONET layer. Further, MPLS-based recovery may provide bandwidth protection for paths that require it. This section provides a discussion of the concepts and principles of MPLS-based recovery. The concepts are presented in terms of atomic or primitive terms that may be combined to specify recovery approaches. We do not make any assumptions about the underlying layer 1 or layer 2 transport mechanisms or their recovery mechanisms.</p>
<h1>3.1. Configuration of Recovery</h1>
<p>An LSR may support any or all of the following recovery options on a per-path basis:</p>
<p>Default-recovery (No MPLS-based recovery enabled): Traffic on the working path is recovered only via Layer 3 or IP rerouting or by some lower layer mechanism such as SONET APS. This is equivalent to having no MPLS-based recovery. This option may be used for low priority traffic or for traffic that is recovered in another way (for example load shared traffic on parallel working paths may be automatically recovered upon a fault along one of the working paths by distributing it among the remaining working paths).</p>
<p>Recoverable (MPLS-based recovery enabled): This working path is recovered using one or more recovery paths, either via rerouting or via protection switching.</p>
<h3>3.2. Initiation of Path Setup</h3>
<p>There are three options for the initiation of the recovery path setup. The active and recovery paths may be established by using either RSVP-TE [RFC2205][RFC3209] or CR-LDP [RFC3212], or by any other means including SNMP.</p>
<p>Pre-established:
This is the same as the protection switching option. Here a recovery path(s) is established prior to any failure on the working path. The path selection can either be determined by an administrative centralized tool, or chosen based on some algorithm implemented at the PSL and possibly intermediate nodes. To guard against the situation when the pre-established recovery path fails before or at the same time as the working path, the recovery path should have secondary configuration options as explained in Section 3.3 below.</p>
<p>Pre-Qualified:
A pre-established path need not be created, it may be prequalified. A pre-qualified recovery path is not created expressly for protecting the working path, but instead is a path created for other purposes that is designated as a recovery path after determining that it is an acceptable alternative for carrying the working path traffic. Variants include the case where an optical path or trail is configured, but no switches are set.</p>
<p>Established-on-Demand:
This is the same as the rerouting option. Here, a recovery path is established after a failure on its working path has been detected and notified to the PSL. The recovery path may be precomputed or computed on demand, which influences recovery times.</p>
<h1>3.3. Initiation of Resource Allocation</h1>
<p>A recovery path may support the same traffic contract as the working path, or it may not. We will distinguish these two situations by using different additive terms. If the recovery path is capable of replacing the working path without degrading service, it will be called an equivalent recovery path. If the recovery path lacks the resources (or resource reservations) to replace the working path without degrading service, it will be called a limited recovery path. Based on this, there are two options for the initiation of resource allocation:</p>
<p>Pre-reserved:
This option applies only to protection switching. Here a preestablished recovery path reserves required resources on all hops along its route during its establishment. Although the reserved resources (e.g., bandwidth and/or buffers) at each node cannot be used to admit more working paths, they are available to be used by all traffic that is present at the node before a failure occurs. The resources held by a set of recovery paths may be shared if they protect resources that are not simultaneously subject to failure.</p>
<p>Reserved-on-Demand:
This option may apply either to rerouting or to protection switching. Here a recovery path reserves the required resources after a failure on the working path has been detected and notified to the PSL and before the traffic on the working path is switched over to the recovery path.</p>
<p>Note that under both the options above, depending on the amount of resources reserved on the recovery path, it could either be an equivalent recovery path or a limited recovery path.</p>
<h1>3.3.1 Subtypes of Protection Switching</h1>
<p>The resources (bandwidth, buffers, processing) on the recovery path may be used to carry either a copy of the working path traffic or extra traffic that is displaced when a protection switch occurs. This leads to two subtypes of protection switching.</p>
<p>In 1+1 ("one plus one") protection, the resources (bandwidth, buffers, processing capacity) on the recovery path are fully reserved, and carry the same traffic as the working path. Selection between the traffic on the working and recovery paths is made at the path merge LSR (PML). In effect the PSL function is deprecated to establishment of the working and recovery paths and a simple replication function. The recovery intelligence is delegated to the PML.</p>
<p>In 1:1 ("one for one") protection, the resources (if any) allocated on the recovery path are fully available to preemptible low priority traffic except when the recovery path is in use due to a fault on the working path. In other words, in 1:1 protection, the protected traffic normally travels only on the working path, and is switched to the recovery path only when the working path has a fault. Once the protection switch is initiated, the low priority traffic being carried on the recovery path may be displaced by the protected traffic. This method affords a way to make efficient use of the recovery path resources.</p>
<p>This concept can be extended to 1:n (one for n) and m:n (m for n) protection.</p>
<h3>3.4. Scope of Recovery</h3>
<h3>3.4.1 Topology</h3>
<h3>3.4.1.1 Local Repair</h3>
<p>The intent of local repair is to protect against a link or neighbor node fault and to minimize the amount of time required for failure propagation. In local repair (also known as local recovery), the node immediately upstream of the fault is the one to initiate recovery (either rerouting or protection switching). Local repair can be of two types:</p>            </div>
