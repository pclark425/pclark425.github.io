                <p><strong>Paper Venue:</strong> British Journal for the Philosophy of Science</p>
                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The main arguments against hybrid concepts are examined and it is concluded that, even if not successful, they challenge hybridism to find a robust criterion for concept individuation and to show an explanatory advantage for hybrid concepts.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The renewed interest in concepts and their role in psychological theorizing is partially motivated by Machery's claim that concepts are so heterogeneous that they have no explanatory role. Against this, pluralism argues that there is multiplicity of different concepts for any given category, while hybridism argues that a concept is constituted by a rich common representation. This paper aims to advance the understanding of the hybrid view of concepts. First, we examine the main arguments against hybrid concepts, and conclude that, even if not successful, they challenge hybridism to find a robust criterion for concept individuation, and to show an explanatory advantage for hybrid concepts. Then we propose such a criterion of individuation, which we will call functional stable coactivation. Finally, we examine the prospects of hybridism to understand what is involved in recent approaches to categorization and meaning-extraction.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction: the heterogeneity of conceptual representations</h2>
<p>The last years have seen a renewed philosophical interest in the nature of concepts and their role in psychological theorizing. In a widely discussed book, Machery ([2009]) proposed that cognitive science can do without concepts. The main basis for this eliminativist conclusion was the multiplicity of representational structures that are posited in psychological theories to account for the array of effects found in the last decades of categorization research. Prototypes, exemplars, theory-like networks, and ideals have been proposed as the best explanation for different sorts of findings (see Murphy [2002]; Kruschke [2005]; or Machery [2009]) for reviews of the literature from different perspectives). This heterogeneity, along with certain ideas about what a natural kind</p>
<p>is and how concepts are to be individuated, led Machery to the conclusion that so-called concepts do not share any interesting property to be regarded as a unified natural kind, so there was no point in trying to investigate their nature (Machery [2005]). A number of authors raised objections to this pessimistic conclusion (e.g., see replies to Machery [2010]). Among those that accept the multiplicity of representations disclosed by concept research there are two main reactions. One is to argue for a pluralist stance (Piccinini and Scott [2006]; Weiskopf [2009]); the other is to endorse a hybridist view of concepts (e.g., Gonnerman and Weinberg [2010]; Keil [2010]; Scarantino [2010]). The main difference between both approaches has to do with the question whether the different kinds of representations posited to explain categorization results are or are not separate from each other. The pluralist thinks that for any given category C there are typically several different representations in long-term memory -a prototype of C , a set of exemplars of C , and so on. These representations are actually different concepts that are stored separately, operate independently, and are usually accessed in different tasks. The hybridist thinks that the different representations are in fact parts of a common representation, which constitutes the concept for C . They are stored in longterm memory as a functional whole and all of them can be accessed in the same task (at least to some degree, more on this below).</p>
<p>The debate connects with recent considerations about the need to posit different kinds of representations to account for categorization results. Initially the crux of the debate on categorization was whether a single representational kind can accommodate the results better than the alternatives. Yet in the last years it is increasingly acknowledged that there are multiple representations involved in categorization processes. To mention but a few, Ashby and O'Brien ([2005]) review the evidence that different memory systems may be involved in different category learning processes; Kruschke ([2005]) thinks that the full complexity of human category learning cannot be accounted for by a single type of representation; Voorspoels et al. ([2011]) endorse this conclusion and, in particular, explore the idea that the human conceptual system includes both exemplar representations and abstracted summary representations. Thus the emphasis has moved to</p>
<p>characterize which elements affect differential processing of those representations, and how they actually interact. For instance, Ashby and O'Brien mark as 'questions for future research' whether the multiple memory systems involved in category learning operate independently or cooperate in some way, and whether there is "a consolidation of learning into some common long-term (...) category representation". To a large extent, these are questions to address empirically. Yet there is also room for a lot of conceptual work on how to characterize notions such as "operate independently" or "common representation", which have to do with how best to individuate concepts.</p>
<p>In this paper we want to defend the view that hybrid concepts are preferable to the alternatives in terms of their explanatory power. First, we will examine the arguments put forward against hybrid concepts. We will conclude that, even if they are not final against hybridism, they challenge this position to a) find a robust criterion for hybrid concept individuation, i.e., to tell when two distinct representational structures can be said to be constitutive of the same concept; and b) show an explanatory advantage for hybrid concepts. Second, we will propose such a criterion of individuation, which we will call functional stable coactivation. In a nutshell, the idea is that different structures can be regarded as constituting a common representation when they are activated concurrently, in a way that is functionally significant for the task at hand, and in patterns that remain substantially stable along different tasks related to the same category. Third, we will argue that hybridism does not just equal eliminativism and pluralism in explanatory power. We will examine two strands in the literature that may be better explained by such hybrid concepts: on the one hand, recent work on categorization shows that conceptual structure has the form of rich, heterogeneous representations; on the other, work on meaning extraction shows that we can explain linguistic understanding if we postulate that lexical entries either consist in, or give access to, a rich but integrated conceptual structure which may well include a theory, a prototype, an exemplar-based computational mechanism, etc. ${ }^{1}$</p>
<h1>2. Two challenges for hybrid concepts: individuation and explanation</h1>
<p>Arguments against hybrid concepts have been most explicitly formulated by Machery ([2009], [2010]), Machery and Seppälä ([2011]), and Weiskopf ([2009]). Machery proposed two criteria for concept individuation that, he argued, are not actually met by hybrid theories of concepts. Weiskopf's strategy against hybridism is different: he provides two arguments that lead to the conclusion that hybrid concepts are either unmanageable or explanatorily superfluous. So Machery challenges hybridism to provide adequate criteria of individuation for hybrid concepts, while Weiskopf challenges hybridism to tell what explanatory advantage it provides. Let us consider both challenges in turn.</p>
<h3>2.1. The coordination criterion</h3>
<p>Machery's proposal is that a number of representations count as a single concept when they meet two different criteria, which he calls connection and coordination. According to the connection criterion, two representations count as parts of the same concept when they are connected in such a way that retrieval of one of them typically facilitates retrieval of the other in different cognitive tasks. For instance, if one part is used in, e.g., categorization, then another can be used in induction. According to the coordination criterion "the parts of a given concept do not produce inconsistent outcomes, for instance, inconsistent categorization judgments" ([2009], p. 64). We will concentrate on coordination because it is the criterion that Machery emphasizes (Machery [2009]; Machery and Seppälä, [2011]). As for connection, there seems to be plenty of evidence that we indeed may categorize something as an X in terms of prototypes and then induce that it has some properties based on an X-theory. For instance, we may categorize an animal that we see near the shore as a bird based on its sharing enough features with the bird-prototype and then induce, on the basis of our knowledge of sea-birds, that it probably eats fish (see Murphy [2002], Ch. 5, for discussion). ${ }^{2}$</p>
<p>Machery contends that hybridism and his own "heterogeneity hypothesis" are just terminological variants of the same position unless the hybridist commits herself to the existence of some mechanism of coordination between parts. He contends that hybrid concept theories entail predictions about categorization judgments that are not actually fulfilled, i.e., there are many cases of inconsistent categorization judgments that give the lie to hybrid views. Even though the first case he discusses is Malt's ([1994]) findings concerning people's categorization of water, the bulk of the cases draw from linguistic intuitions. Machery ([2009], p. 71) writes: "According to hybrid theories of concepts, a sentence ' $x$ is a $P$ ' should typically not be ambiguous. For the parts of a given concept of P are not supposed to be independent ways of thinking about P. By contrast, according to the Heterogeneity Hypothesis... a sentence ' $x$ is a P' will sometimes be ambiguous. Linguistic evidence supports the Heterogeneity Hypothesis". The evidence he presents is that sentences such as 'Tina Turner is a grandmother' or 'tomatoes are vegetables' are true under one reading and false under another.</p>
<p>However, Machery's argument is not convincing. Parts of concepts have to be coordinated in some way to be properly considered as parts of a single concept, but this does not mean that they have to be coordinated in such a way that they do not result in inconsistent judgments. That is to say: the no-inconsistency requirement is stronger than the coordination requirement, and Machery does not provide any specific argument for the no-inconsistency requirement. Indeed, most critics have questioned the principle of coordination (see Gonnerman and Weinberg [2010]; Keil [2010]; Scarantino, [2010]). On the other hand, the inconsistency phenomenon that Machery identifies is a well-known phenomenon that suggests that, in very many occasions, the constituents of utterancemeanings are modulations of concepts or parts of them (we will deal with this in section 4.2). This entails that the test of inconsistency does not reveal that people are applying different concepts. And in particular, it means that inconsistency is in fact to be expected if prototypes, theories, etc., are parts of larger conceptual structures.</p>
<p>Machery and Seppälä ([2011]) argue that their linguistic data support a "polysemy</p>
<p>hypothesis" concerning prototypes and theories. In turn, they hold that this polysemy hypothesis supports their heterogeneity hypothesis. However, it is simply not the case that the polysemy hypothesis supports heterogeneity. The typical explanations of polysemy resort to different senses (or aspects, or facets, or parts) of just one concept (see Pustejovsky [1995]; Cruse [2004]); for a proper discussion of polysemy, see section 4.2.2). The archetypical example of polysemy is that of 'book', which stands for a concept that has two different aspects: the text/content aspect, and the tome/physical object aspect. To be sure, 'book' provokes "in a sense, yes, in a sense, no" truthevaluations. Suppose you have an exemplar of Madame Bovary in your hands and someone else says 'that book is nice'. She may mean that she likes that particular instance of $M B$, that is, that she likes the book as a physical object, or that she likes $M B$, i.e., the content of the book that Flaubert wrote. Suppose further that, as it happens, the book you are holding in your hands is a paperback pocket old edition of $M B$ whose cover is full of coffee stains. In that situation, your friend's words, if they are not ironic, will mean that she likes the text, not that she likes the tome. So what she says is in a sense true and in another sense false. The book is nice in a sense, and is not nice in another (in one and another sense of BOOK). Yet, as we say, while this can be taken to show that 'book' is polysemous -and 'book' is indeed polysemous-, it is usually held that there is just one concept at play. In sum, the "polysemy hypothesis" points towards hybridism, rather than towards heterogeneity. In other words: if it is conceded that 'Tina Turner is a grandmother' is ambiguous because 'grandmother' can express either a stored prototype or a stored theory (or definition), the hybridist can point to the 'book' case and say "yes, words can express different parts of a single concept on different occasions".</p>
<p>So there are powerful reasons to think that the coordination criterion is a red herring. Indeed, Machery ([2010]) eventually admits that it may ultimately fail as a criterion. Still, he challenges the hybrid theorist to provide an alternative characterization of the notion of conceptual parthood. We agree that this is a major task to sustain a theoretically cogent notion of hybrid concepts, and we will devote the next section to such an undertaking, but first we want to engage Weiskopf's distrust</p>
<p>of hybrids, which poses a different kind of challenge.</p>
<h1>2.2. Concepts as constituents of thoughts</h1>
<p>Weiskopf makes two points against hybrid concepts. The first is that "big" concepts cannot be the elements of thought. The second, that there is a problem concerning the selection of parts of concepts. Let us quote him at length:
"Concepts then might be thought of as single, structured bundles containing exemplars, prototypes, theoretical information, causal information, category ideals, etc. This representational inflation faces at least two problems. First, structures that include all of a person's ways of representing a category are too large to serve as units of thought. Working memory, where concepts are assembled on-line into thoughts, has limited capacity, which in effect imposes architectural limits on the size of human concepts. Second, there is no reason to think that all category information is retrieved and used each time a person tokens a concept. The experimental data surveyed so far tend to show effects attributable to some relatively well-delimited subset of this information, rather than to the entire bundle. The question then becomes how to selectively retrieve parts of this large body of information to serve the immediate goals of the subject better. But again, this begins to collapse into the pluralist position" (Weiskopf [2009], p. 169)</p>
<p>The first argument is flawed. The philosophical tradition (and a good part of the psychological tradition as well) has it that concepts are the constituents of thoughts, such that only what goes into a thought can be properly be called 'a concept'. The problem for large bodies of information to be part of thoughts, according to Weiskopf, is that concepts are assembled into thoughts in working memory, and working memory cannot work with large bodies of information. However, we think</p>
<p>that there are reasons to doubt the assumption that thoughts are constructed in working memory out of concepts. Indeed, if this assumption were accepted, it would undermine both hybridism and Weiskopf's own pluralism. Let us explain.</p>
<p>The mainstream view about concepts, which Weiskopf endorses, is that they are more or less stable bodies of information stored in long-term memory (or, stored in memory, period). Against this more or less orthodox view, Barsalou ([1999]) is notable for holding that concepts are temporary constructs of working memory, on-the-fly constructions which lack stability. The mainstream position has it that Barsalou's "concepts" are constructs that draw from information stored in memory, that is, from concepts in the orthodox sense. However, there is one point that seems well-established, namely, that Barsalou-concepts are what he claims them to be, i.e., unstable representations. The evidence he has amassed is convincing enough. Typically, our categorization is sensitive to background factors such that a change in these background factors entails a change in our categorization. So, Weiskopf's invocation of working memory is counterproductive: working memory does not work with the huge representations posited by hybridism, but most probably it does not work with Weiskopf's concepts either. The representations tokened in working memory are typically not the representations stored in long-term memory. Suppose, for instance, that concepts were prototypes: the unstable prototype used in working memory does not need to be -and will typically not be- the alleged stable prototype stored in memory and constitutive of the concept. Rather, it will be an instance of the prototype that will include only contextually relevant features. That is, it can be argued that the constituents of thoughts are usually slimmer than full-fledged concepts, i.e. bodies of information stored in memory, either because they are constructions derived from them ${ }^{3}$ or because they are parts of full-fledged, stored concepts. If this is a problem, then it is as problematic for hybrid concepts as it is for Weiskopf's plural concepts, given that any subkind of the plurality will suffer from it.</p>
<p>The second problem for "big concepts" comes from Weiskopf's assumption that to posit a hybrid concept is to posit a representation that is "employed in all circumstances when a concept is</p>
<p>entertained and used". He argues that this poses a dilemma for hybrids: "either they fall short of accounting for some phenomenon or other, or they attempt to account for everything and grow to the point of being unmanageable". In fact, the evidence shows that only a delimited subset of such a big structure is "retrieved and used" in each cognitive task, so Weiskopf contends that "this begins to collapse into the pluralist position". The idea is that the pluralist individuates concepts in terms of the functions they serve in different cognitive processes. For instance, if certain tasks involving category C demand prototype processing, and certain other tasks demand exemplar processing, then one can conclude that we have two different concepts of C , respectively prototype-based and exemplar-based. Given that the hybrid theory has to allow that only a subpart of the hybrid concept will be used in each occasion, it will have to concede that different subparts count as different functional units, even if they are somehow linked in long-term memory. But then the hybrid explanation will not be different from the pluralist one, and the greater parsimony of the latter will lead us to dispose of the notion of hybrid as an unnecessary add-on.</p>
<p>In short, Weiskopf is posing a challenge for hybrid theory that goes further than Machery's. The problem is not only to find a robust criterion for hybrid individuation -i.e., one that shows when different representations can be seen as forming a single concept- but also to say which explanatory advantage our theory gains in talking about such a heterogeneous structure instead of talking merely about its putatively component parts. We think that there is a kernel of truth in his claim that, if the hybridist wants to develop a position that is relevantly different from pluralism, she has to assume that the whole representation that constitutes the hybrid concept is "employed in all circumstances when a concept is entertained and used". However, the notion of "employing a concept" cannot mean, as we saw, that the whole concept is retrieved in working memory. There is a weaker and more plausible reading, i.e., that the whole conceptual representation has a role to play. The possibility that the rich, heterogeneous, structure plays a role even if it is not retrieved in working memory will become apparent once one pays attention to an important distinction regarding what it takes to access a concept, an idea that we develop in the next section.</p>
<h1>3. Individuating hybrids: functional stable coactivation</h1>
<p>As we said above, we concur with Machery in regarding concept individuation as a pressing issue for hybridism. To put it roughly, a concept will be something that is constituted by a number of representational elements, some of them possibly shared by other different concepts, and what matters for concept individuation is to explain what keeps those elements together. Let us begin by seeing how Weiskopf proposes to individuate concepts. Weiskopf contends that concepts are individuated "primarily by the content that they represent and by how they represent it; a cat concept is that concept because it represents cats in whatever way that it does" ([2009], p. 147). The first part (the content) is a condition of coreferentiality, i.e., non-coreferential concepts count ipso facto, as different concepts ${ }^{4}$. The way Weiskopf fleshes out the "how" condition, in turn, is by typifying concepts in terms of the different structures involved. So if you have, say, a prototype, an exemplar, and a theory associated to the same category, you will have three different concepts of the same thing. Yet there is some link between those different concepts: "What makes $\mathrm{CAT}<em 2="2">{1}, \mathrm{CAT}</em>$, etc. all cat concepts is that they refer to cats. What enables the thinker to recognize this fact is that they are connected to one another via identity links that indicate this co-reference relation to the thinker." ([2009], p. 166). Weiskopf calls referential chaining to the mechanism that establishes the links, and the result is that "concepts are stored, linked together, and retrieved by a set of memory processes that are indifferent to the subkind that they belong to".</p>
<p>We think that the notion of referential chaining is too weak. What the literature on concept development shows is that typical processes of acquisition integrate information. ${ }^{5}$ What the hybridist claims is that such an integration process is better understood as the formation of a rich common representational structure that constitutes the concept. What Weiskopf labels $\mathrm{CAT}<em 2="2">{1}$ and $\mathrm{CAT}</em>$ are but different parts or instances, drawn to working memory under the pressure of task demands, of that rich, common concept. The criterion we propose to tell when different representational</p>
<p>structures can be regarded as constituting a common conceptual representation is functional stable coactivation. The idea is that representations belong to the same concept when (i) they are activated concurrently by the same pattern of stimulus, even if only some of them are selected for further processing, (ii) what is activated has some functional significance for the task at hand, even if it is not responsible for the main effects, and (iii) the coactivation patterns remain substantially stable in tasks related to the same category. The three conditions in the criterion play different roles, so let us elaborate a little on each of them.</p>
<p>The coactivation condition (i) captures the idea that when a concept is retrieved all its component parts are retrieved at the same time, given a certain time span. ${ }^{6}$ Which time span is actually relevant is something for empirical research to ascertain. On the one hand, spreading activation models where each node counts as a concept employ very low values -for instance, Anderson's ACT (Anderson [1983]) posits that it takes about 1 millisecond for each link to be activated. On the other hand, if each concept, as we think it will be the case, is itself realized in a network-like structure then a higher value will probably have to be admitted. At any rate, we think it will have to be a value that makes it unlikely that in cases of priming the concept activated by the prime (say, 'car') forms part of the concept activated by the target (say, 'bus'), given the lag between prime and target.</p>
<p>Now, even if all concept parts are activated concurrently, not all of them need to be selected for further processing. This distinction is relevant to tell the pluralist and hybridist positions apart. First, let us note that a number of concept theorists have warned that it is necessary to distinguish questions of representation from questions of access. For instance, Murphy ([2002]) suggests that the evidence found in research on categorization perhaps does not tell much about concept representation but about access to this representation. This means that claims, say, about exemplars explaining better some categorization effect for a certain concept C are just claims that exemplars are accessed, not that the whole representation of C is constituted by exemplars. Thus the actual representation could consist of a hybrid concept combining prototypes and exemplars, with the</p>
<p>different parts accessed for different tasks. However, the pluralist can always argue that this possibility has no explanatory value given that what is relevant to account for experimental effects is only what is accessed. So the fact that there can be more represented than what is actually accessed does not per se show that what is represented constitutes a single concept whose parts are those different structures accessed in each occasion.</p>
<p>To address this issue we need to make a distinction in the notion of 'what is accessed'. Let us begin by noting that whenever a certain stimulus is processed a vast amount of representations can receive some activation. It is reasonable to assume that a certain representation counts as 'accessed' when its activation goes above certain threshold. Most of the representations accessed in this way are not subject to further processing and its activation may simply decay. Yet a few of them -which ones depends on factors such as kind of task, attentional focus, contextual properties, and otherswill remain active, will possibly be drawn to working memory, and will be selected for further processing. So there are two dimensions in the notion of 'accessed': to be activated, and to be selected. The coactivation condition merely points out that all the parts of the same concept are activated concurrently, not that all of them are actually selected to play the leading role in a given task. Still, the pluralist might press the point by arguing that only what is selected is relevant for concept identification given that only what is selected is functionally significant. This leads us to the second element of our criterion, i.e., functionality.</p>
<p>The functionality condition (ii) says that in order to count as part of the same concept the coactivated elements must have some functional significance, even if not all them are responsible of the main effects. Typically, main effects are related to what is selected, which receives further processing and hence plays the prominent role in explanation. Thus if a certain categorization effect is explained by appeal to exemplar concepts, this means that the categorization judgment is carried out selecting and processing exemplars. Yet this does not mean that what is only activated is not functionally significant. We think that examples of this can be found in research showing that having more semantic features (Moss et al. [2007]) or more senses (Azuma and van Orden [1997];</p>
<p>Klepousniotou and Baum [2007]) is beneficial for conceptual processing. As we will explain later, a reasonable explanation is that features and senses are parts of the same concept that are coactivated in a way that has a functional effect in which and how the features/senses relevant for the task are selected.</p>
<p>The functionality condition is meant to discard irrelevant information: when retrieving a particular concept it is likely that there will be representations that are activated at the same time yet are ineffectual for the task at hand. The idea behind functionality is that only representational components that make a positive contribution to select the appropriate tokening of the concept count as part of such a concept. For instance, representations that are coactivated but that compete against each other cannot be regarded as part of the same concept. This helps to see why two homonymous meanings cannot be the same concept. In some cases of homonymy resolution (e.g., when both meanings are equally frequent: see Frisson [2009]) both meanings receive activation, which means that two different representations are coactivated. However, it is customary in the homonymy literature to consider that homonymous meanings are separate representations. The reason is that the process of meaning-extraction in these cases is one of competition: accessed representations compete against each other.</p>
<p>The stability condition (iii) deals with the problem that when retrieving a particular concept it may be the case that, depending on the contextual details of the task, other representations that are not constitutive of the concept will be activated at the same time and even influence the result of the cognitive process. The idea behind (iii) is to prevent those more or less variable but functional representational additions from being regarded as components of the concept. One may wonder whether this may allow too much as constitutive of the concept, given that a word may stably give access to different semantically close representations. ${ }^{7}$ Suppose that a word were capable of activating a whole conceptual field: one would not wish to include the whole field as part of the corresponding concept. Notice, however, two things: First, that the fact that other concepts are activated does not necessarily mean that they will be functional for the task at hand. So there can be</p>
<p>conceptually close information that is accessed and yet -just as in the case of coactivated homonymous words- does not play any functional role, so its activation will typically decline rapidly. Secondly, stability is quite a demanding condition: it does not require that all the representations that constitute a concept be activated in all cases, but it requires that they are activated in most cases. Representations that are only semantically related to a concept may be activated in many contexts, but they are not stably activated across contexts. For instance, the "tome" sense of BOOK seems to be stably activated when we hear 'book', even when the sense intended is the "information" sense, as in 'I have my next book in mind'. This is why we could continue this sentence with 'it will be heavy'. However, representations related to the "tome" aspect of BOOK will be active mostly only when this "tome" sense comes to the fore, and not when the sense that comes to the fore is the "information" sense. ${ }^{8}$</p>
<p>We want to emphasize that the three conditions work together in such a way that they constrain each other. For instance, when one thinks of the vast amount of information that can be functionally relevant for a given task, one can concentrate only on those pieces that go reliably together at different moments and tasks -i.e., that are stably coactivated- in order to individuate concepts. Yet they cannot be regarded as strict necessary and sufficient conditions for concepthood, so the criterion provides no clear-cut boundaries between concepts. Again, when one thinks of the similar problems faced by any account of concepts that regards them as structured entities -e.g., the problem of individuating prototypes- one may suspect that perhaps there are no such neat boundaries to be found. So we doubt that it will be possible to find concept elements that are always functionally and stably coactivated, and we are satisfied with elements that typically meet the three conditions, however inherently vague the notion of typical may seem.</p>
<h1>4. The explanatory power of hybrid concepts</h1>
<p>Of course, it is one thing to offer a criterion for individuating hybrid concepts, and a very different</p>
<p>one to find whether there are instances of such concepts that play an explanatory role in psychological models. Let us summarize when a model will lend support to the hybrid view of concepts in the following two claims:</p>
<p>1) Heterogeneity claim: The model sustains the idea that there is a common long-term representation that does not belong to a single representational kind.
2) Functional integration claim: This common long-term representation is functionally integrated.</p>
<p>We think that the most pressing problem for the hybridist comes from the element of functional integration. Models that merely appeal to heterogeneous representations could have a more parsimonious explanation in pluralist terms. To use the toy illustration above: suppose that a model appeals to prototype and exemplar representations to account for different categorization effects but that when the prototypes are selected the exemplars are functionally inert, and vice versa. Then the pluralist can say that there is no gain in hypothesizing a hybrid prototype-cum-exemplar concept. The hybridist needs then to show that the representational components are functionally integrated in the sense that all of them have some impact in the outcome of the subsequent processing, even those that do not seem to be subsequently selected and processed themselves. At the end of the day the hybrid view may be facing a sort of trade-off between heterogeneity and functional integration: on the one hand, a concept will look as more genuinely hybrid inasmuch as it is actually composed by structurally heterogeneous subparts but then the problem is how to avoid the pluralist account in which each subpart counts as a different concept; on the other hand, functional integration prevents the pluralist stance but the problem is that the more functional integration one finds, the more difficult it gets to find structurally heterogeneous subparts, and the less hybrid the concept will look. ${ }^{9}$</p>
<p>In this section we examine two different areas of research -categorization and meaning extraction- to assess the prospects of hybridist explanations in them. We begin with categorization given that it is the phenomenon where eliminativism and pluralism chiefly put their focus,</p>
<p>examining some lines of research that have been overlooked by both positions. Yet we think that processes of meaning-extraction in linguistic comprehension provide a more solid hybridist explanation. As Medin and Rips ([2005], pp. 62-3) point out, sometimes both areas of research seem to be playing with different notions of concept. Yet we agree with them that "it cannot be true that the concepts we use in online sentence understanding are unrelated to the concepts we employ in reasoning and categorizing". We expect that at some point theories will converge and that some hybrid account of concepts will eventually be in a better explanatory position.</p>
<h1>4.1. Categorization</h1>
<p>Research on categorization shows that it is certainly difficult for a single theory of concepts to account for all the data, and what counts as categorization can be quite diverse (see Malt and Sloman [2007]). Prototype theories may be good at explaining some typicality effects, but they fail at explaining categorization by essence. Theory theories can explain categorization by essence, but they do not have an explanation for typicality effects, and so on and so forth. As we said, pluralism concludes from all this that for a given category there are different kinds of concepts, while eliminativism claims that there are no such things as concepts. According to hybridism, a better explanation lies in regarding a concept as an integrated heterogeneous structure. Depending on the task at hand, and on background factors, one part or another of this complex structure receives more activation and plays the leading functional role. Taken separately, prototypes, theories, etc. may be not concepts, but components of concepts.</p>
<p>Now, one may worry that the differences between hybridism and its competitors are merely a matter of terminological preference, so all that is at stake is how to label the heterogeneity of representational structures that everybody pretty much agrees are involved in categorization. Indeed, whether a model received the label of 'hybrid' is not a guarantee that it cannot be interpreted in pluralist terms. Some models of categorization (e.g., Anderson and Betz [2001];</p>
<p>Erickson and Kruschke [1998]) seem to comply with the heterogeneity claim in the sense that they appeal to more than one kind of representational structure (prototypes plus exemplars, exemplars plus rules, etc.) to be recruited for each different task. These are probably the kinds of models that traditionally are posited as hybrid. Yet it is unclear whether those representations are functionally integrated or are merely co-opted in different contexts. This is why these models are prone to the eliminativist criticism and why a pluralist explanation could still be suitable for them.</p>
<p>Other models deal more aptly with the functional integration claim but the extent to which they posit heterogeneous representations is unclear. We mentioned above proposals that emphasize the idea of information integration, such as (Hayes et al. [2003]; Sloutsky [2010]), or (Kiefer and Pulvermüller [2012]), and pointed out that the integration process is better understood as the formation of a rich common representational structure that constitutes the concept. If this interpretation is correct these proposals are closer to the hybridist position. However, some of these models may not be hybrid in the required sense. For instance, Hayes and Kearney ([2010], p. 214) contend that recent models that integrate data-driven and theory-based approaches "are not "hybrid models" in the sense used by Machery" because "they do not assume separate "exemplar" and "knowledge" modules". Indeed, some of these approaches (as Carmichael and Hayes [2001]) take exemplars as the representational basis that incorporates theory-like knowledge.</p>
<p>As we said, we do not want to turn the issue into a terminological matter so let us state again what the hybridist is and is not committed to. The hybridist is committed to the existence of a rich common representational structure that constitutes the concept. The structure is rich in the sense of having different representational components and it is common in the sense that they are integrated as a functional unit. We admit that models that take, say, only exemplars as their representational basis are not hybrid in the required sense. The hybridist, however, is not committed to the existence of "separate modules" for each representational component. This is an assumption that some current categorization models make, but the notion of having a "rich" representational structure does not by itself involve such a demand. Recall our distinction above between what is selected and what is</p>
<p>represented. The fact that what is selected appears to have properties of a certain representational kind does not necessarily mean that what is stored in long-term memory is precisely such a kind of representation. To put an example, it could be the case that the long-term representation of a concept consisted in a collection of exemplars and that, when the concept is put to use, there were an on-line process of abstraction that produced a summary representation of the exemplars to be processed in working memory. We admit that it is difficult that a model like this could be regarded as endorsing hybrid concepts. However, just as what is selected might be prototype-like even though there were no actual prototypes among the long-term conceptual representation, it might be the case that we had conceptual representations that were not represented inherently neither as prototypes nor as exemplars, and yet sometimes they behaved as a prototype, and others as an exemplar. We contend that models that are based on such conceptual representations are closer to the hybridist position as long as they endorse a rich common functionally integrated representational basis for each concept. We want to explore such an interpretation in two recent approaches: the Varying Abstraction Framework (Verbeemen et al. [2007]) and the Conceptual Structure Approach (Moss et al. [2007]; Taylor et al. [2011]). Neither of them has been posited as hybrid in the way in which the term has been traditionally employed -which is closer to the heterogeneity claim. Yet we think that they open up new possibilities of understanding what a rich common representation is, so this is why we will devote some space to analyzing them.</p>
<p>The Varying Abstraction Framework "allows intermediate levels of abstraction, in which some exemplars are merged together in a single representation and other exemplars are kept apart in separate representations" (Verbeemen et al. [2007], p. 549). In categorization tasks the context will determine the level of abstraction that is used in a decision -from "complete abstraction (i.e., a single summary representation) to no abstraction at all (i.e., every exemplar is represented in memory and activated in categorization decisions)" ([2007], p. 549). Now, the question is whether the representations posited in this approach can be regarded as hybrid. We think that there is room for such an interpretation given that: (a) the VAF endorses a notion of representation that is "rich" in</p>
<p>the sense that it assumes that for the same category abstractions and exemplars can coexist, and (b) the representations posited in the VAF are functionally integrated in the sense that exemplars can be merged together in a single abstracted representation, so there will be a functional effect of which exemplars are activated for a particular task. So there is room to interpret the VAF as meeting, to some extent, both the heterogeneity and the functional integration claims.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to challenge this interpretation ${ }^{10}$ by arguing that in the VAF concepts are not really hybrid given that it does not "glue together" exemplar and prototype pieces. Rather, it posits coherent, integrated concepts that can look like prototype or exemplar-based concepts depending on their content. Moreover, the VAF is based in the generalized context model (Nosofsky, [1984], [1986]), which is an exemplar-based model that computes similarity as a function of relevant stored exemplars. The difference would lie in the fact that the VAF posits pseudo-exemplars instead. To get pseudo-exemplars one has "to first make a partition of the category exemplars for each category involved and then to construct, for every subset of exemplars, a prototype by averaging over all the exemplars in that subset. These prototypes are called the pseudo-exemplars and are used to represent the category" (Verbeemen et al. [2007], p. 541). When the partition consists of a single subset then the system behaves as a prototype model, when the number of subsets equals the number of exemplars the system behaves as full-exemplar model, and other in-between behaviors occur for intermediate numbers of subsets. The gist of the objection, thus, is that in the VAF we have one coherent type of concept that can yield a range of behaviours, not a hybrid concept after all.</p>
<p>The question is what sort of representation a pseudo-exemplar is: could it be regarded as a sort of hybrid concept, or is it a single-kind concept that appears as a new competitor to the existing prototype and exemplar models? To address this issue, let us first stress again that the hybridist is not necessarily committed to the idea that the conceptual components are semi-separable in the quasi-modular sense that we mentioned above. It may be the case that prototype-like, exemplar-like or other concept properties were supported by the same rich constitutive basis. Second, it seems to</p>
<p>us that the spirit of the VAF is not to propose a new kind of representation to compete with prototypes and exemplars. In our view, the VAF does not discard that, for any given category, both prototypes and exemplars are present: they simply are supported by the same representational basis. Indeed, as Verbeemen et al. ([2007], p. 539) point out, exemplars and prototypes have a "fuzzy status", so it is not entirely clear when a given representation counts as an exemplar or as a prototype. We think that pseudo-exemplars can be understood as representations that conflate prototype-like and exemplar-like properties, which appear as extreme poles of a continuum and which come up depending on the particular categorization task.</p>
<p>The central claim in the Conceptual Structure Approach (Moss et al. [2007]; Taylor et al. [2011]) is that "a given concept can be defined in terms of the features that make up its meaning, and that the quantity and quality of these features, as well as featural interrelationships, - its internal structure - determines how a concept is activated during normal language comprehension and production" (Moss et al. [2007], p. 219). The way a concept is activated depends particularly on two key feature properties: distinctiveness and co-occurrence. Distinctiveness is a matter of how many concepts share a given feature: the fewer concepts share a feature, the more distinctive the feature is. Co-occurrence has to do with the strength with which a feature is associated to other features: features that are strongly correlated tend to co-occur while lowly correlated features cooccur infrequently. In our view, properties like these determine what kind of common representation constitutes a concept and how its elements work as a functional whole. On the one hand, we think that the degree of distinctiveness can be related to how much a concept will appear as a prototype or as an exemplar. First, concepts that share many features are unlikely to appear as exemplars. Second, even though a distinctive feature may characterize prototypically a whole category (e.g., has an udder as distinctive of cows) at the extreme degree of distinctiveness we find features that belong to an individual exemplar of the category (e.g., the particular udder of my cow Daisy). On the other hand, co-occurrence will be crucial to determine which features are functionally related to which others -and, as research on conceptual structure investigates, what patterns of functional</p>
<p>disruption appear.
We think that this approach is capable of meeting the heterogeneity and functional integration claims of the hybridist view. First, the CSA endorses a rich common representation where both prototype-like and exemplar-like properties appear supported by the same distributed componential model, in which a concept is distributed among a number of features and its properties depend on the sorts of features (shared/distinctive, perceptual/functional, and so on) relevant for their content and context of processing. Second, the approach regards features of the same concept as typically interrelated parts that are activated together when the concept is retrieved and are functionally integrated in the sense that co-activated parts of the representation can influence the process without being actually selected. To illustrate the latter point we can consider the evidence pointed out by Moss et al. ([2007]) that having more semantic features may indeed be beneficial to conceptual and lexical processing. In our view, this piece of evidence would also show that all the activated features are functionally involved even if only a selection of them makes it to working memory. The rationale for this conclusion is the following: If the selection of features were not influenced by the features with which they are connected, then there should not be differences between concepts with a larger or a fewer number of them. And if the selection process were merely a process of letting the ineffectual features' activation decay, or of merely "going through" the different features until the relevant ones were selected, then one should find that having more features is disadvantageous. So the fact that there is a processing advantage in having more features shows that they are integrated in a functional whole, just as the hybrid concept theory contends.</p>
<p>One may raise about features the same kind of worry as the one raised about pseudoexemplars: could not one say that the CSA poses a single kind of representation -namely, featuresas the basis for all concepts? If so, then concepts cannot be regarded as hybrid after all. We think that such an objection focuses on the wrong level of analysis. Notice that features are not concepts; they simply provide the fine-grain structure of concepts.
