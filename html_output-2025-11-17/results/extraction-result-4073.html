                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Neuronal gene profiling of tau oligomer-bearing cholinergic nucleus basalis neurons during the onset of Alzheimer’s disease</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Soluble tau oligomeric assemblies display neurotoxic properties and may provide a pathogenic link between neurofibrillary tangle evolution and selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the precise molecular and cellular pathways mediating tau oligomer toxicity are unclear. We combined single-neuron laser capture microdissection with custom microarrays to investigate differences in the molecular signatures of basal forebrain neurons within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) labeled for p75NTR, a cholinergic cell marker, or dual-labeled for p75NTR and TOC1, a tau oligomer marker. Tissue was obtained postmortem from Rush Religious Orders Study participants who died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild/moderate AD. Using clinical diagnosis as a covariate to isolate tau oligomer-specific mechanisms, we identified 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in p75NTR + /TOC1 + cholinergic nbM neurons compared to p75NTR + /TOC1- neurons. STRING interactome and pathway analysis revealed that downregulated genes were associated with pre- and postsynaptic function, with additional enrichment in glutamate and acetylcholine signaling. By contrast, upregulated genes related to cellular stress responses and apoptosis were clustered with a subset of downregulated DEGs regulating mitochondrial metabolism and redox function, indicative of bioenergetic failure. Weighted gene co-expression correlation network analysis of the entire dataset revealed only two significantly correlated modules, which were either negatively correlated with the presence of TOC1 and enriched for synaptic signaling or positively correlated with TOC1 and enriched for cellular responses to hypoxia. These data show with single-neuron resolution that oligomeric tau formation in vulnerable cholinergic nbM neurons, even prior to MCI, is associated with the dysregulation of multiple classes of genes driving cell/mitochondrial stress and synaptic imbalances, which may be amenable for disease-modifying therapeutic approaches.

Soluble tau oligomeric assemblies display neurotoxic properties and may provide a pathogenic link between neurofibrillary tangle evolution and selective neuronal vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease (AD).However, the precise molecular and cellular pathways mediating tau oligomer toxicity are unclear.We combined single-neuron laser capture microdissection with custom microarrays to investigate differences in the molecular signatures of basal forebrain neurons within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) labeled for p75 NTR , a cholinergic cell marker, or duallabeled for p75 NTR and TOC1, a tau oligomer marker.Tissue was obtained postmortem from Rush Religious Orders Study participants who died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild/moderate AD.Using clinical diagnosis as a covariate to isolate tau oligomer-specific mechanisms, we identified 140 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in p75 NTR + /TOC1 + cholinergic nbM neurons compared to p75 NTR + /TOC1-neurons.STRING interactome and pathway analysis revealed that downregulated genes were associated with pre-and postsynaptic function, with additional enrichment in glutamate and acetylcholine signaling.By contrast, upregulated genes related to cellular stress responses and apoptosis were clustered with a subset of downregulated DEGs regulating mitochondrial metabolism and redox function, indicative of bioenergetic failure.Weighted gene co-expression correlation network analysis of the entire dataset revealed only two significantly correlated modules, which were either negatively correlated with the presence of TOC1 and enriched for synaptic signaling or positively correlated with TOC1 and enriched for cellular responses to hypoxia.These data show with single-neuron resolution that oligomeric tau formation in vulnerable cholinergic nbM neurons, even prior to MCI, is associated with the dysregulation of multiple classes of genes driving cell/mitochondrial stress and synaptic imbalances, which may be amenable for disease-modifying therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The presence of tau protein and amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide aggregates in the form of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and senile plaques, respectively, is required for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) [65].Although postmortem neuropathologic and in vivo PET imaging studies demonstrate that the appearance of Aβ plaques precedes frank NFT formation, the spatiotemporal pattern of NFTs mirror synaptic and neuronal loss in AD [9,41,46,49,53,148].However, a large body of evidence posits that NFT lesions are neither necessary nor sufficient for cellular neurotoxicity [16,37,45,77].By contrast, soluble "pre-tangle" aggregates such as tau oligomers have been shown to impair cellular trafficking by inhibiting fast axonal transport [26,130], interfering with electron transport chain function [77], inducing DNA/ RNA oxidative damage [104], activating microglia [84], and contributing to deficits in long-term potentiation and cognition [78].</p>
<p>Braak and colleagues described a neuronal hierarchical pattern of NFT pathology that first appears in transentorhinal/entorhinal cortex (Braak stages I-II), then the hippocampus, extending into the fusiform, lingual, and medial temporal cortex (Braak stages III-IV) and ultimately extending into higher order association areas of the neocortex (Braak stages V-VI) [19,20].However, a reevaluation of NFT pathology has shown that nuclei of the pontine locus coeruleus and forebrain nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) display tau pathology prior to that seen at Braak stages I-II as well as cortical plaque deposition [21].The region of the nbM contains the large magnocellular cholinergic neurons that innervate the entire cortical mantle [88,99,147] and develop NFTs during the onset of AD [87, 99,140].In this regard, we have shown that cholinergic nbM neurons display a rapid accumulation of toxic oligomeric tau aggregates in people with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/ prodromal AD [102,138] that correlates with worsening global cognitive function [52,102,138,144], which supports the notion that these soluble tau species contribute to the degeneration of these neurons.However, the molecular mechanisms by which tau oligomers form or how these soluble aggregates might contribute to neurotoxicity and the selective vulnerability of cholinergic neurons located within the nbM during AD progression remains unclear.</p>
<p>The present study investigated the molecular signature of cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons within the nbM accessed postmortem from Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) participants who died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, or AD.Naïve or tau oligomer-containing neurons were harvested by laser capture microdissection (LCM) combined with RNA amplification and customdesigned microarrays for differential gene expression analysis.The custom microarrays contained 864 cDNA/ EST targets of interest to neurobiology and neurodegenerative disease [3,28,58,60,71,136,137].We also used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules of gene clusters correlating with specific demographic or diagnostic variables.Differentially expressed genes and significantly correlated WGCNA modules were interrogated further via STRING interactome and functional enrichment tools to identify putative protein-protein interactions and cellular pathways associated with the presence of tau oligomeric pathology [11,40,124].</p>
<p>Materials and methods</p>
<p>Subjects and clinical and pathological evaluation</p>
<p>Postmortem tissue was obtained from RROS subjects who died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of NCI (n = 8), MCI (n = 8), or mild/moderate AD (n = 8, Table 1) groups.Details of RROS clinical and neuropathologic evaluations and diagnostic criteria have been published extensively [14,35,123].Briefly, RROS participants undergo an annual neurological examination and cognitive performance testing using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and 19 additional neuropsychological tests referable to five cognitive domains: orientation, attention, memory, language, and perception [14].These tests resulted in scores for episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability, as well as a composite global cognitive z-score (GCS) for each subject.Subjects were classified as MCI if they displayed deficits in one or more cognitive domains but did not meet the criteria of AD established by the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/AD and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) [85].Exclusion criteria included a history of depression, chronic alcoholism, Lewy body disorders, prominent TDP-43 proteinopathy, hippocampal sclerosis, or large strokes.Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was performed as reported previously [70].</p>
<p>Tissue processing and neuropathological evaluation</p>
<p>Coronal slabs sectioned using a plexiglass brain jig were immersion fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected, and cut frozen on a sliding microtome into 40 µm thick sections.Tissue containing neocortical and limbic areas including the hippocampus were immunostained with antibodies against the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ (6E10, 1:400 dilution) and phosphorylated tau (AT8, 1:250 dilution) for neuropathological evaluation [70].A board-certified neuropathologist evaluated all cases blinded to clinical diagnosis [123].Pathological designations of "normal" (with respect to AD or other dementing processes), "possible AD, " "probable AD, " or "definite AD" were based on semi-quantitative estimation of neuritic plaque density, an age-related senile plaque score, and presence or absence of dementia as established by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) [90].All cases received a Braak score classification [20] as well as an NIA-Reagan Likelihoodof-AD diagnosis based on neuritic plaque and NFT pathology [66].The "ABC" algorithm for the diagnosis of AD [92] is currently being applied to all RROS cases.</p>
<p>Dual-label immunohistochemistry</p>
<p>Forty micron-thick fixed sections containing the nbM were washed (1xTBS-Tx 0.05%), quenched with peroxidase (3%), blocked using 10% normal goat serum/2% bovine serum albumin in 1xTBS-TX 0.05%, and incubated with a TOC1 primary monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution; kindly provided by Dr. Kanaan) that recognizes tau oligomers overnight at 4 °C [102,138,142].</p>
<p>Since the TOC1 antigen is conformation-specific, immunostaining was performed without antigen retrieval, which can result in the recognition of false-positive epitopes (Kanaan and Counts, unpublished observations).Sections were then washed (1xTBS-Tx 0.05%) and incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse IgM (Vector Labs, 1:500) for one hour at room temperature.Sections were developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB)/ nickel solution resulting in blue-black TOC1 + profiles.Following additional rinses and re-blocking, sections were incubated overnight in solution containing a p75 NTR monoclonal antibody (NeoMarkers clone NGFR5,1:120,000), an excellent marker of CBF neurons [95,101,138].Sections were washed and incubated with biotinylated secondary anti-mouse IgG (Vector Labs, 1:500) for one hour at room temperature.The sections were then developed with DAB to produce brown p75 NTR + profiles.Sections were stored in buffer at 4 °C until mounting onto Leica PET FrameSlides for LCM.</p>
<p>Single cell expression profiling</p>
<p>p75 NTR + /TOC1-and p75 NTR /TOC1 + nbM neurons (~ 80 neurons/phenotype/case = ~ 2,000 neurons/phenotype) were microdissected using a Leica LMD6500 and subjected to terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification, as previously described [3,28,58,60,71,136,137].Total RNA from each reaction was extracted using Trizol reagent (ThermoFisher).RNA was first reverse transcribed in the presence of poly d(T) primer (100 ng/μl) and TC primer (100 ng/μl) in 1 × first strand buffer (Ther-moFisher), 2 μg of linear acrylamide, 10 mM dNTPs, 100 μM DTT, 20 U of SuperRNase Inhibitor (Life Technologies), and 200 U of reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, ThermoFisher).After RNase H digestion and reannealing of the T7 and TC primers to generate cDNAs with double-stranded regions at the primer interfaces, single stranded cDNA was purified using Ambion Ultra 0.5 mL centrifugal filters (EMD Millipore).Hybridization probes were synthesized by in vitro transcription using 33</p>
<p>Subject characteristics</p>
<p>Demographic, clinical, and neuropathologic variables across the NCI, MCI, and AD cases were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilks normality test.Demographic (age, education, interval from last cognitive battery to death, postmortem interval), clinical (MMSE, GCS), and neuropathologic (Braak stage, NIA-Reagan, CERAD) variables were compared using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.APOE genotype and % males were compared using the Chi-square test.Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (v10.5).</p>
<p>Differential gene expression analysis</p>
<p>Normalized gene counts from the microarrays were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the p75 NTR + /TOC1-vs.p75 NTR + /TOC1 + nbM neurons, adjusting for subject and using clinical group as a covariate via the limma package (v3.54.0) [115], incorporating lmFit, contrasts.fit,and eBayes in the workflow.An adjusted p-value threshold of 0.05 was set to identify DEGs.The ggvenn package (v0.1.10:https:// github.com/ yanli nlin82/ ggvenn) was used to visualize intersections of DEGs across different comparisons.Volcano plots were created using R package ggplot2 v3.5.2.</p>
<p>Interactome and functional enrichment analysis</p>
<p>Putative interaction networks within the DEG and relevant WGCNA modules were created using K means clustering in the STRING v12 database [133].To identify functional enrichment among DEGs, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using the fgsea R package (v1.26.0).The gene probe names were first changed to official gene symbols and then to ENTREZ ids using Bioconductor's Genome wide annotation for Human (org.Hs.eg.db_3.17.0).Gene ontology terms and their assigned genes were similarly pulled from this package.All probes with ENTREZ ids were included in the analysis and were ranked by the t-statistic calculated by limma before being input into fgsea.The resulting p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method [114].Gene Ontology-Biological Process [51] terms were displayed as Lollipop plots using the STRING v12 software.</p>
<p>Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)</p>
<p>We used the WGCNA R package (v 1.72-1) to identify patterns of co-expression among genes and group them into modules based on their expression patterns.Before performing WGCNA, the expression values for the extra cellular domain and tyrosine kinase domain of NRTK1, 2, and 3 were averaged to represent expression of the NRTK1, 2, and 3 genes, respectively.The empirical-BayesLM function in the WGCNA package was used to adjust the gene expression for PMI.A signed network was built and modules detected using the blockwiseModules function with the following parameters: power = 22, TOMType = "signed", networkType = "signed", minModuleSize = 10, reassignThreshold = 0, mergeCutHeight = 0.25, pamRespectsDendro = FALSE.</p>
<p>Module-eigengene to trait Pearson correlations were calculated using WGCNA's cor function for diagnosis (NCI, MCI, AD), neuron type (TOC, p75), age at death, sex (male, female), education in years, MMSE, GCS, APOE genotype (e2, e3, e4), PMI in hours, CERAD, BRAAK, and NIAREAGAN.Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and correlations were calculated for each category individually.The corPvalueStudent function in the WGCNA package was used to calculate p-values, and the p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.Candidate hub genes were identified by ranking genes within their resident modules by Kme and Kwithin calculated using the signedKM() and intramodularConnectivity.fromExpr() functions, respectively.Hub genes were also cross-referenced with genes differentially expressed between neuron types.</p>
<p>Module-eigengene to categorical trait associations were also tested for diagnosis and APOE genotype using the Kruskal-Wallis test as implemented in the rstatix package (v 0.7.2).We also used PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) as implemented in the vegan package (v 2.6-10) to test for associations between diagnosis and APOE genotype and the multivariate gene expression profiles of resident module genes [8].PERMDISP (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Dispersion), as implemented in the vegan package, was used in conjunction with PERMANOVA to assess the homogeneity of group dispersions [7].In the univariate and multivariate tests, the p-values were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
<p>Over-representation analysis was used to test for enrichment of genes annotated to gene ontology terms among module genes [76].The gene probe names were first changed to official gene symbols and then to ENTREZ ids using Bioconductor's Genome wide annotation for Human (org.Hs.eg.db_3.17.0).The analysis was performed with the gprofiler2 package (v 0.2.2)12 which uses the hypergeometric test followed by correction for multiple testing with the package's custom algorithm.The 861 array genes included in the WGCNA analysis were used as a custom background set.Enrichment of module genes was assessed with GSEA using the fgsea R package (v 1.26.0), as described above.More details of these procedures can be found at the following site: https:// github.com/ MSUBi oinfo rmati csCore/ Kara_ et_ al_ Acta_ Neuro patho logica_ 2025.git.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>Case demographics and clinical neuropathologic characteristics</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in age, sex, years of education, interval between last cognitive test battery and death, or PMI among the NCI, MCI, and AD groups (Table 1).By contrast, the presence of at least one APOE ε4 allele was higher in the AD group (p = 0.01).With respect to antemortem global cognitive performance, there were no differences in MMSE or GCS scores between the NCI and MCI subjects, yet both groups displayed significantly higher MMSE (p = 0.0008) and GCS (p &lt; 0.0001) scores compared to the AD group.Interestingly, the distribution of Braak scores was not different among the diagnostic groups.</p>
<p>However, only 25% of the NCI cases were classified as Braak I-II, whereas 75% were Braak III-IV.Similarly, 12.5% of the MCI subjects were classified as Braak I-II, whereas 62.5% were Braak III-IV and 25% were Braak V-VI.By contrast, none of the AD subjects was classified as Braak I-II and the cases were split between Braak III-IV and Braak V-VI (50% each).There were also no differences between clinical groups in CERAD or NIA Reagan diagnostic scores (Table 1).These results were most likely due to the prevalence of putatively resilient NCI subjects who displayed relatively high amounts of AD pathology, as 62.5% displayed intermediate levels of neuritic plaque burden based on CERAD and 50% received an intermediate likelihood of AD diagnosis based on NIA-Reagan [61,73,91,111].</p>
<p>Tau oligomers alter cholinergic nbM neuron gene expression independent of antemortem clinical status</p>
<p>The cholinergic (Ch) neurons within the nbM form a continuum located within the basal forebrain divided into subfields designated as anterior medial (Ch4am), anterior lateral (Ch4al), intermediate (with ventral and dorsal subdivisions, Ch4iv/id) and posterior (Ch4p), which innervate the entire cortical mantle in a semi-topographic fashion [89].The current investigation examined neurons primarily within the Ch4am and Ch4al subfields.Dual-brightfield immunohistochemistry using antibodies directed against p75 NTR , an excellent marker for cholinergic neurons [94], and the tau oligomeric antigen TOC1 [142] revealed oligomer reactivity in the soma and neurites of p75 NTR + nbM neurons across all clinical groups (Fig. 1) [138].Individual p75 NTR + /TOC1-and tau oligomer-bearing p75 NTR + /TOC1 + neurons were collected and processed for custom microarray analysis (see Materials and Methods; please refer to Fig. 1 of our prior publication for low magnification photomicrographs of p75 NTR ± TOC1 nbM neurons in NCI, MCI, and AD) [138].Our goal was to identify gene expression changes in TOC1 + neurons that were common among the three clinical groups to isolate putative early molecular mechanisms contributing to tau oligomer formation or oligomer-mediated neurodegeneration, without potential confounds of expression changes arising from other sources of disease severity.Therefore, differential gene expression analysis was performed using clinical diagnosis as a covariate.This strategy identified 140 DEGs (Fig. 2A) in TOC1-bearing compared to naïve cholinergic nbM neurons (82 downregulated [58.6%,Table 2], 58 upregulated [41.4%,Table 3]) among the 864 gene probes on the array platform (Supplementary Table 1), or ~ 16% of the total (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for DEG representation and overlap in the individual NCI, MCI, and AD groups).Among the most significantly downregulated genes were those coding for Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1 (NRF1), Glutathione Peroxidase 1 (GPX1), a custom microarray cDNA encoding full-length Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2, or TrkB, containing the tyrosine kinase domain (NTRK2TK), Cytochrome C, Somatic (CYCS), Homer Scaffold Protein 1 (HOMER1), Glutamate Ionotropic Receptor AMPA Type Subunit 2 (GRIA2), Synaptophysin (SYP) and Synaptotagmin 1 (SYT1) (Table 2).By contrast, significantly upregulated genes in TOC-1 bearing nbM neurons included Protein Phosphatase 3 Catalytic Subunit Gamma (PPP3CC, or calcineurin), RAB11A-RAS Oncogene Family (RAB11A), and Aph-1 Homolog B, Gamma-Secretase Subunit (APH1B), Autophagy Related 4B/10 Cysteine Peptidases (ATG4B/ATG10), Utrophin (UTRN), Heat Shock Protein Family D (Hsp60) Member 1 (HSPD1)}, G Protein Subunit Gamma 2 (GNG2), and Calpain Small Subunit 1 (CAPNS1) (Table 3).Functional enrichment analysis using GO Biological Process terms revealed that the 140 DEGs, when taken together, were most associated with regulation of synaptic plasticity, synaptic transmission, and membrane potential, with particular reference to the postsynaptic compartment (Fig. 2B).</p>
<p>Key: LogFC = Logarithmic fold change; Ave Expr = average expression level across all samples; t = t-statistic; Adj P value = adjusted P value (corrected for multiple testing); B = log-odds of differential expression    We next performed STRING analysis to delineate potential interactomes among the 140 DEGs (Fig. 3), which also allowed us to perform additional, potentially more refined functional enrichment analysis of specific interacting gene/protein clusters in TOC1-bearing nbM neurons (Table 4).The largest interactome (Cluster 1, red node, 46 genes), which included the DEGs noted above (ATG4B, HSPD1, NRF1, PPP3CC) as well as other potentially key DEGs such as ADAM Metallopeptidase Domain 9) (ADAM9), CAMP Responsive Element Binding Protein 1 (CREB1), DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member A3 (DNAJA3, also known as mitochondrial Tid1) and Superoxide Dismutases 1 and 2 (SOD1/2), was associated with the GO term for Cellular response to stress and apoptosis (Table 4).Cluster 2 (pink node, 39 genes), which included DEGs noted above (HOMER1, GRIA2, RAB11A), was comprised predominantly of additional glutamate receptors (e.g.,  [10] were also enriched in this cluster (Table 4).The remaining STRING interactome clusters were associated with similar receptor/synaptic pathways including Exocytosis and SNARE binding, G protein-coupled receptor activity, and Acetylcholine receptor activity (Clusters 3-5, respectively), whereas Cluster 7 containing Integrin Table 4 Functional enrichment of STRING interactome cluster Subunits Alpha 1/3 (ITGA1/ITGA3) as well as Reelin (RELN) [17] were associated with Plasma membranebounded cell projection organization.These functional DEG interactome data elaborated upon several themes of synaptic function/neurotransmission-related dysregulation within cholinergic nbM neurons but provide further insights elucidating dysfunctional cell stress pathways as additional key molecular and cell biological mechanisms associated with tau oligomer pathology.</p>
<p>WGCNA reveals specific networks correlated with tau oligomer pathology</p>
<p>The second analytical approach to the dataset was to leverage WGCNA to test whether there were modules of co-expressed genes among the 864 microarray targets (i.e., independent of DEG status) that correlated with specific cohort traits (e.g., age, sex, APOE genotype, clinical and neuropathological variables) as well as cellular phenotype (p75 NTR ± TOC1) (Fig. 4).Interestingly, of the 18 modules of co-expressed genes identified, the only two significantly correlated modules were those associated with cholinergic neuronal phenotype: the yellow module was negatively correlated with the presence of TOC1, whereas the red module was positively correlated with TOC1.The grey module was also associated with TOC1 pathology, but this module represents genes unassigned to any co-expression network module and was not analyzed further (Fig. 4).A subanalysis of the WGCNA data using Kruskal-Wallis testing was performed to test for module-eigengene to categorical trait associations for each of the three diagnostic groups (Supplementary Fig. 2) and three APOE genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 3).We also used PERMANOVA (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance) to test for associations between diagnosis (Supplementary Fig. 4) or APOE genotype (Supplementary Fig. 5) and the multivariate gene expression profiles of resident module genes [8].PERMDISP (Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Dispersion) was used in conjunction with PERMANOVA to assess the homogeneity of group dispersions [7].</p>
<p>The co-expressed genes in the yellow and red modules are shown in Table 5. Notably, most of the co-expressed genes among the yellow module genes were significantly downregulated (Table 2), whereas the co-expressed genes in the red module were predominantly upregulated in TOC1 + nbM neurons (Table 3).The strength of association between overlapping hub genes and DEGs were queried further by cross-referencing kME, kWithin, and the differential expression analysis results (Supplementary Table 2).</p>
<p>STRING analysis was used to compare yellow and red module gene interactomes with those identified in the previous STRING analysis of DEGs to reveal possible additional pathways associated with the presence of tau pathology within cholinergic nbM neurons.A central cluster of the yellow module interactome included transcription factors such as Forkhead Box O3 (FOXO3), RELA Proto-Oncogene, NF-KB Subunit (RELA) and Catenin Beta 1 (CTNNB1), as well as CREB1 and NRF1.(Fig. 5A).Another prominent connected cluster included synaptic DEGs (e.g., SYP, SNAP25, DLG4, HOMER1, GALR1/2) and, interestingly, Synuclein Alpha and Beta (SNCA/B) (Fig. 5A).Neuronal Pentraxin NPTX1 and its receptor NPTXR, which are also involved in synaptic function [47], as well as the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthetic enzymes Nicotinamide Riboside Kinase 1 and 2 (NMRK1/2) and NAD Synthase (NADS) [79], formed additional, independent gene family clusters.Functional enrichment terms for these genes collectively inferred a negative association of multiple aspects of neurotransmission, including receptor activity and synaptic vesicle biogenesis and recycling, in the presence of TOC1 + tau oligomers (Fig. 5B).</p>
<p>By contrast, STRING interactome analysis of network genes in the red module revealed a central cluster involving stress response genes such as Mechanistic Target Of Rapamycin Kinase (MTOR) Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog (PTEN), and PTEN Induced Kinase 1 (PINK1) as well as Protein Kinase C Beta (PRKCB) and GSK3B signaling kinases (Fig. 6A).Another prominent connected cluster included the chaperones HSPD1, DNAJA3, Heat Shock Protein Family E (Hsp10) Member 1 (HSPE1, or chaperonin), Heat Shock Protein Family A (Hsp70) Fig. 4 Module-trait relationships of co-expressed genes in cholinergic nbM neurons across the AD spectrum.The heatmap is colored by the strength of the Pearson correlation between each module's eigengene and demographic, clinical, or neuropathological variables.Shown are Pearson coefficients with p values in parentheses Member 9 (HSPA9, or mortalin), and DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member C5 (DNAJC5).Smaller clusters of protein phosphatase subunits (e.g., PPP2R1B, PPP2R5C, PPP3CC) and casein kinase subunits (e.g., CSNK2A1/2 and CSNK3B) were also connected within the red module interactome.Functional enrichment terms for these genes collectively inferred a positive association of TOC1 + tau oligomers with stress responses related to hypoxia, as well as serine/threonine phosphorylation and reduced cellular catabolism (Fig. 6B).</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>The present study used custom-designed microarrays to compare expression levels of 864 neurobiology-relevant genes in naïve and tau oligomer-positive cholinergic/ p75 NTR labeled nbM neurons obtained from individuals that died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of NCI, MCI, or AD.Previous studies by our group revealed TOC1 + tau oligomer pathology in Ch4am and Ch4al subpopulations of cholinergic nbM neurons in NCI subjects, which increased significantly with disease progression and correlated with worsening global cognitive Table 5 Analysis of STRING functional pathways for WGCNA module genes * Module genes that are also DEGs in differential expression analysis (Fig. 2, Tables 2 and 3) are boldfaced performance [138].Recently, we demonstrated that nbM neurons bearing the early [140] and potentially neurotoxic [135] tau phosphorylation epitope pS422 displayed altered expression of several functional classes of genes (e.g., neurotrophin receptors, proteostasis regulators) compared to naïve cholinergic nbM neurons [136,137].Interestingly, we found that these transcript alterations were independent of clinical diagnosis, suggesting that the pathological state of a neuron, not antemortem clinical diagnosis, underlies changes in cellular gene expression [136,137].Although we and others have used single-cell profiling techniques to investigate changes in specific classes of genes in cholinergic nbM neurons during the progression of AD [28,60,97,116], whether oligomeric tau-bearing neurons downregulate or upregulate transcript expression in these remains a major knowledge gap.Here, we identified TOC1-specific dysregulated functional gene classes and pathways associated with nbM neurons during the onset of AD.Clinical diagnosis was used as a covariate as opposed to neuropathological criteria since many subjects in the NCI group displayed intermediate levels of AD pathology (e.g., Braak stages III-IV and Intermediate Likelihood of AD based upon CERAD and NIA-Reagan criteria; Table 1).Hence, using cognitive status as a covariate allowed greater sensitivity for pinpointing novel differentially expressed genes associated with oligomeric tau that are already present in nbM neurons in NCI and may influence cognitive deterioration during the transition from NCI to MCI to AD.We detected 140 genes (16% of the genes represented on the microarray platform) that were significantly dysregulated in TOC1 + vs. TOC1-cholinergic nbM neurons.Functional enrichment analysis of these 140 DEGs revealed involvement in synaptic integrity and function in TOC1-bearing neurons, yet the DEGs themselves represented a broad range of functional gene classes associated with synaptic, mitochondrial, protein folding/ turnover, and intracellular signaling regulation (Fig. 2).Further refinement with STRING analysis and functional enrichment of specific interactomes suggested that the DEGs interact and operate within two broad molecular and cellular pathways (Fig. 3).Overall, downregulated genes were primarily associated with synaptic function/ neurotransmission, with enrichment in genes related to glutamate and acetylcholine signaling.By contrast, most of the upregulated genes were primarily associated with cellular stress responses and apoptosis, yet there was also a subset of downregulated DEGs regulating mitochondrial metabolism and redox function, indicative of bioenergetic failure which also contributes to cell stress (Tables 2, 3, 4).Our secondary approach to the dataset (including non-DEGs) was to use WCGNA to identify correlated networks of genes associated with cohort characteristics beyond cholinergic nbM tau pathology, such as age, sex, APOE genotype, clinical diagnosis, global cognitive scores, or severity of pathology (Fig. 4).Although none of the co-expression modules correlated with demographic or clinical pathologic viables, there were two significant co-expression modules that correlated with either the presence or absence of TOC1.Based upon this interesting finding, we used STRING to identify additional key pathways associated with tau oligomer pathology, regardless of subject characteristics.STRING and functional enrichment analysis revealed a similar pattern to DEG analysis: (i) interacting genes in the yellow module that negatively correlated with TOC1 were enriched in synaptic signaling and neurotransmission pathways, with minor interactomes associated with metal ion metabolism, and (ii) interacting genes in the red module that positively correlated with TOC1 were enriched in hypoxia as a specific form of cellular stress, with additional interactomes associated with serine/threonine phosphorylation and protein degradation.</p>

<p>AD has been considered to arise from connectional synaptopathy or proteinopathy [74,86,100,109].Synapse loss observed in MCI is tightly correlated with cognitive decline [120][121][122]134].Pathological tau moieties including oligomers have been found in synaptosomes and possibly contribute to synaptic dysfunction by disrupting synaptic protein homeostasis [148], immobilizing synaptic vesicles [150], and/or interacting with Aβ oligomers at the synapse, which exacerbates tau mislocalization and aggregation [62].Here, we identified multiple downregulated synaptic genes including those involved in presynaptic vesicle trafficking and release (e.g., SYP, SNAP25, SYT1) and postsynaptic scaffolding/dendritic spine plasticity (e.g., HOMER1, DRB1, DLG4) in TOC1 + neurons.Previous studies have shown that SYP, SNAP25, and SYT expression is decreased in the hippocampus and limbic and neocortical regions in MCI and AD patients [15,35,50,119,132].Conversely, CSF levels of these proteins are increased in early-stage AD cases [25,106,139], suggesting a potential biomarker for presynaptic deterioration.With respect to postsynaptic proteins, we and others have demonstrated dysregulation of dendritic spine proteins HOMER1, DRB1, and DLG4 in cortical and hippocampal regions in MCI and AD [28,33,35,64,129].Taken together, these findings suggest impairment in both presynaptic mechanisms of cholinergic transmission in limbic and cortical target fields as well as impaired signaling from afferent inputs, perhaps impairing cholinergic nbM neuronal activity in the presence of tau oligomer pathology.In support of this, nbM neurons receive inputs from multiple glutamatergic regions including cortex and amygdala, as well as other subcortical nuclei including the noradrenergic locus coeruleus, serotoninergic raphe nuclei, and midbrain dopaminergic areas [127].We noted TOC1-associated decreases in the expression of several neurotransmitter receptors such as GRIA1/2, GRIN2B, the adrenoceptors ADRA1A and ADRA2B, the serotonin receptor HTR2B, and the DRD1 dopamine receptor.In addition, downregulation of GALR1/GALR2 galanin receptors was interesting as we have shown hyperinnervation of galanin fibers upon cholinergic nbM neurons in late-stage AD [18,30,98].Finally, from a presynaptic perspective, we observed downregulation of NRTK1 and NRTK2 transcripts encoding the high affinity TrkA nerve growth factor receptor and TrkB BDNF receptor, respectively.Previously, we have shown dysregulation of cholinotrophic survival pathways in MCI and AD [24,34,36,59,93,96,125].The present observation supports the hypothesis that cholinergic nbM neurotrophism is impaired in the presence of tau pathology, irrespective of disease status [137].</p>
<p>Of the broad and varied functional gene classes associated with cellular stress in TOC1 + nbM neurons, those operating within mitochondrial pathways were among the most enriched.For instance, NRF1 was the most dysregulated gene in TOC1 + neurons (Fig. 2, Table 2).NRF1 encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of several genes regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration (e.g., mitochondrial transcription factor A, cytochrome C oxidase), redox status (e.g., nitric oxide synthase) and even the GRIA2 and GRIN2B glutamate receptor subunits [42,43,126], which were also downregulated in TOC1 + nbM neurons.NRF1 expression is decreased in multiple neocortical regions in AD [107], in amyloid angiopathy [110], and in 3xTg-AD mice [22], whereas mutant K274/K28-acetylated tau results in lower NRF1 levels [80].</p>
<p>Other key classes of dysregulated mitochondrial-associated genes that are putatively involved in cellular stress included upregulated mitochondrial chaperones such as HSPD1, HSPE1, and DNAJA3, which mediate the mitochondrial unfolded protein response to misfolded and damaged proteins [2,68,108]; the proteins encoded by these genes were also upregulated in the cortex of both familial and sporadic AD [12,128].A second key class involved downregulated genes encoding antioxidants such as SOD1/2 and GPX1, which detoxify superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen peroxide to water, respectively [48].Polymorphisms in these genes have been associated with AD risk [38,145].</p>
<p>A third class of genes coded for mitochondrial/cytosolic enzymes mediating apoptosis, such as the calpain protease members CAPNS1 and CAPN2 and the phosphatase PPP3CC/calcineurin.Calpain members are upregulated in the cortex as early as Braak stage II [75] and were associated with poorer cognitive performance [1].We previously reported increased calpain gene expression in pS422-tau + nbM neurons [136].Increased calpain activity has been implicated in AD pathophysiology, possibly as a mediator of mitochondria cytochrome C-initiated apoptosis [105].On the other hand, PPP3CC/ calcineurin plays a role in mitophagy [81], which is dysfunctional in AD and results in the accumulation of defective mitochondria [83].Calcineurin has also been shown to negatively regulate glutamate release by deactivating synapsin 1 [69], and cholinergic nbM neurons co-transmit glutamate [6].Interestingly, there is evidence for crosstalk between calpain and calcineurin during cell stress and apoptosis, wherein calpain cleaves the C-terminus of calcineurin, which in turn activates Dynaminrelated protein 1 to activate mitochondrial fission, which is impaired in AD [141,151].WGCNA functional enrichment analysis suggests that these mitochondrial alterations are associated with hypoxia-related stress pathways.Collectively, the present data indicate that nbM neurons exhibit metabolic stress in the presence of tau oligomer pathology, which likely affects pre-and postsynaptic function.</p>
<p>Study limitations</p>
<p>We are aware of the criticism that human clinical pathologic studies lack a mechanistic component compared to those using animal or cellular models.Currently, there are no in vitro or in vivo models that truly replicate tau pathology found within the cholinergic nbM during the progression of AD.We suggest that human clinical pathologic studies are a "gold standard" for defining the molecular/cellular pathogenic events that occur during the transition from clinical NCI to prodromal (MCI) and frank AD.Moreover, data generated from investigations like the present one provide a foundation for the generation of models that better replicate the cellular and molecular neuropathology of AD.It could be argued that the current findings are affected by case selection or comorbidities.However, the cases used here were obtained from the NIA-supported RROS, a longitudinal study of aging and AD, wherein all participants receive extensive antemortem clinical testing each year prior to death and a comprehensive postmortem neuropathological evaluation, and case selection included strict exclusion criteria (see Methods) [14,35,123].A notable exception for the exclusion criteria was the lack of information on medication history for the subjects; hence, we could not test for associations between gene expression and the presence or absence of anticholinesterase treatment.Although RROS participants are composed of a cloistered cohort that follow regimented lifestyles and have high levels of educational attainment [13], clinical pathological data using tissue from this population replicate those derived from non-religious subjects [39,82,112].Secondly, although TOC1 has traditionally been considered a pretangle marker based upon its lack of colocalization with Thioflavin S or the fibrillar NFT marker Ab39 [143], and TOC1 + neurons typically displayed a pretangle morphology (Fig. 1), we did observe sparse TOC1 + neurons with emergent globose morphology associated with NFT-bearing cholinergic nbM neurons [87,118].Hence, we cannot rule out the possibility that a limited number of gene expression changes are also associated with the development of fibrillar tau.Third, LCM-based accession of neurons in fixed tissues results in limited input RNA/sample that precludes RNA sequencing studies to profile thousands of transcripts.By contrast, we recently pioneered LCM in frozen sections to harvest larger populations of neurons (~ 500/sample) from Nissl-stained frontal cortical layers III and V for RNA sequencing [4].A current limitation of this approach is that immunohistochemistry in frozen tissue results in RNA degradation, so LCM-based profiling in fixed tissues using microarray hybridization methods remains valuable for understanding pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of neurochemically (e.g., cholinergic) and phenotypically (e.g., with and without tau pathology) distinct neuronal populations-with minimal contamination from adjacent glial and vascular cell types-in discrete brain regions in neurodegenerative disorders [72].In this way, they provide a powerful complementary approach to large-scale RNA sequencing and proteomics studies of brain tissues, cellular subtypes (e.g., neurons, glia, and vascular), and fluids to home in on clinically relevant markers and pathways of disease [63,67,103,146].The effect of RNA degradation is an additional concern when interpreting gene expression results in human tissue samples.LCM-based profiling using immunlabeled fixed tissues necessitates the use of fragmented RNA.However, these fragmented samples are a suitable substrate for hybridization and expression profiling using the custom microarray platform [3, 5, 27, 29, 31, 32, 55-57, 59, 136, 137].Similarly, high quality RNA from frozen tissues is also digested for fragmentation prior to large-scale microarray hybridization.With respect to RNA degradation due to PMI, we note that PMIs are relatively short in the RROS, and we mitigated this issue further by matching for PMI during case selection (Table 1).Finally, although we did not uncover significant sex differences in p75 NTR ± TOC1 gene expression across the cases during post hoc analysis (data not shown), the study was likely underpowered for such an analysis and this question can be pursued in future studies.On the balance, however, the present study offers newly refined insights into putative pathogenic mechanisms associated with selective vulnerability and dysfunction of the cholinergic neurons within the nbM during the progression of AD, providing new clues for disease-modifying therapeutics.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Despite decades of investigations, the multifactorial etiologies and neuronal pathophysiology of sporadic AD have not been fully elucidated.We posit that increasingly cutting-edge studies using phenotypically distinct neuronal populations from well-characterized postmortem brain tissue samples will advance our understanding of the molecular factors driving cellular degeneration, despite their cross-sectional nature.Given the strong link between tau pathology and neuronal and synaptic loss and data connecting soluble tau oligomers to neuronal toxicity in AD, the present study provides et al.Acta Neuropathologica Communications (2025) 13:218 several corroborative and novel insights into the functional effects of tau oligomer pathology in cholinergic nbM neurons beginning in people with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of NCI.As mentioned above, our previous custom-designed microarray studies showed that several classes of dysregulated genes, such as those involved in neurotransmission, neurotrophism, and protein metabolism, were dysregulated in cholinergic nbM neurons bearing pathologic pS422 + tau [136,137], using a panel of 576 genes as opposed to the 864 targets queried here.This new format and more sophisticated bioinformatics techniques allowed us to expand into new, potentially more precise mechanisms, particularly those involved in synaptic dysfunction and cell and mitochondrial stress.Notably, the functional gene families involved in these pathway alterations inform mechanistic underpinnings for in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrating synaptic and mitochondrial abnormalities following tau oligomer administration [23,77,78].We previously demonstrated that TOC1 and pS422 epitopes overlap within ~ 30% of the same nbM neurons [138].Hence, the extent to which common or unique gene changes and pathways within TOC + or pS422 + NB neurons are due to these distinct tau modifications alone or in combination will require further study.Nonetheless, given recent evidence that mitochondrial stress influences tau oligomerization [44,117], and that tau pathology can drive mitochondrial dysfunction [113,149], we hypothesize a vicious cycle scenario in which the initiation of soluble tau oligomer pathology is driven in part by multiple sources of cellular stress including mitochondrial imbalances.In turn, the accrual of tau oligomers intensifies mitochondrial stress, further exacerbating tau pathology and, ultimately, driving synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration.This concept is in line with the proposed mitochondrial cascade hypothesis for AD pathogenesis and supports the rationale for bioenergetic-centric strategies targeting mitochondrial function as part of a polypharmacological, synaptoprotective, and diseasemodifying therapeutic regimen [131].</p>
