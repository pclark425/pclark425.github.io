                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> Current scenario of machine learning applications to hydrothermal liquefaction via bibliometric analysis</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Background Energy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history. Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability. Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil. Methods Hydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process. However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations. Results The results reveal an increasing trend in the study of ML in the HTL process, with a growing interest from various countries. Conclusion Notably, China currently holds the largest share of ML research in HTL processes, with most published works falling within the field of engineering. The keyword “liquefaction” emerges as the most popular term in these publications.</p>

BackgroundEnergy shortages and global warming have been significant issues throughout history.Therefore, the search for environmentally friendly renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving sustainability.Biomass energy is gaining global attention as a renewable energy option, particularly through the process of hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil.MethodsHydrothermal liquefaction is a complex process that is challenging to explain, leading to research on machine learning models for this process.These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process.These models aim to predict values and investigate the impact of variables on the hydrothermal liquefaction process.However, the development of machine learning in hydrothermal liquefaction is still limited due to its novelty and the time required for comprehensive study.Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze relevant publications in the Scopus database, focusing on indexed ML and HTL keywords, to understand keyword associations and co-citations.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>2][3] Biomass stands as a prominent alternative in the realm of renewable energy, referred to as biomass energy. 4Biomass energy refers to the energy derived from various organic materials that serve as natural energy sources.These materials encompass a wide range of substances, including organic waste, agricultural residues, industrial byproducts, manure, and fuel crops such as rice husks, rice straw, bagasse, sugar cane leaves and shoots, wood, wood chips, fibers, palm kernel shells, cassava residue, corn cobs, husks, coconut shells, and more.The conversion of biomass into usable energy involves processes such as fermentation, combustion, hydrothermal treatment, or other methodologies, which transform biomass into heat or gas for energy utilization. 5,6dditionally, there exists a biomass processing method known as hydrothermal liquefaction, which converts wet biomass into bio-crude oil.This process involves subjecting the biomass to high-temperature and high-pressure conditions in a liquid water environment, resulting in the production of bio-crude oil. 7,8drothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a thermal depolymerization process that facilitates the conversion of wet biomass and other macromolecules into crude oil, commonly known as bio-crude oil.This transformation occurs under medium temperature (180-400 °C) and high-pressure (5-30 MPa) conditions, enabling the efficient conversion of the biomass feedstock. 9,10Bio-crude oil exhibits a high energy density, characterized by a higher heating value ranging from 33.8 to 36.9 MJ/kg.It typically contains 5-20 wt% oxygen, along with renewable chemicals.HHV are critical in HTL as they measure the energy content of bio-crude, determining its quality and efficiency as a fuel.Bio-crude with higher HHV is suitable for applications like direct combustion for heat and power, upgrading into transportation fuels (diesel, gasoline, jet fuel), and as a feedstock for biorefineries.It can also be used in marine and heavy industries, blended with fossil fuels to reduce emissions, or converted into biochar for additional benefits.HHV ensure bio-crude's economic viability and its role as a sustainable energy source. 11The study of various variables and their effects under HTL processing conditions is challenging and intricate.Consequently, researchers worldwide have shown keen interest in investigating the behavior of variables within the HTL environment.Machine learning has emerged as the most popular technology to address such difficult and complex problems efficiently.It offers promising avenues for understanding and optimizing HTL processes through data-driven analysis and predictive modeling.</p>
<p>Machine Learning (ML) can be considered as the learning component of a machine.It serves as the foundational element of Artificial Intelligence (AI), that enables AI systems to acquire knowledge and exhibit intelligent behavior.AI utilizes ML techniques to develop and enhance its intelligent capabilities, allowing it to learn from data, recognize patterns, make predictions, and adapt to new information or situations.In essence, ML forms an integral part of the AI framework, enabling the creation and manifestation of intelligence in AI systems. 12,13Indeed, ML is commonly associated with the learning models of artificial intelligence.ML involves programming AI systems to learn from data.Once programmed, the machine leverages the available data to train and refine its own intelligence through practice and iterative processes.ML has found extensive applications across various domains, including medicine, education, economy, and engineering.In medicine, it is used for diagnostics, personalized treatments, and drug discovery.In education, it aids in adaptive learning and intelligent tutoring systems.In the economy, it assists with data analysis, forecasting, and fraud detection.In engineering, it facilitates automation, optimization, and predictive maintenance.[15][16][17][18] Moreover, ML is extensively applied in the field of energy to predict and establish correlations among variables in highly complex processes that cannot be easily explained through conventional means.For instance, a study by Onsree and Tippayawong (2020) demonstrated the development of a ML application for predicting yields of solid products obtained from biomass torrefaction.This model achieved a remarkable accuracy with an R2 value of approximately 0.9 with a root mean squared error (RMSE) value of approximately 0.07.Furthermore, the application also shed light on the interrelationships between variables within the torrefaction process, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms.Such applications of ML in energy-related research not only enhance predictive capabilities but also contribute to a</p>

<p>Any further responses from the reviewers can be found at the end of the article deeper understanding of complex processes and their underlying dynamics. 19Additionally, Phromphithak et al. (2021)  conducted a study where they employed ML techniques to predict the production of cellulose-rich materials during biomass pretreatment using ionic liquid solvents.The developed model exhibited a high accuracy, with an R2 value of 0.94 with an RMSE value of approximately 0.22.Moreover, the study successfully elucidated the behavior of ionic liquids and their impact on the ML-based pretreatment process.Ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment enhances lignocellulosic biomass conversion by dissolving lignin, reducing cellulose crystallinity, and improving accessibility for enzymatic or catalytic processes.ILs enable selective dissolution, efficient cellulose isolation, and recycling, offering a sustainable pretreatment method.Machine learning further aids in predicting outcomes and understanding IL effects on biomass. 20n a study by Prasertpong et al. (2022), the researchers investigated the synergistic effects observed during the co-pyrolysis of biomass and plastic waste using ML techniques.The aim of the study was to gain insights into the variables that influence the co-pyrolysis process.By employing machine learning, the researchers were able to uncover and comprehend the intricate relationships and interactions between these variables, shedding light on the synergistic effects observed during the co-pyrolysis process.This study highlights the potential of ML in providing valuable insights and understanding complex processes involving biomass and plastic waste co-pyrolysis. 21Furthermore, there have been studies that utilize ML in the context of HTL processes.In a previous research endeavor, an ML model was developed for predicting biocrude yields and higher heating values obtained from HTL of wet biomass and waste materials.The model achieved a high precision with an R 2 value of nearly 0.9 with normalized RMSE of 0.16.Additionally, it elucidated the relationships among variables that directly and indirectly impact the HTL process.This study showcases the potential of ML in accurately predicting and comprehending the complex interplay of variables in HTL processes, contributing to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing HTL and enabling more efficient and effective utilization of wet biomass and waste for biocrude production. 22There are other studies related to ML in HTL processes a number of similar. 23,24ndeed, the development of ML in the field of HTL is relatively new and holds great potential for further study and exploration in the future.Consequently, the collection and comprehensive search for research pertaining to the development of ML in the HTL process become crucial and should be given significant emphasis.This endeavor would facilitate the identification of existing studies, trends, and advancements in the application of ML techniques specifically for HTL, thereby laying the groundwork for future research and advancements in this domain.By focusing on this area of research, researchers can deepen their understanding of the potential of ML in HTL and further contribute to its development and utilization in the pursuit of sustainable and efficient energy production.Bibliometric analysis involves a systematic statistical examination of research data extracted from extensive databases, aiming to evaluate various aspects of scholarly work.This analysis serves as a valuable tool for measuring research quality, including the productivity and impact of individual researchers and institutions.By employing bibliometric methods, researchers can quantitatively assess factors such as publication output, citation counts, collaboration networks, journal rankings, and other bibliographic indicators.These analyses provide valuable insights into the performance and influence of researchers and institutions within specific fields of study, contributing to the evaluation and comparison of research outcomes across various domains. 25Bibliometric analysis is a research methodology that emphasizes quantitative and statistical investigations.It enables the description and analysis of various aspects of scholarly publications or literature, such as the type of publication, the countries, institutions, and authors associated with the research.By conducting long-term studies, bibliometric analysis allows researchers to identify trends in the growth or decline of research within specific fields.Consequently, bibliometric data serves as a valuable foundation for monitoring scientific and technological research, providing insights into the progress and development of knowledge in various domains. 26ibliographic analysis typically involves selecting a set of keywords to search relevant literature databases.These keywords are chosen based on the topic and title of the articles to retrieve information related to the conceptual framework and writing style within a specific field of study.Electronic bibliographic databases offer vast opportunities for efficient and rapid access to a wide range of scholarly resources.By utilizing these databases, researchers can benefit from an extensive collection of literature and gain quicker access to relevant information for their studies.This enables more efficient literature review and analysis, aiding in the advancement of research in a particular area. 27The application of the bibliometric method in the HTL field remains limited.Similar study of bibliometrics of HTL and ML was recently reported by Qian et al. 28 The review explores the application of ML in optimizing HTL for biomass conversion.Using bibliometric analysis tools, the study identifies research trends, key contributors, and future directions from 2020 to 2024.ML techniques are highlighted as effective for predicting product yields and optimizing HTL conditions, addressing challenges related to complex reaction pathways and feedstock variability.The paper emphasizes the growing role of ML in advancing HTL efficiency and sustainability.This review contributes to scientific and research growth by integrating ML with HTL to optimize biomass conversion.Through bibliometric analysis, it identifies key research trends, gaps, and future directions, fostering collaboration among researchers and institutions.By leveraging ML-based predictive models, the study enhances process efficiency, reducing trial-and-error experimentation.Additionally, its insights support industrial applications and sustainable energy development, making it a valuable resource for advancing both scientific knowledge and practical implementation in renewable energy research.</p>

<p>Results</p>
<p>Main data and annual publication growth</p>
<p>Table 1 provides an overview of the number of documents related to ML in the HTL process, categorized by year of publication from 1955 to 2023.The table shows the number of documents found for each year, indicating the volume of research conducted in this area.Figure 2   process, particularly in recent years.The findings from Figure 2 indicate that ML in the HTL process has garnered substantial attention and continues to gain momentum, highlighting its significance and potential for further advancements in research and applications.</p>
<p>Top 10 in various fields</p>
<p>Based on the analysis of search results related to ML in the HTL process, it was possible to rank the top 10 in terms of subject area, author name, source title, and country.Engineering emerged as the most published subject area, with 350 publications, as depicted in Figure 3.Among the authors, Samui, P, stood out with the highest number of publications on ML in HTL processes, totaling 20 publications, as shown in Figure 4.The most frequently published source title was "Bioresource Technology," with a notable 43 publications, as illustrated in Figure 5.China emerged as the country with the highest number of publications on the studied topic, with a total of 407 publications, as depicted in Figure 6.</p>
<p>From Figure 6, it can be seen that China ranks first in publications on ML in HTL processes, which has more than twice that of the second place.Figure 6</p>
<p>Bibliometric analysis</p>
<p>The bibliometric analysis in this study utilized the VOSviewer program to construct cluster maps and identify relationships within the database.The cluster map construction involved three aspects: co-citation correlation, keyword correlation, and published countries.A total of 38 author groups were identified.The analysis indicated that Zhang Y. had the highest number of links, with 21 links and 506 citations.However, it was observed that the number of links did not have a significant impact on citations.Li H.I. and Goh A.T.C. had 20 and 6 links, respectively, but garnered 1048 and 877 citations, respectively.</p>
<p>Figure 8 represents the cluster map based on the co-occurrence of all keywords.It revealed the existence of 5 keyword groups, with a predominant focus on HTL process-related keywords.Interestingly, ML keywords did not form a substantial cluster, potentially due to their relatively lower number compared to the keywords associated with the HTL process chain.The top 5 most common keywords were liquefaction, article, human, soil liquefaction, and male, with  frequencies of 590, 308, 219, 203, and 173, respectively.The keyword ML appeared in the 6th position, specifically in the form of "neural networks," with a frequency of 156.</p>

<p>The bibliometric analysis conducted in this study revealed a continuous increase in publications related to ML in HTL processes from 1955 to 2023.It was found that China has been the leading country in terms of publishing research in this area.The "Bioresource Technology" journal emerged as the most popular choice for publishing articles on ML in the HTL process.The field of engineering, particularly with a focus on the keyword "Liquefaction," garnered the most interest among researchers.These findings provide valuable insights and can serve as a guide for future studies on ML in HTL processes, offering a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in this domain.</p>

<p>Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility?The reviewer would like to thank the editors of F1000 for the opportunity to provide feedback on the manuscript "Current scenario of machine learning applications to hydrothermal liquefaction via bibliometric analysis".This study by Katongtung et al. leverages bibliometric analysis to collect and analyze publications relating to machine learning on hydrothermal liquefaction systems in the corpus of existing literature.Using a Scopus search, the authors uncovered the most productive authors in the field, and geopolitical regions with the greatest academic output.While the conclusions of this study (in which Chinese and US scientists tend to be the most productive in this area from a raw studies-published perspective) are useful, the manuscript may benefit from reformatting of figures for better clarity of the data being communicated, and for reconsideration of how each figure contributes to the overall narrative conclusion of the work.In light of the following comments, the reviewer recommends that this work is revised and resubmitted after major revisions, or reconsidered for indexing at another time.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>This paper should do a better job to introduce and motivate the problem/question it is trying to solve.The way the information is presented makes the analysis seem very exploratory and not directed.This leads to some of the figures, figure 3 for example, to seem disconnected from the overall story The work's motivation reads well and is well cited.I would recommend quantifying the conditions HTL occurs at (i.e. the exact pressures and temperature ranges rather than qualitative descriptions of "medium" and "high" temperature and pressure respectively.I would also recommend discussing why the higher heating values are useful -the authors discuss "various applications" but may consider discussing the exact applications (for example in aviation fuels) which may bolster the narrative.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>In the third paragraph, in which an ML model and AI as a whole are referred to vaguely as "the learning component of a machine" or in comparison to a "brain" may risk unsubstantiated analogies -rather than exhibiting "intelligent behavior" many applications of machine learning in HTL are rather used as fitting tools that can 2.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>predict metrics that are empirically useful.I would recommend discussing ML and AI in a more objective way.Overall, the description of ML and AI in the third introduction paragraph risk miscommunicating how ML and AI models work and often self contradict -for example, the authors refer to ML as not programs, but in the same sentence, refer to humans programming the ML.This kind of confusion warrants a more mechanistic description of ML and AI.</p>
<p>The reviewer appreciates the well cited and discussed summary of ML use in the introduction.However, many of the cited works span a broad range of use cases -for example, HTL pretreatments, yield prediction, and specific feedstock compositions are discussed, but the reviewer worries that this may be casting too wide of a net to focus on the nature of this study.The authors may stylistically disagree as needed.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Keyword choice may benefit from some honing -the terms may be too broad to reach the correct audience for what is a relatively niche intersectional field.The reviewer recommends specifying some of the keywords -even including HTL seems like great choice.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Overall, while the authors are able to clearly communicate how the work was performed, the results and the specific conclusions to be garnered from each figure could be better communicated.The reviewer struggles to find specific conclusions or a line of narrative information that the figures tie into.This poises the paper as primarily exploratory rather than providing the incisive synthesis of information that may be interpreted from the data in the figures.I highly recommend visualizing some of this useful data in a manner that a reader can derive obvious conclusions the authors wish to communicate (for example for the graph/node plot, greater spacing between the nodes may aid clarity).Similarly, I would recommend poising a stronger line of thought tying each point (i.e. each figure) together.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>Other Comments: R 2 vs MAE, RMSE, error metrics In paragraph 4 of the introduction, R 2 is used to refer to both accuracy and precision when referring to machine learning models.While R 2 is an empirically useful metric to quantify the correlation between two variables or goodness of fit, it does not describe accuracy or precision.When talking about ML models, metrics that communicate the applied usefulness or "error bounds" of a model may be more useful, and are widely used throughout ML in HTL.Some examples include RMSE (root mean squared error) or MAE (mean absolute error).R 2 can be used to describe the performance of the model (how close to a straight line does the parody plot of the model create)</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Regarding figure clarity, the reviewer suggests using colors of higher contrast -they are currently set up to be in the form of a heat map, where they are similar to each other but change down the list.This implies a relationship between the different items on the figures that may not exist (and if it does it could be helpful to clarify it!)Use of more distinct colors may rectify this 2.</p>
