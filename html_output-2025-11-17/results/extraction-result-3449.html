                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The discussion about the formation of human`s conceptual and cognitive system has been ongoing throughout history and different theories have been presented in this regard. Among the theories that have been advanced during the last 3 decades, there are some well-known viewpoints that emphasize the role of human embedded information processing in the formation of conceptual and cognitive processes. It is believed that cognition is grounded and cognitive processing depends on the environment on the one hand and the bodily sensorymotor system on the other. Our aim in this article is to review some theories of knowledge acquisition in cognitive psychology and cognitive science as well as modality-specific and the so called amodal systems of knowledge representation in the mind.</p>

The discussion about the formation of human`s conceptual and cognitive system has been ongoing throughout history and different theories have been presented in this regard. Among the theories that have been advanced during the last 3 decades, there are some well-known viewpoints that emphasize the role of human embedded information processing in the formation of conceptual and cognitive processes. It is believed that cognition is grounded and cognitive processing depends on the environment on the one hand and the bodily sensorymotor system on the other. Our aim in this article is to review some theories of knowledge acquisition in cognitive psychology and cognitive science as well as modality-specific and the so called amodal systems of knowledge representation in the mind.</p>
