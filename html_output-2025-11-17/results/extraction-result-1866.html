Objectives:The rise in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has reinforced the global quest for developing effective therapeutics.Traditional drug discovery approaches have been inadequate in overcoming this challenge due to their resource and time constraints.Methods: English literature was searched by structured queries related to our review between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2024.Results:The key resistance mechanisms in CRE, such as enzymatic hydrolysis, decreased permeability, and efflux pump overexpression, have been examined in this review.Computational technologies have become pivotal in discovering novel antimicrobial agents with improved accuracy and efficiency.Besides this, the review highlights the advances in structure-and ligand-based drug discovery approaches for identifying potential drugs against CRE.Recent studies demonstrating the use of such in silico techniques to develop targeted drugs against CRE have also been explored.Moreover, this review also underscores the significance of integrating both in silico and in vitro techniques to counter resistance in Enterobacterales, supported by the latest studies.However, these promising computational technologies have a few major drawbacks, such as a lack of standardized parameterization, potentially false positives, and the complexity of effective clinical translations.The drug regulatory barriers also restrict the progress of new antimicrobials for market approval.Conclusion:The use of computational technologies for antimicrobial inhibitor discovery is gaining popularity, and it can be expedited by refining computational techniques and integrating them with reliable in vitro validation.The use of innovative hybrid in silico and in vitro technologies is the need of the hour to tackle CRE and mitigate the global threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>
<p>| Introduction</p>
<p>The order Enterobacterales contains the family Enterobacteriaceae, and with over 250 species is among the most taxonomically diverse groups of bacterial families.Most common bacterial pathogens in the family Enterobacteriaceae include Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae [1,2].These pathogens are key causative agents of severe healthcareassociated infections (HAIs) having very limited treatment options.The antibiotic abuse has led to the rise of resistance in the Enterobacterales [3].Notably, the global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has become a formidable public threat [4,5].The nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infections, septicemia, and pneumonia caused by CRE often lead to inpatient hospitalization and higher mortalities [6].In light of this emerging threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recognized CRE as among their top priorities for research and development of new antimicrobial therapeutics [7,8].</p>
<p>Nonetheless, developing novel therapeutic agents against CRE is considerably arduous.These notorious pathogens have rapidly evolved various sophisticated resistance mechanisms that render the carbapenems (the most powerful class of β-lactam antibiotics) utterly ineffective against them [5].Briefly, these carbapenem-neutralizing adaptations include enzymatic degradation, exclusion from entering the bacterial cell, alteration of the binding sites, omission or mutation of the porin proteins, and overstimulation of the efflux pump (EP), as well as modifications of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) [9].Adding to the complexity, these resistance traits are often on mobile parts of the bacterial genetic material, such as plasmids, that facilitate swift spread across the bacterial population, thus exacerbating the challenge of resistance [10].The conventional approaches of drug discovery are laborious, costly, and often poorly address the rapid evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [11].The failure to develop effective treatments for CRE prompts crucial questions regarding the type of drug discovery and development strategies required to restore healthcare systems.</p>
<p>Several in silico technologies, such as molecular modeling and machine learning, can expedite and facilitate the discovery of antimicrobials against CRE [12,13].The optimization of the probable drug candidates can also be performed through these techniques [14].Once screened, the drug candidates can be subjected to various in vitro/in vivo tests to validate their cytotoxicity and efficacy [15,16].This review emphasizes the significance of computational technologies in developing as well as discovering antimicrobials against CRE.Furthermore, various latest research works that successfully implied combined in silico and in vitro techniques against CRE are also highlighted in this review.This study offers new opportunities for novel and innovative antimicrobial drug discovery using computational techniques, hence promoting strategies that can effectively address the global challenges of CRE as well as other pathogens.</p>
<p>| Literature Review</p>
<p>The academic databases that were utilized for obtaining data for this study included Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, and Cochrane Library.Structured queries were created for retrieving studies regarding carbapenem resistance mechanisms such as "carbapenem," "carbapenem resistance," "carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales," "carbapenemases."Furthermore, the search terms used for curating data related to the application of in silico and in vitro technologies included but not limited to "computer aided drug discovery," "combined in-silico and invitro analysis," "antimicrobials for Enterobacterales," "drug discovery against CRE."The selected articles were published between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2024.Articles published in languages other than English were strictly not entertained.</p>
<p>| Mechanisms of Carbapenem Resistance</p>
<p>Carbapenems are a clinically significant class of antibiotics, which have a broad spectrum of activity against several grampositive and gram-negative pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter spp., and Enterobacteriaceae [17][18][19].Carbapenems are somewhat like other β-lactam antibiotics apart from containing a 5-carbon ring fused with their β-lactam ring [20].This peculiar structural dissimilarity makes carbapenems resistant to hydrolysis by common β-lactamases or even extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) [19].Their mode of action involves inducing bacterial cell death by interacting with their PBPs and inhibiting cell wall synthesis [21,22].Imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, and doripenem are four approved common clinical drugs.Carbapenems were previously favored as the last line of defense against infections which could not be treated by other antibiotics.However, the efficacy of carbapenems is now facing critical decline due to the emergence of resistance in Enterobacterales [23].The carbapenem resistance is driven by the multifaceted mechanisms represented in Figure 1.</p>
<p>| Enzymatic Hydrolysis of Drugs</p>
<p>Enzymatic breakdown of antibiotics has been the most common resistance mechanism in bacterial pathogens.Originally, only hydrolyzing penicillin (by penicillinases), these enzymes have now significantly evolved over time.The carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales directly arises from the production of carbapenemases [24][25][26].In most members of the CRE, the resistance is solely conferred by these enzymes without requiring any other strategies.Carbapenemases are a subclass of βlactamases having versatile hydrolytic potential [26,27].The genes encoding carbapenemases such as bla KPC , bla NDM , and bla VIM are found on both bacterial plasmids and chromosomes</p>

<p>and can be disseminated to other pathogens by various mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer [25].This plasmid-mediated spread of carbapenemases contributes to increasing resistance not only against carbapenems and cephalosporins but also against aminoglycosides and colistin [28].</p>
<p>According to Ambler's classification, all the members of class A, B, and D β-lactamases can hydrolyze carbapenems; thus, they are considered carbapenemases [5].Based on active site fold, carbapenemases are broadly categorized into two groups.</p>
<p>The first group comprises the class A penicillinases and class D oxacillinases, which contain serine in their catalytic sites and are often inhibited by clavulanic acid [29].On the other hand, zinc metal is present at the active sites of the metalloβ-lactamases, which can be inhibited by EDTA-like chelating agents [29].</p>
<p>Popular members of class A carbapenemases are Guiana extended-spectrum β-lactamase (GES), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), Serratia marcescens enzyme (SME) and imipenem hydrolyzing β-lactamase/non-metallo enzyme carbapenemase (IMI/NMC) [29,30].The OXA (oxacillinase) represents the class D carbapenemases, with OXA-48 being predominantly involved in carbapenem resistance in CRE [29][30][31].</p>
<p>Several widely distributed metallo-β-lactamases have been implicated in carbapenem resistance.Among them are New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases (NDM), imipenemases (IMP), and Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamases (VIM) are commonly associated with serious clinical implications [26,28,30].Other infrequent but noteworthy members include German imipenemases (GIM), Seoul imipenemases (SIM), Australian imipenemases (AIM), and L1 carbapenemases [9].Table 1 summarizes information about the structure and activity profiles of the five most frequent and thoroughly investigated carbapenemases of CRE.Ikenoue et al. [32] observed that the effectiveness of the carbapenems can be reclaimed by synthesizing other drugs that can inhibit these enzymes.</p>
<p>| Active Expulsion of Drug</p>
<p>In Enterobacterales, another mechanism of carbapenem resistance is the overexpression of efflux pumps responsible for the expulsion of such drugs from bacterial cells [27].For example, the carbapenem expulsion is performed by the RND (Resistance-Nodulation-Division) efflux family, commonly known as the AcrAB-TolC efflux system, in E. coli and Salmonella enterica [33,34].In this system: AcrA is an anchoring protein that embeds the pump in the periplasm; AcrB is the central component, localized in the inner membrane; and TolC is an outer membrane protein that forms the channel [34,35].When antibiotics are complexed to AcrB, the structure is changed to force them through TolC, facilitated by AcrA, thus ejecting the drugs out of the cell [36].The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is primarily caused by the presence of RND-like efflux pumps [33,36,37].Thus, inhibiting the efflux pumps can lead to increased sensitivity of the CRE strains and better treatment strategies.</p>
<p>| Porin Channels Modifications</p>
<p>Alterations in the porins channels also significantly reduce the influx and permeability of carbapenems into the bacterial cells [27,38].These small, water-soluble antibiotics generally enter the bacterial cell through the porin channels.However, this antibiotic influx is greatly influenced by the size, structure, and quality of these outer membrane porins (OMPs) in the gramnegative pathogens [37].</p>
<p>Zhou et al. [39] emphasized the serious impact of certain OMPs of the CRE in declining the effectiveness of the treatment strategies.OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, OmpW, and OmpX-like porins are important for membrane stability and nutrient transport; moreover, these are also implicated in the development of antibiotic resistance [38].Table 2 shows the properties of some OMPs essential for exacerbating resistance in gram-negative pathogens.</p>
<p>| Alterations in Drug Target Sites</p>
<p>PBPs play a critical role in synthesizing the peptidoglycans of the bacterial cell walls [43].Carbapenems form acylated complexes by interacting with these PBPs, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis.Carbapenem resistance can also occur if the genetic structure of the target proteins is mutated [44].These genetic variations can change the conformation or availability of the PBPs, hinder the carbapenem's ability to reach its site of action, or inhibit its activation and thus decrease the drug efficacy [27,42,44].Genetic modifications can also lead to structural changes in the PBPs, synthesis of new PBPs as well as reduced binding affinity to the carbapenem [43].</p>
<p>Le Terrier et al. [45] observed that the decrease in carbapenem susceptibility in E. coli was associated with mutations in the PBP2-encoding mrdA gene.Moreover, when this mutation coexists with changes in the PBP3-encoding ftsI gene, the carbapenem resistance of E. coli is substantially increased [46].Strikingly, PBPs modifications often require additional factors such as decreased permeability or overstimulation of efflux pumps to actively induce carbapenem resistance in CRE.Jiang et al. [47] reported that targeting PBPs could effectively reduce carbapenem resistance (particularly induced by the ESBL/PBP pathway) in K. pneumoniae.</p>
<p>| Biofilm Barriers</p>
<p>Biofilms are complex clusters made by bacteria as they adhere to a self-produced polymeric matrix [48,49].These entities protect bacteria against various antimicrobial agents and unfavorable environmental conditions.The penetration of carbapenem is drastically reduced in the presence of bacterial biofilms [11].Sauer et al. [50] defines biofilms as structures with distinct phases essential for bacterial communication, gene exchange, and defense.The LPS (lipopolysaccharides), flagella as well as type I and III fimbriae are characteristic components of a bacterial biofilm [7,51].Modifying these components helps protect bacteria when exposed to carbapenems; therefore, facilitating antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>The biofilm production in K. pneumoniae is regulated by capsular polysaccharides, which aid in intracellular signaling, and type III fimbriae, which facilitate cell-to-cell adherence [52,53].When exposed to meropenem, K. pneumoniae reduces the production of pili and flagellar proteins as its key resistance mechanism [51].Al-Bayati et al. [54] credited the biofilm-associated genes' upregulation concomitant with IMP and NDM carbapenemases' production in greatly enhancing the antibiotic resistance and virulence of E. coli and K. pneumoniae.Clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales were observed to have a strong propensity to form biofilms, which was directly associated with NDM-1 production [55].</p>
<p>| Computational Strategies for Antimicrobial Discovery</p>
<p>Although advances in combinatorial chemistry produce surplus compound libraries, only a small fraction of them contribute to the drug market.The intensive time and financial demands of conventional validation approaches are primarily responsible for this gap, creating a great bottleneck in the antimicrobial discovery pipeline.Computer-aided drug design (CADD) approaches are shifting the paradigm of antimicrobial discovery by rapidly screening the potential lead compound.Its main uses include but are not limited to identifying "hits" or "leads" for a particular target from a small molecule library, evaluating the selectivity of compounds towards the targets, improving leads to increase their affinity to the target, their ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) profiles, and finally, designing new chemotypes for library synthesis and biological testing [12,56].This section describes the computational techniques commonly used for discovering drugs against CRE. Figure 2 summarizes the basic workflow of CADD.</p>
<p>| Ligand-Based Drug Discovery</p>
<p>Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) is a powerful approach in drug discovery, particularly useful when the 3D structure of the biological target is unknown [57,58].Its operating principle is that the molecules with structural similarities tend to display related bioactivities [59].Thus, rather than focusing on the target itself, LBDD focuses on the ligands or known "actives" to identify compounds with comparable structures or physicochemical properties [56].In this way, the geometric or chemical features of a compound essential to interact with the target can be identified.</p>
<p>LBDD measures the similarities between molecules using Tanimoto coefficient-like metrics [57].These metrics simply compare the structural fragments of known active molecules with those of the virtual libraries.LBDD techniques, such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) and pharmacophore modeling, often categorize descriptors into three classes: 1D for basic molecular features such as weight, atom numbers, or types; 2D for structural topology or molecular connectivity; and 3D for spatial arrangement and molecular conformations [57,60].</p>
<p>| Pharmacophore Modeling</p>
<p>Pharmacophore modeling identifies the set of structural features of a compound required for its optimal interaction with the target [59].The pharmacophore model depicts the spatial arrangement of these key features such as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and ionizable regions, which are essential for producing a biological effect after binding to the target [58,61].</p>
<p>As the exact atomic details are ignored, only the essential chemical features are identified.This facilitates recognizing similarities across structurally diverse compounds sharing a common biological target [62].Thus, a pharmacophore model serves as a reference for screening new drugs, with the potential to interact with a specific target, from vast compound libraries [60,63].</p>
<p>Pharmacophore models can be developed using either ligandbased or structure-based approaches.The ligand-based approach is employed when the 3D structure of the target protein is inadequate or unavailable, but information regarding active ligands exists [62].So, the chemical properties of these known ligands are used to identify structural motifs relevant to target binding [64].Contrarily, in the structure-based approach, the features of the binding site are directly mapped from the available structure of the target protein, which is used for searching compounds with complementary structural features [61].A pharmacophore model can be generated using the steps depicted in Figure 3 [12,63].</p>
<p>Pharmacophore modeling plays a significant role in the fight against CRE, aiding the identification of structurally diverse compounds with similar antimicrobial activities.a large library of phytochemicals retrieved using online databases.Their study concluded that only 5 out of 2500 screened phytocompounds could effectively bind to the target proteins and therefore, can be used to inhibit E. xiangfangensis.</p>
<p>| Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship</p>
<p>QSAR is a highly valuable in silico drug discovery approach that predicts the biological activities of chemical compounds by developing models based on their structural features [67,68].QSAR quantitatively describes how molecular descriptors of certain compounds relate to their bioactivities.These models facilitate selective filtering and optimizing of potential drugs for improved activities in terms of affinity, selectivity, and reduced side effects [69].QSAR identifies structural modifications of a molecule that can enhance its biological activity.Table 3 summarizes the properties of QSAR models.</p>
<p>QSAR models utilize both statistical and multivariate techniques, such as logistic regression and pattern recognition methods, to analyze the structural features such as electronic, spatial, and hydrophobic properties and relate these to the pharmacokinetic, toxicity, and bioactivities of the compound [70,71].QSAR  Assists in analyzing various solvation models -models are particularly useful in the process of virtual screening to rapidly evaluate vast compound libraries, expediting the drug discovery [67].These models also help in estimating the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) profiles of compounds and excluding those with undesirable pharmacokinetics early in the process [69,72].Software such as PharmQSAR, ADMEWORKS Model Builder, DeepAuto QSAR, ezqsar, QSAR-Co, Spartan, MOE, and GUSAR are commonly employed to construct QSAR models, generally following this scheme, Figure 4 [70,73].</p>
<p>QSAR modeling has become quite popular in the discovery of antimicrobial agents to inhibit CRE.Since NDM-1 neutralizing drugs are quite few currently, this study therefore employed QSAR models to screen promising inhibitors [74].Yu et al. [74] collected IC 50 values of over 600 NDM-1 inhibitors from the ChEMBL database and analyzed 12 molecular fingerprint sets using a machine learning approach.The QSAR model revealed that aromatic, carbonyl, and aliphatic regions can potentiate the inhibition of NDM-1.Such studies provide key information regarding lead optimization for developing NDM-1 inhibitors, advancing the combat against CRE.</p>
<p>| Structure-Based Drug Discovery</p>
<p>Structure or receptor-based drug discovery (SBDD) uses the 3-dimensional structures of target molecules-typically proteins-to predict and score the potential drugs (ligands) [75,76].SBDD determines the binding affinities and stability of the complexes by simulating the ligands' orientations in the active site of the target protein.One of the widely used SBDD techniques is molecular docking, which can practically measure and predict the binding modes, prioritizing the compounds with the highest affinities [60].SBDD advances antimicrobial discovery by leveraging the welldefined 3D structural properties of target molecules for designing and optimizing the ligands for desired bioactivities [75].Briefly, this approach is concerned with locating the protein binding sites, preparing the ligand compound libraries, performing the molecular dynamics simulations, and ultimately estimating the binding energies [76].SBDD also provides insight into understanding the resistance mechanisms at the molecular level, promoting the development of targeted antimicrobial drugs [77].</p>
<p>| Molecular Docking</p>
<p>Molecular docking can predict the most favorable binding mode and affinity between a ligand (small chemical compounds) and a target receptor (proteins) [78].Docking or search algorithms stimulate how a ligand would fit in the binding site of the target protein and identify optimal binding orientations.Then the scoring function ranks these orientations as binding affinities in terms of their hydrophobicity and structural complementation [79].Molecular docking requires high-resolution 3D structures of the target proteins, which can be obtained from experimental techniques (NMR or X-ray crystallography) or homology-based computational techniques [80].With the help of AI-powered tools like AlphaFold, the 3D structures of proteins, previously difficult to characterize, can be predicted with high accuracy [75].</p>
<p>Consequently, molecular docking has become indispensable in antimicrobial drug discovery for rapidly screening large compound libraries and identifying potential inhibitors against bacterial proteins, which can be experimentally validated [81].The detailed molecular interactions between ligands and their protein targets can also be modeled through docking algorithms.AutoDock vina, Discovery studio, FlexX, GOLD, LigandFit, UCSF DOCK, Glide, rDOCK, and FRED are commonly used software and algorithms for generating and scoring multiple orientations of protein-ligand complexes [78,82].The steps of the general docking scheme are presented in Figure 5   performed a similar study in which they evaluated the effects of one-point mutations in NDM-1 on its carbapenem hydrolysis abilities.For this purpose, they selected seven mutants of NDM-1 that increased the binding affinities with inhibitors by 50% and subjected these complexes to further simulation.Tran et al. [86] concluded that amino acid substitutions at the 122 and 124 positions of wild-type NDM-1 significantly influence its binding with antibiotics.</p>
<p>| Molecular Dynamics Simulation</p>
<p>Molecular dynamics simulations (MDSs) are now widely applied in antimicrobial drug discovery as they provide detailed insights into the atomic changes within the molecular systems occurring due to physical interactions or docking [80].MDS captures the gradual changes in the structures of interacting molecules, which are difficult to obtain when conducting experiments only [87].It has become an effective approach for probing complex issues related to protein misfolding or aggregation and uncovering new therapeutics for various disorders [16].MDS improves the SBDD process by considering protein flexibility, representing its original biological conformation, which is an inherent limitation of experimentally determined static protein models [88].It enables the development of multiple conformations of protein structure and identifies more accurate druggable sites for ensemble docking.</p>
<p>MDS process begins with the system preparation, where both ligand and protein are optimized by energy minimization and a dual-stage equilibration that ensures complex stability [88,89].Then, simulations are performed to monitor the atomic interactions over time, mapping the binding interactions, flexibility, and stability of the protein-ligand complex [79].MD programs such as AMBER, DESMOND, GROMACS, NAMD, and CHARMM utilize force fields to accurately represent the molecular interactions and atomic forces, producing detailed MDS trajectories [57,80].The simulation trajectories are further analyzed based on specific parameters, summarized in Table 4.Despite its efficiency, MDS requires robust computational resources and is often limited by the accuracy of force fields and simulation periods, which may not properly record long-term dynamics [87].</p>
<p>Major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is a class of efflux pumps that can actively expel antibiotics from bacterial cells, significantly contributing to resistance in CRE.MDS revealed the conformational transitions of MFS proteins, identifying an intermediate state between its inward and outward conformations [90].Li et al. [90] reported that in E. coli, this inward transition is initiated by protonation on the periplasmic side, which enhances the hydrophobic interactions and structural changes.On the other hand, the reverse transition is maintained by hydrophobic membrane interactions.Concurrently, the changes in cytoplasmic bridges restrict substrate entry.These findings develop insights regarding efflux pump dynamics in CRE and contribute to the screening of inhibitors to overcome resistance.</p>
<p>| ADMET Profiling</p>
<p>ADMET analysis determines the safety and efficacy of potential therapeutic candidates [91].With billions invested annually by pharmaceuticals for new drug development, about half of these compounds fail due to their poor pharmacokinetic properties or undesirable toxicity [80,92].Although several predictive models are available that can determine the toxicity of the drug candidates (Figure 6), their use raises serious ethical concerns.In contrast, computational tools overcome these challenges and facilitate early-stage ADMET profiling with higher efficiency, lower cost and time, and limited reliance on animal models [93].</p>
<p>The potential drug candidates must follow some of the predefined rules for drug-likeness.One significant rule is the Lipinski Rule of Five (RO5) which focuses on molecular properties such as molecular weight (&lt; 500 Da), partition coefficient (≤ 5), polar surface area (&lt; 140), hydrogen bond donors (≤ 5) and acceptors (≤ 10) [94].Additional rules include the Ghose filter, which determines molecular weight, lipophilicity, and molecular refractivity, and the Veber rule, which considers molecular flexibility and polar surface area [95].Despite being valuable, all such rules are not absolute, and drug discovery approaches often integrate them with computational tools for better predictions [91].</p>
<p>Online tools such as admetSAR, SwissADME, ADMETlab, and DrugMint have expedited drug discovery by predicting the permeability and toxicity of potential therapeutic drugs [16,80].Moreover, some of the AI-powered platforms, such as LiveDesign by Schrödinger, have revolutionized the drug optimization process [96].The advances in structural modeling of proteins with critical roles in drug metabolism have enhanced the accuracy of these ADMET predictions, reflecting realistic clinical outcomes [93].The integration of multi-omics techniques in precision medicine has also improved ADMET predictions [95].Moreover, by incorporating proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics, the inter-individual variability in drug response can be considered, facilitating more personalized therapies [76].</p>
<p>| Successful Applications of In Silico Approaches</p>
<p>Computational tools have been indispensable in the search for antimicrobials targeting CRE, as shown in Table 5.In this section, we have explored some of the latest studies employing the use of computational techniques to overcome the carbapenem resistance mechanisms of Enterobacterales.</p>
<p>The study by Elbaramawi et al. [104] is particularly interesting in this aspect.In this study, Elbaramawi et al. [104] screened and developed novel inhibitors against Methionine tRNA synthetase (MetRS) of P. mirabilis.MetRS has a crucial role in the biosynthesis of several metabolic proteins of P. mirabilis.As the 3D structure of the target protein was unavailable, Elbaramawi et al. [104] used MOE software to construct its homology model.Then, structure-based pharmacophore models were developed to screen potential inhibitors against P. mirabilis.The inhibition activities of screened compounds were evaluated by molecular docking and simulation analyses.This study concluded that Val235, Lys334, Asp52, and Glu27 of P. mirabilis MetRS are key amino acids that should be targeted to develop its novel inhibitors.</p>
<p>Oyedara et al. [105] conducted systematic in silico analysis to determine the inhibitory activities of several phytocompounds from selected Mexican medicinal plants against Salmonella AcrB efflux pump protein.For this purpose, they performed molecular docking of 71 phytochemicals and the target protein using Open Babel and AutoDock vina.The top-scoring phytochemicals were then screened for their ADMET properties, and only those having desirable drug-like properties were chosen for further testing.The selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 50 ns simulation using GROMACS software.Oyedara et al. [105] reported naringenin, licarin A, and methoxypsoralin as potential inhibitors of the efflux pump of S. enterica, as these compounds actively bound the distal deep pockets of the AcrB protein.</p>
<p>Computational technologies are also valuable in identifying novel target sites of CRE.In this essence, Jamil et al. [103] emphasized targeting proteins of K. pneumoniae essential for host interactions.Initial screening of over 400 bacterial proteins identified 16 candidates based on their non-homology and pathogenicity.2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate Nsuccinyltransferase (DapD), which is a key protein of the lysine metabolic pathway of K. pneumoniae, was selected as the target molecule.Subsequently, docking-based virtual screening of Similarly, Ahmed et al. [106] identified inhibitors against a novel target protein of S. typhi.They generated protein-ligand interaction fingerprint (PLIF)-based pharmacophore models to screen natural compound inhibitors against S. typhi.LpxC, a metallo amidase responsible for the synthesis of Lipid A (bacterial endotoxin) was selected as the target protein.The toxicity and ADME properties of the top-scoring compounds were also analyzed after docking.MD simulation of 100 ns was performed using YASARA software, identifying three inhibitors of the Salmonella LpxC enzyme.</p>
<p>| Combined In Vitro and In Silico Validation of Antimicrobials</p>
<p>The in silico and in vitro combination therapy has become the new reference for drug development in the face of increasing antibiotic resistance.This iterative approach integrating the speed and accuracy of computational techniques with the precise in vitro/in vivo validation provides a reliable and effective drug discovery process against CRE [14,107].The analysis of molecular factors influencing the effectiveness of a chemical compound derives the discovery of novel and more potent analogs [12,108].Such analogs can then be tested by rigorous experiments for their antimicrobial efficacy specifically targeting the resistance mechanisms.Various latest research works involving such combined approaches are briefly summarized in Table 6.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive study by Abuelizz et al. [109], three Benzoquinazoline derivatives were identified as potent inhibitors of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae.In their study, Abuelizz et al. [109] determined the antibacterial activity of the benzo-[g]-quinazolines through in vitro XTT reduction assay, and the results showed that the compounds inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae 60% more effectively than the selected antibiotics.The docking results further confirmed the effective binding of the designed compounds with the OXA-48 β-lactamase of K. pneumoniae.The stability of the docked complexes was evaluated by MD simulation of 10 ns.Thus, both in silico and in vitro analyses of the benzoquinazoline derivatives highlighted their antimicrobial activities not only against K. pneumoniae but also against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fluconazole-resistant Candida albicans.Moreover, these compounds exhibited very low cytotoxic activity against normal human lung fibroblast cells (WI-38 cell line).</p>
<p>In another compelling study by Abdel-Halim et al. [111], the inhibitory activities of coumarin targeting K. pneumoniae were analyzed using various in silico and in vitro techniques.In this study, the presence of certain carbapenemase-encoding genes (bla OXA , bla NDM , bla VIM ) was detected in 6 different clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae through PCR.These carbapenemases were then selected as target enzymes docked against coumarin.The broth microdilution assay showed that the growth of K. pneumoniae is inhibited in the presence of coumarin.Strikingly, the checkerboard assay exhibited the synergistic activities of coumarin with meropenem against the selected pathogen.Such studies highlight the discovery of coumarin and other such compounds that can not only actively inhibit CRE but can also revive the efficacy of carbapenems against them.</p>
<p>Medicinal plants produce several secondary metabolites that exhibit antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities.Thus, in a study by Mehta et al. [114], the potential of various medicinal plants, namely Centella asiatica, Ocimum sanctum, Momordica charantia, Zingiber officinale, and Ziziphus mauritiana, to inhibit the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump of S. typhimurium was evaluated.For this purpose, the phytocompounds of the selected medicinal plants and RamR (key protein of EP) were subjected to molecular docking employing AutoDock vina.The in silico analysis screened the presence of certain compounds such as Lariciresinol exhibiting high binding affinities for the target proteins.The in vitro microdilution analysis also confirmed the antimicrobial potential of selected plants.For analyzing their biofilm inhibition potential, the EtBr cartwheel assay was also performed.The integrated in silico and in vitro study concluded that Z. officinale had comparatively the highest antibacterial    and anti-biofilm activities against carbapenem-resistant S. typhimurium [114].</p>
<p>| Future Perspectives</p>
<p>In silico technologies have transformed the conventional drug discovery process by being rapid and cost-effective.Techniques such as QSAR, molecular dynamics, pharmacophore modeling, and docking have been indispensable, particularly in the development of antimicrobials targeting CRE.These tools have facilitated not only the identification of "hit" or lead compounds but also the optimization of drug candidates, substantially reducing the time for experimental stages.Nevertheless, these advanced technologies have their own drawbacks.In silico models often face parameterization challenges, can produce false positive or negative results, and lack the subtility to accurately predict ligand-protein interactions.</p>
<p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have the potential to revolutionize the antibacterial drug discovery process by making quicker, more accurate predictions based on massive datasets of chemical substances [119,120].These models can precisely and efficiently predict receptor-ligand docking interactions [121].Moreover, the high-throughput screening and optimization of pharmacokinetic properties of chemical compounds are also facilitated by these models [122].Python-based AI models such as DeepChem (https:// github.com/ deepc hem/ deepchem) and DeepTox (http:// www.bioinf.jku.at/ resea rch/ DeepTox) can screen vast chemical compound libraries and predict their toxicity [121].ORGANIC (https:// github.com/ aspur u-guzikgroup/ ORGANIC) and other molecular generation tools aid in designing chemical compounds having desired drug-like properties [123] DeltaVina (https:// github.com/ cheng wang88/ delta vina) and PotentialNet (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00507)use different scoring functions to predict the binding affinity of ligands and receptors [124].Moreover, AlphaFold (https:// deepm ind.com/ blog/ alpha fold), RoseTTAFold (https:// github.com/ Roset taCom mons/ RoseT TAFold) and trRosetta (https:// yangl ab.nankai.edu.cn/ trRos etta/ downl oad/ ) use neural networks to predict the protein structures based on residue-to-residue distance and contact [125].To enable individualized treatment methods, future research should concentrate on improving AI systems to anticipate resistance patterns with greater precision [126].</p>
<p>Integrating AI and ML techniques with in vitro and in vivo experiments can expedite drug validation and enhance clinical outcomes [127].Additionally, these techniques offer real-time solutions for optimizing drugs by facilitating the development of adaptive learning models that evolve with emerging antibacterial resistance [128].However, handling enormous data and ensuring ethical considerations will be crucial in utilizing the full potential of AI and ML-based approaches in antimicrobial drug discovery.</p>
<p>The future of in silico drug discovery lies in bridging the gap between computational predictions and their clinical applications.For this purpose, the predictive capabilities of these computational technologies must be integrated with reliable experimental validation.</p>
