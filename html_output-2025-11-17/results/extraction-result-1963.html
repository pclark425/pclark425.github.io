                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents. However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies. Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts. Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencies-highlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks. We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.</p>

<p>HEAL: An Empirical Study on Hallucinations in Embodied Agents Driven by Large Language Models

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being adopted as the cognitive core of embodied agents.However, inherited hallucinations, which stem from failures to ground user instructions in the observed physical environment, can lead to navigation errors, such as searching for a refrigerator that does not exist.In this paper, we present the first systematic study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents performing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies.Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond.To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40× higher than base prompts.Evaluating 12 models across two simulation environments, we find that while models exhibit reasoning, they fail to resolve scene-task inconsistencieshighlighting fundamental limitations in handling infeasible tasks.We also provide actionable insights on ideal model behavior for each scenario, offering guidance for developing more robust and reliable planning strategies.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Recent advances in the reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) (Chang et al., 2024;Wei et al., 2022) have led to their increasing adoption as the cognitive core (Mai et al., 2023) of embodied agents (Zhang et al., 2024b;Kannan et al., 2024;Dorbala et al., 2023), enabling these systems to interpret instructions in natural language and formulate action plans in complex environments.However, LLMs have well-known vulnerabilities (Liu et al., 2024;Chakraborty et al., 2024).Consequently, LLMdriven agents (Xiang et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2025) inherit not only the vast world knowledge and reasoning capability of LLMs, but also their limita- tions (Jiao et al., 2024;Zhang et al., 2025); most notably a persistent tendency to hallucinate (Perković et al., 2024;Sriramanan et al., 2024).</p>
<p>While hallucination is a well-recognized limitation of LLMs (Tonmoy et al., 2024;Rawte et al., 2023a), its manifestation in embodied agents is qualitatively different.Unlike conversational systems, where hallucinations often result in factual errors or incoherent replies (Zhou et al., 2023;Yu et al., 2024a), hallucinations in embodied agents stem from a failure to ground user-provided task instructions in the observed physical environment.This misalignment can lead to consequences far more serious than a simple textual error.For example, if a robot is instructed to "put the knives in the dishwasher" but no dishwasher is present, an LLM unable to reconcile the task with the observed scene may hallucinate the existence of the dishwasher, and include it in the generated plan to follow the user instruction.This can cause the robot to place sharp utensils in an empty cabinet or try to press buttons on a bare wall, leading to physical damage, safety hazards, and wasted battery.Such behaviors highlight the need for scene-taskconsistent planning in LLM-based agents.</p>
<p>Motivated by these limitations of current LLMsmost of which are optimized to complete tasks {"node goals": [ {"name": "washing_machine", "state": "ON"}, {"name": "washing_machine", "state": "PLUGGED_IN"}], "edge goals": [{"from_name": "clothes_jacket", "relation": "ON", "to_name": "washing_machine"}, {"from_name": "soap", "relation": "ON", "to_name": "washing_machine"}]} (A) Base Pipeline {"node goals": [...], "edge goals": [ {"from_name": "clothes_jacket", "relation": "ON", "to_name": "washing_machine"}]} {"node goals": [ {"name": "washer", "state": "ON"}], "edge goals": [ {"from_name": "detergent", "relation": "ON", "to_name": "washing_machine"}]}</p>
<p>{"node goals": [ {"name": "washing_machine", "state": "ON"}], "edge goals": [ {"from_name": "soap", "relation": "ON", "to_name": "washing_machine"}]} The base pipeline in the existing benchmark (Li et al., 2024b) begins with a scene parser that extracts structured textual scene information from raw visual input.Combined with the natural language task description, this is processed by an LLM to generate symbolic goals in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) (see subsection 3.1).(B) Examples of hallucinations.Output elements highlighted in red indicate hallucinated content that is not grounded in the scene information, i.e., inconsistent with the observed environment.These examples demonstrate that when inconsistencies arise between the scene information and the given task description, the LLM fails to reconcile the two and generates incorrect plans or object references.Given the base prompt, we systematically modify two core input components-the task description and scene information-to elicit hallucinations.Our four controlled modifications of the base prompts are: under task description variation, (i) Distractor Injection-adds non-existent objects to the task description; and under scene variation, (ii) Task Relevant Object Removal-omits key objects from the scene; (iii) Synonymous Object Substitution-replaces scene objects with synonyms; and (iv) Scene Task Contradiction-introduces conflicts between the task and scene.</p>
<p>Scene</p>
<p>under ideal conditions-we shift our focus to understand their failure modes.Although prior works explore LLMs in embodied agents (Majumdar et al., 2024;Islam et al., 2023) and hallucinations in QA (Guan et al., 2024;Xu et al., 2025), studies on hallucinations in embodied agents, especially for long-horizon tasks, are limited.Existing efforts (Zhou et al., 2024) mainly study incidental cases from generic prompts, capturing only surface-level issues and overlooking the failure patterns behind hallucinations.To fill this gap, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first empirical study that systematically exemplifies and quantifies hallucinations in long-horizon planning through controlled scene-task inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Because existing datasets either do not explicitly aim to elicit hallucination in long-horizon embodied tasks, or do not target embodied agent tasks, we first construct a new probing set 1 that is more likely to cause hallucination.Constructing such a probing set faces two main challenges: (i) how to induce hallucinations and (ii) how to detect unwanted behaviors caused by hallucinations.We solve these challenges by systematically modifying base prompts from the existing LLM-based embodied agent benchmark (Li et al., 2024b) to introduce scene-task inconsistencies.Specifically, we modify the two core components of each base prompt-the task description and the scene information-to create mismatches between user instructions and the observed environment (see Figure 2).</p>
<p>With the new hallucination inducing probing set, we conduct an empirical study of popular LLMs.Overall, among our four controlled modifications, Synonymous Object Substitution yields the lowest hallucination rates, suggesting that models can recognize objects conceptually belonging to the same category but often fail to maintain naming consistency, probably due to the inherent tendency of language models to favor varied phrasing over strict lexical alignment.In contrast, the highest hallucination rates occur under Scene Task Contradiction (see Figure 1), revealing the model's inability to ground planning to perceived environments.</p>
<p>We also empirically study the effectiveness of mitigation strategies (Peng et al., 2023;Yin et al., 2024).The result shows that, even with feedbackbased self-correction, hallucinations in Scene Task Contradiction remain high, underscoring a fundamental inability of models to recognize the infeasibility of the task.Additionally, our small-scale experiments with vision-language models (VLMs) suggest that hallucinations are reduced when both image and text inputs are available, emphasizing the importance of cross-modal verification.</p>
<p>In summary, our contributions are as follows:</p>
<p>• We present the first study of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents for long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies.Our probing set, building on the existing benchmark, elicits hallucination rates up to 40× higher than base prompts, effectively exposing hallucinations.Our designed scenarios can be leveraged to guide robust planning.</p>
<p>• Our study, involving 12 models and a new hallucination probing set based on two simulation environments, reveals that among the four variants, Scene Task Contradiction induces the highest hallucination rates.The models exhibit signs of reasoning and do not blindly follow prompts; however, a prominent pattern is their inability to reject infeasible tasks-stemming from the trait that they do not know how to say "no".</p>
<p>• The absence of hallucination does not guarantee correct planning in scene-task inconsistencies.For instance, when instructed to turn on a washing machine that is not present, the models fail to reject the task and instead re-purpose available objects-such as turning on the shower-resulting in unsafe actions.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>LLMs in Embodied AI.Use of LLMs in Embodied AI ranges from high-level planners that decompose instructions into subtasks, as shown in Say-Can (Ahn et al., 2022); to multimodal reasoners like PaLM-E (Driess et al., 2023).LLMs can also serve as natural interaction interfaces between humans and robots (Cui et al., 2023).Such versatile capabilities have led to the integration of LLMs throughout the embodied AI stack, from perception processing (Kamath et al., 2021) to decisionmaking frameworks combining internet knowledge with embodied grounding (Song et al., 2023;Zawalski et al., 2024;Ren et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2022).Vision-Language Action (VLA) (Jiang et al., 2023;Brohan et al., 2023;Kim et al., 2024) models further extend these capabilities by jointly learning representations among modalities like vision, language, and physical action.Despite these advances, these systems still face grounding challenges (Majumdar et al., 2024;Islam et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Hallucinations in LLMs.Hallucinations in LLMs have been widely studied in text-only settings (Dhuliawala et al., 2023;Agrawal et al., 2024).Recent work extends these to multimodal LLMs, manifested as category misidentification, attribute errors, or relation misrepresentation (Bai et al., 2024;Xu et al., 2025;Guan et al., 2024).Causes include data quality issues, weak vision encoders, and language model priors overriding visual evidence.Mitigation approaches include cross-checking (Yu et al., 2024b), instruction-tuning (Liu et al., 2023), selfcorrection (Peng et al., 2023), and others.</p>
<p>Hallucinations in Embodied AI.Recent studies (Li et al., 2024a,b;Zhou et al., 2024) have examined incidental embodied AI hallucinations from generic prompts, but these capture only surfacelevel issues without revealing underlying failure patterns.Other work (Yang et al., 2024b) investigates object hallucinations using binary existence questions, but such simplified formats fail to address the complexity of long-horizon tasks that require complicated actions beyond mere QA.</p>
<p>Methodology</p>
<p>To conduct our study, we construct a new hallucination probing set by systematically modifying an existing embodied AI benchmark (Li et al., 2024b) to introduce scene-task inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Preliminaries</p>
<p>Embodied Settings.Let x td denote the userprovided natural language task description and x i the corresponding visual observation captured by the agent's camera about the environment.Let O denote the set of objects present in the scene and S the universal set of all states that any object can attain.A perception module P transforms the visual input x i into a structured linguistic representation x s that describes the scene in terms of tuples of the form
(o k , s 0 k , s p k ), where o k ∈ O is the k-th object, s 0 k ∈ S is its initial state, and s p k ⊆ S
is the set of all possible states the object may attain.This representation captures both the current scene information and the potential state transitions available for objects, as formalized in Equation 1.
x s = P(x i ) = {(o k , s 0 k , s p k ) | o k ∈ O, s 0 k ∈ S, s p k ⊆ S}(1)
An LLM-based goal interpretation module L, parameterized by θ, takes as input the combined context x = (x td , x s ) and outputs a structured goal specification in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) (Li et al., 2024b), consisting of a set of node goals and edge goals, as illustrated in Figure 2
L θ (x td , x s ) = {(o k , s g k )}, {(o i , r, o j )} (2)
These symbolic goals are then passed to downstream modules such as action planning and trajectory generation (Li et al., 2024b).We highlight that any misinterpretation of the LTL goal is critical, as errors at this stage will propagate through the downstream modules and impair task execution.</p>
<p>Hallucination.Hallucination is commonly defined as an apparent perception in the absence of an external stimulus (Ji et al., 2023).In the context of LLM-conditioned embodied agents, we define hallucination as the generation of content that is not grounded in the observed environment (Rawte et al., 2023b;Huang et al., 2025)
/ ∈ S). H(x, y) =      1 if ∃o k ∈ F obj (y) with o k / ∈ O or ∃s g k ∈ F state (y) with s g k / ∈ S, 0 otherwise (3)</p>
<p>Hallucination Instances</p>
<p>Previous studies (Liu et al., 2023;Guan et al., 2024) show that hallucinations arise when the user query references objects absent from the image, suggesting that inconsistencies between the scene and the user-provided instruction are a key trigger.Inspired by this, we extend an existing benchmark (Li et al., 2024b) to systematically understand hallucination patterns by applying targeted transformations to two core components of the base prompt: task description x td and scene information x s , to introduce scene-task inconsistencies.A. Task Description Modification.In this setting, we modify the task description x td of the base prompt while keeping the scene x s unchanged, allowing us to examine how variations in userprovided instructions can trigger hallucinations.i ⃝ Distractor Injection.We introduce distractors o d (non-existent objects in the scene) into the base prompt's task description x td without altering the core task intent.We employ a structured prompt (see Appendix Figure 4) to query GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), which subtly inserts distractors into task descriptions and generates modified ones while preserving the original task intent.A hallucination is detected if the model's output references the distractor object.As shown in Figure 2, adding refrigerator as a distractor in a washing clothes task causes the model to hallucinate a goal involving the refrigerator, even though it is not present in the scene.The new prompt with distractor injection is defined as Equation 4.
(x ′ td , x s ), where x ′ td = x td ∪ {o d } and o d / ∈ O (4)
B. Scene Information Modification.We keep the task description x td fixed and modify the scene information x s to investigate hallucinations induced by changes in the environment.</p>
<p>ii ⃝ Task Relevant Object Removal.A taskrelevant object o r is one in the ground-truth LTL plan and critical to the success of the task.We randomly remove task-relevant object o r from the structured scene information x s , creating cases with missing task-relevant objects while keeping the task description x td unchanged.A hallucination is detected if the model's output references the removed object.For example, as shown in Figure 2, removing washing machine from the scene while it is required by the task causes the model to hallucinate the washing machine in its goal output, whereas it correctly omits soap, indicating that not all object removals result in hallucination.See Appendix G for more details.The new modified prompt is defined as Equation 5.
(x td , x ′ s ), where x ′ s = x s \ {o r }, with o r ∈ O task (5)
iii ⃝ Synonymous Object Substitution.We replace scene objects o k in the scene information x s with commonly used synonyms o ′ k , creating a modified scene that remains semantically equivalent but uses different object names.We again prompt GPT-4o (see Appendix Figure 5), which generates familiar synonym replacements for scene objects while ensuring no subwords or fragments of the original object name are included in the synonym.A hallucination is detected if the model's output reverts to using the original object name o k instead of the synonym o ′ k .For example, as shown in Figure 2, replacing washing machine with washer and soap with detergent may cause the model to hallucinate the term washing machine even though no exact match exists in the scene.The resulting prompt is formulated as shown in Equation 6.
(x td , x ′ s ), where x ′ s = {o ′ k : o ′ k ∼ o k } (6)
iv ⃝ Scene Task Contradiction.We introduce contradictions between the task and the scene by ensuring that all objects required to complete the task are entirely absent from the scene information x s .This tests whether the model can recognize the infeasibility between the task description and the available environment.We generate these contradiction cases by replacing all original scene objects with objects from an unrelated scene, while leaving the task description unchanged to simulate challenging grounding conditions.A hallucination is detected if the model's output references any of the missing scene objects.For example, as shown in Figure 2, asking the robot to "put soap into the washing machine" when only table and plate are present in the scene creates an intentional conflict between the task and the environment.The modified prompt is defined in Equation 7.
(x td , x ′ s ), where x ′ s = x s \ O task (7)
Ground-Truth Preservation.We also aim to understand how hallucinations may affect the success of tasks.Thus, we induce hallucinations within the existing benchmark while ensuring that evaluation remains aligned with the original LTL plans.Specifically, our modified prompts fall into two categories: (i) those maintaining the validity of the original plans-as DistInj and SynonymSubbecause distractors or synonyms should not change the ultimate goal, and (ii) those creating situations where the correct response is to generate no plansuch as TaskObjRem and SceneTaskCon-because required objects are missing.This design allows us to reuse the original ground truth for direct comparison and maintain consistent evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Experimental Setup</p>
<p>Datasets.We evaluate long-horizon tasks that require multiple sequential steps across two simulation environments: VirtualHome (Puig et al., 2018) and BEHAVIOR (Li et al., 2023a).Table 13 in the Appendix shows the prompt distribution in our probing set, which contains 2,574 samples designed to demonstrate task-scene inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Models.</p>
<p>We evaluate 12 open and closed LLMs, including models from LLaMA (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Qwen (Yang et al., 2024a), Gemma (Team et al., 2024), Gemini (Team et al., 2023), Claude (Anthropic, 2024), Mistral (AI, 2024), GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), as well as DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) distilled versions of LLaMA and Qwen.To assess the role of vision, we evaluate VLMs with the same language backbones, including Qwen-VL (Wang et al., 2024a), Gemma-3 (Team et al., 2025), and LLaMA-Vision.Smaller models are more suitable for running locally in robots, while large models represent the state-ofthe-art.All experiments are performed with three independent runs per setting, and results reflect the mean performance.See Table 14 for model cards.</p>
<p>Metrics.We adopt two widely used metrics originally proposed for image captioning: CHAIR (Caption Hallucination Assessment with Image Relevance) (Rohrbach et al., 2018) and POPE (Pollingbased Object Probing Evaluation) (Li et al., 2023b).Although used for visual grounding, both generalize naturally to text generation.CHAIR, defined in Equation 8, quantifies the proportion of hallucinated items relative to all mentioned ones.</p>
<p>C t = |{hallucinated t}| |{all t mentioned}| , t ∈ {states, objects} (8)   While CHAIR gives a holistic estimate, it can be biased by output length.For instance, if two outputs hallucinate the same number of entities but differ in length, CHAIR may unfairly penalize the shorter one.Therefore, we also report POPE, which frames hallucination detection as binary classification.</p>
<p>P o = |{non-existent objects mentioned}| |{questions about non-existent objects}| (9)</p>
<p>Here, we measure whether non-existent objects appear in generated text by posing yes/no questions (e.g., "Is a washing machine mentioned?").Since we inject controlled hallucinations, we create a set of binary questions on those non-existent objects.</p>
<p>POPE, formalized in Equation 9, computes the proportion of these questions that incorrectly receive a "yes" response.However, for object states and base prompts, we do not have a predefined list of non-existent elements.Therefore, we report POPE for objects and omit it for states and base prompts.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>We summarize hallucination trends observed in Table 1 here and then discuss them in Section 5. Models and Environments.Overall, hallucination rates are lower in BEHAVIOR compared to Virtu-alHome.Among all models, Claude and Gemini are most resistant to hallucination, while smaller models hallucinate more frequently.Scene-task Inconsistency Types.Among the four settings, the SceneTaskCon yields the highest hallucination, indicating that models generate plans even in irrelevant scenarios where the ideal response would be to abstain from planning (Zhang  2).</p>
<p>Mitigation.</p>
<p>We implement post-hoc selfcorrection (Madaan et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2024b) as mitigation by prompting models to revise initial responses after receiving feedback.We explore two approaches: (i) Knowledge-Augmented Feedback (KAF) (Peng et al., 2023), which provides general guidance, and (ii) Self-Correcting Woodpecker (SCW) (Yin et al., 2024), which offers explicit feedback by naming hallucinated objects.As shown in Table 3, SCW outperforms KAF by providing more actionable feedback.However, hallucination rates in the SceneTaskCon setting remain high, highlighting the need for stronger mitigation strategies (Tian et al., 2023;Elaraby et al., 2023).Further details and prompt formats are provided in Appendix C.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Understanding Hallucination</p>
<p>We identify three key contributing factors under which hallucinations emerge: task complexity, hallucination variants, and model capability.Task Complexity.Tasks in VirtualHome are significantly more complex than those in BEHAV-IOR, often requiring abstract scene understandingfactors that contribute to overall higher hallucination in VirtualHome (see Table 1).As shown in Appendix Figure 3, BEHAVIOR task descriptions tend to be low-level and closely aligned with symbolic LTL goals, typically involving direct pickand-place actions (e.g., placing a modem under a table).In contrast, VirtualHome task descriptionssuch as writing an email-require understanding of the scene, involving turning on a computer, holding the keyboard, and so on.These gaps between the task description and observable scene lead the model to infer and "fill in" missing steps or objects.Although this reflects a form of reasoning, it often leads to hallucinations, highlighting that LLMs still struggle to reliably execute long-horizon tasks.Hallucination Variants.As shown in Table 4, hallucinations arise from the model's attempt to complete the task despite missing inputs.Models do not simply copy the task description; instead, there is evidence of underlying reasoning and an attempt to resolve inconsistencies, often by filling in gaps based on learned patterns.In the SynonymSub, we observe that models recognize that substituted objects conceptually belong to the same category (e.g., "pail" and "bucket" are the same), yet they fail to maintain naming consistency in the output.This inconsistency may stem from language modeling biases: in conversational settings, synonym variation is preferred for fluency, but in task-oriented planning-especially grounded in a specific sceneconsistent naming is critical for accurate symbolic goal generation.In particular, these patterns suggest that while LLMs exhibit signs of reasoning, they lack the control mechanisms necessary to balance user instructions with the observed scene.Model Capability.Smaller models hallucinate more than larger ones-suggesting that increased Table 4: Qualitative examples of hallucinations.Under DistInj, models exhibit pattern-matching behavior by assigning plausible IDs to hallucinated objects (e.g., "printer.n.01_1").In the TaskObjRem setting, models generate multiple hallucinated instances when the task description includes plural forms (e.g., "books").For SynonymSub, models partially adapt to synonym replacements (e.g., "pail" vs. "bucket") but fail to maintain consistency throughout the output.In SceneTaskCon, models produce plans involving non-existent objects, reflecting a failure to suppress planning in incompatible environments.These examples suggest that models are not blindly following the prompt-there is evidence of reasoning-but they lack the capability to reject the task when it is infeasible.Given the goal "Pick up phone," the phone is not in the provided object list.Therefore, this goal cannot be translated to a symbolic goal."'json{"node goals": [],"edge goals": [],}"' scale causes reduced hallucination.As shown in Table 5, Gemini-2.0Flash is the only model among our studied ones to reject generation when required objects are missing; others generate empty plans.</p>
<p>Seeing the stronger performance of larger models, we evaluate their behavior in non-hallucinated cases (see Appendix A).We find that plan quality remains stable under DistInj and SynonymSub.However, under TaskObjRem and SceneTaskCon, these models are less likely to generate empty plans-highlighting that even larger models struggle in handling task infeasibility.We discuss the There is no cat in the environment, so this goal cannot be fulfilled.I will set the goal to pick up clothes and hold it.'node goals': [{'name': 'clothes_pants', 'state': 'GRABBED'] Wax the dust off the vehicle.bed.n.01_1, door.n.01_1 ..."not",["Dusty", "bed.n.01_1"]],</p>
<p>["not", ["Dusty","door.n.01_1"] challenge of grounding reasoning in Appendix B.</p>
<p>Beyond Hallucinations: Planning Failures</p>
<p>While hallucination is a failure mode, we observe that its absence does not guarantee correct planning.Even when models do not hallucinate, they often generate syntactically valid but incorrect LTL goals (see Table 6).These models attempt to fulfill the task by re-purposing available scene objects inappropriately.It highlights a deeper issue that the models still struggle to recognize when not to generate plans.See Appendix E on reliable planning.</p>
<p>In this paper, we systematically identify hallucination cases in LLM-based embodied agents, offering insights into where and how current models fall short when executing long-horizon tasks under scene-task inconsistencies.The significantly elevated hallucination rates observed with our modified prompts highlight that existing models struggle to reconcile mismatches between user instructions and the environment.We further find that hallucinations persist despite feedback-based mitigation and are only partially reduced with cross-modal inputs.By introducing challenging scenarios along with guidance on ideal model behavior, our work takes an important first step toward enabling more grounded planning in real-world embodied agents.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>While our empirical study reveals significant occurrences of hallucinations in LLM-based embodied agents under scene-task inconsistencies, it has some limitations.First, although our prompt modifications introduce diverse and challenging failure cases, they do not exhaustively cover the full space of hallucination types in embodied agents.Our focus is primarily on object-level hallucinations, but other forms-such as hallucinations related to counts, attributes, or spatial relations-remain unexplored.Second, our analysis is limited to symbolic outputs (in the form of Linear Temporal Logic plans) and does not evaluate downstream execution errors that may arise during physical task performance in real-world environments.Third, our cross-modal verification experiments are conducted at a small scale and limited to the Distractor Injection.Extending such experiments to other modified prompts would require changing the underlying simulation environments to attain the scene information as images, which we leave for future work.Fourth, we do not evaluate all the available models, so our sampling may not be representative enough for the broader landscape of LLM capabilities.Lastly, we explore only post-hoc, selfcorrection-based mitigation strategies.Other mitigation approaches-such as alternative decoding methods, supervised fine-tuning, or architecturelevel modifications-may yield deeper insights and are left for future exploration.</p>
<p>A Goal Interpretation Correctness in Non-Hallucinated Cases</p>
<p>We evaluate model performance in nonhallucinated cases.For DistInj and SynonymSub, the ideal output is the original LTL goal.Using the original benchmark's evaluation script, we report performance in Table 7, showing that larger models maintain performance in these settings.For TaskObjRem and SceneTaskCon, the ideal response is to reject the task or generate an empty plan.We report refusal/empty response rates in Table 8, revealing that models still struggle to recognize and appropriately handle task infeasibility.</p>
<p>B Reasoning Models</p>
<p>While reasoning-capable models are expected to be less prone to hallucination, our results (Table 1) show mixed performance for smaller modelssometimes outperforming the non-reasoning version of model, and sometimes underperforming.</p>
<p>To better understand this behavior, we examine the reasoning traces (i.e., "thinking" blocks) of smaller models such as DeepSeek-R1 distilled versions of LLaMA and Qwen.As shown in Table 9, we find that these models often attempt to fill in missing information by assuming the existence of objects not present in the scene.For example, when instructed to interact with an object like a "washing machine" or "TV" that is not listed in the scene, they rationalize its presence based on task relevance and proceed to generate symbolic goals involving it.While such reasoning demonstrates an ability to infer implicit dependencies, it ultimately leads to incorrect grounding.Enabling reliable reasoning for grounded planning-especially in small models-remains an open problem.</p>
<p>C Mitigation Details</p>
<p>Knowledge-Augmented Feedback (KAF) In KAF (Peng et al., 2023), we provide general feedback by appending the prior response and instructing the model with: "Your previous response is inconsistent with the scene information.Please refine your answer to the prior request based on your examination."Self-Correcting Woodpecker (SCW).In SCW (Yin et al., 2024), we provide targeted feedback by listing hallucinated objects explicitly: "The scene does not contain {objects}.Please refine your answer to the prior request based on your examination."This approach makes the feedback more specific and actionable, leading to greater hallucination reduction.</p>
<p>D Cross Modal Experiment Details</p>
<p>We conduct a small-scale analysis of cross-modal hallucination behavior using the distractor injection setting in VirtualHome.In this setting, only the task description is modified, while the scene remains unchanged.Therefore, we are able to directly use the original simulator-provided scene images for evaluation.Extending cross-modal analysis to other variants in our hallucination probing set would require modifying the visual scenes within the simulator-an effort we leave for future work.</p>
<p>E Toward Reliable Planning</p>
<p>We also provide guidance on what should or should not be done for reliable planning in each scenario of our hallucination probing set.In embodied settings, hallucinating an object that is not present in the scene can cause the agent to search for or interact with nonexistent entities-leading to navigation errors, execution failures, or unsafe behaviors.With our setup, model behavior should ideally fall into one of two expected response patterns: (i) when the task is feasible and the required objects are present (as in DistInj and SynonymSub), the model should generate a plan that aligns with the original groundtruth LTL goal; (ii) when key objects are missing or the task is semantically incompatible with the scene (as in TaskObjRem and SceneTaskCon), the model</p>
<p>F Other Forms of Hallucinations F.1 State Hallucinations</p>
<p>In addition to object-level hallucinations, we observe cases where models generate invalid or unsupported object states in an attempt to satisfy task instructions.These occur when the predicted state does not belong to the predefined set of possible states for the given object.As shown in Table 10, models sometimes fabricate states-such as "AR-RANGED" or "INSIDE"-that are not included in the allowed state space.</p>
<p>F.2 Relation Hallucinations</p>
<p>Following our definition in subsection 3.1, relation hallucination occurs when the predicted relations fall outside the allowable set.As shown in Table 11, smaller models exhibit higher rates of relation hallucination, consistent with trends observed for object and state hallucinations in the main paper.We highlight that the relation hallucinations observed here primarily arise as a secondary effect of the object-level inconsistencies introduced in our study.Systematically designing scenarios to explicitly induce attribute-or spatial-level hallucinations remains a valuable but distinct direction, which we leave for future work.</p>
<p>G Hallucinations on Core vs. Peripheral Object Removal</p>
<p>We qualitatively observe that hallucinations are more frequent when core objects are removed.Table 12 presents case-by-case examples where we remove one object at a time and report the corresponding hallucination rates.The results show that removing essential objects, such as the pot while cooking, the dishwasher while washing dishes, or the washing machine while doing laundry, leads to high hallucination rates, while removing peripheral objects has little to no effect.</p>
<p>H Hallucination Probing Prompts Design and Distribution</p>
<p>H.1 Base Prompt Format and Structure</p>
<p>The base prompts from VirtualHome are more complex, often requiring multi-step reasoning about scene objects and their interactions.In contrast, BEHAVIOR prompts closely resemble their corresponding LTL goals, leaving less room for ambiguity and reducing the model's need to infer or fill in missing information.</p>

Figure2: Overview of our settings.(A) The base pipeline in the existing benchmark(Li et al., 2024b) begins with a scene parser that extracts structured textual scene information from raw visual input.Combined with the natural language task description, this is processed by an LLM to generate symbolic goals in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) (see subsection 3.1).(B) Examples of hallucinations.Output elements highlighted in red indicate hallucinated content that is not grounded in the scene information, i.e., inconsistent with the observed environment.These examples demonstrate that when inconsistencies arise between the scene information and the given task description, the LLM fails to reconcile the two and generates incorrect plans or object references.Given the base prompt, we systematically modify two core input components-the task description and scene information-to elicit hallucinations.Our four controlled modifications of the base prompts are: under task description variation, (i) Distractor Injection-adds non-existent objects to the task description; and under scene variation, (ii) Task Relevant Object Removal-omits key objects from the scene; (iii) Synonymous Object Substitution-replaces scene objects with synonyms; and (iv) Scene Task Contradiction-introduces conflicts between the task and scene.</p>
<p>A hallucination occurs if any mentioned object or state is not supported by the input scene representation x s -specifically, as formalized in Equation 3, if any mentioned object does not exist in the scene (o k / ∈ O) or the predicted state is not from the allowed states (s g k</p>
<p>, i.e., outputs that reflect objects or states inconsistent with the given scene.Let F obj (y) and F state (y) denote the sets of objects and states mentioned in the model's output y.</p>

Goal interpretation performance (Precision, Recall, F1) for non-hallucinated outputs under base prompts and our hallucination probing prompts in VirtualHome.It reports the correctness of symbolic goal generation (LTL) when no hallucination is detected, across two transformation types: Distractor Injection and Synonymous Object Substitution.Performance remains largely consistent between base and modified prompts, indicating that while our transformation introduces new failure modes, it does not significantly degrade goal interpretation quality when hallucination is avoided.
