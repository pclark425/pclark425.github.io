                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers. In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research. To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain. Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication. Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation. Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation. Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research. Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research. Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zkzhou126/AI-for-Research.</p>

            "validation_sufficiency": "Survey emphasizes that in chemistry/materials domains, wet-lab experimental validation (physical synthesis and characterization) is the domain norm and is required to claim real discoveries; computational validation alone is generally insufficient.",
            "validation_accuracy": null,
            "experimental_validation_performed": true,
            "experimental_validation_details": "Survey cites work demonstrating automated execution of experiments and closed-loop discovery pipelines (examples include autonomous synthesis and accelerated materials synthesis); details vary by cited study and typically include automated reaction execution and measurement (e.g., characterization yields, structural/functional assay), but the survey does not give per-study protocols or numerical outcome aggregates.",
            "validation_comparison": "Survey notes comparisons are often between autonomous pipelines and human baselines or between simulation-only workflows and hybrid (simulation + lab) workflows; hybrid approaches that included physical experiments are presented as necessary to validate true discovery, but the survey does not provide unified numeric comparisons.",
            "validation_failures": "Survey warns of failures due to lack of methodological rigor, practical feasibility mismatches, misalignment between automated experimental designs and realistic lab constraints, and reproducibility issues when automation or protocols are insufficiently robust.",
            "validation_success_cases": "Cited works (e.g., autonomous chemical/materials labs) report successful accelerated synthesis/discovery outcomes when automated execution and measurement pipelines are well integrated and human oversight addresses safety/feasibility constraints.",
            "ground_truth_comparison": "Physical measurements and characterization serve as ground truth (e.g., yields, structure characterization), and success is measured by agreement between predicted and observed properties, novelty vs known compounds, and demonstration of functional performance.",
            "reproducibility_replication": "Survey highlights reproducibility challenges — successful replication requires detailed protocols, robust automation, and shared datasets/instrumentation; lack of standardized benchmarks for autonomous experimentation impedes cross-study replication.",

<p>From Hypothesis to Publication: A Comprehensive Survey of AI-Driven Research Support Systems
23 Jul 2025849F4D481CD613154990E0D345D8280FarXiv:2503.01424v2[cs.AI]Maximilian Idahl and Zahra Ahmadi. 2024. Openreviewer: A specialized large language model for generating critical scientific paper reviews. CoRR, abs/2412.11948.Research Paper Recommendation Systematic Literature Survey
Research is a fundamental process driving the advancement of human civilization, yet it demands substantial time and effort from researchers.In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has inspired researchers to explore how AI can accelerate and enhance research.To monitor relevant advancements, this paper presents a systematic review of the progress in this domain.Specifically, we organize the relevant studies into three main categories: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication.Hypothesis formulation involves knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation.Hypothesis validation includes the verification of scientific claims, theorem proving, and experiment validation.Manuscript publication encompasses manuscript writing and the peer review process.Furthermore, we identify and discuss the current challenges faced in these areas, as well as potential future directions for research.Finally, we also offer a comprehensive overview of existing benchmarks and tools across various domains that support the integration of AI into the research process.We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Research is creative and systematic work aimed at expanding knowledge and driving civilization's development (Eurostat, 2018).Researchers typically identify a topic, review relevant literature, synthesize existing knowledge, and formulate hypothesis, which are validated through theoretical and experimental methods.Findings are then documented in manuscripts that undergo peer review before publication (Benos et al., 2007;Boyko et al., 2023).However, this process is resource-intensive, requir-ing specialized expertise and posing entry barriers for researchers (Blaxter et al., 2010).</p>
<p>In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, represented by large language models (LLMs), have experienced rapid development (Brown et al., 2020;OpenAI, 2023;Dubey et al., 2024;Yang et al., 2024a;DeepSeek-AI et al., 2024;Guo et al., 2025).These models exhibit exceptional capabilities in text understanding, reasoning, and generation (Schaeffer et al., 2023).In this context, AI is increasingly involving the entire research pipeline (Messeri and Crockett, 2024), sparking extensive discussion about its implications for research (Hutson, 2022;Williams et al., 2023;Morris, 2023;Fecher et al., 2023).Moreover, following the release of ChatGPT, approximately 20% of academic papers and peer-reviewed texts in certain fields have been modified by LLMs (Liang et al., 2024a,b).A study also reveals that 81% of researchers integrate LLMs into their workflows (Liao et al., 2024).</p>
<p>As the application of AI in research attracts increasing attention, a significant body of related studies has begun to emerge.To systematically synthesize existing research, we present comprehensive survey that emulates human researchers by using the research process as an organizing framework.Specifically, as depicted in Figure 1, the research process is divided into three key stages:</p>
<p>(1) Hypothesis Formulation, involving knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation; (2) Hypothesis Validation, encompassing scientific claim verification, theorem proving, and experiment validation; (3) Manuscript Publication, which focuses on academic publications and is further divided into manuscript writing and peer review.</p>
<p>Comparing with Existing Surveys Although Luo et al. (2025) reviews the application of AI in research, it predominantly focuses on LLMs, while neglecting the knowledge synthesis that precedes hypothesis generation and the Figure 1: Overview of AI for research.The framework consists of three stages: hypothesis formulation, hypothesis validation, and manuscript publication.In the hypothesis formulation stage, knowledge integration leads to the proposal of an initial hypothesis after a topic is identified.The hypothesis validation stage involves verifying the hypothesis from three perspectives to ensure its correctness and validity.Finally, the manuscript publication stage focuses on drafting and publishing the validated hypothesis.theoretical validation of hypothesis.Other surveys concentrate on more specific areas, such as paper recommendation (Beel et al., 2016;Bai et al., 2019;Kreutz and Schenkel, 2022), scientific literature review (Altmami and Menai, 2022), hypothesis generation (Kulkarni et al., 2025), scientific claim verification (Vladika and Matthes, 2023;Dmonte et al., 2024), theorem proving (Li et al., 2024e), manuscript writing (Li and Ouyang, 2024), and peer review (Lin et al., 2023a;Kousha and Thelwall, 2024).Additionally, certain surveys emphasize the application of AI in scientific domains (Zheng et al., 2023b;Zhang et al., 2024d;Gridach et al., 2025).</p>
<p>Contributions Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We align the relevant fields with the research process of human researchers, systematically integrating and extending these aspects while primarily focusing on the research process itself.(2) We introduce a meticulous taxonomy (shown in Figure 2).(3) We provide a summary of tools that can assist in the research process.(4) We discuss new frontiers, outline their challenges, and shed light on future research.</p>
<p>Survey Organization We first elaborate hypothesis formulation ( §2), followed by hypothesis validation ( §3) and manuscript publication ( §4).Additionally, we present benchmarks ( §5), and tools ( §6) that utilized in research.Finally, we outline challenges as well as future directions ( §7).In the Appendix, we provide further discussion on open questions ( §A), challenges faced in different domains ( §B), discusssion about relevant ethical considerations ( §C), and a comparison of capabilities among different methods ( §D).</p>
<p>Hypothesis Formulation</p>
<p>This stage centers on the process of hypothesis formulation.As illustrated in Figure 3, it commences with developing a comprehensive understanding of the domain, followed by identifying a specific aspect and generating pertinent hypothesis.This section is further structured into two key components: Knowledge Synthesis and Hypothesis Generation.</p>
<p>Knowledge Synthesis</p>
<p>Knowledge synthesis constitutes the foundational step in the research process.During this phase, researchers are required to identify and critically evaluate existing literature to establish a thorough understanding of the field.This step is pivotal for uncovering new research directions, refining methodologies, and supporting evidence-based decisionmaking (Asai et al., 2024).In this section, the process of knowledge synthesis is divided into two modules: Research Paper Recommendation and Systematic Literature Review.</p>
<p>Research Paper Recommendation</p>
<p>Research paper recommendation (RPR) identifies and recommends novel and seminal articles aligned with researchers' interests.Prior studies have shown that recommendation systems outperform keyword-based search engines in terms of efficiency and reliability when extracting valuable insights from large-scale datasets (Bai et al., 2019).Existing methodologies are broadly categorized into four paradigms: content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, graph-based approaches, and hybrid systems (Beel et al., 2016;Li and Zou, 2019;Bai et al., 2019;Shahid et al., 2020).Recent advancements propose multi-dimensional classification frameworks based on data source utilization (Kreutz and Schenkel, 2022).</p>
<p>Recent trends in research suggest a decline in publication volumes related to RPR (Sharma et al., 2023), alongside an increasing focus on usercentric optimizations.Existing studies emphasize the limitations of traditional paper-centric interaction models and advocate for more effective utilization of author relationship graphs (Kang et al., 2023).Multi-stage recommendation architectures Systematic Literature Review ( §2.1.2)E.g., AutoSurvey (Wang et al., 2024e) , OpenScholar (Asai et al., 2024) Hypotheses Generation ( §2.2) E.g., SciMON (Wang et al., 2024c) , MOOSE (Yang et al., 2024b) , Dolphin (Yuan et al., 2025) Hypothesis Validation ( §3)</p>
<p>Scientific</p>
<p>Claim Verification ( §3.1) E.g., FactKG (Kim et al., 2023) , SFAVEL (Bazaga et al., 2024) , ClaimVer (Dammu et al., 2024) Theorem Proving ( §3.2) E.g., Dt-solver (Wang et al., 2023b) , LEGO-Prover (Wang et al., 2024b) , DeepSeek-Prover (Xin et al., 2024) Experiment Validation ( §3.3) E.g., SANDBOX (Liu et al., 2023b) , CRISPR-GPT (Huang et al., 2024a) , MLR-Copilot (Li et al., 2024d) Manuscript Publication ( §4)</p>
<p>Manuscript Writing ( §4.1) E.g., Scilit (Gu and Hahnloser, 2023) , UR3WG (Shi et al., 2023) , STEP-BACK (Tang et al., 2024a) Peer Review ( §4.2) E.g., SWIF2T (Chamoun et al., 2024) , GLIMPSE (Darrin et al., 2024) , MetaWriter (Sun et al., 2024) Figure 2: Taxonomy of Hypothesis Formulation, Hypothesis Validation and Manuscript Publication (This is a simplified version, full version in Figure 6).</p>
<p>that integrate diverse methodologies have been shown to achieve superior performance (Pinedo et al., 2024;Stergiopoulos et al., 2024).Visualization techniques that link recommended papers to users' publication histories via knowledge graphs (Kang et al., 2022) and LLMs-powered comparative analysis frameworks (Lee et al., 2024) represent emerging directions for enhancing interpretability and contextual relevance.</p>
<p>Systematic Literature Review</p>
<p>Systematic literature review (SLR) constitutes a rigorous and structured methodology for evaluating and integrating prior research on a specific topic (Webster and Watson, 2002;Zhu et al., 2023;Bolaños et al., 2024).In contrast to single-document summaries (Elhadad et al., 2005), SLR entails synthesizing information across multiple related scientific documents (Altmami and Menai, 2022).SLR can further be divided into two stages: outline generation and full-text generation (Shao et al., 2024;Agarwal et al., 2024b;Block and Kuckertz, 2024).</p>
<p>Outline generation, especially structured outline generation, is highlighted by recent studies as a pivotal factor in enhancing the quality of surveys.Zhu et al. (2023) demonstrated that hierarchical frameworks substantially enhance survey coherence.AutoSurvey (Wang et al., 2024e) extended conventional outline generation by recommending both sub-chapter titles and detailed content descriptions, ensuring comprehensive topic coverage.Additionally, multi-level topic generation via clustering methodologies has been proposed as an effective strategy for organizing survey structures (Katz et al., 2024).Advanced systems such as STORM (Shao et al., 2024) employed LLMdriven outline drafting combined with multi-agent discussion cycles to iteratively refine the generated outlines.Tree-based hierarchical architectures have gained increasing adoption in this domain.For instance, CHIME (Hsu et al., 2024) optimized LLM-generated hierarchies through human-AI collaboration, while HiReview (Hu et al., 2024b) demonstrated the efficacy of multi-layer tree representations for systematic knowledge organization.</p>
<p>Full-text generation follows the outline generation stage.AutoSurvey and Lai et al. (2024) utilized LLMs with carefully designed prompts to construct comprehensive literature reviews step-bystep.PaperQA2 (Skarlinski et al., 2024) introduced an iterative agent-based approach for generating reviews, while STORM employed multiagent conversation data for this purpose.LitLLM (Agarwal et al., 2024a) and Agarwal et al. (2024b) adopted a plan-based search enhancement strategy.KGSum (Wang et al., 2022a) integrated knowledge graph information into paper encoding and used a two-stage decoder for summary generation.Bio-SIEVE (Robinson et al., 2023) and Susnjak et al. (2024) fine-tuned LLMs for automatic review generation.OpenScholar (Asai et al., 2024) developed a pipeline that trained a new model without relying on a dedicated survey-generation model.</p>
<p>Hypothesis Generation</p>
<p>Hypothesis generation, known as idea generation, refers to the process of coming up with new concepts, solutions, or approaches.It is the most important step in driving the progress of the entire research (Qi et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Early work focused more on predicting relationships between concepts, because researchers believed that new concepts come from links with old concepts (Henry and McInnes, 2017;Krenn et al., 2022).As language models became more powerful (Zhao et al., 2023a), researchers are beginning to focus on open-ended idea generation (Girotra et al., 2023;Si et al., 2024;Kumar et al., 2024).Recent advancements in AI-driven hypothesis generation highlight diverse approaches to research conceptualization.For instance, MOOSE-Chem (Yang et al., 2024c) and IdeaSynth (Pu et al., 2024) used LLMs to bridge inspiration-tohypothesis transformation via interactive frameworks.The remaining research primarily falls into two areas: enhancing input data quality and improving the quality of generated hypothesis.</p>
<p>Input data quality improvement is demonstrated by Majumder et al. (2024a); Liu et al. (2024a), who showed that LLMs can generate comprehensive hypothesis from existing academic data.Literature organization strategies have evolved through various methodologies, including triplet representations (Wang et al., 2024c), chain-based architectures (Li et al., 2024a), and complex database systems (Wang et al., 2024d).Knowledge graphs emerge as critical infrastructure (Hogan et al., 2021), enabling semantic relationship mapping via subgraph identification (Buehler, 2024;Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024).Notably, SciMuse (Gu and Krenn, 2024) pioneered researcher-specific hypothesis generation by constructing personalized knowledge graphs.</p>
<p>Hypothesis quality improvement has been addressed through feedback and iteration (Rabby et al., 2025), as proposed by HypoGeniC (Zhou et al., 2024) and MOOSE (Yang et al., 2024b).Feedback mechanisms include direct responses to hypothesis (Baek et al., 2024), experimental outcome evaluations (Ma et al., 2024;Yuan et al., 2025), comparison with the existing literature (Schmidgall and Moor, 2025), and automated peer review comments (Lu et al., 2024).Fun-Search (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024) generates solutions by iteratively combining the innovative capabilities of LLM with the verification capabilities of an evaluator.Beyond iterative feedback, collaborative efforts among researchers have also been recognized, leading to multi-agent hypothesis generation approaches (Nigam et al., 2024;Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024).VIRSCI (Su et al., 2024) further optimized this process by customizing knowledge for each agent.Additionally, the Nova framework (Hu et al., 2024a) was introduced to refine hypothesis by leveraging outputs from other research as input.</p>
<p>Knowledge synthesis and hypothesis generation comprise the hypothesis formulation phase.Research paper recommendation supports knowledge acquisition, while systematic literature review aids organization within knowledge synthesis.Recent advances integrate LLMs (de la Torre-López et al., 2023) to enhance knowledge integration (Huang and Tan, 2023;Gupta et al., 2023;Kacena et al., 2024;Tang et al., 2024b).By developing a deep understanding of a domain through knowledge synthesis, researchers can identify research directions and use hypothesis generation techniques to formulate hypothesis.Additionally, the distinction between scientific discovery and hypothesis generation is discussed in §A.</p>
<p>Hypothesis Validation</p>
<p>In scientific research, any proposed hypothesis must undergo rigorous validation to establish its validity.In some studies, this process is also referred to as 'falsification' (Liu et al., 2024d;Huang et al., 2025).As illustrated in Figure 4, this section explores the application of AI in verifying scientific hypothesis through three methodological components: Scientific Claim Verification, Theorem Proving, and Experiment Validation.</p>
<p>Scientific Claim Verification</p>
<p>Scientific claim verification, also referred to as scientific fact-checking or scientific contradiction detection, aims to assess the veracity of claims related to scientific knowledge.This process assists scientists in verifying research hypothesis, discovering evidence, and advancing scientific work (Wadden et al., 2020;Vladika and Matthes, 2023;Skarlinski et al., 2024).Research on scientific claim verification primarily focuses on three key elements: the claim, the evidence, and the validity of the claim (Dmonte et al., 2024).Claim Studies have highlighted that certain claims lack supporting evidence (Wührl et al., 2024a), while others have demonstrated the ability to perform claim-evidence alignment without annotated data (Bazaga et al., 2024).Additionally, methods such as HiSS (Zhang and Gao, 2023) and ProToCo (Zeng and Gao, 2023) proposed generating multiple claim variants to enhance verification.</p>
<p>Evidence Existing research has explored various aspects related to evidence, including evidentiary sources (Vladika and Matthes, 2024a), retrieval configurations (Vladika and Matthes, 2024b), strategies for identifying and mitigating flawed evidence (Glockner et al., 2022;Wührl et al., 2024b;Glockner et al., 2024a), and approaches for processing sentence-level (Pan et al., 2023b) versus document-level indicators (Wadden et al., 2022b).</p>
<p>Verification In the verification results generation phase, MAGIC (Kao and Yen, 2024) and SERIf (Cao et al., 2024b) proposed utilizing LLMs to synthesize evidence into more comprehensive information.FactKG (Kim et al., 2023) and Muharram and Purwarianti (2024) structured evidence into knowledge graphs, enabling claim attribution (Dammu et al., 2024;Wu et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Theorem Proving</p>
<p>Theorem proving constitutes a subtask of logical reasoning, aimed at reinforcing the validity of the underlying theory within a hypothesis (Pease et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2023c;Li et al., 2024e).</p>
<p>Following the proposal of GPT-f (Polu and Sutskever, 2020) to utilize generative language models for theorem proving, researchers initially combined search algorithms with language models (Lample et al., 2022;Wang et al., 2023b).However, a limitation in search-based approaches was later identified by Wang et al. (2024a), who highlighted their tendency to explore insignificant intermediate conjectures.This led some teams to abandon search algorithms entirely.Subsequently, alternative methods emerged, such as the two-stage framework proposed by Jiang et al. (2023) and Lin et al. (2024), which prioritized informal conceptual generation before formal proof construction.Thor (Jiang et al., 2022a) introduced theorem libraries to accelerate proof generation, an approach enhanced by Logo-power (Wang et al., 2024b) through dynamic libraries.Studies like Baldur (First et al., 2023), Mustard (Huang et al., 2024c), and DeepSeek-Prover (Xin et al., 2024) demonstrated improvements via targeted data synthesis and fine-tuning, though COPRA (Thakur et al., 2024) questioned their generalizability and proposed an environment-agnostic alternative.Complementary strategies included theoretical decomposition into sub-goals (Zhao et al., 2023b) and leveraging LLMs as collaborative assistants in interactive environments (Song et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Experiment Validation</p>
<p>Experiment validation involves designing and conducting experiments based on the hypothesis.The empirical validity of the hypothesis is then determined through analysis of the experimental results (Huang et al., 2024b).</p>
<p>Experiment validation represents a timeconsuming component of scientific research.Recent advancements in LLMs have enhanced their ability to plan and reason about experimental tasks (Kambhampati et al., 2024), prompting researchers to use these models for designing and implementing experiments (Ruan et al., 2024b).2024) leveraged agent-generated analytical insights to facilitate iterative hypothesis refinement.In contrast, social science research often uses LLMs as experimental subjects to simulate human participants (Liu et al., 2023b;Manning et al., 2024;Mou et al., 2024).</p>
<p>A hypothesis can be conceptualized as consisting of two key components: claims and theorems.Scientific claim verification and theorem proving offer theoretical validation of hypothesis through formal reasoning and logical deduction, whereas experiment validation provides comprehensive practical validation via empirical testing.</p>
<p>Manuscript Publication</p>
<p>Upon validating a hypothesis as feasible, researchers generally progress to the publication stage.As depicted in Figure 5, this section categorizes Manuscript Publication into two primary components: Manuscript Writing and Peer Review.</p>
<p>Manuscript Writing</p>
<p>Manuscript writing, also referred to as scientific or research writing.At this stage, researchers articulate the hypothesis they have formulated and the results they have validated in the form of a scholarly paper.This process is crucial, as it not only disseminates findings but also deepens researchers' understanding of their work (Colyar, 2009).</p>
<p>Early shared tasks focused on assisting researchers in writing or analyzing linguistic features (Dale and Kilgarriff, 2010;Daudaravicius, 2015).Recent advances have led to three main directions: citation text generation, related work generation, and complete manuscript generation.</p>
<p>Related Work Generation (Paragraph Level)</p>
<p>In contrast to citation text generation, several studies have focused on related work generation in scholarly writing, emphasizing the production of multiple citation texts and the systematic analysis of inter-citation relationships (Li andOuyang, 2022, 2024).The ScholaCite framework (Martin-Boyle et al., 2024) leveraged GPT-4 to cluster citation sources and generate draft literature review sections, although it required manually provided reference lists.By contrast, the UR3WG system (Shi et al., 2023) adopted a retrieval-augmented architecture integrated with large language models to autonomously acquire relevant references.</p>
<p>To improve the quality of generated related work sections, Yu et al. (2024b)</p>
<p>Peer Review</p>
<p>Peer review serves as a critical mechanism for improving the quality of academic manuscripts through feedback and evaluation, forming the cornerstone of quality control in scientific research.However, the process is hindered by its slow pace, high time consumption, and increasing strain due to the growing academic workload (Lin et al., 2023a;Kousha and Thelwall, 2024;Thelwall and Yaghi, 2024).To address these challenges and enhance manuscript quality, researchers have investigated the application of AI in peer review (Yuan et al., 2022;Liu and Shah, 2023;Niu et al., 2023;Kuznetsov et al., 2024;Thakkar et al., 2025).Peer review can be categorized into two main types: paper review generation and meta-review generation.</p>
<p>Paper Review Generation In paper review generation, reviewers provide both scores and evaluations for manuscripts.For instance, Setio and Tsuchiya (2022) 2024) modeled the review process as a dynamic, multi-turn dialogue.Furthermore, CycleResearcher (Weng et al., 2024) and OpenReviewer (Idahl and Ahmadi, 2024) finetuned models for comparative reviews and structured outputs aligned with conference guidelines.</p>
<p>Meta-Review Generation</p>
<p>In meta-review generation, chairs are tasked with identifying a paper's core contributions, strengths, and weaknesses while synthesizing expert opinions on manuscript quality.Meta-reviews are conceptualized as abstractions of comments, discussions, and paper abstracts (Li et al., 2023).Santu et al. (2024) investigated the use of LLMs for automated meta-review generation, while Zeng et al. (2023) proposed a guided, iterative prompting approach.MetaWriter (Sun et al., 2024) utilized LLMs to extract key reviewer arguments, whereas GLIMPSE (Darrin et al., 2024) and Kumar et al. (2023) focused on reconciling conflicting statements to ensure fairness.Additionally, Li et al. (2024b) introduced a three-layer sentiment consolidation framework for meta-review generation, and PeerArg (Sukpanichnant et al., 2024) integrated LLMs with knowledge representation to address subjectivity and bias via a multiparty argumentation framework (MPAF).DeepReview (Zhu et al., 2025) generates a comprehensive meta-review by simulating expert evaluation across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>During the Manuscript Publication phase, researchers can leverage AI to systematically complete manuscript writing by incorporating validated hypothesis, related papers, and literature reviews.The manuscript is subsequently subjected to peer review, involving iterative revisions before culminating in its final publication.</p>
<p>Given that AI for research spans multiple disciplines, the tasks addressed within each domain vary significantly.To facilitate cross-domain exploration, we provide a summary of benchmarks associated with various areas, including research paper recommendation, systematic literature review, hypothesis generation, scientific claim verification, theorem proving, experiment verification, manuscript writing, and peer review.An overview of these benchmarks is presented in Table 9.</p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>To accelerate the research workflow, we have curated a collection of tools designed to support various stages of the research process, with their applicability specified for each stage.To ensure practical relevance, our selection criteria emphasize tools that are publicly accessible or demonstrate significant influence on GitHub.A comprehensive overview of these tools is presented in Table 10.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
<p>We identify several intriguing and promising avenues for future research.</p>
<p>Integration of Diverse Research Tasks</p>
<p>The research process is an integrated pipeline of interdependent stages.Paper recommendation and literature review provide an AI tool with a field overview and relevant works, ensuring that hypothesis generation is informed and of higher quality.Hypothesis validation assesses feasibility both logically and practically, with results feeding back to refine the hypothesis.In manuscript writing, validated hypotheses and prior outputs serve as key inputs.Peer review evaluates the manuscript and offers feedback across modules, enabling the hypothesis generator to adjust content accordingly (Lu et al., 2024).In addition, combinations can also be made between some small fields, for instance, meta-review generation could be integrated with scientific claim verification, experiment verification could be linked with hypothesis formulation (Jansen et al., 2025;Yuan et al., 2025;Liu et al., 2024d), and research paper recommendation systems could be connected with manuscript writing processes (Gu and Hahnloser, 2023).Furthermore, some studies have begun to emphasize the development of systems capable of covering mul-tiple stages of the research process (Jansen et al., 2024;Weng et al., 2024;Yu et al., 2024a).</p>
<p>Integration with Reasoning-Oriented Language Models</p>
<p>Research is a process that places a significant emphasis on logic and reasoning.Theorem proving serves as a subtask within logical reasoning (Li et al., 2024e), while hypothesis generation is widely recognized as the primary form of reasoning employed by scientists when observing the world and proposing hypothesis to explain these observations (Yang et al., 2024b).Experiment verification, in turn, demands a high degree of planning capability from models (Kambhampati et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Recent advances in reasoning-oriented language models, such as OpenAI-o1 (Jaech et al., 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025), have substantially enhanced the reasoning abilities of these models.Consequently, we posit that integrating reasoning language models with reasoning tasks is a promising future direction.This prediction was validated by experiments conducted by Schmidgall et al. ( 2025) using o1-Preview.Furthermore, in Appendix §B, we provide a summary of the challenges in hypothesis formulation, validation, and manuscript publication.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This paper provides a systematic survey of existing research on AI for research, offering a comprehensive review of the advancements in the field.Within each category, we offer detailed descriptions of the associated subfields.In addition, we examine current challenges, ethical considerations, and potential directions for future research.To support researchers in exploring AI-driven research applications and enhancing workflow efficiency, we also summarize existing benchmarks and tools, accompanied by a comparative analysis of representative methods and their capabilities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the course of investigating various subfields within AI for research, we observed that this domain remains in its infancy.Research in numerous directions remains at an experimental stage, and substantial progress is necessary before these approaches can be effectively applied in practical scenarios.We hope that this survey serves as an introduction to the field for researchers and contributes to its continued advancement.</p>
<p>Limitation</p>
<p>This study presents a comprehensive survey of AI for research, based on the framework of the research process conducted by human researchers.</p>
<p>We have made our best effort, but there may still be some limitations.Due to space constraints, we provide only concise summaries of each method without detailed technical elaboration.Given the rapid progress in AI and the expanding research landscape, we primarily focus on works published after 2022, with earlier studies receiving less attention.To emphasize areas that closely mimic the human research process, some topics are excluded from the main text but briefly discussed in Appendix §A.Moreover, as AI for Research is still an emerging field, the lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics hinders direct comparison.Nonetheless, we offer a comparative analysis of representative methods across domains using attribute graphs in Appendix §D.</p>
<p>A Further Discussion</p>
<p>Open Question: What is the difference between AI for science and AI for research?We posit that AI for research constitutes a subset of AI for science.While AI for research primarily focuses on supporting or automating the research process, it is not domain-specific and places greater emphasis on methodological advancements.In contrast, AI for science extends beyond the research process to include result-oriented discovery processes within specific domains, such as materials design, drug discovery, biology, and the solution of partial differential equations (Zheng et al., 2023b;AI4Science and Quantum, 2023;Zhang et al., 2024d).</p>
<p>Open Question: What is the difference between hypothesis generation and scientific discovery?Hypothesis generation, which is primarily based on literature-based review (LBD) (Swanson, 1986;Sebastian et al., 2017), emphasizing the process by which researchers generate new concepts, solutions, or approaches through existing research and their own reasoning.Scientific discovery encompasses not only hypothesis generation, but also innovation in fields like molecular optimization and drug development (Ye et al., 2024;Liu et al., 2024b), driven by outcome-oriented results.</p>
<p>Open Question: What is the difference between systematic literature review and related work generation?Existing research frequently addresses the systematic literature survey, which constitutes a component of the knowledge synthesis process during hypothesis formulation, alongside the related work generation phase in manuscript writing (Luo et al., 2025).However, we argue that these two tasks are distinct in nature.The systematic literature survey primarily focuses on summarizing knowledge extracted from diverse scientific documents, thereby assisting researchers in acquiring an initial understanding of a specific field (Altmami and Menai, 2022).In contrast, related work generation focuses on the writing process, emphasizing selection of pertinent literature and effective content structuring (Nishimura et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Discussion: Potential links between artificial intelligence systems and human research practice</p>
<p>• In research paper recommendation, Paper-Weaver (Lee et al., 2024) offers an interactive page that allows users to modify the topics they are interested in.</p>
<p>• In systematic literature review, Block and Kuckertz (2024) highlights the significant role of humans, including setting correct questions and individualized problem-solving and theorizing.Meanwhile, Hsu et al. ( 2024) emphasizes manual correction during the outline generation process.</p>
<p>• In hypothesis generation, AI engages more closely with human researchers, ranging from scenarios where humans provide the core ideas and AI contributes by iteratively refining them (Pu et al., 2024), to more collaborative settings where humans and AI engage in dialogue to facilitate new scientific discoveries (Ni et al., 2024;Liu et al., 2024b;Ye et al., 2024).</p>
<p>• • In peer review, Kumar et al. (2023); Darrin et al. (2024) advocate for assigning the responsibility of generating meta-reviews to human researchers.The role of AI is to assist by identifying conflicts among reviewers' opinions and supporting the chair in the scoring process, rather than independently assigning scores.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>The involvement of AI in manuscript writing The application of AI in manuscript writing has been accompanied by significant controversy.As LLMs demonstrated advanced capabilities, an increasing number of researchers began adopting these systems for scholarly composition (Liang et al., 2024b;Gao et al., 2023a).This trend raised concerns within the academic community (Salvagno et al., 2023), with scholars explicitly opposing the attribution of authorship to AI systems (Lee, 2023).Despite these reservations, the substantial time efficiencies offered by this technology led researchers to gradually accept AI-assisted writing practices (Gruda, 2024;Huang and Tan, 2023;Chen, 2023).This shift ultimately led to formal guidelines issued by leading academic journals (Ganjavi et al., 2024;Xu, 2025).</p>
<p>Discussion: Some areas that have not been discussed In addition to the eight areas discussed above, there are other lines of work that also aim to support scientific research, such as reading assistance (Kang et al., 2020;Head et al., 2021;Lo et al., 2023), which helps researchers read academic papers; literature processing1 , which handles documents in various formats to provide effective data for subsequent tasks; as well as code and data generation (Bauer et al., 2024;Zheng et al., 2023a), which serve as a foundation for experimental validation.However, as our focus is on the core process of scientific research, we have chosen to omit these aspects from the main text.</p>
<p>B Challenges B.1 Hypothesis Formulation</p>
<p>Knowledge Synthesize Existing paper recommendation tools predominantly rely on the metadata of existing publications to suggest related articles, which often results in a lack of user-specific targeting and insufficiently detailed presentation that hampers comprehension.Leveraging LLMs can facilitate the construction of dynamic user profiles, enabling personalized literature recommendations and enhancing the richness of the contextual information provided for each recommended article, ultimately improving the user experience.In the process of generating systematic literature reviews, our practical experience reveals that the outline generation tools often produces redundant results with insufficient hierarchical structure.Moreover, the full-text generation process is prone to hallucinations-for instance, statements may not correspond to the cited articles-a pervasive issue in large language models (Huang et al., 2023;Bolaños et al., 2024;Susnjak et al., 2024).This problem can be ameliorated by enhancing the foundational model capabilities or by incorporating citation tracing.</p>
<p>Hypothesis Generation Most existing tools generate hypotheses by designing prompts or construct-ing systematic frameworks, which heavily rely on the capabilities of pre-trained models.However, these methods struggle to balance the novelty, feasibility, and validity of the hypotheses (Li et al., 2024c).Furthermore, our investigation reveals that many current approaches adopt novelty and feasibility as evaluation metrics; these metrics are either difficult to quantify or require manual scoring, which can introduce bias.To date, there is no unified benchmark to compare the various methods, and we believe that future research should prioritize establishing a unified metric that objectively reflects the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.</p>
<p>B.2 Hypothesis Validation</p>
<p>Most existing scientific claim verification tools are largely confined to specific domains, exhibiting poor generalizability, which limits their practical applicability (Vladika and Matthes, 2023).Theorem proving, the scarcity of relevant data adversely affects performance improvements through training , results across different proof assistants are not directly comparable, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks presents numerous challenges.Moreover, current approaches remain predominantly in the research stage and lack practical tools that facilitate interaction with researchers (Li et al., 2024e).Experiment Validation, as automatically generated experiments often suffer from a lack of methodological rigor, practical feasibility, and alignment with the original research objectives (Lou et al., 2024).All these fields require rigorous logical reasoning, and I believe that the recent surge in advanced reasoning technologies could potentially address these issues.</p>
<p>B.3 Manuscript Publication</p>
<p>Similar to systematic literature surveys, manuscript writing is also adversely affected by hallucination issues (Athaluri et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2023).Even when forced citation generation is employed, incorrect references may still be introduced (Aljamaan et al., 2024).Furthermore, the text generated by models requires meticulous examination by researchers to avoid ethical concerns, such as plagiarism risks (Salvagno et al., 2023).AI-generated manuscript reviews frequently provide vague suggestions and are susceptible to biases (Chamoun et al., 2024;Drori and Te'eni, 2024).Additionally, during meta-review generation, models can be misled by erroneous information arising from the manuscript review process (Kumar et al., 2023).To address these issues, it may be necessary for the industry to establish appropriate regulations or to employ AI-based methods for detecting AIgenerated papers and reviews (Lin et al., 2023a).</p>
<p>C Ethical Considerations</p>
<p>AI has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing productivity by mitigating human limitations, thereby motivating increased investigation into its capacity to accelerate the research process (Messeri and Crockett, 2024).Nevertheless, its integration into scientific workflows introduces a range of ethical concerns (Fecher et al., 2023;Morris, 2023), including algorithmic biases, data privacy issues, risks of plagiarism, and the broader implications of AI-generated content for research communities.In this work, we examine these ethical challenges across the key stages of the research lifecycle: hypothesis formulation, validation, and publication.</p>
<p>During the hypothesis formulation stage, research paper recommendation systems and literature reviews are commonly employed; however, they often suffer from limitations that can lead to the formation of information bubbles and restrict exposure to diverse viewpoints.Furthermore, these systems tend to reinforce recognition disparities between prominent and lesser-known researchers and may inadvertently contribute to the dissemination of misinformation (Polonioli, 2021;Bolaños et al., 2024).To address these biases, recommendation algorithms can be enhanced by emphasizing contentbased rather than author-based recommendations and by incorporating robust evaluation mechanisms to strengthen the credibility of suggested materials.</p>
<p>In contrast, AI-driven hypothesis generation presents more pronounced ethical challenges.First, the attribution of intellectual property rights and authorship for AI-generated hypotheses remains ambiguous (Majumder et al., 2024a).Additionally, the widespread generation of low-quality content poses a risk of diluting the integrity of the academic landscape (Hu et al., 2024a), while the potential misuse of such technologies for illicit purposes cannot be overlooked (Si et al., 2024).Addressing these concerns necessitates the development of robust accountability frameworks, the assignment of clear responsibility for AI-generated outputs to researchers, and the establishment of appropriate legal and regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>During the hypothesis validation phase, automated systems for scientific fact-checking remain underdeveloped.This limitation may be exploited by malicious actors to create advanced misinformation generators capable of circumventing existing fact-checking tools (Wadden et al., 2022b).Likewise, in the context of experimental validation, there is a risk of unethical or legally questionable experiments being designed (Eger et al., 2025).These concerns underscore the need for continued research into model safety.</p>
<p>During the manuscript publication stage, several challenges remain.Text generated by AI models may carry a risk of plagiarism (Salvagno et al., 2023;Gupta and Pruthi, 2025), while AI-assisted peer reviews often offer vague feedback and exhibit inherent biases (Schintler et al., 2023;Drori and Te'eni, 2024;Pataranutaporn et al., 2025).To address these issues, the development of robust detection methods is essential.However, current detection tools are still in the early stages of maturity (Gupta and Pruthi, 2025).</p>
<p>D Ability Comparison</p>
<p>An effective survey should not only summarize existing methods within a field but also provide comparative analyses of different approaches.However, the domain of AI for Research remains in its early stages, with many areas lacking standardized benchmarks and even established evaluation metrics.To facilitate a clearer understanding of the distinctions among various methods, we draw on existing literature (Kang et al., 2023;Bolaños et al., 2024;Luo et al., 2025;Vladika and Matthes, 2023;Yang et al., 2023c;Li andOuyang, 2022, 2024;Lin et al., 2023a)

<p>Figure 4 :

Figure 4: This figure illustrates the various perspectives for hypothesis validation during the hypothesis validation stage.A hypothesis is typically divided into scientific claims and theorems, with SCI-claim verification (scientific claim verification) and theorem proving ensuring theoretical correctness, while experiment validation assesses practical feasibility.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Atanasova et al. (2020); Krishna et al. (2022); Pan et al. (2023a); Eldifrawi et al. (2024); Zhang et al. (2024b) advocated for generating explanatory annotations alongside experimental out-comes during the verification process.Meanwhile, Das et al. (2023); Altuncu et al. (2023) emphasized the critical role of domain expertise in ensuring accurate verification.</p>
<p>To ensure accuracy, studies such asZhang et al.  (2023)  andArlt et al. (2024) imposed input/output constraints, though this reduced generalizability.To address this, Boiko et al. (2023); Bran et al. (2024); Huang et al. (2024a) integrated tools to expand model capabilities.Full automation was achieved by Ni and Buehler (2023); Li et al. (2024a); Lu et al. (2024) through prompt-guided multi-agent collaboration.Madaan et al. (2023); Yuan et al. (2025) further highlighted that the integration of feedback mechanisms demonstrated potential for enhancing design quality, while Zhang et al. (2024a); Liu et al. (2024c); Ni et al. (2024) employed experimental outcomes to refine hyperparameter configurations, and Szymanski et al. (2023); Li et al. (2024d); Baek et al. (</p>

(2024d) incorporates human input and real-time adjustments during the execution phase to optimize experimental design.• In manuscript writing, Ifargan et al. (2024); Feng et al. (2024); Du et al. (2022a) require human intervention to suggest improvements to AI-generated paragraphs and enhance their quality through interactive methods.</p>
