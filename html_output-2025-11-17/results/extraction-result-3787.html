                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The pace of scientific research, vital for improving human life, is complex, slow, and needs specialized expertise. Meanwhile, novel, impactful research often stems from both a deep understanding of prior work, and a cross-pollination of ideas across domains and fields. To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents. Specifically, starting with a core scientific paper, ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications by connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from a knowledge store derived from shared underlying concepts mined across numerous papers. Then, mimicking a scientific approach to improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple LLM-based ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback via iterative revision processes. These reviewing agents are instantiated with human preference-aligned LLMs whose criteria for evaluation are elicited from actual human judgments via LLM prompting. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid ideas based on both human and model-based evaluation results. Our initial foray into AI-mediated scientific research has important implications for the development of future systems aimed at supporting researchers in their ideation and operationalization of novel work.</p>

The pace of scientific research, vital for improving human life, is complex, slow, and needs specialized expertise.Meanwhile, novel, impactful research often stems from both a deep understanding of prior work, and a cross-pollination of ideas across domains and fields.To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose Re-searchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work.This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents.Specifically, starting with a core scientific paper, Re-searchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications by connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from a knowledge store derived from shared underlying concepts mined across numerous papers.Then, mimicking a scientific approach to improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple LLM-based Re-viewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback via iterative revision processes.These reviewing agents are instantiated with human preference-aligned LLMs whose criteria for evaluation are elicited from actual human judgments via LLM prompting.We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid ideas based on both human and modelbased evaluation results.Our initial foray into AI-mediated scientific research has important implications for the development of future systems aimed at supporting researchers in their ideation and operationalization of novel work 1 .</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Scientific research plays a crucial role in driving innovation, advancing knowledge, solving prob-Figure 1: (A) The scientific knowledge used for research idea generation consists of a paper, its relationships over an academic graph, and entities within a knowledge store extracted from numerous papers.(B) Given them, the proposed research idea generation process involves problem identification, method development, and experiment design.Those are also iteratively refined by reviews and feedback from reviewing agents, aligned with criteria induced from human judgements.lems, expanding our understanding of the world, and ultimately improving the lives of people in tangible ways.This process usually consists of two key components: the formulation of new research ideas and the validation of these ideas through wellcrafted experiments, which are typically conducted by human researchers (Hope et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023a;Huang et al., 2023).However, this is a slow, effort-intensive process, which requires reading and synthesizing overwhelming amounts of knowledge over the vast corpus of rapidly growing scientific literature to formulate research ideas, as well as design and perform experimental validations of those ideas.For example, the number of academic papers published per year is more than 7 million (Fire and Guestrin, 2019).Similarly, the process of testing a new pharmaceutical drug requires deep expertise, and is massively expensive and labor-intensive, often taking several years (Vamathevan et al., 2019).</p>
<p>In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) (Touvron et al., 2023;OpenAI, 2023;Anil et al., 2023) have shown impressive capabili-ties in processing and generating text with remarkable accuracy, even outperforming human experts across diverse specialized domains including math, physics, history, law, medicine, and ethics.They are able to process and analyze large volumes of data at speeds and scales far exceeding human capabilities, have internalized large swaths of human knowledge from being trained on virtually the entire web, and can identify patterns, trends, and correlations that may not be immediately apparent to human researchers (such as the usage of quantum mechanics in medical imaging or applying psychological insights in AI).This renders them ideally poised to become foundational tools to accelerate the two phases of the scientific research process: ideation of novel research opportunities, and scientific validation of those research hypotheses.</p>
<p>A few recent papers in the domain of LLMaugmented scientific discovery have focused on the second phase.Specifically, they attempt (Huang et al., 2023;AI4Science and Quantum, 2023;Bran et al., 2023) to mainly accelerate the experimental validation process, by writing code for machinelearning models, facilitating the exploration of chemical spaces, or advancing the simulation of molecular dynamics.Thus, in this paper, we leverage LLMs in the first phase of scientific research -specifically idea generation, whose key focus is conceptualizing novel research questions, methodologies, and experiments.To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to leverage and evaluate the capabilities of LLMs to act as mediators in scientific idea generation in an open-ended setting.</p>
<p>Given our goal to build an LLM-powered Re-searchAgent, we draw inspiration from how human researchers position themselves to come up with novel research ideas.We draw distinctions between three key components of their workflow: a broad and deep understanding of related scientific literature, an encyclopedic view of concepts and how they relate to one another both within and across domains, and a community of colleagues on which to rely for feedback and constructive criticism.</p>
<p>We model each of these three aspects in our ResearchAgent.Specifically, in order to imbibe related work, the system begins with a core scientific paper and then explores a range of related papers through references and citation relationships.Further, to develop an encyclopedic view of related concepts, we build and then augment ResearchAgent with an entity-centric knowledge store derived from co-occurrences of key concepts in the scien-tific literature.This repository is aimed at capturing novel underlying relationships within and across domains, thereby increasing the chances of a crosspollination of ideas (Wahle et al., 2023).Finally, to simulate robust feedback mechanisms, we instantiate a number of LLM-powered ReviewingAgents that help the ResearchAgent to iterate on research idea generation with constructive critiques.Crucially, these ReviewingAgents are prompted with evaluation criteria that are induced from real researchers' judgements, thus aligning them with actual scientific preferential standards.An illustration of our system is provided in Figure 1.</p>
<p>We validate the effectiveness of ResearchAgent for research idea generation based on scientific literature across multiple disciplines.Then, on a battery of tests conducted with both human-and modelbased evaluations, we demonstrate that ResearchAgent outperforms strong LLM-powered baselines by large margins, generating more clear, relevant, and significant ideas that are especially novel.Furthermore, analyses show the efficacy of our comprehensive approach to modeling ResearchAgent: the entity-centric knowledge store and the iterative idea refinement steps help the system generate meaningfully better ideas compared with an instantiation that is purely based on prior related work.</p>
<p>These findings highlight the immense potential of AI-mediated research assistants like ResearchAgent to enhance the ideation process in scientific research.In practice, it can support researchers by identifying knowledge gaps, proposing novel problem statements, and suggesting potential methodologies early in the research process.Also, it can assist in designing experiments and streamline the writing and refinement of research papers by generating drafts and offering feedback on how to effectively frame contributions and cite relevant work.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Large Language Models LLMs have shown impressive performances across various tasks (Ope-nAI, 2023;Anil et al., 2023), including scientific fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and computer science (Portenoy et al., 2021;Romera-Paredes et al., 2023;Bran et al., 2023;Huang et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2024).For instance, GPT-4 can understand DNA sequences, design biomolecules, predict molecular behavior, and solve PDE problems (AI4Science and Quantum, 2023).However, LLMs have mainly been used for accelerating the experimental validation of already identified research ideas, but not for identifying new problems.</p>
<p>Hypothesis Generation</p>
<p>The principle of hypothesis generation is based on literature-based discovery (Swanson, 1986), which aims to discover relationships between concepts (Henry and McInnes, 2017).For instance, these concepts could be a specific disease and a compound not yet considered as a treatment for it.Early works on automatic hypothesis generation first build a corpus of discrete concepts, and then identify their relationships with machine learning approaches, e.g., using similarities between word (concept) vectors (Tshitoyan et al., 2019) or applying link prediction methods over a graph (where concepts are nodes) (Sybrandt et al., 2020;Nadkarni et al., 2021).Recent approaches are further powered by LLMs (Wang et al., 2023b;Qi et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2023), leveraging their prior knowledge about scientific disciplines.Yet, all these approaches perform idea generation in a localized manner and are designed to identify potential relationships between two variables or generate sentence-level connections, which may be sub-optimal to capture the complexity and multifaceted nature of real-world problems (e.g., urban planning involves numerous interacting variables).Meanwhile, we do not artificially restrict the target research idea to be a predictive single concept or simple binary link, instead allowing the model to generate ideas in a more open-ended fashion.</p>
<p>We note that there has been a recent surge of interest in exploring scientific idea generation: from Li et al. (2024) that focus on evaluating whether LLMs can generate research ideas that are better than human ideas, to Lu et al. (2024) that aim to automatically generate full research papers (including idea development, code writing, and experiment execution), to Li et al. (2024) that enhance the idea generation process by organizing a sequential chain of literature, all of which acknowledge and build upon insights from a prior version of our paper.</p>
<p>Knowledge-Augmented LLMs</p>
<p>The approach to augment LLMs with external knowledge makes them more accurate and relevant to target contexts.Much prior work aims at improving the factuality of LLM responses to queries by retrieving the relevant documents and injecting them into the LLM input (Lazaridou et al., 2022;Ram et al., 2023;Shi et al., 2023).In addition, given that entities or facts are atomic units for representing knowledge, recent studies augment LLMs with them (Baek et al., 2023;Wu et al., 2023).In contrast to these efforts, which use knowledge units piecemeal, we instead jointly leverage accumulated knowledge over massive troves of scientific papers.Also, Baek et al. (2024) proposes to use entities for query suggestion, which -while similar -has the entirely different objective of narrowing the focus of LLMs to entities already present in their context.Instead, our approach retrieves and integrates entities outside the given context, enabling LLMs to explore other concepts for research idea generation.</p>
<p>Iterative Refinements with LLMs Similar to humans, LLMs do not always generate optimal outputs on their first attempt.To tackle this, drawing inspiration from humans who can iteratively refine their thoughts based on critiques from themselves and their peers, many recent studies have investigated the potential of LLMs to correct and refine their outputs, demonstrating that they indeed possess those capabilities (Welleck et al., 2023;Madaan et al., 2023;Shridhar et al., 2023;Ganguli et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023b;Qi et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2023).Based on their findings, we extend this paradigm (and further test their capability) to our novel scenario of research idea generation.</p>
<p>Method</p>
<p>We present ResearchAgent, a system that automatically proposes research ideas with LLMs.</p>
<p>LLM-Powered Research Idea Generation</p>
<p>We begin by formally introducing the new problem of research idea generation, followed by an explanation of how LLMs are utilized to tackle it.</p>
<p>Research Idea Generation</p>
<p>The goal of the research idea generation task is to formulate new and valid research ideas, to enhance the overall efficiency of the first phase of scientific discovery.While we acknowledge that the real process by which humans conduct research is varied and complex to an extent well beyond the scope of this scientific study, we attempt to model simulacra in three systematic steps that would likely be maximally beneficial to a researcher seeking assistance from an AI system.These are namely, identifying novel research ideas, proposing methods to validate these ideas, and designing experiments to measure the success of these methods in relation to the ideas.</p>
<p>To accomplish the aforementioned steps, we utilize the existing literature (such as academic pub-lications) as a primary source, which provides insights about existing knowledge along with gaps and unanswered questions2 .Formally, let L be the literature, and o be the ideas that consist of the problem p, method m, and experiment design d, as follows: o = [p, m, d] where each item consists of a sequence of tokens.Then, the idea generation model f can be represented as follows: o = f (L), which is further decomposed into three submodular steps: p = f (L) for identifying problems, m = f (p, L) for developing methods, and d = f (p, m, L) for designing experiments.We operationalize f with LLMs, leveraging their capability to understand and generate academic text.</p>
<p>Large Language Models Before describing the LLM in the context of our problem setup, let us first provide its general definition, which takes an input sequence of tokens x and generates an output sequence of tokens y, as follows: y = LLM θ (T (x)).</p>
<p>Here, the model parameters θ are typically fixed after training, due to the high costs of further finetuning.In addition, the prompt template T serves as a structured format that outlines the context (including the task descriptions and instructions) to direct the model in generating the desired outputs.</p>
<p>Knowledge-Augmented LLMs for Research Idea Generation</p>
<p>We now turn to our primary focus of automatically generating research ideas with LLMs.Recall that we aim to produce a complete idea consisting of the problem, method, and experiment design (o = [p, m, d]), while using the existing literature L as a primary source of information.We operationalize this with LLMs by instantiating the aforementioned research idea generation function f with LLM coupled with the taskspecific template.Following this general formulation, the important question to answer is how the body of scientific literature is leveraged for actually generating research ideas with LLMs.Here, we outline three key desiderata that contribute to the success of human researchers ideating novel research ideas: a broad and deep understanding of related work, an encyclopedic perspective on the interconnectedness of concepts within and across scientific domains, and a community of peers who help iteratively improve ideas through constructive critiques.We describe our operationalization of these three desiderata using the prior literature and LLMs in what follows.</p>
<p>Citation Graph-based Literature Survey Due to the constraints on their input lengths and their reasoning abilities, particularly over very long contexts (Liu et al., 2023a), it is not possible to incorporate all the existing publications from the literature L into the LLM input.Instead, we need to find a meaningful subset relevant to the problem at hand.To achieve this, we mirror the process followed by human researchers, who expand their knowledge of a paper by perusing other papers that either cite or are cited by it.Concretely, for the LLM, we initiate its literature review process by providing a core paper l 0 from L and then selectively incorporating subsequent papers {l 1 , ..., l n } that are directly connected based on a citation graph.This procedure makes the LLM input for idea generation more manageable and coherent.In addition, we operationalize the selection process of the core paper and its relevant citations with two design choices: 1) the core paper is selected based on its citation count (e.g., exceeding 100 over 3 months) typically indicating high impact; 2) its relevant papers (which may be potentially numerous) are further narrow-downed based on their similarities of abstracts with the core paper, ensuring a more focused and relevant set of related work.</p>
<p>However, despite the simplicity and intuitiveness of this idea generation approach, there exists one major limitation.This approach relies exclusively on a set of given papers (the core paper and its citations); however, since scientific knowledge is not confined to specific studies but rather accumulates across a wide range of publications (across various fields), we should ideally harness this extensive, interconnected, and relevant scientific knowledge in our method for research idea generation.</p>
<p>Entity-Centric Knowledge Augmentation</p>
<p>In order to model an encyclopedic view of interconnected concepts, we must effectively design a framework to extract, store and effectively leverage the vast amount of knowledge in scientific literature L. In this work, we view entities as the atomic units of knowledge, which allows for ease of representation and accumulation over papers in a unified manner across different disciplines.For example, we can easily extract the term "database" whenever it appears in any paper, using existing off-the-shelf entity linking methods and then aggregate their linked occurrences into a knowledge store.Then, if the term "database" is prevalent within the realm of medical science but less so in hematology (which is a subdomain of medical science), the constructed knowledge store can capture the affinity between those two domains based on overlapping entities.This representational paradigm can then be used to suggest the term "database" when formulating the ideas about hematology.In other words, this approach enables providing novel and interdisciplinary insights by leveraging the interconnectedness of entities across various fields.</p>
<p>Formally, we design the knowledge store as a two-dimensional matrix K ∈ R m×m where m is the total number of unique entities identified and K is implemented in a sparse format.This knowledge store is constructed by extracting entities over all the available scientific articles in literature L3 , which not only counts the co-occurrences between entity pairs within individual papers but also quantifies the count for each entity.Our approach is versatile, thus, we can use any entity linker; in this paper we use one developed by Wu et al. (2020).This off-the-shelf system proves capable of extracting key scientific entities (which is demonstrated in Table 16) despite its lack of customized training for the scientific domain.Specifically, this linker tags and canonicalizes entities in a paper l from L, formalized as follows: E l = EL(l) where E l denotes a multiset of entities (allowing for repetitions) appearing in l4 .Upon extracting entities E, to store them into the knowledge store K, we consider all possible pairs of E represented as follows: {e i , e j } (i,j)∈C(|E|,2) where e ∈ E.</p>
<p>Given this knowledge store K, our next goal is to enhance the previous vanilla research idea generation process implemented based on a group of interconnected papers, denoted as follows: o = LLM(T ({l 0 , l 1 , ..., l n })).We do this by augmenting the LLM with the relevant entities from K, which expand the context that LLMs consume with additional knowledge.Formally, let us define entities extracted from the group of interconnected papers, as follows: E {l 0 ,...,ln} = n i=0 EL(l i ).Then, the probabilistic form of retrieving the top-k relevant external entities can be represented as follows:</p>
<p>Ret({l 0 , ..., ln} ; K) = arg max where [m] = {1, ..., m} and e i / ∈ E {l 0 ,...,ln} .Also, for simplicity, by applying Bayes' rule and assuming that entities are independent, the retrieval operation (Equation 1) can be approximated as follows: where P (e j |e i ) and P (e i ) can be derived from values in the two-dimensional matrix K, suitably normalized.We note that the formulation in Equation 2 is only one instance of operationalizing retrieval; this could be replaced with other retrieval strategies -for example, embedding-based retrieval (discussions and results are provided in Appendix B.3). Hereafter, the instantiation of research proposal generation augmented with relevant entitycentric knowledge is formalized as follows: o = LLM(T ({l 0 , ..., l n } , Ret({l 0 , ..., l n } ; K)))5 .We call this knowledge-augmented LLM-powered idea generation approach ResearchAgent, and provide the templates to instantiate it in Tables 6, 7, and 8.</p>
<p>Iterative Research Idea Refinements</p>
<p>We note that attempting to write a full research idea in one go may not be an effective strategy.Humans write drafts that are continually improved based on multiple rounds of reviews and feedback.Therefore, we lastly model a community of peers for iterative idea improvement by introducing a set of LLM-powered reviewing agents (called ReviewingAgents), which provide the ResearchAgent with reviews and feedback according to various criteria for improvement.</p>
<p>Specifically, similar to our approach to instantiate ResearchAgent with an LLM (LLM) and template (T ), ReviewingAgents are instantiated similarly but with different templates (See Tables 9, 10, and 11).Then, with ReviewingAgents, each of the generated research ideas (problem, method, and experiment design) is separately evaluated according to its own specific five criteria6 , which are provided in labels of Figure 2 and detailed in Table 12.Based on the reviews and feedback from ReviewingAgents, the ResearchAgent iteratively updates and refines its generation of research ideas.</p>
<p>Despite the proficiency of LLMs in the evaluation of machine-generated texts (Zheng et al., 2023;Fu et al., 2023), their judgments on research ideas may not be aligned with the judgments of real human researchers.However, there are no ground truth reference judgments available, and collecting them to align LLMs is expensive and often infeasible.Ideally, the judgments made by LLMs should be similar to the ones made by humans, and we aim to ensure this by automatically generating human preference-aligned evaluation criteria (used for automatic evaluations) with a few human annotations.Specifically, to obtain these humanaligned evaluation criteria, we first collect 10 pairs of research ideas and their associated scores for every evaluation criterion on a 5-point Likert scale, annotated by human researchers having at least 3 papers.After that, we prompt the LLM with these human-annotated pairs to induce detailed descriptions for evaluation criteria (Lin et al., 2024) (See Tables 13, 14, and 15).These criteria reflect the underlying human preferences7 and are used as evaluation criteria by the ReviewingAgents.</p>
<p>Experimental Setup</p>
<p>Data</p>
<p>The main source to generate research ideas is the scientific literature L, which we obtain from the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph API8 .From this, we select papers appearing after May 01, 2023, because LLMs that we use in our experiments are trained on data from the open web available before this point.This follows the procedure of existing literature-based hypothesis generation work (Qi et al., 2023).Then, we select high-impact papers (that have more than 20 citations) as core papers, mirroring human researchers' tendency to leverage influential work, to ensure the high quality of generated ideas.The resulting data is still very large; thus, we further sample a subset of 300 papers as core papers to obtain a reasonably sized benchmark dataset.The average number of reference papers for each core paper is 87; the abstract of each paper has 2.17 entities on average.The distribution of disciplines for all papers is provided in Figure 7.</p>
<p>Baselines and Our Model</p>
<p>As we target the novel task of research idea generation involving the generation of problems, methods, and experimental designs, there are no baselines for direct comparison.Thus, we mainly compare our full ResearchAgent model against its ablated variants, outlined as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Naive ResearchAgent -which uses only a core paper to generate research ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ResearchAgent w/o Entity Retrieval -which uses the core paper and its relevant references without considering entities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ResearchAgent -which is our full model that uses the relevant references and entities along with the core paper, to augment LLMs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to this set of core baselines, we also compare our approach against existing hypothesis generation work from prior literature in Table 3.</p>
<p>Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>Given our formulation of idea generation (Sec 3.1), there are no ground-truth answers to measure the quality of the generated ideas.Yet, exhaustively listing pairs of core papers and reference research ideas is suboptimal, since there may exist a large number of valid research ideas for each core paper, and this process requires much time, effort and expertise on the part of human researchers.Thus, we use a combination of model-based automatic evaluation and manual human evaluation to validate different models on our experimental benchmark.</p>
<p>Model-based Evaluation Following the recent trends in using LLMs to judge the quality of output texts (especially in the setting of reference-free evaluations) (Zheng et al., 2023;Fu et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023b), we use GPT-4 to judge the quality of research ideas.Note that each of the problem, method, and experiment design is evaluated with five different criteria (See labels of Figure 2 for criteria and see Table 12 for their detailed descriptions).We ask the LLM-based evaluation model to either rate the generated idea on a 5-point Likert scale for each criterion or perform pairwise comparisons between two ideas from different models.We provide the prompts for evaluations in Appendix A.</p>
<p>Human Evaluation Similar to model-based evaluations, we perform human evaluations that involve assigning a score for each criterion and conducting pairwise comparisons between two ideas.As the  generated ideas are knowledge-intensive, we carefully select annotators who are well-versed in the field and provide them with ideas that are highly relevant to their field of expertise 9 .Specifically, we choose ten expert researchers who have authored at least three papers and ask them to judge only the ideas that are generated based on their own papers.</p>
<p>Implementation Details</p>
<p>We mainly use the GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) release from Nov 06, 2023, as the basis for all models, which is, notably, reported to be trained with data up to Apr 2023 (meanwhile, the papers used for idea generation appear after May 2023).To extract entities and build the entity-centric knowledge store, we use the off-the-shelf BLINK entity linker (Wu et al., 2020), with papers from May 01, 2023, to Dec 31, 2023 (available from Semantic Scholar API) along with their references, 9 We also experiment with human evaluation using nondomain-experts, but this proves to be suboptimal therefore, we focus on experts for reliable judgments of generated ideas.</p>
<p>Experimental Results and Analyses</p>
<p>Main Results Our main results on scoring with human and model-based evaluations are provided in Figure 2.These demonstrate that our full Re-searchAgent outperforms all baselines by large margins on every metric across problems, methods, and experiment designs (constituting the complete research ideas).Particularly, the full ResearchAgent augmented with relevant entities exhibits strong gains on metrics related to creativity (such as Originality for problems and Innovativeness for methods) since entities may offer novel concepts and views that may not be observable in the group of citation-based papers alone.In addition, the results of pairwise comparisons between models with both human and model-based evaluations -shown in Figure 3 -demonstrate that the full ResearchAgent shows the highest win ratio over its baselines.1.Specifically, for the scoring, we first rank scores from each annotator and measure Spearman's correlation coefficient (Pirie, 2006) between the ranked scores of two annotators.For the pairwise comparison between two judges, we measure Cohen's kappa coefficient (Cohen, 1960).Table 1 shows that the inter-annotator agreement is high, confirming the reliability of our assessments about the quality of generated research ideas.Also, while agreement scores for experimental designs are slightly lower than other aspects, this does not necessarily indicate a shortcoming in the quality of experimental designs produced by ResearchAgent, as demonstrated in Figures 2 and 3. Instead, we view this as the inherent subjectivity and variability in how such designs are perceived and evaluated by different annotators (i.e., the nature of the variability itself makes achieving high agreement challenging).</p>
<p>Analysis on Human-Model Agreements Similar to what we did for the aforementioned interannotator agreements, we measure agreements between human-based and model-based evaluations, to ensure the reliability of model-based evaluations.</p>
<p>As shown in Table 1, we further confirm that agreements between humans and models are high, indicating that model-based evaluations are a reasonable proxy to judge research idea generation.</p>
<p>Analysis of Refinement Steps</p>
<p>To see the effectiveness of iterative refinements of research ideas with ReviewingAgents, in Figure 4, we report the averaged scores on the generated ideas as a function of refinement steps.We first observe initial  improvements in the quality of generated ideas with increased refinement steps.Yet, the performance becomes saturated after three iterations, which may indicate diminishing returns for subsequent iteration steps, which aligns with the pattern observed in agent-based refinement work (Du et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Ablation on Knowledge Sources Recall that the full ResearchAgent is augmented with two different knowledge sources, namely relevant references and entities.To see their individual contribution, we perform an ablation study by either excluding one of the knowledge sources or replacing it with random elements.As shown in Table 2, each knowledge source contributes to performance improvement, and the relevant references are especially helpful.We also note that providing random elements is more helpful than providing no elements at all; we hypothesize that this may be due to the LLM's capability to filter out noise while still gaining incidental value from random inputs.</p>
<p>Analysis on Human Alignment for Evaluation</p>
<p>Recall that to align judgments from model-based evaluations with actual human preferences, we generated the evaluation criteria based on human evaluation results and used them as the criteria for model-based evaluations.Figure 5 demonstrates the efficacy of this strategy, presenting the score distribution of human evaluation compared with the distributions of model-based evaluations with and without human alignment.We find that the score distribution of model-based evaluations without alignment is skewed and different from the score distribution of human judgments.Meanwhile, after aligning the model-based evaluations with humaninduced score criteria, the calibrated distribution more closely resembles the distribution of humans.Correlation on Citation Counts We further investigate whether a high-impact paper (when used as a core paper) leads to high-quality research ideas.</p>
<p>To measure this, we categorize papers by their citation count (as a proxy for impact), and visualize the average score of each bucket (with model-based evaluations) in Figure 6.We find that ideas from high-impact papers tend to be of higher quality, likely due to their ability to identify research gaps, propose feasible methods, and connect with other works.Additionally, based on the paper distribution (See Figure 7) and for the ease of manual quality check, evaluation criteria for model-based evaluations are induced mainly with computer science papers.To see whether those criteria are applicable to diverse fields, we also compare a correlation between scores of computer science papers and all papers in Figure 6.From this, we observe that the scores increase when the citation increases for both domains, which may support the generalizability of human-preference-induced evaluation criteria.</p>
<p>Comparisons to Hypothesis Generation Recall that existing methods for hypothesis generation focus on predicting links between variables or generating hypotheses based on these links, which differs from our experimental setup of generating openended research ideas (problems, methods, and experiments).Nevertheless, to understand how the quality of the generated research ideas from prior works (Wang et al., 2023b;Yang et al., 2023) differs from our ResearchAgent, we perform comparisons.As shown in Table 3, we observe that ResearchAgent is capable of generating superior research hypotheses, due to the utilization of broad and deep knowledge across domains as well as the iterative review and refinement procedures.</p>
<p>Analysis using Different LLMs To assess how</p>
<p>ResearchAgent's performance changes with different LLMs, we conduct an auxiliary analysis with Llama3, Mixtral, Qwen1.5, and GPT-3.5 (Bai et al., 2023;Jiang et al., 2024), as shown in Table 4.These results show a significant performance drop with less capable models.Moreover, the performance differences between the Naive ResearchAgent without knowledge augmentation and the full ResearchAgent become marginal (for Mixtral and GPT-3.5),which indicates that they might struggle with capturing complex concepts between scientific papers.This can likely be attributed to the emergent abilities of LLMs for complex reasoning (but not in smaller LMs) (Wei et al., 2022), although other subtle issues may also be contributing factors.</p>
<p>Qualitative Analysis We provide qualitative results on generated research ideas in Table 16.One representative example in the last row highlights the advantage of entity-centric knowledge augmentation, where two entities (such as Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel and CRISPR) retrieved from the entity-centric knowledge store enable the generation of a novel research idea: bridging genetic variability and CRISPR applications.This exemplifies how external entity-based knowledge uncovers non-trivial relations between scientific concepts.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In this work, we introduced ResearchAgent, a system designed to assist researchers by generating research ideas, which encompass problem identification, method development, and experiment design.</p>
<p>Inspired by the human process of ideation, our approach conducts broad and deep literature reviews, integrates knowledge across domains to foster idea cross-pollination, and employs a community of reviewing agents to iteratively refine the generated ideas.Our evaluations, both human and modelbased, demonstrated that ResearchAgent produces ideas that are more creative, valid, and clear compared to baselines.While this initial foray shows promising results, multiple challenges remain to operationalize ResearchAgent in real-world research settings.Practical considerations include scaling the knowledge store to encompass diverse research domains, and keeping it current with the latest publications, through which the system can become adaptable even to emerging fields.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>ResearchAgent has some limitations that we hope to address in future work.</p>
<p>First, recall that we built the entity-centric knowledge store to propose beneficial entities during idea generation; however this store is constructed by extracting entities from the titles and abstracts of a limited number of publications (due to the costs of processing them) thereby precluding a large number of other entities and their interconnectedness.</p>
<p>In addition, the number of entities that we obtain from the BLINK entity linker (Wu et al., 2020) amounts to 3 per paper on average, indicating limited coverage (it is an open-domain linker after all), although it does exhibit generally strong understanding of scientific contexts, as demonstrated by the improvement achieved by the inclusion of its predictions (See Figures 2 and 3, and Table 16).</p>
<p>Furthermore, since our ResearchAgent is powered by LLMs, similar to any other approaches based on LLMs, it may hallucinate the generated research ideas.While our proposed ResearchAgent can partially mitigate this problem by augmenting LLMs with additional elements, such as references to the target paper and greater entity-centric knowledge, which help ground the generation process in more accurate and relevant information, validating these generated research ideas with experiments is essential to truly accelerate scientific research.</p>
<p>Moreover, while our iterative refinement process with ReviewingAgents demonstrates promising results, it has inherent limitations in scope.Although we employed diverse perspectives by utilizing 15 ReviewingAgents to evaluate three different ideas (problem, method, and experimental design) with five specific criteria for each, this approach may not fully capture the broad range of potential perspectives and criteria necessary for comprehensive evaluation across all different research domains.As acknowledged in the paper, our selection of criteria was informed by their presumed importance, but conducting an exhaustive exploration of all possible criteria over diverse domains is beyond the scope of this work (given the complexity of categorizing and balancing all relevant factors and perspectives).However, we believe the potential of our modular approach allows for customizing and aligning updated or even new criteria to any specific target domain with novel applications, and we leave further expanding them as future work.</p>
<p>Lastly, our ResearchAgent may be less suited for generating ideas in certain domains, such as theoretical sciences, where mathematical reasoning and proof generation play a central role.However, its flexibility allows for customization through specific instructions, enabling the integration of reasoningbased models and techniques to cater to the needs of theoretical research.For instance, in theoretical mathematics, we can instruct (reasoning-based) LLMs to focus on generating proofs or methods and omit experimental design steps that are less relevant.This as an exciting area for future work, where specialized techniques tailored to each domain could be included to broaden its applicability.</p>
<p>Ethics Statement</p>
<p>We are aware that the ResearchAgent may have the potential to be misused for nefarious purposes, such as generating research ideas about new explosives, malicious software, and invasive surveillance tools.</p>
<p>Notably, this vulnerability is not unique to our approach but a common challenge faced by existing LLMs that possess significant creative and reasoning capabilities, occasionally generating content that may be deemed undesirable.Consequently, it underscores the necessity to enhance the robustness and safety of LLMs more broadly.Also, we recognize the risks of unintentional plagiarism associated with using ResearchAgent, where the system might generate ideas that closely mirror existing research due to the regurgitation of training data.While mitigation strategies, such as integrating access to a comprehensive knowledge base to inform users of prior work, can be employed, we understand that building and maintaining such a resource is inherently complex and may not fully eliminate the risk.To further reduce the possibility of plagiarism, recording and tracking all generated ideas could help identify similarities and guide the model to avoid repetition, though this approach would necessitate explicit user consent.</p>
<p>A Additional Experimental Details</p>
<p>In this section, we provide additional details on experiments, including datasets, human evaluation setups, prompts (used for research idea generation and validation), and human-induced criteria.</p>
<p>A.1 Data Statistics</p>
<p>We visualize a distribution of core paper categories used for idea generation in Figure 7, where the categories are obtained from Semantic Scholar API 10 .From this, we find that the top 3 categories are computer science, medicine, and engineering.</p>
<p>A.2 Details on Human Evaluation</p>
<p>To conduct evaluations with human judges, we recruited 10 researchers from the United States and South Korea, majoring in computer science, medicine, and biology, each with a minimum of 3 published papers.For annotation, they were provided with a 6-page guideline document, which includes the task instruction and annotation examples.After reading this document, the annotators access the Label Studio platform, on which they first read the title and abstract of the target paper, and then review and evaluate the generated research ideas from different models.During the evaluation process, they are allowed to use any external tools, such as web searches.We note that they were compensated at a rate of $22.20 per hour.Also, on average, for one hour, they evaluated 3 sets of research ideas (that are generated from their own papers), with each set comprising three sub-ideas (the problem, method, and experiment design) from three different approaches (i.e., a total of 9 ideas for one hour).We perform three rounds of human evaluations with refinements in between, and, due to the cost associated with human annotations, we are able to fully evaluate a total of 150 ideas.</p>
<p>A.3 Prompts for Ideas Generation</p>
<p>We provide the prompts used to elicit the idea generations from our full ResearchAgent, specifically for instantiating problem identification, method development, and experiment design in Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8, respectively.</p>
<p>A.4 Prompts for Idea Validation</p>
<p>We provide the prompts used to elicit the idea validation from our ReviewingAgents as well as the model-based evaluations, specifically for instantiating problem validation, method validation, and experiment design validation in Table 9, Table 10, and Table 11, respectively.In addition, we provide the criteria used, which are induced by human judgments in the next subsection (Appendix A.5).</p>
<p>A.5 Criteria Induced by Human Judgements</p>
<p>Recall that, to align model-based evaluations with human preferences, we induce the criteria (used for automatic evaluations) with actual human judgments.We note that this is done by prompting GPT-4 with 10 pairs of generated ideas and (randomly selected) human judgments.We provide the resulting criteria for validations of problems, methods, and experiment designs in Table 13, Table 14, and Table 15, respectively.</p>
<p>B Additional Experimental Results</p>
<p>We provide additional experimental results, including comparisons without refinements and examples of the generated research ideas.</p>
<p>B.1 Results without Refinement Steps</p>
<p>To see whether the proposed ResearchAgent is consistently effective even without ReviewingAgents, we show the model-based evaluation results without any refinement steps in Figure 8. From this, we clearly observe that the full ResearchAgent outperforms its variants, demonstrating its effectiveness.</p>
<p>B.2 Results on Generated Ideas by Domain</p>
<p>To see the quality of the generated research ideas across different domains, we breakdown the performance of ResearchAgent according to the categories of core papers in Figure 7, and present the results in Figure 9. From this, we observe that the generated research ideas on the high-resource domains (such as Computer Science, Medicine, and Engineering where there is a greater volume of existing literature as shown in Figure 7) are superior to those generated from the low-resource domain papers (such as Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics).This disparity might be attributed to the fact that the underlying LLMs used to generate research ideas are likely trained on data predominantly sourced from high-resource domains, which leads to enhancing their ability to comprehend scientific concepts and produce relevant research ideas.</p>
<p>B.3 Analysis with Different Entity Retrieval</p>
<p>To see the effectiveness of different entity retrieval strategies, we perform additional experiments, replacing the co-occurrence-based entity retrieval in Equation 2 to the contextual embedding-based retrieval.Notably, this contextual embedding-based retrieval approach uses the entities that have the highest similarity to the entities appearing in the current literature (i.e., core paper and its references) used for idea generation, where the similarities are calculated based on embedding-level similarities between entities over the latent space represented by the entity linker (Wu et al., 2020).Therefore, unlike the previous co-occurrence-based entity retrieval that may retrieve entities that have opposite concepts to the main idea of the current core paper (since we often mention limitations of previous work along with the proposed ideas), this embedding-based approach may provide the Re-searchAgent with mostly the entities having similar concepts to the core paper.Nevertheless, as shown in Table 5, the results with the strategy of entity cooccurrence-based retrieval are comparable to the results with the new embedding-based contextual retrieval.These results might confirm that there is not much difference in the quality of entity retrieval among those two strategies, i.e., most entities retrieved from the co-occurrence-based retrieval are contextually relevant for generating research ideas.</p>

<p>We focus on the existing literature-based idea generation by following the paradigm that a new idea is more often than not just a new combination of old elements(Young, 2003).
As extracting entities on all articles is computationally infeasible, we target papers appearing after May 01, 2023.
Due to the extensive length of scientific publications, the target of entity extraction is restricted to titles and abstracts.
There may be additional knowledge sources (beyond the existing literature and entities) for research idea generation, and we leave exploring them as future work.
We select the top five criteria which we consider as the most important, and leave exploring others as future work.
We additionally ask five human annotators, who evaluate research ideas, to judge the quality of the induced criteria; two of them agree strongly, while the other three agree moderately.

Connectome Mapping and Variability Analysis: a. Utilize the Virtual Fly Brain database to identify and compare individual connectomes, focusing on the mushroom body.b.Quantify the variability in connection weights and cell type counts using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns of variability.2. Behavioral Assays: a. Design a series of learning and memory tasks for Drosophila, such as olfactory conditioning or visual pattern recognition.b.Test groups of flies with known connectome profiles under controlled environmental conditions to establish baseline behavioral data.Environmental and
