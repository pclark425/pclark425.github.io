                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The article states that social intelligence in psychology is seen as the ability of a person to understand correctly his / her own behavior and the behavior of other people in the society. This ability is very necessary for a person to have an effective interpersonal interaction and successful social adaptation. Social intelligence implements the functioning of cognitive processes associated with the reflection of a person as a partner in the processes of communication and activities. The main function of social intelligence is to predict the behavior of others. The authors of the article consider the concept of «intelligence» in the broad and narrow senses. In a broad meaning of «intelligence» it is only one intelligence, the intellectual sphere of the person in general. In this sense, the intelligence of a person can be described as a hierarchical system that has several levels. The first level is the level of functioning of cognitions. The second level of intelligence is the level of metacognitions. The third level of intelligence amplifies the characteristics of both the first and the second levels, while intellectual activity is carried out mainly at an unconscious level, the level that approximates a person to use of automated skills and abilities. The next, the fourth level, is the level of meta-intellectual activity, which explodes the creative achievements of the person. It was proved that each type of intelligence contained some abilities of the person to perform a certain type of the activity. Guided by the narrow sense of understanding the word «intelligence», it was determined: social intelligence; technical intelligence; artistic intelligence; information intelligence. It was described the empirical research which was organized in diffe rent regions of Ukraine (the participants of this research were teachers and directors from preschool educational establishments). The results having been received in this research proved that the respondents of all groups had the results which showed the advantage of average indicators of their ability to understand the meanings of non-verbal expressions and the meaning of the expression, depending on a social context. This may be due to the fact that these abilities are formed in the immediate process of communication and to a large extent depend on the conditions of the life of the subjects, at the first place – on the conditions of their professional activity, means and methods of professional activity of teachers of preschool educational establishments. © Eduard Ivashkevych, Liana Onufriieva Збірник наукових праць К-ПНУ імені Івана Огієнка, Інституту психології імені Г.С.

The article states that social intelligence in psychology is seen as the ability of a person to understand correctly his / her own behavior and the behavior of other people in the society. This ability is very necessary for a person to have an effective interpersonal interaction and successful social adaptation. Social intelligence implements the functioning of cognitive processes associated with the reflection of a person as a partner in the processes of communication and activities. The main function of social intelligence is to predict the behavior of others.The authors of the article consider the concept of «intelligence» in the broad and narrow senses. In a broad meaning of «intelligence» it is only one intelligence, the intellectual sphere of the person in general. In this sense, the intelligence of a person can be described as a hierarchical system that has several levels. The first level is the level of functioning of cognitions. The second level of intelligence is the level of metacognitions. The third level of intelligence amplifies the characteristics of both the first and the second levels, while intellectual activity is carried out mainly at an unconscious level, the level that approximates a person to use of automated skills and abilities. The next, the fourth level, is the level of meta-intellectual activity, which explodes the creative achievements of the person.It was proved that each type of intelligence contained some abilities of the person to perform a certain type of the activity. Guided by the narrow sense of understanding the word «intelligence», it was determined: social intelligence; technical intelligence; artistic intelligence; information intelligence.It was described the empirical research which was organized in diffe rent regions of Ukraine (the participants of this research were teachers and directors from preschool educational establishments). The results having been received in this research proved that the respondents of all groups had the results which showed the advantage of average indicators of their ability to understand the meanings of non-verbal expressions and the meaning of the expression, depending on a social context. This may be due to the fact that these abilities are formed in the immediate process of communication and to a large extent depend on the conditions of the life of the subjects, at the first place -on the conditions of their professional activity, means and methods of professional activity of teachers of preschool educational establishments.© Eduard Ivashkevych, Liana OnufriievaЗбірник наукових праць К-ПНУ імені Івана Огієнка, Інституту психології імені Г.С.

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In the paradigm of Cognitive Psychology the study of social cognitions and social intelligence has greatly enriched in the psychology by the essence and content of social intelligence, which previously had been developed in the psychometric tradition. Thanks to cognitive psychology, the actualization of the concepts of social representation was intensified. However, the analysis of existing models of representations of social knowledge suggests that the greatest attention in the history of cognitive psychology was given to abstract representations, and existing mental models (which relate to both verbal and figurative presentation formats of information) were not systematically checked. In addition, the functioning of these models, as a rule, plays a leading role in such a field of social cognition, as the actualization of processes of social categorization and stereotyped thinking, in the field of perception of psychological features, the formation of the first impression, understanding of subjects of interpersonal interaction, etc. This situation, we deal with, sets the prospect of further empirical research on the development of social intelligence.</p>
<p>In Cognitive Psychology there are several models that describe the representation and functioning of social knowledge (in particular, relating to different categories, stereotypes, and the development of a personal impression (that is, the perception of psychological features)). In this research we'll analyze the basic models.</p>
<p>Prototype model  highlights that abstract representations of typical features of a group which are stored in the subject's memory; thus, the evaluation of another person is based on the process of establishing its similarity to the prototype. In the other words, the rep-resentation of the prototype is something like «averaged» on many features of the representation of the category without distinguishing key characteristics of it. This model assumes that the knowledge of stereotypes has a hierarchical organization: it can be said about so called «base level categories» and their subtypes. The prototype model can explain two phenomena: the process of changing the stereotype it is going through the formation of new subtypes, or its rather unsuccessful usage according to the specific members of the group. So, human perception is based on its comparison with the prototype, then any of its features (even those that are too difficult to diagnose), leveling the similarity, lead to a loosening of the stereotype.</p>
<p>Example model arose recently as a rather alternative model of prototypes and some other models built on the mechanisms of abstraction . According to this model, there are no abstract representations of any groups, since they were presented by concrete, wellknown examples, and judgments about a person are based on the principles of comparison with these examples.</p>
<p>Associative networks model assumes that knowledge exists in the form of systems created by interrelated features. And the notion of «sign» and the concept of «system» are interpreted quite differently. Under attributes refer to the features or traits of the person, motivational guides, behavioral strategies can be interpreted as a system of any simple associative or content-causative, or affective-emotional connections. For this model, it is typical that associations arise automatically, that is, knowledge is actualized beyond conscious control by the subject, and changes in the paradigm of this knowledge occur, as a rule, rather slowly. An example of such a model is the approach of D. Carlston .</p>
<p>Models of schemas characterize social knowledge as rather abstract and generalized . The high level of abstraction of social knowledge, as was foreseen by this model, justifies the high ability of a person to assimilate.</p>
<p>The model of base rates implies awareness of the subject of how social knowledge functions, that is, the question is not about the representation in a whole . Each person has relevant experience of applying some knowledge that usually leads to more successful integration of basic assessments with the inclusion of the latest new integrative information, or, for example, to ignore stereotypes in certain specific cases.</p>
<p>Although this systematization of models seems rather conditional, its authors note that in practice insufficient attention is paid to their empirical verification. As a rule, one of these models is implicitly accepted by the researcher as theoretical basis of the study, and in a case of obtaining the corresponding results it is considered correctly. An abstract or summary judgment in shaping the impression of a person can be both a final assessment of a person and the assessment of specific features of an individual. In particular, S. Sherman, C. Judd, B. Park ) explicitly pointed to the existence of two types of representation, and, respectively, two relatively independent types of memory for different types of information. The question of the relationship between elements of human behavior in the content of social knowledge is considered as the actualization of formal thinking or as the expression of spontaneous and unconscious intentions.</p>
<p>We consider the concept of «intelligence» in the broad and narrow senses. If we talk about the broad meaning of «intelligence», we mean only the intelligence, the intellectual sphere of the person in general. In this sense, the intelligence of a person can be described as a hierarchical system that has several levels. The first level is the level of functioning of cognitions, to which psychologists refer the main psychical processes (sensation, perception, memory, attention, which, in turn, «control» the course of cognitive activity), as well as thinking and imagination, speech and dialogical interaction Smulson, 2003;Zasekina, 2006). The second level of intelligence is the level of metacognitions (metacognitive integrators, «secondary» mental processes), among which the main ones are intellectual initiation (self-statement of the problem), reflection, decentralization, intellectual strategies and abilities (abilities and competences), as well as metacognitive monitoring, intuition, intellectual atheist (values, meanings) . The first and the se cond levels of intelligence, in our opinion, are fully understood by the person who carries out intellectual activity. The third level of intelligence amplifies the characteristics of both the first and the second levels, while intellectual activity is carried out mainly at an unconscious level, a level that approximates a person to use of automated skills and abilities. The next, the fourth level, is the level of meta-intellectual activity, which explodes the creative achievements of the person. Thanks to this fourth level of intelligence a person is able to establish interaction not only with different objects and other people, but also with the world as a whole, thus expanding the limits of his / her intellect and starting a dialogue with the creative beginning of the world (Fig. 1).</p>
<p>When it comes about intelligence in the narrow sense, we rely first of all on the model of the intellect of G. Gardner , which in his recent works distinguishes seven types of intelligence: linguistic intelligence, musical one, logical intelligence and mathematical one, spatial intelligence, physical-kinesthetic one, interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal one. Such models of intelligence are distinguished by J. Kihlstrom and N. Cantor . In particular, technical intelligence is highlighted in the theories of G.О. Ball and V.O. Medintsev (Ball &amp; Medintsev, 2011), J. Kihlstrom and N. Cantor . Also, J. Kihlstrom and N. Cantor ), E. Fedorova (Fedorova, 2009) singled out poetic and artistic intelligence, G.О. Ball and V.O. Medintsev (Ball &amp; Medintsev, 2011) -also aesthetic intelligence. The basis of all these models was the peculiarities of the classification of abilities, which authors, as a rule, refer to certain synthesizing factors (for example, the factor that determines the ability of a person to operate on quantitative relationships, the factor determines the ability to qualitative analysis and the formation of categories and classifications). That is, each type of intelligence contains certain abilities of the person to perform a certain type of the activity. In this case, for example, «linguistic intelligence» is referred to as «intelligence» by the authors, because it is a complex of integral education, which includes separate abilities to perform a certain type of the activity, and if we talk about a specialist in this sphere of the activity, his / her competences, we remind about the structure of the professional competence of the person.</p>
<p>Thus, guided by the narrow sense of understanding the word «intelligence», we distinguish: social intelligence; technical intelligence; artistic intelligence; information intelligence.</p>
<p>We refer to artistic intelligence the abilities that many authors have attributed to linguistic, poetic, artistic, dance, aesthetic intelligence, because we consider them the abilities of one semantic group. The level of the development of artistic intelligence inevitably determines such qualitative features of thinking as poetry and imaginative thinking. Subjects with a high level of the development of artistic intelligence are characterized by aspirations for new and unknown, lack of fear of risk.</p>
<p>Information intelligence, in our opinion, is related to the development of abilities to work in a complicated information society, to understanding of information systems and networks, to predict their further development and functioning. If we consider information systems as a communication system that assists in collecting, searching, processing and forwarding information, the information intelligence, due to the set of abilities that are part of it, provides some maintenance into the structure of information system. Such abilities are: the abilities, aimed at assessing the situation (solving problems in recognition of images); the abilities aimed at transforming the description of the situation (solving settlement problems, problems in modeling); the ability to make decisions (including optimization).</p>
<p>So, the aim of our article is to describe social intelligence as largely determined structure by the nervous and mental state of the person, by different social factors of the environment, the level of adequacy and the success of the implementation of social interaction.</p>
<p>The tasks of our research</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To describe the functioning of social intelligence in the paradigm of Cognitive Psychology in which there are several models that describe the representation and functioning of social knowledge: prototype model, example model, associative networks model, models of schemas, the model of base rates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To consider the concept of «intelligence» in the broad and narrow senses, to describe the levels of the intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To distinguish social intelligence, technical intelligence, artistic intelligence, information intelligence, to describe their main characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To describe the empirical research which was organized in different regions of Ukraine (the participants of this research were teachers and directors of preschool educational establishments) with the purpose to measure the level of social intelligence of teachers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Methods and methodical instrumentation of the research</p>
<p>The first phase of the experiment was carried out in 2005. The method of the research at this stage was the observation of teachers of preschool establishments, the selection of methodical tools for empirical research. The second, empirical stage of our study was carried out during 2006-2008. The following methods were used in the research: 1) general scientific methods (analysis, comparison, generalization); 2) the psychodiagnostic method, which was provided using the test of J. Gilford and M. O'Sullivan «Research of Social Intelligence», verbal and figurative subtest «Methods of studying divergent thinking» by P. Torrens, J. Gilford (in the modification of O.E. Tunik); associative experiment (using the method of B.V. Zeygarnik «Understanding the portable value of proverbs and metaphors»; 3) mathematical and statistical methods (statistical estimations of distribution parameters, x-Pearson criterion, checking of statistical hypotheses by means of parametric t-Student's criteria and the non-parametric U-criterion Manna-Whitney, the r-Spearman correlation coefficient).</p>
<p>Also, to determine the psychological type of the teacher's person we used: a questionnaire by V.M. Minyarov; typographic questionnaire MBTI; personal questionnaire of CPI; a questionnaire for evaluation of personal and business professional-important qualities of the person (T.Y. Bazarov); a questionnaire for evaluation of interpersonal admissibility (N.V. Baharev); a questionnaire for evaluation of assessing the complex of productivity in managerial situations (R. Scock); the questionnaire proposed by us for the purpose of diagnosing difficulties of interaction of teachers with other people.</p>
<p>Therefore, 114 respondents were evenly distributed in groups:</p>
<p>Е1 -16 teachers of ІІ and ІІІ categories (the experience of work -from 5 to 10 years, age -up to 30 years) of regional cities (5 respondents of the kindergarten № 2 of Rivne, 5 educators of the kindergarten № 5 of Kharkiv and 6 teachers of the kindergarten № 11 in Odessa, Ukraine); E2 -18 teachers of category I (work experience -from 10 to 15 years, age -from 30 to 37 years) of regional cities (7 respondents of the kindergarten № 2 of Rivne, 6 teachers of the kindergarten № 5 of Kharkiv and 5 teachers of the kindergarten № 11 in Odessa, Ukraine); E3 -15 teachers of the higher category (the experience of work -from 15 and more, age -from 37 years) of regional cities (5 respondents of the kindergarten № 2 of Rivne, 5 educators of the kindergarten № 5 of Kharkiv and 5 teachers of the kindergarten № 11 of Odessa, Ukraine); E4 -13 teachers of category I (work experience -from 5 to 10 years, age -up to 30 years) of regional towns (4 respondents from the town of Zdolbuniv of Rivne region, kindergarten №1; 5 tutors of Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi region, kindergarten №2; 4 respondents from the town of Zdolbuniv, Rivne region, kindergarten №5, Ukraine); E5 -14 teachers of ІІ category (the experience of workfrom 10 to 15 years, age -from 30 to 37 years) of regional towns (6 respondents in the town of Zdolbuniv of Rivne region, the kindergarten №1, 4 educators of Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi region, the kindergarten №2; 4 respondents from the town of Zdolbuniv, Rivne region, kindergarten №5, Ukraine); E6 -19 teachers of the higher category (work experience -from 15 years and more, age -more than 37 years) of regional towns (5 respondents in Zdolbuniv city of Rivne region, kindergarten №1; 5 educators of Shepetivka town of Khmelnytskyi region, kindergarten №2; 9 respondents from the town of Zdolbuniv, Rivne region, kindergarten №5, Ukraine); E7 -19 directors of kindergartens (this group includes directors of cities and regional towns, such as: nursery schools №2 and №4 of Rivne, nursing homes №5,13,14,15,18 of Kharkiv,nursery schools №3,8,9,11 in Odessa, kindergarten №1, 2 in Zdolbuniv, Rivne region, nurseries №1, 2, 4 in town of Shepetivka, Khmelnytskyi region, kindergartens №1, 2, 5 in town of Kamianets-Podilskyi, Khmelnytskyi region, Ukraine).</p>
<p>The results of the research and their discussion</p>
<p>The empirical research was aimed at analyzing the results we obtained for «the integral indicator of a general level of the development of divergent thinking in the verbal and figurative sphere» of teachers of pre-school educational institutions. This indicator was determined by factorizing the results for all subtest (see Figure 1).</p>
<p>The results of teachers of pre-school educational institutions for the «integral indicator of the general level of the development of divergent thinking in the verbal and figurative spheres» (according to «Methods of studying divergent thinking» by P. Torrens, J. Gilford), in points, according to the results of factor analysis are: in E1 -0,7382, in E2 -0,7694, in E3 -0,7911, in E4 -0,7610, in E5 -0,7532, in E6 -0,7587, in E7 -0,7301. Comparative analysis of a general indicator of the development of the qualities of divergent thinking of teachers of all groups suggests that the results of respondents do not have significant differences, including the results of respondents-directors of preschool educational institutions. Thus, it is experimentally confirmed the definition of divergent thinking as the indicator of the diversity of subjective experience gained under the influence of a certain type of creative activity. So, we can draw the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The criteria of divergent thinking (speed, flexibility, originality, productivity) is developed in the conditions of the creative activity, defining the development of such qualities of thinking of teachers and leaders of preschool educational institutions as: a) extrapolation of subjective representations in the process of forecasting atypical situations; b) the generation of semantic units based on the organization of subjective representations; c) actualization of certain categorizations, associations; d) transformation and organization of uncertain material into the integral system of representations; e) independence and synthetic perception of unfinished objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The structure of qualities of divergent thinking of a teacher of preschool educational institution corresponds to the specifics and content of the creative activity. In the conditions of artistic and musical activity, the following intellectual qualities are developed: generalization of semantic units, actualization of various individual categories and associations, the organization of uncertain material into a coherent system of representations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>The psychological determinants of the development of the qualities of divergent thinking of a teacher of preschool educational institution are: 1) figurative perception as a teacher of a real reality, which prompts a specialist to diversify and bulk actualization of the potential features of the subject (actualization of certain categories and associations); 2) generalization of certain features of a particular object, taking into account his/her own subjective impressions, which allow the teacher to generate a new image-symbol (generation of semantic units, independence in the perception of unfinished objects); 3) the need to amplify the subjective representation of the characteristics of the product of cognitive activity, taking into account the objective aesthetic criteria of this product (the organization of uncertain material into an integral system of representations); 4) in the conditions of pedagogical activity the following intellectual qualities of the teacher are developed: extrapolation of subjective representations; generalization of semantic units reflected in sentence structure; synthetic perception of obscure objects, etc.</p>
<p>Psychological conditions of the development of the qualities of divergent thinking of a teacher of preschool institutions are: 1) a high level of the development of critical thinking, which is realized in the sphere of personal abilities to predict the development of situations (extrapolation of subjective representations); 2) the ability to objectify communication intentions in relation to the communication of a partner, taking into account generally accepted structure of the statement (sentence) (generalization of semantic units); 3) the ability to give meaning to unclear situations in order to orientate in the dynamic conditions of the pedagogical activity (quick and original perception of obscure objects); 4) in the context of the professional activity, the perception of obscure objects as a leading cognitive process among others, which may be due to the need to be oriented in a holistic game situation; 5) in the conditions of dance activity which develop the following qualities of divergent thinking: the actualization of individual categorizations, independence in the perception of unfinished objects. The psychological basis for the development of these qualities of divergent thinking of preschool teachers is the additional system of categorization based on a nonverbal sign system (actualization of individual categorizations, independence of perception of unfinished objects, etc.).</p>
<p>Consequently, taking into account that social intelligence is a complex structural entity consisting of a number of mental capacities that directly or indirectly relate to the performance of certain activities and personal characteristics, then the socio-psychological factors of the development of social intelligence of the person can be considered precision understanding of other people, the adequacy of interpretation and forecasting, individual properties of the nervous and mental states, and, finally, the social factors of the environment, the adequacy and successful implementation of social interpersonal interaction. These social and psychological factors, in turn, emphasize the fact that social intelligence is somewhat independent in relation to the intelligence of the person.</p>
<p>So, subjects with a high level of the development of social intelligence can receive maximum information about human behavior, understand the language of non-verbal communication, express adequate and accurate judgments about people, successfully predict their behavioral reactions in the given situations, show forward-lookingness in the processes of interaction with others, contributing successful social adaptation of subjects.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that in itself the level of the development of social intelligence is not yet a guarantee of productivity of social behavior of the person. The basis of social unadaptation may be some psychological peculiarities such as neuroticism of the person, accentuation of a character, peculiarities of the motivational and value-semantic sphere, negative behavior and other characteristics that can and should be identified with the help of appropriate psychodiagnostic techniques.</p>
<p>People with a high level of the development of social intelligence, as a rule, differ in the ability to implement successful communication. Such individuals are characterized by contact, openness, tact, benevolence and cordiality, aspiration for psychological closeness in the process of communication. A high level of social intelligence is associated with a great interest in social problems, with the need to influence others, which is often combined with highly developed organizational skills. People with a high level of the development of social intelligence, as a rule, have a clear interest in knowing themselves, the ability to reflect other people and so on.</p>
<p>A high level of the development of social intelligence to a greater extent determines the success of the adaptation of subjects in cases of recruitment, rather than a high level of the development of so called general intelligence. People with high level of social intelligence usually quite easily adapt in the team, contribute to maintaining an optimal psychological climate, show more interest, demonstrate intelligence and ingenuity in their work.</p>
<p>Persons with a low level of the development of social intelligence have the considerable difficulties in understanding and predicting the behavior of other people, which greatly complicate interpersonal interaction and reduces the possibilities of social adaptation. The low level of social intelligence is usually compensated to a large extent by other psychological peculiarities of the person: developed empathy, certain features of the character, style of communication, communicative skills, which, in turn, can be adjusted in the process of active social and psychological training.</p>
<p>Consequently, on the one hand, social intelligence is considered as a cognitive ability, which provides a successful subject-subject interaction. On the other hand, the actualization of social intelligence is primarily due to life skills and personal experience, with the ability to predict the behavior of other people. As socio-psychological factors that determine the development of social intelligence, consider, first of all, the competence of the behavior, understanding of sociopsychological aspects of life and a reflective attitude towards himself/herself.</p>
<p>Somewhat new approach to the problem of the structure of social intelligence is the emphasis on communicative-personal potential, which some scholars regard as a structural component of social intelligence. Communicative-personal potential, in turn, is understood as a complex of properties, features and characteristics that greatly facilitate or complicate the communicative process, on the basis of which such integrated communicative properties as psychological contact and communicative compatibility are formed.</p>
<p>Thus, social intelligence is largely determined by the nervous and mental state of the person, by different social factors of the environment, the level of adequacy and the success of the implementation of social interaction.</p>
<p>A variety of characteristics directly related to the social intelligence of the person, reflects its diverse peculiarities. At the same time, in defining these characteristics that predetermine the development of social intelligence, there are a number of common points. First of all, they are interpreted as the ability, therefore, directly interrelated with certain activities. Secondly, the subject of these abilities is the possibility of the person to establish connections between events in which actors are other people. Thirdly, in whatever context social intellect was described in scientific theories and concepts, it is in any case presented as a rather complex structural formation consisting of different abilities and possibilities. Also, the accuracy of the understanding of other people, the adequacy of interpretation, prediction and reflection are the main indicators of the presence or absence of the person's ability to solve tasks in order to establish the relationship between events in the subject-subject communication and interaction.</p>

Описано эмпирическое исследование, в котором принимали участие педагоги и директора дошкольных учебных заведений разных регионов Украины. Доказано, что у респондентов всех групп выявлены преимущественно «средние» показатели способностей к пониманию значений невербальной экспрессии и смысла высказывания в зависимости от социального контекста. Это может быть связано с тем, что данные способности формируются в непосредственном процессе общения и во многом зависят от условий жизнедеятельности субъектов, в первую очередь -от условий их профессиональной деятельности, средств и способов её выполнения.Ключевые слова: социальный интеллект, когниции, метакогниции, метаинтеллектуальная активность, технический интеллект, художественный интеллект, информационный интеллект.
