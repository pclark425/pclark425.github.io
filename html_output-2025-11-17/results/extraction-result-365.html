                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1\% to 15.8\%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.</p>

<p>JARVIS: A Neuro-Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Framework for Conversational Embodied Agents
2 Sep 2025B1452FDA7304632CECB59CCB15C382D6arXiv:2208.13266v4[cs.AI]
Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain.To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents.First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations.Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task-and action-level common sense.Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1% to 15.8%).Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings.Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge 1 .</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>A long-term goal of embodied AI research is to build an intelligent agent capable of communicating with humans in natural language, perceiving the environment, and completing real-life tasks.Such an agent can autonomously execute tasks such as household chores, or follow a human commander to work in dangerous environments.Figure 1 demonstrates an example of dialog-based embodied tasks: the agent communicates with the human commander and completes a complicated task "making a sandwich", which requires reasoning about dialog and visual environment, and procedural planning of a series of sub-goals.</p>
<p>Although end-to-end deep learning models have extensively shown their effectiveness in various tasks such as image recognition (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021;He et al., 2017) and natural language understanding and generation (Lewis et al., 2020;Dathathri et al., 2020), they achieved little success on dialog-based embodied navigation and task completion with high task complexity and scarce training data due to an enormous action space (Padmakumar et al., 2021).In particular, they often fail to reason about the entailed logistics when connecting natural language guidance with visual observations, and plan efficiently in the huge action space, leading to ill-advised behaviors under unseen environments.Conventionally, symbolic systems equipped with commonsense knowledge are more conducive to emulating humanlike decision-makings that are more credible and interpretable.Both connectionism and symbolism have their advantages, and connecting both worlds would cultivate the development of conversational embodied agents.</p>
<p>To this end, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework towards modular, generalizable, and interpretable embodied agents that can execute dialogbased embodied tasks such as household chores.First, to understand free-form dialogs, a large language model (LLM) is applied to extract task-relevant information from human guidance and produce actionable sub-goals for completing the task (e.g., the sub-goals 1.1, 1.2,...,3.6 in Figure 1).During the process, a semantic world representation of the house environment and object states is actively built from raw visual observations as the agent walks in the house.Given the initial sub-goal sequence and the semantic world representation being built, we design a symbolic reasoning module to generate executable actions based on task-level and action-level common sense.</p>
<p>We evaluate our JARVIS framework on three different levels of dialog-based embodied task execution on the TEACh dataset (Padmakumar et al., 2021), including Execution from Dialogue History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialogue (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC).Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across all three settings.In a more realistic few-shot setting where available expert demonstrations are limited for training, we show our framework can learn and adapt well to unseen environments.Meanwhile, we also systematically analyze the modular structure of JARVIS in a variety of comparative studies.Our contributions are as follows:</p>
<p>• We propose a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework blending the two worlds of connectionism and symbolism for conversational embodied agents.The neural modules convert dialog and visual observations into symbolic information, and the symbolic modules integrate sub-goals and semantic maps into actions based on task-level and action-level common sense.</p>
<p>• Our framework is modular and can be adapted to different levels of conversational embodied tasks, including EDH, TfD, and TATC.It consistently achieves the SOTA performance across all three tasks, with great generalization ability in new environments.</p>
<p>• We systematically study the essential factors that affect the task performance, and demonstrate that our framework can be generalized to few-shot learning scenarios when available training instances are limited.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Embodied AI Tasks Embodied agents capable of navigation and interaction have been long studied in AI, with early work focusing on goal-directed navigation in indoor and outdoor environments (Zhu et al., 2017;Yang et al., 2019;Kim et al., 2006).More recently, research has shifted toward language-grounded agents.Vision-and-Language Navigation (Anderson et al., 2018;Ku et al., 2020;Zhu et al., 2020a;Chen et al., 2019;Qi et al., 2020;Vasudevan et al., 2021;He et al., 2021;Gu et al., 2022) explores how agents follow natural language instructions to reach target locations, while Vision-and-Dialog Navigation (Thomason et al., 2019;Banerjee et al., 2020;Nguyen et al., 2019;Nguyen and Daumé III, 2019) incorporates real-time dialogue for guidance.Beyond navigation, recent efforts (Shridhar et al., 2020;Misra et al., 2018;Gordon et al., 2018) introduce interactive task completion involving both navigation and object manipulation.Dialog-based embodied tasks (Padmakumar et al., 2021;Narayan-Chen et al., 2019) further align with real-world settings, enabling agents to collaborate with humans through conversation.Our work builds on this line, aiming to develop a conversational agent for complex household tasks.</p>
<p>Vision-and-Language Navigation and Task Completion Prior work in embodied AI has explored vision-and-language navigation (Wang et al., 2019;Hong et al., 2021;Tan et al., 2019;Fried et al., 2018;Guhur et al., 2021;Chen et al., 2021a;Gu et al., 2022), vision-anddialog navigation (Wang et al., 2020;Zhu et al., 2020b;Kim et al., 2021), and task-oriented</p>

<p>Step 0.1: Fine-tune LLM Figure 2: An overview of our JARVIS framework.The fine-tuned language planning model takes dialogue and previous sub-goals G 0:t−1 as input and produces the future subgoals G t:T (Section 3).G t:T will be further examined by our Task-Level Common Sense model and converted to more reasonable and detailed future sub-goals G ′ t:T .Meanwhile, the Visual Semantic module actively updates the semantic world representations (Section 3).If the object is found in the world representation, the next action is determined by the Fast Marching method.If not, the Goal Transformer will generate the next action.The next action a t+1 ∈ A will be post-processed by the Action-Level Common Sense model.object navigation (Ramrakhya et al., 2022).Vision-and-language task completion has also gained attention (Pashevich et al., 2021;Min et al., 2022;Blukis et al., 2021;Song et al., 2022), with early methods like Shridhar et al. (2020) using LSTMs for multi-modal fusion, and Pashevich et al. (2021) introducing transformers for improved temporal modeling.Modular approaches further decompose tasks: Blukis et al. (2021) use semantic voxel grids with hierarchical controllers, and Min et al. (2022) integrate semantic policies for fine-grained object search.However, these systems are designed for structured, instruction-following tasks and often struggle with the ambiguity and complexity of dialog-based scenarios.In contrast, our approach extracts task-relevant information directly from free-form dialogue and performs neuro-symbolic reasoning to generalize across diverse dialog-based embodied tasks.</p>
<p>Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning While neural models have achieved great success across vision and language tasks (He et al., 2017;Devlin et al., 2019;He et al., 2016;Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), they often lack interpretability and reasoning ability in complex, multi-modal settings.Neuro-symbolic methods address this by combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning (Mao et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2021b;Gupta et al., 2020;Hudson and Manning, 2019;Sakaguchi et al., 2021).For example, Mao et al. (2019) introduce a symbolic program generator for visual question answering, and Chen et al. (2021b) extend it to video reasoning.In dialog-based household tasks, neural models struggle to integrate diverse inputs and infer correct actions (Padmakumar et al., 2021).To address this, we propose a modular neuro-symbolic framework that converts multi-modal observations into symbolic representations and applies commonsense reasoning for robust task execution.</p>

<p>We study dialogue-based embodied agents, where a Follower agent must interpret natural language instructions from a Commander (a human or another agent) to complete longhorizon tasks in a visual environment.Each task begins from an initial state s i ∈ S and proceeds through multi-turn dialogue D = {(p i , u i )}, where p i ∈ {Commander, Follower} indicates the speaker and u i is the utterance.At each timestep t, the Follower receives a visual observation v t and executes an action a t ∈ A : S t → S t+1 , aiming to reach a goal state s f ∈ S.</p>
<p>Tasks often involve intermediate sub-goals (e.g., "Find bread", "Cook egg") under a high-level goal (e.g., "Make breakfast").The Commander has oracle access to task and environment details, while the Follower has only egocentric perception and can request clarification during the dialogue.</p>
<p>Following Padmakumar et al. (2021), we consider three settings: in Execution from Dialog History (EDH), the agent completes an unfinished task given past dialogue and partial trajectory; in Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), the agent reconstructs a full action sequence from complete dialogue; and in Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC), the agent collaborates interactively with a Commander to complete the task.Our proposed JARVIS framework is designed to handle all three scenarios.</p>
<p>Proposed Methods</p>
<p>Our JARVIS framework (as shown in Figure 2) consists of a Language Planning module, a Visual Semantic module, and a Symbolic Reasoning module.Specifically, the Language Planning module utilizes a pre-trained large language model to process free-form language input and produces procedural sub-goals of the task.In the Visual Semantic module, we use a semantic segmentation model, a depth prediction model, and the SLAM algorithm to transform raw visual observations into a more logistic form -semantic maps containing spatial relationships and states of the objects.Finally, in the Symbolic Reasoning module, we utilize task-level and action-level commonsense knowledge to reason about transferred symbolic vision-and-language information and generate actions, and a Goal Transformer is trained to deal with uncertainty by directly producing actions when no relevant information can be retrieved from the visual symbolic representations.Below we introduce our methods in detail; please refer to Appendix A for more implementation details and Appendix B for our notation table.</p>
<p>Language Understanding and Planning The language commands in dialog-based embodied tasks are free-form and high-level, and do not contain low-level procedural instructions.Therefore, it is essential to break a command like "can you make breakfast for me?" into sub-goals such as "Find bread", "Find knife", "Slice bread", "Cook egg", and then generate actions a i to complete the sub-goals sequentially.Large language models (LLMs) are shown to be capable of extracting actionable knowledge from learned world knowledge (Huang et al., 2022).In order to understand free-form instructions and generate the sub-goal sequence for action planning, we leverage an LLM, the pre-trained BART (Lewis et al., 2020) model, to process dialog and action, and predict future sub-goal sequence G t:T for completing the whole task:
G t:T = LLM(D, G 0:t−1 ) (1)
where D = {(p i , u i )} is the collected set of user-utterance pairs and the previous sub-goal sequence G 0:t−1 = {g 0 , g 1 , g 2 , ..., g t−1 }.For sequential inputs G 0:t−1 , we encode the sub-goals into tokens and concatenate them as the input of the LLM model.For the ground-truth subgoal sequence G 0:T , we acquire it by a rule-based transformation from the action sequence A 0:T = {a 0 , a 1 , a 2 , ..., a t , ..., a T }.Concretely, we note that the actions can be categorized as navigations and interactions.For interactions, we coalesce the action and targeted object as the sub-goal.For example, if the embodied agent executes the action of picking up a cup, we will record the sub-goal "PickUp Cup".For navigation, we coalesce "Navigate" with the target object of the next interaction.Note that in cases like the Trajectory from History (TfD) task, where only dialog information D is given and other history information is missing, Equation 1 reduces to
G t:T = LLM(D) (2)
The BART model is trained with a reconstruction loss by computing the cross entropy between the generated future sub-goal sequence G t:T and the ground truth future sub-goal sequence G t:T .</p>
<p>Semantic World Representation</p>
<p>The visual input into a embodied agent is usually a series of RGB images V = {v 0 , v 1 , v 2 , ..., v T }.One conventional way in deep learning is to fuse the visual information with other modalities into a neural network (e.g., Transformers) for decision making, which, however, is uninterpretable and often suffers from poor generalization under data scarcity or high task complexity.Thus, we choose to transform visual input into a semantic representation similar to Blukis et al. (2021) and Min et al. ( 2022), which can be used for generalized symbolic reasoning later.At each step t, we first use a pre-trained Mask-RCNN model (He et al., 2017) for semantic segmentation, which we fine-tune on in-domain training data of the TEACh dataset, to get object types O t = {o 0 , o 1 , o 2 , ..., o k } and semantic mask M t = {m 0 , m 1 , m 2 , ..., m k } from egocentric RGB input v t at time stamp t.Then we use a Unet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) based depth prediction model as Blukis et al. (2021) to predict the depth of each pixel of the current egocentric image frame.Then, by combining the agent location and camera parameters, we transform the visual information into symbolic information: if a certain object exists in a 3D space, which we store in a 3D voxel.Then we further project the 3D voxel along the height dimension into a 2D map and obtain more concise 2D symbolic information.So far, we have transformed the egocentric RGB image into a series of 2D semantic maps, among which each map records a certain object's spatial location in the projected 2D plane.This symbolic environment information will be maintained and updated during the task completion process as in Figure .2.</p>
<p>Action Execution via Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning</p>
<p>Once the sub-goal sequence and semantic world representation are obtained, the agent must generate executable actions.However, these inputs may be noisy-sub-goals can be misordered or infeasible, and the semantic map may be incomplete.To address this, we introduce a Symbolic Reasoning module that leverages task-level and action-level commonsense logic to validate and refine execution plans.Sample logic predicates are listed in Table 5 (Appendix A).</p>
<p>Task-level reasoning enforces logical preconditions between sub-goals.For instance, the predicate P ick(agent, x) holds only if x is movable and the agent is free-handed.Sub-goals violating such constraints are revised-e.g., inserting "PickUp knife" before "Slice bread."This process assumes ideal execution and updates the agent's internal state accordingly.</p>
<p>Given validated sub-goals and the semantic map, we employ two action generation methods.If the target is visible, the Fast Marching Method (FMM) (Sethian, 1999) plans a path to the nearest empty space near the object.Otherwise, we use a Goal Transformer (GT), adapted from the Episodic Transformer (Pashevich et al., 2021), trained on TEACh data.GT predicts the next action from past observations V 0:t−1 , actions A 0:t−1 , and subgoals G 0:t−1 : ât = GT([V 0:t−1 , A 0:t−1 , G 0:t−1 ]).</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Action-level reasoning ensures that planned actions respect environmental constraints.For example, M ove(x, y) is valid only if a path exists from y to x.If constraints are violated, the agent adapts-e.g., executing a fallback policy like random exploration or navigating to the nearest feasible location.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>Dataset and Tasks</p>
<p>We evaluate JARVIS on the TEACh dataset (Padmakumar et al., 2021), which contains over 3,000 human-human interaction sessions involving household tasks.Each session begins from an initial state s i , proceeds through a multi-turn dialogue D between a Commander and a Follower, and ends in a final state s f after executing a reference action sequence A = {a 0 , a 1 , . . .}.These sessions form the basis for three evaluation settings: Execution from Dialog History (EDH) requires the agent to complete part of a task by predicting future actions A t:T , given the current state s i , dialogue history D, and previous actions A 0:t−1 .Success is determined by whether the final simulated state ŝ matches the reference s f .Given an initial instruction, the Follower communicates with the Commander to complete the task.The Commander has oracle access to environment metadata via three APIs: Pro-gressCheck, which lists task-relevant state differences; SelectOid, for querying object identifiers; and SearchObject, for locating objects.Following TEACh conventions, we implement JARVIS as two interacting agents: the Commander uses a Task-Level Commonsense Module to issue instructions, while the Follower executes actions and queries for help via an Action Execution Module.</p>
<p>Experimental Setup</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics We adopt Success Rate (SR), Goal-Condition Success (GC), and Trajectory Weighted Metrics (TLW) as evaluation metrics.Task success is a binary value, defined as 1 when all the expected state changes s f are presented in ŝ otherwise 0. SR is the ratio of success cases among all the instances.GC Success is a fraction of expected state changes in s f present in ŝ which is in (0, 1) and the GC success of the dataset is the average of all the trajectories.Trajectory weighted SR (TLW-SR) and GC (TLW-GC) are calculated based on a reference trajectory A R and a predicted action sequence A. The Table 4: Ablation studies on the EDH and TfD validation sets.Language: the agent directly teleports to the target goals generated by the language language planning module, thus trajectory length weighted metrics do not make sense here.Executor: the agent will use the ground truth sub-goals.Reasoning: the agent use both ground truth sub-goals and visual information.No Goal Transformer: the agent explore random place when it did not find the target object.</p>

as the weight of each instance.Following evaluation rules in TEACh (Padmakumar et al., 2021), the maximum number of action steps is 1,000 and the failure limit is 30.</p>
<p>Baseline We select Episodic Transformer (E.T.) (Padmakumar et al., 2021) as the baseline method.E.T. achieved SOTA performance on the TEACh dataset.It learns the action prediction based on the TEACh dataset using a ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) backbone to encode visual observations, two multi-modal transformer layers to fuse the embedded language, visual and action information, and output the executable action directly.</p>
<p>Main Results and Analysis</p>
<p>EDH We establish the state-of-the-art performance with a large margin over the baseline E.T.model.Our model achieves a higher relative performance than baselines on trajectoryweighted metrics, as shown in Table 1, suggesting that adding symbolism can also reduce navigation trajectory length.Besides, our framework has less performance gap between seen and unseen environments, showing better generalizability in new environments.We find that E.T. usually gets stuck in a corner or keeps repeatedly circling, while our model barely suffers from those issues, benefiting from neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning.</p>
<p>TfD Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics in TfD tasks, as shown in Table 1, which shows that JARVIS has better capability for task execution based on offline human-human conversation.Compared with EDH tasks, TfD tasks provide only the entire dialog history for the agent, which increases the difficulty and causes performance decreases in both models, while our JARVIS still outperforms the E.T. by a large margin, showing that the end-to-end model can not learn an effective and generalized strategy for long tasks completion providing only dialog information.</p>
<p>TATC We evaluate our framework on the TATC task with a Commander under three distinct constraint levels, simulating varied human assistance.The Commander is provided with: 1) only the current sub-goal; 2) the sub-goal and target object location; or 3) the sub-goal, location, and segmentation mask (the original TATC setting Padmakumar et al. (2021)).As shown in Table 2, JARVIS greatly outperforms the only open-source baseline, which fails on all TATC instances, highlighting the task's complexity for end-to-end methods.Furthermore, the Success Rate (SR) improves as the Commander is given more information, demonstrating that JARVIS effectively adapts its instructions to leverage all available knowledge.</p>
<p>Few-Shot Learning</p>
<p>Data scarcity has been known as a severe issue for deep neural methods.Especially, it is even more severe in language-involved embodied agent tasks since collecting training data is more expensive and time-consuming.Here we also conduct experiments in the few-shot setting, shown in Table 1.We randomly sample ten instances from each of the 12 types of household tasks in the TEACh dataset and train the language understanding and planning module and Goal Transfomer in the same way as the whole dataset setting.For E.T., we notice a significant performance drop on both EDH and TfD (e.g., 0 success rate in TfD tasks), since it overfits and can not learn effective and robust strategy.Since our framework breaks down the whole problem into smaller sub-problems and incorporates a solid symbolic commonsense reasoning module, it still has the ability to complete some complex tasks.This also indicates the importance of connecting connectionism and symbolism.</p>
<p>Unit Test of Individual Module</p>
<p>To analyze the performance gain of JARVIS, we conduct ablation studies on EDH and TfD tasks (Table 4).With ground truth perception and sub-goals, the Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning module achieves over 60% success in EDH, showing its effectiveness in action inference when provided accurate inputs.Replacing our language planner with ground truth yields greater improvement than replacing the executor, confirming the importance of symbolic reasoning in short-horizon tasks.</p>
<p>In longer TfD tasks, where a single sub-task failure leads to overall task failure, executor quality becomes the bottleneck.Here, replacing our executor with a teleport agent boosts performance more than using ground truth sub-goals.We also observe that our Goal Transformer improves trajectory-weighted success, indicating more efficient action planning.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This work studies how to teach embodied agents to execute dialog-based household tasks.We propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic framework that can incorporate the perceived neural information from multi-modalities and make decisions by symbolic commonsense reasoning.Our framework outperforms baselines by a large margin on three benchmarks of the TEACh (Padmakumar et al., 2021) dataset.We hope the methods and findings in this work shed light on the future development of neuro-symbolic embodied agents.</p>
<p>For the depth prediction model, we use an Unet-based model architecture same as Blukis et al. (2021).We get the images and ground truth depth frames from the training environments of TEACh dataset by AI2THOR Kolve et al. (2017) too.The range of depth prediction is from 0-5 meters, with an interval of 5 centimeters.Thus, the depth prediction problem is formulated as a classification problem over 50 classes on each pixel.During training, the loss function is a pixel-wise cross entropy loss:
L = CE(D predict , D gt )(6)
D gt stands for ground truth depth and D predict stands for predicted depth.During training, we follow the training details in Blukis et al. (2021) and using the batch size of 4, learning rate of 1×10 −4 .We train for 4 epochs and select by the best performance on data in unseen validation environments.</p>
<p>For semantic map construction, we first project the depth and semantic information predicted by learned models into a 3-D point cloud voxel, based on which we do vertical projection and build a semantic map of 240 × 240 for each object class and obstacle map.Each pixel represents a 5cm × 5cm patch in the simulator.</p>
<p>Goal Transformer</p>
<p>We collect one data sample from each EDH instance to train the Goal Transformer.The Goal Transformer takes the ground truth future sub-goals, history images, and history actions as inputs.We modify the prediction head of the Episodic Transformer to generate the actions in TEACh benchmarks Padmakumar et al. (2021).The Goal Transformer uses a language encoder to encode the future sub-goals, an image encoder (a pre-trained ResNet-50) to encode the current and history images, and an action embedding layer to encode the history actions in order.The model is trained to predict future actions autoregressively.</p>
<p>During training, we use the cross entropy loss between the ground truth future action A gt and predicted future action, as is A predict :
L = CE(A predict , A gt ) (7)
We follow the episodic transformer (E.T.) Pashevich et al. (2021) training details for the goal transformer model.The batch size is 8 and the training epoch is 20.We use the Adamw optimizer Loshchilov and Hutter (2017) with a learning rate of 1 × 10 −4 .</p>
<p>Symbolic Reasoning</p>
<p>Here, we provide some details of the implementations of the symbolic reasoning part.In task-level commonsense reasoning, we mainly check sub-goals from two perspectives: properties and causality.For properties, we need to check whether the action is affordable for the object.Therefore, we define some object collections depending on the properties, including movable, sliceable, openable, toggleable, and supportable.We can determine the unreasonable sub-goals by checking whether the planned object can afford the corresponding action.Then, causality means whether the sub-goal sequence obey the causal relations, like "a knife in hand" should always be the prerequisite of "slice a bread".To achieve this purpose, we define some rules of prerequisites and solutions according to commonsense, including placing the in-hand object before picking something, removing the placing action if nothing in hand, etc.To check the prerequisites, we assume all the previous sub-goals are completed and check if the agent's states matches the desired states.If the current sub-goal and the agent's state have causal conflict, we will use predefined solutions to deal with it.</p>
<p>For example, we will remove Place(agent, x) if there is nothing in the hand.We will add Pick(agent, "Knife") before Slice(agent, "Bread") if the agent do not grasp a knife in hand.</p>
<p>The whole process can be found in Algorithm 2. We consider both the semantic map and action states for action-level commonsense reasoning.In general, the agent updates the semantic map according to the observation of every step.We use the pixels change to detect whether the previous action success.To determine the next step, the agent must check whether the target object has been observed.If the target object has been observed, an FMM algorithm will plan a path to the closest feasible space.Otherwise, we will use the Goal Transformer to determine the next action for exploration.The action space of the Goal Transformer is all motion actions, including forwarding, backward, panning left, panning right, turning right, and turning left.During the movement to the target position, if the agent counterfaces unexpected collisions due to the error of the semantic map, the agent will save the current pose and the action from causing the collision.Then, the agent will first consider using the estimated motion action from Goal Transformer.But if the output action of GT is the same as the previous one leading to the collision, it will take a random motion action.After the agent reaches the target position, the agent will rotate and move around the place if the target object cannot be found in the current observation.If all attempts have been made and the object is still unobservable, the agent will consider it as a false detection situation and add the corresponding signal in the semantic map.The whole process can be found in Algorithm 3.</p>
<p>Task Completion Process of the JARVIS framework</p>
<p>We elaborate logic predicates for symbolic commonsense reasoning in Table 5.In Algorithm 1, we show the overall process when our JARVIS framework tries to finish an EDH or TfD tasks, which includes two algorithms to implement symbolic commonsense reasoning predicates: Algorithm.2 describes semantic map building process and language planning process, which including the task-level commonsense reasoning.Algorithm.3 describes the detailed action generation process with action-level commonsense reasoning.</p>
<p>Experiment Details for Two Agent Task Completion (TATC)</p>
<p>We experiment with our JARVIS framework on TATC task in three different settings, where there are different constraints about how much information will be available to the Commander for generating instructions.As in Table .2, in the first setting named full info.setting, the Commander has all information about the current subgoal, eg.pickup knife, target object location and the ground truth segmentation of the target object in the view.In this setting, same as the setting in Padmakumar et al. (2021), the Commander can specifically instructs where the Follower should interact to finish the current subgoal.In the second setting, we eliminate the ground truth segmentation of the target object from the information provided to the Commander.As a result, the Commander could still instruct the Follower to arrive near the target object but will not be able to explicitly tell the The lettuce is in the fridge.</p>
<p>Please now cook a slice of potato.

Where is the potato?The potato is in the fridge.Other frequent reasons for failure are 'Cannot place without holding any object,' 'Hand occupied when picking up,' and 'Knife not in hand when cutting.'These are because of the wrong judgment of whether the former 'Place' and 'Pickup' actions have succeeded.For example, the agent might think it has picked up the knife, while it failed to pick up in fact,</p>

Figure1: Dialogue-based embodied navigation and task completion.The Commander (often a human) issues a task such as making a sandwich, and the Follower agent completes the task while communicating with the Commander.Unlike the agent in finegrained instruction following tasks, the Follower agent needs to extract sub-goals from the free-form dialogue and execute actions in the visual environment.Note that the Follower agent can only navigate and interact with objects in an egocentric view and has no access to the map or other oracle information.</p>

<p>Trajectory from Dialog (TfD) tasks the agent with reconstructing the entire action sequence A 0:T from the complete dialogue D and initial state s i , aiming to reach the target final state s f .Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) models both Commander and Follower roles.</p>
<p>Figure 3: EDH example.(a) shows an example of our JARVIS in EDH task, where the inputs are dialog history and sub-goal history (converted from action history input).The inputs are first interpreted by the Language Parsing Module to become sub-goals.Then, our Symbolic Reasoning Module will generate action predictions.The predicted actions will change the follower's egocentric views and the semantic map will be built up and completed gradually.} m 1 shows the agent is opening the fridge } m 2 shows the agent has placed the knife and navigate back to the fridge.} m 3 shows the agent is picking up the potato.(b) is an example demonstrating a typical way of how Episodic Transformer fails on EDH task.In this case, the E.T. model predicts "Forward" repetitively even facing the wall, therefore stuck at the current position.</p>

Appendix A. Implementation DetailsJARVIS takes advantage of both connectionism and symbolism.Here we first introduce the learning details of the deep learning modules in JARVIS, followed by the symbolic commonsense reasoning.Then we introduce the task completion process of the JARVIS framework, shown in the Algorithm 1.Learning ModulesHere we elaborate on the implementation details of the learning and symbolic reasoning modules in our framework, including language understanding and planning, semantic world representation, and goal transformer.Language Understanding and PlanningFor data collection of the EDH task, we collect one data sample from each EDH instance.In each data sample, the input contains a history dialogue between the commander and the follower and history sub-goals that have been executed, and the output is the future subgoals.We create special tokens &lt; COM &gt;, &lt; FOL &gt; to concatenate different utterances of the dialogue, and &lt; HIS &gt; to concatenate the history sub-goals and dialogue.Note that the history sub-goals are not available in the training set, so we translate the provided history actions into history sub-goals by excluding all the navigation.For the TfD task, we collect the whole dialog sequence and the whole ground truth future sub-goal sequence from each TfD instance as input and output for training.We collect the same data scheme from seen validation EDH/TfD instances for validation.We adapt the pre-trained BART-LARGELewis et al. (2020)model and fine-tune the BART model separately on the collected training data for each task.We follow the HuggingfaceWolf et al. (2019)implementation for the BART model as well as the tokenizer.The BART model is finetuned for 50 epochs and selected by the best validation performance.We use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5 × 10 −5 .The maximum length of generated subgoal is set to 300, and the beam size in beam search is set to 4.Semantic World RepresentationFor Mask-RCNN He et al. (2017), we use a model pre-trained onMSCOCO Lin et al. (2014)data and fine-tune it on collected data from training environments of TEACh dataset.We get the ground truth data samples from the provided interface of AI2THOR.During training, the loss function is as follows:Where L cls is the cross entropy loss of object class prediction.L box is a robust L 1 loss of bounding box regression.And L mask is the average binary cross entropy loss of mask prediction, where the neural network predict a binary mask for each object class.FollowingShridhar et al. (2021), we use the batch size of 4 and learning rate of 5 × 10 −3 for Mask-RCNN training.We train for 10 epochs and select by the best performance on data in unseen validation environments.follower the ground truth location of the target object in the view.In the third setting, we further restrict the target object location (goal location) from the information to the Commander and thus the instruction generated from the Commander will not include any ground truth information about where the target object is.Appendix B. Notation TableWe describe the notation used in this paper in Table.6.Appendix C. Case StudyIn the EDH task, the agent can process history dialog and execute sub-goals, and plan future actions to complete the task.With well-designed Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning module, the agent can efficiently navigate to the target location and execute planned actions, as shown in Figure.3. In the TfD task, the agent is able to understand the dialog and break down the whole task into future sub-goals, and execute it correctly, as in Figure.4. We also show an example of one classic error of episodic transformer in 3(b).The E.T. model will repetitively predict "Forward" when facing the wall, or "Pickup Place" in some other cases.This is because the agent can not correctly and robustly infer correct actions from all the input information.Figure.5 illustrates how our JARVIS framework can be adapted to the TATC task under the setting that the commander can acquire state changes needed to be complete,   Where is the cloth Commander FollowerSemantic map in progress:Figure4: Successful TfD example from our JARVIS framework.According to the dialog, the language planner estimate four future sub-goals: ("Navigate cloth", "PickUp Cloth", "Navigate Bathtub", "Place Bathtub").Then with the symbolic reasoning module, interaction and navigation actions are predicted.} m 1 shows the agent is finding the cloth.} m 2 shows the agent has picked up the cloth and then found the bathtub.} m 3 shows the agent can correctly put the cloth on the bathtub.Table7: Average action failure rate on validation set for EDH, TfD and TATC tasks.When the time of action failure in a session reaches 30, the session will be forced to end, causing a task failure.The action failure exist widely in sessions.Failure Mode EDH(%) TfD(%) TATC(%)No action failure 4.0 17.0 5.8 Action failures exist but are less than 30 times 78.8 79.9 69.0 Action failures reaches 30 times 17.2 3.1 25.2Appendix D. Error AnalysisAccording to Table.7, we find that all failed tasks include at least one action failure.For the shorter tasks, like EDH, the dominant situation is "Action failures are less than 30 times", while the longer tasks, like TfD and TATC, include even more action failures due to more sub-goals.To this aspect, we further analyze the action failure reason as in Table.8, which shows a quantitative analysis of the failed actions categories in the validation set.We randomly sampled 50 failure episodes in both seen and unseen splits and computed the average ratio of each action failure category in all the failed actions.From Table.8, we notice that 'Blocked when moving' is the most frequent cause of failure action in all the three tasks, EDH, TfD, and TATC.The main reason is that errors in depth prediction cause semantic obstacle map errors.Besides, 'Too far to interact' is also mainly caused by wrongly predicting the 3D location of an object.To solve this, we need to improve the precision of the depth prediction model or design a more delicate and robust algorithm to update the semantic map.The second frequent failure action is 'Object not found at the location or cannot be picked up,' which could be due to the wrong predicted location of an object by Mask R-CNN.Moreover, it is also likely caused by the situation where the 1 : Navigate to Faucet @ (3, 5.25, 270°)), then uses ground-truth segmentation to compute an interaction target (e.g.} m 3 : Pickup Mug @ (0.7, 0.37)).Steps 1-6 repeat for Faucet, Sink, Mug, Sink, Faucet, and Mug; step 7 pours water on the Plant @ (0.55, 0.6).After each sub-goal the follower executes in its egocentric view and reports completion.target object is inside a receptacle that needs to be open first, as inFigure. 6(a).'Invalid position for placing the held object' is also mainly caused by the segmentation error of Mask  which causes the latter 'Knife not in hand when cutting.' We need to further refine our Symbolic Commonsense Reasoning Action module for these cases.Instead of the failed actions, a miss-recognized object will also lead to an unsuccessful task.As in Figure6(b), the tomato is falsely recognized as an apple, which leads to a failure when the target object is about "Tomato".Additionally, the false sub-goals estimations also contribute to the failures in task completion.In Section 4, we quantitatively analyze the performance of the Language Planning Module in the JARVIS framework.Here, we show a typical qualitative error result in Fig.7.According to the dialog, the ground truth future sub-goals need the follower to put all potatoes on the plate.However, the estimated sub-goals indicate one slice of potatoes and tomatoes will be put on the plate, which will cause the unsatisfied state changes.
