                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</p>

Robix: A Unified Model for Robot Interaction, Reasoning and Planning
September 12, 2025DB5CB38B9778FF4CE460B505C1816AADarXiv:2509.01106v2[cs.AI]Okay. Proactive Dialogue Monitoring &amp; Replanning Realtime Interruption Memorization &amp; Verification Task Status Verification Human Instruction Embodied Reasoning Low-level Action Robot Response Visual Observation
We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture.Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework.Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution.At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy:(1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence.Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The goal of generalist robots is to assist humans in diverse daily tasks within open, dynamic environments.Realizing this vision requires more than executing isolated commands-it demands the ability to engage in natural human interaction and reason through complex, long-horizon tasks.For example, when cleaning a dining table, a robot must not only recognize dishes and utensils, but also interpret nuanced instructions such as "only clear the plates if people are finished eating", respond to corrections like "leave that glass", and adapt to novel scenarios such as properly sorting stacked tableware.To meet these requirements, a general-purpose robot system should adopt a hierarchical architecture in which a high-level cognitive layer handles complex multimodal reasoning, adaptive task planning, and natural human-robot interaction, while a Human: I'm hungry.Please put the highest-calorie food on the table into the plastic box and fetch me a drink.</p>
<p>Human: I'm allergic to caffeine.</p>
<p>Think: The user requests the highestcalorie food along with a drink.There are various types of food and drinks, including hamburger, drumstick, coke, sprite, orange juice, and coffee.Usually, a hamburger contains more calories than a drumstick, and coke is a suitable pairing with hamburger… Action: put the hamburger into the white plastic box</p>
<p>Response: Okay.</p>
<p>Think: I've successfully placed the hamburger into the white plastic box.</p>
<p>The user also wants a drink, so next I'll put the coke into the plastic box as well.</p>
<p>Action: put the coke into the white plastic box</p>
<p>Think: I'm currently holding the coke with the left gripper, but the user just informed me that they're allergic to caffeine.Since coke typically contains caffeine, I need to place it back on the table and select a caffeine-free drink instead.</p>
<p>Action: place the coke back on the table</p>
<p>Response: Got it.</p>
<p>Think: …Since the user is allergic to caffeine, and both coke and coffee contain caffeine, the remaining options are orange juice and Sprite, which are typically caffeine-free.</p>
<p>Orange juice is generally considered the healthier choice, so I will offer that to the user… Action: put the orange juice into the white plastic box</p>
<p>Human: Next, tidy up the entire table.Throw all the trash into the trash bin, including the caffeinated drinks.Put everything else into the white plastic box.</p>
<p>Think: I've successfully placed the highest-calorie hamburger and the caffeine-free orange juice into the plastic box, completing the user's task instruction.Next, I can ask the user if there's anything else they need me to do.</p>
<p>Think: The user asked me to throw away all trash and caffeinated drinks, and place the remaining items into the plastic box.I will start by discarding the coke and coffee, then throw away common trash items like napkins and paper cups.Finally, I'll place the utensils into the plastic box...</p>
<p>Action: put the coke into the rubbish bin</p>
<p>Think: I've successfully thrown the napkin into the trash bin.Next, I can start tidying up the utensils.There is a fork and a knife on the plate.To make the subsequent steps easier, I need to put them away first.I will begin by placing the fork, which is on top, into the plastic box.</p>
<p>Think: I noticed that the fork is still on the table, indicating that the previous action failed.I should try again and place the fork into the plastic box first.</p>
<p>Action: put the fork into the white plastic box</p>
<p>Think: The fork has already been successfully placed into the plastic box.There is still a knife on the plate, so next I will place the knife into the plastic box as well.</p>
<p>Think: …Currently, there is still a chicken drumstick on a green plate and a bottle of sprite on the table.The drumstick is food and typically should either be packed or discarded, but the user hasn't specified.I should ask the user whether the drumstick should be thrown away as trash.</p>
<p>Think: The user asked me to throw away the chicken drumstick on the green plate.So next, I should discard the drumstick into the trash bin, and then place the plate into the plastic box.</p>
<p>Action: put the chicken drumstick into the rubbish bin Think: All items on the table have been cleared.As instructed by the user, the caffeinated drinks and trash have been thrown into the bin, the drumstick was also discarded, and all other items have been placed into the plastic box.The task is now complete.I can ask the user if there's anything…</p>
<p>Response: I've cleaned up the table as you instructed.Is there anything else you'd like me to do?</p>

<p>Response: Alright, I'll clean it up right away.low-level controller layer executes the atomic motor actions issued by the high-level layer.This division of responsibilities allows the robot to reason at a macro level while acting at a micro level, enabling human-like adaptability in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Existing hierarchical approaches typically employ large language models (LLMs) or vision language models (VLMs) as the high-level cognitive layer for task planning, which decompose long-horizon tasks into executable subtasks for the low-level controller [1,8,17,29,53,60,84,88].However, these methods focus solely on task decomposition, overlooking human-robot interaction and embodied reasoning, which are essential for general-purpose robotic systems.Taking one step further, recent work [11] constructs modular pipelines that combine reasoning, planning, and interaction through hand-designed workflows.While workflow-based systems are easy to develop, their inflexibility and brittleness remain notable limitations-rooted primarily in rigid modularization and over-reliance on hand-engineered designs.In this work, we introduce Robix, a unified high-level cognitive layer that seamlessly integrates reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single model.Unlike modular frameworks, Robix adopts an end-to-end vision-language architecture natively designed for interactive task execution.At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and formulates interactive task execution as a unified reasoning-action sequence, effectively functioning as the "brain" of a generalist robot system.Figure 1 illustrates Robix in an interactive table-organization task, demonstrating flexible capabilities such as understanding complex instructions, handling real-time interruptions, monitoring task progress, and engaging in proactive dialogue to clarify ambiguous commands or infer user intent.</p>
<p>Modeling such complex interactive task execution within a single VLM is challenging.Although general VLMs have achieved strong performance in digital domains, extending them to physical robots is far more demanding: robots must continuously perceive and act in dynamic environments, interpret ambiguous instructions, adapt to real-time feedback, and make sequential decisions under strict physical and temporal constraints.Addressing this gap requires overcoming two major limitations of existing models: (1) limited embodied reasoning-the ability to ground objects and spatial concepts in the physical world and integrate these signals for adaptive planning and task-centric reasoning [64]; (2) lack of flexible multimodal interaction-hindered both by its inherent complexity and by the scarcity of corresponding training data.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Robix is trained with a three-stage strategy:</p>
<p>• Continued pretraining on general VLMs to enhance foundational embodied reasoning capabilities.We curate a large-scale dataset covering various robot-relevant tasks, such as 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning, enabling the model to strengthen its grounded planning and reasoning abilities.</p>
<p>• Supervised finetuning to endow the model with complex interactive capabilities.We employ comprehensive data synthesis to incorporate chain-of-thought reasoning and model interactive task execution as a unified reasoning-action sequence.The synthetic data covers a full spectrum of capabilities, including complex instruction understanding, long-horizon planning, task status monitoring, dynamic replanning, real-time interruption handling, and human-robot dialogue.</p>
<p>• Reinforcement learning to further refine the reasoning ability and strengthen the consistency between reasoning and actions, particularly in long-horizon, interactive tasks.</p>
<p>We comprehensively evaluate Robix on embodied reasoning and interactive task execution.Across 31 benchmarks covering robot-relevant abilities (3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, task-centric reasoning) and general-purpose skills (general VQA, multimodal reasoning), Robix achieves obvious improvements on most robot-relevant tasks while maintaining strong general-purpose performance.On a curated interactive-task benchmark spanning in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings and diverse instruction types (multi-stage, constrained, open-ended, invalid, interrupted), Robix consistently outperforms commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro)and open-source (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL,RoboBrain-2.0)baselines; notably, Robix-32B exceeds the strongest baseline, Gemini-2.5-Pro,by 3.0 and 11.8 percentage points in accuracy on the two OOD settings.We further assess five real-world scenarios-table bussing, grocery shopping, checkout packing, tableware organization &amp; shipment, and dietary filtering-using task-progress metrics in a hierarchical robot system under two low-level control modes (human teleoperation and an automatic VLA controller).Across Please give me the highest-calorie food and fetch a bottle of drink.</p>

<p>Illustration of the hierarchical robot system.Robix serves as the high-level cognitive layer, interpreting tasks and reasoning over multimodal inputs to generate language responses and action plans.The low-level controller layer executes the corresponding atomic commands, enabling interaction with both humans and the physical environment.</p>
<p>both modes, Robix-32B surpasses Gemini-2.5-Proby 1.6 and 4.3 percentage points on task progress and markedly outperforms all other baselines by 28.1 ∼ 64.6 percentage points.Our experiments demonstrate that Robix couples strong embodied reasoning with flexible high-level planning and interaction, advancing toward general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p>
<p>We summarize Robix's main features as follows:</p>
<p>• Unified model.Robix is a single vision-language model that unifies robot reasoning, task planning, and human-robot interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally in an end-to-end manner.</p>
<p>• Flexible interaction.Within this unified framework, Robix supports proactive dialogue to clarify ambiguity or infer user intent, real-time interruption handling that seamlessly incorporates feedback, and context-aware commonsense reasoning for complex, open-ended tasks.</p>
<p>• Robust performance.We assess Robix in two setups: (i) on a curated interactive-task benchmark covering both in-and out-of-distribution scenarios with diverse instruction types, and (ii) across five real-world scenarios in a hierarchical robot system with both human teleoperation and an automatic VLA model as the low-level controller.These evaluations demonstrate that Robix consistently delivers strong performance across all settings.</p>
<p>The Robix Model</p>
<p>Figure 2 illustrates the hierarchical robot system, where Robix serves as the high-level cognitive layer responsible for planning and interaction.The low-level controller-typically implemented as a vision-languageaction (VLA) model-executes the atomic commands generated by Robix, enabling the robot system to directly interact with the physical environment.</p>
<p>At each iteration, Robix directly processes visual observations from robot-mounted cameras and user utterances, selectively producing atomic action commands for the low-level controller and appropriate verbal responses.This iterative reasoning-action loop allows Robix to perform deliberate reasoning and generate contextually grounded behaviors.The sequential decision-making process can be formally modeled as:
P t n , a n , r n (o 1 , u 1 , t 1 , a 1 , r 1 ), . . . , [(o n−i , u n−i , t n−i , a n−i , r n−i )] N i=1 , o n , u n .(1)
Here, each step involves predicting the next thought t n , action a n , and optional verbal response r n , conditioned on the current observations o n , optional user instruction u n and the interaction history.These intermediate</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 1, Robix unifies the entire interactive task execution process-including instruction understanding, task planning, task status monitoring, real-time user feedback integration, proactive dialogue, and dynamic replanning-through grounded, multi-faceted reasoning.Unlike prior modular frameworks for task planning or human-robot interaction, Robix offers significantly greater flexibility, allowing the robot to adapt its behavior in real time to dynamic environmental changes, thereby achieving human-like adaptability.</p>
<p>Training Recipe</p>
<p>We develop Robix-7B and Robix-32B by continually training Qwen2.5-VL-7B and 32B [3] on approximately 200 billion tokens using a three-stage training pipeline.First, we perform continued pretraining to enhance the model's capabilities in robot-relevant perception and reasoning (Section 3.1).Next, we apply supervised finetuning to model the complex human-robot interaction and long-horizon task planning as a sequential decision-making process grounded in chain-of-thought reasoning (Section 3.2).Finally, we leverage reinforcement learning to further improve the embodied reasoning ability and enhance the alignment between reasoning and action in interactive long-horizon tasks (Section 3.3).</p>
<p>Continued Pretraining</p>
<p>A foundational capability of general-purpose embodied models is embodied reasoning-the ability to ground objects and spatial concepts in the physical world and integrate these signals for downstream robotic tasks [64].</p>
<p>Our objective is to develop a vision-language model with embodied reasoning at its core, capable of generalizing across diverse embodied scenarios while maintaining strong foundational multimodal understanding.To support this, we construct a large-scale pretraining corpus comprising 200 billion high-quality and diverse tokens, targeting both robot-relevant and general-purpose multimodal capabilities, as illustrated in Figure 3.</p>
<p>In particular, we emphasize 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning, while also incorporating general visual understanding, multimodal reasoning, and instruction tuning data.Below, we detail the data sources and task types used in our continued pretraining.), enabling the model to learn multimodal fusion and context-aware understanding grounded in visual cues.Together, these tasks significantly enhance the model's grounding abilities in both language-to-image and image-to-language directions, and improve its capacity for grounded planning in embodied settings.</p>
<p>Task-centric Reasoning.To directly strengthen the model's reasoning and planning abilities in embodied scenarios, we construct a large-scale embodied task-centric reasoning dataset based on publicly available robot and egocentric datasets, including AgiBot [6], BridgeData V2 [67], Droid [32], Egodex [27], RoboVQA [52], HoloAssist [70], and Ego4D [22].We curate over 5 million examples (about 10B tokens) targeting three key reasoning functions: (1) Task Status Verification-determining whether a task or subtask has been successfully completed;</p>
<p>(2) Action Affordance-assessing whether an action is feasible in the current context; (3) Next Action Prediction-identifying the most plausible next step to achieve the intended goal.To enrich the reasoning process, we further use Seed-1.5-VL-thinking[24] to generate step-by-step thought traces for our QA pairs via carefully designed prompts (details are shown in Section B).This thought-augmented supervision enables the model to learn deliberate, high-level decision-making in dynamic and open-ended environments.General Multimodal Understanding.To preserve and enhance broad vision-language understanding, we curate a large-scale dataset of over 50 million image-text pairs (over 80B tokens) that serve as the foundation for multimodal comprehension.We refine the instructions using Seed-1.5-VL[24] for quality filtering and ensure better alignment between instructions, images, and responses.This instruction-tuned dataset significantly improves the model's ability to follow open-world multimodal instructions and engage in multi-turn, grounded reasoning.</p>
<p>We adopt a two-stage training strategy leveraging the large-scale, diverse corpus described above.In stage 1, we continue pretraining Qwen2.5-VL[3] on the full dataset-comprising approximately 5% text-only data-updating all model parameters to enhance general multimodal and embodied reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>Training follows a full cosine learning rate schedule, starting at 1 × 10 −5 and decaying to 1 × 10 −6 , with linear warm-up over the first 10% of total steps.We use a sequence length of 32,768 tokens, with effective batch sizes of 1536× and 3008× the sequence length for the 7B and 32B models, respectively.In stage 2, we perform instruction tuning on curated instruction-following data to align the model with multimodal prompts and improve instruction adherence.The vision encoder is frozen during this phase, while all other parameters remain trainable.The learning rate is fixed to the final value from Stage 1 (1 × 10 −6 ) and remains constant throughout Stage 2. Optimizer states are carried over from Stage 1, and no additional warm-up is used.Both stages are optimized using AdamW [33,41], with β 1 = 0.9, β 2 = 0.99, and a weight decay of 0.01.Training on this diverse and comprehensive corpus significantly improves the model's embodied reasoning, multimodal understanding, and its ability to generalize to long-horizon, interactive tasks in real-world settings.</p>
<p>Supervised Finetuning</p>
<p>The supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage adapts the preceding pretrained model into the robot's high-level cognitive module while retaining its original capabilities.A central challenge lies in the scarcity of largescale, multi-turn egocentric-vision datasets that integrate human-robot interaction with task planning.</p>
<p>To address this, we design a data-synthesis pipeline that transforms existing task-planning datasets into human-robot interaction trajectories.Two properties of the resulting SFT data are crucial for out-ofdistribution generalization: (1) diverse human-robot interactions and (2) high-quality reasoning traces.The overall pipeline is shown in Figure 4; the interaction and reasoning synthesis modules are detailed below.</p>
<p>Interaction Synthesis</p>
<p>The interaction synthesis is mainly based on two data sources:</p>
<p>• Teleoperated Robot Demonstrations.We utilize both internal teleoperation data (previously used to train GR-3 [7]) and the open-source AGIBot dataset [6].Each contains episodes of robots performing diverse tasks (e.g., table bussing, breakfast preparation).Human annotators segment each demonstration into clips, where each clip corresponds to an atomic action-e.g., "put the tissue into the trash bin".</p>
<p>• Simulation &amp; AIGC Data.We programmatically generate diverse object organization scenarios in our in-house simulator, and further employ state-of-the-art text-to-image models [21] to synthesize complex Simulation &amp; AIGC Data Labeled Teleoperation Data</p>

</ol>
<p>Sure.I will only clear the trash.</p>
<p>Constrained Instruction</p>
<p>Clear the trash and leave the food on the table.</p>
<p>There is a plate of food, a plate and a to-go box.Building on the above sources, we define seven categories of human-robot interaction instructions and develop tailored data-synthesis strategies for each.Training on this dataset equips Robix with flexible interaction capabilities, such as complex instruction understanding, real-time interruption handling, and proactive dialogue.</p>
<p>Multi-Stage Instruction.Teleoperated trajectories are annotated with a task name (e.g., "clean up the table and pack the food").We select trajectories containing at least ten atomic actions and synthesize a corresponding user instruction from the task name, e.g., "The dining table is a mess.Please clean the table and pack the food on the plate."</p>
<p>Constrained Instruction.We partition each teleoperation trajectory into non-overlapping segments where feasible.For example, a table-bussing task can be decomposed into subtasks such as garbage collection, tableware collection, and food packing.Based on these subtasks, we synthesize tailored user instructions, e.g., "Clean up the table while leaving the food on the table" and "Remove the trash without moving other items".</p>
<p>Open-Ended Instruction.We generate random scenes in simulation and prompt state-of-the-art LLMs to produce open-ended, commonsense instructions conditioned on each scene (e.g., "Place the drink with the least sugar into the carton" for a scene containing Sprite, Coke, orange juice, and soda water).To include items currently not supported by the simulator (e.g., hamburgers, spaghetti, watermelons), we pair such instructions with images synthesized by advanced text-to-image models.Because current text-to-image models still struggle with instruction following and image quality, we apply automated and human-in-the-loop filtering, remaining only 10% of the original dataset after filtering.</p>
<p>Anytime Interruption.We curate a variety of user interruption utterances (e.g., "Stop!", "Hold on.I still need it", "Wait, put the fork into the sink first") and randomly inject them into task flows.Corresponding robot responses are then synthesized using timing-aware heuristics: if the interruption occurs before grasping, the robot halts or adjusts its plan; if it occurs after grasping, the robot returns the item to the table and replans.Such anytime interruption handling is critical for long-horizon tasks, as mid-task feedback and error correction substantially enhance system robustness.</p>
<p>Invalid Instruction.To mitigate hallucination and prevent robots from engaging in dangerous actions, we synthesize four types of invalid instructions as follows: (1) Instructions asking the robot to manipulate items that do not exist in the scenario; (2) Instructions requiring physically impossible actions, such as "Put the table into the rubbish bin"; (3) Instructions demanding abilities beyond the robot's current capabilities, e.g., "Open the coke for me"; (4) Unsafe or dangerous commands, e.g., "Throw the knife onto the sofa".For these invalid or illegal instructions, we design corresponding response strategies to enable the robot to refuse compliance with the user's requests.</p>
<p>Ambiguous Instruction.To enable our model to clarify ambiguous instructions, we construct scenes with multiple similar items (e.g., apple, orange, pear) and synthesize underspecified instructions(e.g., "Put a fruit into the basket").Training with these data enable the model to seek clarification when needed-a capability essential for robust robot systems.</p>
<p>Chat Instruction.We develop some heuristics to randomly insert short human-robot dialogue segments at context-appropriate times.For example, when the robot is collecting trash from the table, the user may ask "I want some fruit.What kind of fruit is on the table?".This type of instruction requires the robot to respond verbally rather than performing any physical manipulation.</p>
<p>Reasoning Synthesis</p>
<p>To incorporate chain-of-thought reasoning, we prompt state-of-the-art VLMs to generate high-quality reasoning traces emphasizing (1) scene understanding, (2) task status reflection, (3) long-term instruction following, and (4) next-step analysis.</p>
<p>• Scene understanding.This part of reasoning enables the robot to accurately identify task-relevant, operable objects in the current scene, with emphasis on those within the robot's field of view.</p>
<p>• Task status reflection.Robots should be capable of reflecting on their prior actions and repeating tasks when initial attempts fail.Furthermore, they need to identify key milestones in long-horizon tasks and proactively request human assistance upon encountering irrecoverable errors.This capability is also critical for handling user interruptions, as robots must maintain awareness of their current status to plan subsequent actions (e.g., tracking whether a gripper is holding an item).</p>
<p>• Long-term instruction following.This module is designed to help robot persist the initial goal and intermediate user instructions across long-horizon tasks, ensuring the primary objective is completed and mid-task instructions continue to guide actions many steps later (e.g., "After cleaning the table, grab me a drink from the fridge").</p>
<p>• Next-step analysis.In the final phase of reasoning, the robot should analyze potential actions for the next step when the overall task remains incomplete.This analysis include assessing target reachability and whether executing the action advances overall task completion.</p>
<p>Inspired by UI-TARS [50], we adopt ActRe [78] and Thought Bootstrapping [50] to synthesize high-quality reasoning traces.Unlike conventional LLM reasoning, robot reasoning must remain concise to support real-time interaction.Accordingly, we prompt Seed-1.5-VL to produce succinct traces (within 200 tokens).We also apply a model-based filtering pipeline to discard hallucinated or logically inconsistent reasoning.These high-quality, multi-faceted chain-of-thought traces enable Robix to execute robust long-horizon task planning with task-status monitoring and dynamic replanning.</p>
<p>Reinforcement Learning</p>
<p>Following the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage, the model exhibits promising agentic capabilities in adaptive task planning and natural human-robot interaction.However, several limitations in robot reasoning and planning persist, notably: (1) irrational reasoning, such as generating conflicting thoughts, lacking common sense, or partially disregarding user instructions; and (2) thought-action inconsistency, where the model's proposed plan diverges from its preceding thought in intent or content.For example, in a table-cleaning task, the SFT model correctly infers that a tissue left on the table should be discarded in a rubbish bin.Yet, in the subsequent plan, it incorrectly suggests handling a paper cup instead.These issues negatively impact the model's effectiveness in real-world task execution.</p>
<p>To mitigate these problems, we adopt reinforcement learning (RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) [23,54], to enhance both the reasoning capacity and the coherence between thought and action.Our approach is based on two core strategies: ( Reward Design for Thought-Action Consistency.To explicitly encourage alignment between the model's thought and action, we introduce a thought-action consistency reward in addition to standard rewards for output formatting and action accuracy.At each decision step, the model's generated thought and corresponding action are extracted and evaluated by an external LLM (Qwen-2.5-32B[74] in our experiments).This auxiliary reward model is prompted to assess whether the action is logically consistent with the preceding thought.A negative reward is given if the assessment indicates inconsistency.The system prompt of the reward model is listed in Section A.5.</p>
<p>To maximize the effectiveness of RL training, we also employ a data filtering procedure designed to retain only samples that can provide meaningful gradient information for GRPO.The key idea is to discard questions whose candidate answers exhibit low reward variance, as such samples contribute little to policy improvement.Specifically, for each question in the dataset, we generate multiple candidate answers using the SFT model and remove those with low variance in their rewards:
D new = (x n , y * n ) ∈ D Var R(y (i) n , y * n ) M i=1 &gt; τ, y (i) n ∼ π SFT (• | x n ) ,(2)
where D denotes the original dataset, R(y
(i)
n , y * n ) is the reward function assigning a scalar score to the i-th generated answer y (i) n based on the ground-truth y * n for question x n , and π SFT is the base policy for RL.The definitions of input x n and output y * n follow Equation (1): x n consists of the current observation, instruction, and trajectory, while y n comprises the model's thought, an optional action, and an optional robot response.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we set the number of samples M to 8 and the variance threshold τ to 0. All RL training is performed using the verl framework [55].</p>
<p>Through the combination of co-training with diverse reasoning data and targeted reward design, our reinforcement learning strategy substantially improves the model's generalization to novel tasks and enhances the consistency between reasoning and planning.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>We conduct extensive experiments to comprehensively evaluate the performance of Robix, focusing on the following key questions:</p>
<p>• Does Robix enhance fundamental embodied reasoning capabilities?</p>
<p>• Can Robix effectively model the full process of interactive task execution in an end-to-end manner?</p>
<p>• Does Robix generalize well to out-of-distribution tasks?</p>
<p>• How does the full robotic system perform when integrating Robix with a VLA model on real-world tasks?Table 1 Performance of Robix on public vision-language benchmarks compared to prior models.The left side shows Robix and state-of-the-art open-source baselines, while the right side presents closed-source large commercial models.The highest score in each benchmark is highlighted in bold within each group.</p>
<p>We first evaluate fundamental embodied reasoning capabilities of our model and baseline methods on public benchmarks (Section 4.1).Next, we assess the planning and interaction abilities of our model and baseline methods with both offline, pre-defined test sets (Section 4.2) and online robotic tasks (Section 4.3).</p>
<p>Fundamental Perception &amp; Reasoning Evaluation</p>
<p>We evaluate Robix after continued pretraining (denoted as Robix-Base) on a comprehensive set of public benchmarks against state-of-the-art multimodal models including Qwen-2.5-VL-7B&amp;32B[3], RoboBrain-2.0-32B[63], Cosmos-Reason1-7B [2], Gemini-2.5-Pro[64], OpenAI GPT-4o [30], Seed-1.5-VL and Seed-1.5-VL-Think[24].The evaluation spans (1) robotics-relevant embodied reasoning (3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, task-centric reasoning) and (2) general multimodal understanding and reasoning.Table 1 presents the detailed results.models Cosmos-Reason1-7B (64.0) and RoboBrain-32B (72.2), and exceed the best commercial baseline, Gemini-2.5-Pro,on 5 of 8 tasks.</p>
<p>Visual Grounding.We evaluate Robix's visual grounding capabilities on eight benchmarks covering both bounding-box and center-point tasks, including LVIS-MG [25], RefCOCO [80], VisualWebBench [39], Pixmo-Point [14], and Where2Place [81].Robix consistently outperforms its backbone across all benchmarks and surpasses state-of-the-art commercial models on most tasks.Notably, Robix-7B and Robix-32B improve the absolute F1 score on LVIS-MG by 39.6 and 25.0 points over Qwen2.5-VL-7B and 32B, respectively.Robix-32B also outperforms commercial models on most tasks.These results highlight Robix's strong performance in object localization, pointing and fine-grained visual understanding.</p>
<p>Task-centric Reasoning.Embodied reasoning reflects a model's ability to understand and reason about robotic tasks.We evaluate Robix across 5 diverse open benchmarks, including ERQA [34], RoboVQA [52], OpenEQA (HM3D &amp; ScanNet) [43], and EgoTaskQA [31].In addition, we introduce Agibot-ER, a real-world task reasoning benchmark derived from the Agibot dataset [6], which includes manually annotated test sets of 97, 120, and 381 samples for the three key reasoning tasks-Task Status Verification, Action Affordance, and Next Action Prediction, respectively.Full details of the benchmark are provided in Section B. We report the average results of the three tasks on this benchmark.Robix consistently outperforms its backbone models as well as Cosmos-Reason1-7B and RoboBrain-2.0-32Bacross most benchmarks.On Agibot-ER, Robix delivers substantial gains over its backbones, improving absolute accuracy by 12.8 and 7.2 points for the 7B and 32B versions, respectively.It further surpasses Cosmos-Reason1-7B and RoboBrain-2.0-32Bby 23 and 8.3 points, demonstrating superior performance in embodied, task-centric reasoning.</p>
<p>General Multimodal Understanding &amp; Reasoning</p>
<p>Multimodal understanding is a core capability of vision-language models and a primary focus of VLM development.To evaluate both static image and dynamic video understanding, we assess Robix on a suite of general VQA benchmarks-image-based (MME [18], MMBench [40], RealWorldQA [71], SimpleVQA [9]) and video-based (EgoSchema [44], VideoMME [19], NextQA [73]).We further test general reasoning on MathVista [42] and MMMU [82], which cover complex mathematical and multimodal problem-solving tasks.Robix preserves the performance of its backbone on most benchmarks, demonstrating the benefit of training with diverse, high-coverage multimodal data, but still trails large-scale commercial models-underscoring the need to scale both data and model size for stronger general-purpose multimodal reasoning.</p>
<p>Overall, Robix greatly enhances robotics-relevant perception and reasoning-particularly in 3D spatial understanding and visual grounding-while maintaining strong performance on general multimodal tasks.These gains deepen its understanding of spatial and temporal properties, enabling more effective reasoning and planning in real-world environments.</p>
<p>Offline Evaluation</p>
<p>The offline evaluation enables fully automated assessment of planning and interaction capabilities using predefined evaluation sets.To thoroughly evaluate both interactive long-horizon planning and out-ofdistribution (OOD) generalization, we design three dedicated evaluation sets:</p>
<p>• AGIBot Evaluation Set.We manually select 16 high-frequency daily tasks from the AGIBot dataset (e.g., making a sandwich, washing dishes with a dishwasher, arranging a sofa, washing clothes with a washing machine, arranging flowers) and ensure none appear in the training data.This set primarily evaluates the model's long-horizon task planning capability on OOD tasks.Details are provided in Section A.2.</p>
<p>• Internal Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Benchmark.We manually design 16 scripts covering task planning and diverse human-robot interaction scenarios, including table organization, dietary filtering, checkout packing, grocery shopping, and shoe cabinet organization.These scripts are enacted by human participants-one acting as the user and the other executing actions via robot teleoperation or a Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) [10] device-and subsequently annotated by trained annotators.The benchmark includes tasks and items absent from the training data and is intended to evaluate interactive task execution in unseen scenarios.• Internal In-Distribution (ID) Benchmark.This evaluation set is randomly sampled from our synthesized data and categorized by task type and user instruction into six groups: (1) multi-stage instructions, (2) constrained instructions, (3) invalid instructions, (4) user interruptions, (5) fail-and-replan, and (6) openended instructions.Each category targets evaluation of the model's corresponding instruction following and task planning capabilities.</p>
<p>Data Format.The overall statistics of each evaluation set are shown in Table 2.Each episode is structured as a multi-turn dialogue and evaluated using a teacher-forcing approach, i.e., the model observes an error-free interaction and planning history when predicting the next step action.Because an observation-instruction pair may permit multiple valid next actions, we annotate a candidate action list for each step to capture all acceptable options.Examples of the offline evaluation format are provided in Section A.3.</p>
<p>Evaluation metrics.For AGIBot, Internal OOD, Internal ID-MultiStage/Constrained/Interrupt/OpenEnded, we report action prediction accuracy by matching the predicted action against a candidate action list, with similarity judged by Seed-1.5-VL(see Section A.5 for the prompt).For Internal ID-Invalid/Replan, which are binary classification tasks, we report the F1 score.</p>
<p>Baseline methods.We compare against widely used commercial and open-source VLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro,GPT-4o, Seed-1.5-VL,Seed-1.5-VL-Think,Qwen2.5-VL-7B/32B/72B,GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking[26], and RoboBrain-2.0-7B/32B.All baselines are adapted to the multi-turn observation-think-action format using the prompts in Section A.5.For each model, we test both English and Chinese prompts and report the better result.Gemini-2.5-Proand GPT-4o perform better with English prompts, whereas the other models achieve higher accuracy with Chinese prompts.All evaluations are conducted using greedy decoding.</p>
<p>Results.The offline evaluation results for each model are presented in Table 3. Key observations include:</p>
<p>• Robix-32B-RL ranks first on all evaluation sets, demonstrating strong task planning and human-robot interaction capabilities, and substantially outperforming all open-source and commercial VLMs on both ID and OOD benchmarks.</p>
<p>• Chain-of-thought reasoning is critical for both OOD generalization and complex instruction following.Robix-7B-SFT without reasoning (Robix-7B-SFT-wo-R) exhibits a drop of over 7 percentage points in accuracy on the Internal OOD benchmarks compared to its reasoning-enabled counterpart, and suffers a 26.7-point decline on the ID-OpenEnded tasks.</p>
<p>• RL is critical, boosting Robix-32B's performance on nearly all evaluation sets.On the challenging Internal OOD benchmarks, Robix-7B-RL and Robix-32B-RL improve accuracy by 8.3 and 3.3 points, respectively, compared to their SFT counterparts.As shown in the case study (Section C), RL primarily enhances the SFT models by (i) reducing irrational reasoning steps, (ii) improving thought-action consistency, and (iii) minimizing formatting errors.</p>
<p>• Gemini-2.5-Pro is the strongest baseline, ranking first on most evaluation sets among baseline methods.</p>
<p>Our evaluation suggests it is currently the leading foundation model for embodied AI applications.</p>
<p>Online Evaluation</p>
<p>While offline evaluation is cost-effective, it is limited to static environments and cannot assess a model's ability to interact with the dynamic physical world.To address this, we deploy our model and baselines within a hierarchical robot system across diverse real-world settings-including kitchens, meeting rooms, and grocery stores-and conduct online evaluations to measure their effectiveness as high-level planning and interaction modules for daily tasks.We design two sets of experiments:</p>
<p>• Online evaluation of VLMs.Assess the planning and interaction capabilities of VLMs in isolation, without the influence of low-level controllers.</p>
<p>• Online evaluation of the VLM-VLA robot system.Assess the end-to-end system performance by pairing the VLM with an automatic VLA model as the low-level controller.</p>
<p>In the first set of experiments, VLMs serve as the high-level planning and interaction module, while human labelers equipped with a Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) [10] device act as the low-level controller, enabling evaluation under a fully reliable control setting.In the second set, we use our in-house VLA model GR-3 [7], as the low-level controller and deploy the integrated VLM-VLA system on the ByteMini robot [7].</p>
<p>Robix is deployed with customized inference optimization techniques [86,87] to reduce response latency.</p>
<p>Online Evaluation of VLMs</p>
<p>Experimental settings.We designed five tasks-table bussing, checkout packing, dietary filtering, grocery shopping, and tableware organization &amp; delivery-spanning diverse environments such as kitchens, meeting rooms, and grocery stores.To increase realism, some tasks deliberately incorporate user interruptions as well as fail-and-replan scenarios.For details on the initial states and brief descriptions of each task, please refer to Section A.4.We further annotated each task with subtasks to assess completion (e.g., for table bussing: "tissue is in the rubbish bin", "plate is in the basket").We compare Robix-32B1 with four baselines that performed well in the offline evaluation: Gemini-2.5-Pro,GPT-4o, Seed-1.5-VL-Think, and Qwen2.5-VL-32B.To reduce experimental variability, each task-model pair is repeated four times, and we report the average results.Following [57], we use task progress-the percentage of subtasks completed by the end of the task-as the evaluation metric.Trained human annotators assess task progress to ensure reliability and consistency.</p>
<p>Results.The online evaluation results are shown in Figure 5.Both Robix-32B and Gemini-2.5-Prorank first in 3 of the 5 tasks, with Robix-32B achieving a slightly higher average task progress (92.6% vs. 91%), demonstrating its superior performance in dynamic real-world environments.Robix-32B also outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-32B by a large margin (92.6% vs. 28%), underscoring the effectiveness of our training pipeline.Gemini-2.5-Proremains the strongest baseline, showing strong capabilities in following complex instructions.However, deploying large foundation models directly for planning and interaction introduces a major challenge-high response latency.In our experiments, Gemini-2.5-Prosometimes required over 30 seconds to respond.While customized deployment may help reduce latency, we contend that current large-scale commercial VLMs remain too computationally heavy for real-time interaction, even on advanced hardware.</p>
<p>Online Evaluation of the VLM-VLA system</p>
<p>Experimental Settings.We select three tasks from the online evaluation-table cleaning, dietary filtering, and checkout packing-as the evaluation set, excluding the remaining two tasks that require actions beyond GR-3's current capabilities.To better isolate the high-level cognitive layer's performance, we also remove particularly challenging items to reduce frequent manipulation failures.Following the VLM online evaluation protocol, each task-model pair is evaluated four times, and we report average results using task progress as the metric.All experiments are conducted with the GR-3 model and the ByteMini robot [7].</p>
<p>Results.We compare Robix-32B with the two strongest baselines from both offline and online evaluations:</p>
<p>Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-4o.Figure 6 shows the results across the three real-world tasks.The findings mirror those in Section 4.3.1:Robix-32B achieves an average task progress of 92.5%, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Proand GPT-4o by 4.3 and 28.1 percentage points, respectively.We find that baseline methods-particularly GPT-4o-sometimes generate actions that are semantically correct but unrecognizable to the VLA.For instance, the VLA can execute "put the Oreo into the shopping basket" but fails to interpret "put the biscuit box into the shopping basket."Such VLM-VLA misalignment mainly accounts for the online performance drop observed in Gemini-2.5-Proand GPT-4o.</p>
<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Robotic Task Planning.Solving complex, long-horizon tasks in open environments demands robust high-level planning.Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced robotic task planning by grounding high-level instructions in perceptual context [47,68,77].Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs), which often generate ungrounded or physically infeasible plans due to a lack of environmental perception [29,60], VLMs integrate visual understanding with language reasoning to enable open-vocabulary instruction following and closed-loop planning.Systems such as COME-robot [88], VILA [28], and REPLAN [59] leverage GPT-4V to generate executable plans directly from raw visual observations and iteratively refine them based on environmental feedback, improving robustness through situated reasoning and failure recovery.Despite these advances, VLM-based approaches face persistent challenges: they struggle to maintain long-term consistency, exhibit limited embodied reasoning for grounding objects and spatial concepts in the physical world, and fail to fully integrate these signals for adaptive, task-centric planning.Addressing these issues is essential for scaling VLM-based planning to real-world, long-horizon embodied tasks.Moreover, most existing methods focus solely on task planning while overlooking the human-robot interaction capabilities during task execution that are crucial for a truly generalist robotic system.</p>
<p>Human-Robot Interaction.Existing work on human-robot interaction primarily focuses on enabling seamless, natural communication through real-time feedback and corrections.Early model-based systems grounded language in symbolic environment representations [45,48,49,62], whereas recent learning-based methods adopt hierarchical architectures to directly interpret and act on user feedback [5,13,15,38,46,56,58,72].</p>
<p>Examples include OLAF [38], which uses GPT-4 to re-label actions and update visuomotor policies from corrections; YAY Robot [56], which integrates feedback into an iterative training loop but is limited by prompt diversity; RT-H [5], which supports language-based intervention but restricts corrections to fixed spatial moves; and RACER [13], which combines a VLM supervisor with physics simulation for recovery guidance.</p>
<p>Hi Robot [57] advances these approaches by grounding real-time corrections in the robot's own observations, enabling interpretation and execution of complex instructions beyond prior systems' capabilities.However, achieving flexible interaction alongside adaptive task planning requires strong reasoning capacity-a challenge Robix addresses by leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning to unify complex task planning and human-robot interaction within a single model.Robix further introduces novel interaction capabilities, including proactive dialogue to clarify ambiguous instructions or infer user intent, and context-aware commonsense reasoning.</p>
<p>Embodied Reasoning.Embodied reasoning is the capacity of vision-language models (VLMs) to ground objects, spatial concepts, and physical interactions in the real world, and to integrate these signals into downstream robotic tasks [64].Unlike abstract symbolic reasoning, it is inherently action-oriented, requiring agents to interpret dynamic environments, plan context-aware behaviors, and adapt through feedback.Recent advances span model design, data curation, and task-specific optimization.Embodied-Reasoner [85] learns observation-thought-action trajectories enriched with spatial reasoning and self-reflection for visual search.Gemini Robotics-ER [64] embeds embodied reasoning into its core VLM, achieving strong generalization across tasks such as 3D perception, pointing, state estimation, and affordance prediction.Data-driven approaches include Cosmos-Reason1 [2], which curates datasets emphasizing task-centric reasoning, and RoboBrain-2.0[63], which synthesizes spatial-temporal reasoning datasets augmented with thought traces for causal chain learning.Task-specific methods include EvolveNav [36], which improves vision-language navigation via formalized CoT fine-tuning and self-reflective post-training; and ECoT [83], which trains vision-language-action models for multi-step reasoning over plans, sub-tasks, motions, and grounded visual features before action generation.However, effectively leveraging embodied reasoning to develop generalist robotic systems capable of interactive, long-horizon task execution remains underexplored.Robix addresses this gap by integrating robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction to enable seamless interaction with both humans and physical environments, advancing toward general-purpose embodied intelligence.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>This paper presents Robix, a unified vision-language model that integrates robot reasoning, adaptive task planning, and human-robot interaction.Serving as the high-level cognitive layer of a hierarchical robot system, Robix enables robots to execute interactive, long-horizon tasks in open environments with high flexibility.It demonstrates flexible interaction capabilities, including proactive dialogue to clarify ambiguous instructions or infer user intent, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning.</p>
<p>Experimental results show that Robix delivers strong performance on real-world robotic tasks and exhibits robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings.</p>
<p>Limitations &amp; Future Work.Similar to other state-of-the-art multimodal models, Robix has several limitations.In highly dynamic tasks with frequent scene transitions, it may produce hallucinations, flawed reasoning, or exhibit gaps in physical commonsense.Additionally, Robix relies on short-term context windows to process interaction history, functioning as a form of short-term memory.Long-term interactive scenarios, however, require more advanced memory mechanisms-specifically, long-term memory with dynamic updates, efficient retrieval, and effective utilization, akin to context engineering in large language models.Addressing these challenges will be a primary focus of future work.</p>

The above example illustrates two consecutive rounds within a trajectory.We query VLMs in a manner analogous to multi-turn dialogue interactions.For the first round, planning is considered correct if the VLM output semantically matches either: <|plan_start|>put the banana into the plastic box<|plan_end|> or <|plan_start|>put the grapes into the plastic box<|plan_end|>.For the second round, we evaluate models under a teacher-forcing setting, incorporating the ground-truth from the first round into the dialogue history.Since the other_actions list is empty for this step, planning is deemed correct only if the VLM output semantically matches: <|plan_start|>put the banana on the table<|plan_end|>.


##Examples


A.4 Online evaluation tasks

Example initial states of the five tasks used in our online evaluation are shown in Figure 7. Below, we provide an overview of each task.

• Table bussing: removing used dishes, utensils, and food items.In our experiment, the user requests the robot to clear the table, but interrupts with the command "I still need it" while the robot is placing a glass into the plastic box.We also introduce a failure event when the robot attempts to place a spoon into the box.

• Checkout packing: organizing and placing purchased items into bags or boxes at checkout.In our experiment, the user asks the robot to move all items on the checkout counter into the shopping basket.An interruption occurs with the command "I am allergic to caffeine" while the robot is placing a coffee into the basket.

• Dietary filtering: selecting or excluding food and drink items based on dietary constraints (e.g., no caffeine, vegetarian).In our experiment, the user issues a series of instructions: (1) "Put the food with the highest energy into the plastic box, then add a drink.Note that I am allergic to caffeine.";(2) "Discard all drinks containing caffeine into the rubbish bin"; (3) "Place all fruits and vegetables into the plastic box "; and (4) "Clean up all remaining items on the table".

• Grocery shopping: retrieving and collecting grocery items according to user instructions.In our experiment, the user first asks the robot to recommend a snack suitable for a road trip.Following the recommendation, the user requests a less sweet snack for the cart, then asks for a non-alcoholic drink, and finally makes a conditional request: "Are there any nuts on the shelf?If so, put some into the shopping cart."

• Tableware organization & shipment : sorting, packing, and transporting tableware to designated locations.In our experiment, the user instructs the robot to discard all trash and transport the tableware to the sink.Specifically, the robot must first dispose of garbage in the rubbish bin, then place all tableware into a plastic box, and finally carry the box to the sink.During this process, the user interrupts with the command "Keep it on the table" while the robot is placing a stainless steel cup into the box.We use the following prompt to configure VLMs as the interaction and planning modules of the robot system in both offline and online experiments.


# Role

You are a robot with two grippers developed by Bytedance, and your name is Roobio.You are deployed in a home environment, and your job is to have natural interactions with users and complete some tasks required by the user.You have basic movement, perception, and manipulation capabilities, and can navigate to the following areas: dining table, sink, refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, bread maker, cupboard, shoe cabinet, sofa, and washing machine.


# Input

In each round, you will be provided with the following information.1.Three images: captured by the cameras from your head/left gripper/right gripper respectively.These images reflect your current visual perception at the current moment.2. User instructions (optional): user may give you some instructions, user instructions are in chinese.


# Output

To distinguish reasoning, planning, response and query.You must output with the following fields.

1. '<|think_start|> ... <|think_end|>': this field is for your reasoning process, it can include -The key items in the current scene.

-Whether the previous action is complete.

-Reasoning about your next action.2. '<|plan_start|> ... <|plan_end|>' (optional): this field is for task planning, You should plan your next action based on your reasoning process.The action should be helpful to complete user's task.3. '<|response_start|> ... <|response_end|>' (optional): this field is your response to user, you response must be in *chinese*.You should respond to the user in the following situations.

-When the user is chatting with you; -When the user gives a new instruction on completing a task, you should always respond to the user whenever you receive a new instruction.The response should be concise, polite, and relevant to the task.

-When you need to ask the user for more information.For example, if the user ask you to give him/her a drink, and you observe both orange juice and apple juice, then you should ask with some leftover food residue on the table.To continue organizing the table, I first need to re-attempt putting the paper cup into the rubbish bin to ensure the trash is handled correctly.<|think_end|><|plan_start|>put the paper cup into the rubbish bin<|plan_end|> # Robix-32B-SFT output <|think_start|>From the current scene, the paper cup is still on the table, near the rubbish bin, and is grasped by my gripper, which indicates that the previous attempt to put the paper cup into the rubbish bin was not successful.Besides the paper cup, there is also a plate with some leftover food residue on the table.To continue organizing the table, I first need to re-attempt putting the paper cup into the rubbish bin to ensure the trash is handled correctly.<|think_end|>{ "action": "put", "object": "paper cup", "target": "rubbish bin" }

reward design targeting thought-action consistency. Co-Training with General Visual Reasoning Data.

The RL stage utilizes two primary data sources: robot interaction data and general visual reasoning datasets.Training on robot interaction data improves the model's robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.Meanwhile, incorporating general visual reasoning data strengthens the model's inherent reasoning capabilities.This co-training strategy helps alleviate irrational reasoning and enhances overall task understanding and solving.The general visual reasoning datasets include a wide range of cognitive challenges, such as task completion verification, action affordance evaluation, and object localization-covering a broad spectrum of reasoning skills relevant to real-world robot applications.

3D Spatial Understanding. We evaluate Robix's 3D spatial understanding across 8 spatial reasoning benchmarks: VSIBench[75], BLINK[20], CV-Bench[65], EmbSpatial[16], SAT[51], VSR[37], SpatialBench[16], and DA-2k[76]. Details of these benchmarks are provided in Section A.1. As shown in Table1, Robix-7B and Robix-32B outperform their backbones (Qwen2.5-VL-7B/32B) on 7 of 8 spatial reasoning tasks, with average accuracies of 73.4 and 75.8 compared to 66.9 and 70.7, respectively. They also surpass embodied
By default, Robix-32B refers to Robix-32B-RL.
Pixmo-Point & Where2Place. For these two benchmarks[14,81], we compute the proportion of predicted points that fall within the referring objects.
Since the baseline models (e.g., Qwen-2.5-VL, Cosmos-Reason1, RoboBrain-2.0, etc.) cannot follow a unified output format on the visual grounding benchmarks-including LVIS, RefCOCO, Pixmo-Point, and Where2Place-we revise their prompts to adapt to their output formats.

present the prompts used in our experiments, including the judge prompt for offline evaluation, the baseline model prompts, and the reward model prompt for reinforcement learning.Judge Prompt for Offline Evaluation# RoleYou are a judge to decide the similarity of two sentences.# Inputs You will be provided with two sentences, each sentence represent an action from a robot.# Output FormatYour output should be a single number that is either 0 orChinese Prompt for Baseline ModelsWe also developed a corresponding Chinese prompt for models that perform better with Chinese.Reward Model Prompt for RL# RoleYou are a consistency checker for a robot's planning.Your task is to evaluate the robot's thinking process and the resulting final action.# Input 1.The robot's thinking process, enclosed by <|think_start|> and <|think_end|>.2. The robot's final action, enclosed by <|plan_start|> and <|plan_end|>.# TaskYou need to determine: 1.Whether the thinking process within <|think_start|> and <|think_end|> is reasonable.2. Whether the final decision within <|plan_start|> and <|plan_end|> is consistent with the decision derived from the thinking process in <|think_start|> and <|think_end|>.# Output Your output must follow this format: [Your reasoning process] + "The final answer is: [NUMBER]."Here, [NUMBER] is an integer: '1' indicates consistency; '-1' indicates inconsistency; '0' indicates that it is impossible to judge.# Notes 1. Ignore ambiguity in names.Items that could potentially be consistent should be considered consistent.2. Assign -1 only if the thinking process is completely unreasonable.B Embodied Task-centric ReasoningB.1 Data SynthesisPublicly available robot datasets often contain long video demonstrations with temporally annotated clips and corresponding individual actions, or they can be segmented automatically into clips using VLMs.To equip Robix with reasoning and planning capabilities in embodied scenarios, we design three dedicated synthesis pipelines, each targeting a distinct sub-task: task status verification, action affordance, and next action prediction.The details of these pipelines are provided below.Task Status Verification.The status of a task is categorized as either complete or incomplete.To construct task verification data labeled as complete, we use the entire video clip as the visual input.Reasoning traces are obtained by prompting a strong VLM (Seed-1.5-VL in thinking mode) with the question "Is the {action} complete?".We then extract the reasoning content from the response and retain only those instances where the predicted status is complete.Conversely, to represent incomplete task status, we randomly truncate each video clip to between one-half and one-third of its original duration, producing partial visual inputs.As before, we retain only those cases where the predicted status is identified as incomplete.Action Affordance.To obtain high-quality labels for action affordance, we distill both labels and reasoning traces from powerful VLMs.However, we find that relying on a single VLM is insufficient for generating accurate labels reliably.Therefore, we employ various VLMs to produce candidate labels and take the intersection of their outputs as the final annotation.The corresponding reasoning traces are extracted from the Seed-1.5-VL-Thinkmodel.Next Action Prediction.The robot datasets are typically annotated with action sequences.Thus, the ground-truth next action can be directly determined once the previous action is specified.To synthesize the corresponding reasoning trace, we leverage Seed-1.5-VLby prompting it with both the video and the following textual input: "You are an intelligent robot executing {the task}.To complete this task, you are performing the action as shown in the video.Your next action is {next action}.Please reflect on the rationale behind your next action and output your response from the perspective of a robotic agent."B.2 Agibot-ER BenchmarkWe construct an embodied task-centric reasoning benchmark based on the Agibot dataset[6], which provides manual annotations of tasks, atomic action sequences, and the corresponding video clips for each action.Specifically:• Task Status Verification: We randomly select 100 samples from the synthesized dataset and further verify the label accuracy, resulting in 97 test samples.• Action Affordance: We select 120 video clips and corresponding individual actions from 50 different tasks.To ensure accuracy, we manually annotate these samples rather than relying on VLM-based annotation.• Next Action Prediction.The ground-truth next action is obtained directly from the robot datasets.We randomly sample 400 instances and construct distractor options by leveraging a powerful LLM to generate incorrect candidates that differ subtly from the correct one-such as variations in action type, target object, or destination.To ensure quality, we manually verify all synthesized options, resulting in 381 validated test samples.All test samples are eliminated from the training dataset.C Case studies of RLOur reinforcement learning stage yields several improvements over the SFT model, including: (1) reduced irrational reasoning, (2) improved thought-action consistency, and (3) fewer formatting errors.In the following, we present comparative case studies between Robix-32B-RL and Robix-32B-SFT to illustrate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning.Reduced irrational reasoning# Current task Put all the drinks on the table into the carton.# Robix-32B-RL output <|think_start|>Based on the current scene, I see that there is already a bottle of soda inside the carton, and the remaining items on the table are milk, Oreos, and gum.Recalling my last action, I have already put the coke into the carton.Now, the only beverage left on the table is milk.To complete the task of putting all beverages into the carton, the next step should be to put the milk into the carton.<|think_end|> <|plan_start|>put the milk into the carton<|plan_end|> # Robix-32B-SFT output <|think_start|>Based on the current scene, I see that there is already a bottle of soda inside the carton, and the remaining items on the table are milk, Oreos, and gum.Recalling my last action, I have already put the coke into the carton.Now, all the beverages on the table have been put into the carton, and the task goal has been achieved.Next, I should proactively ask the user if there are any other tasks that need assistance.<|think_end|> <|response_start|>The task has been processed.Is there anything else I can help you with? <|response_end|>Improved thought-action consistency# Current Task Put the dishes in the sink #

Robix-32B-SFT output <|think_start|>I have grasped the storage basket with my dual grippers, ready to transport the dishes.According to the user's instructions, the dishes need to be taken to the sink.All the dishes that need to be washed have been collected in the storage basket.The next step is to transport the storage basket to the sink area, completing the task of collecting and transporting the dishes.<|think_end|><|plan_start|>navigate to the cupboard<|plan_end|>Fewer formatting errors# Current Task Organize the table #
