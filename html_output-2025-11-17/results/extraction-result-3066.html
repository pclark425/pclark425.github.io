                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Explicit multi-step reasoning, such as chain-of-thought, is widely adopted in the community to explore the better performance of language models (LMs). We report on the systematic strategy that LMs use in this process.Our controlled experiments reveal that LMs rely more heavily on heuristics, such as lexical overlap, in the earlier stages of reasoning when more steps are required to reach an answer. Conversely, their reliance on heuristics decreases as LMs progress closer to the final answer. This suggests that LMs track only a limited number of future steps and dynamically combine heuristic strategies with rational ones in solving tasks involving multi-step reasoning.</p>

RIKEN, 3 MBZUAI  {youichi.aoki.p2, keito.kudo.q4, sone.shusaku.r8}@dc.tohoku.ac.jp,</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When facing complex tasks, humans tend to seek shallow, heuristic solutions first (Erickson and Mattson, 1981;Frederick, 2005).Once these attempts are revealed to fail or elicit another reasonable solution, they switch to being more rational (Stanovich and West, 2000).Such systematic behavior helps us to predict how humans will tackle new problems.Given such a view, when it comes to predicting the behavior of language models (LMs) (Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh 2022; Zhang et al. 2024; inter alia), the following question naturally arises-Do LMs also use a similar systematic strategy to solve complex tasks, or is their strategy totally different from humans, or do they have no such strategies?This study explores an answer to this question.Such analyses will shed light on the cognitive plausibility of LMs in problem solving (Opedal et al., 2024;Eisape et al., 2024;Aher et al., 2023) as well as address general concerns of current neural models relying on superficial, heuristic cues overly and ending up with Figure 1: Illustration of the systematic reasoning strategy we discovered in language models .When the goal is distant from the current reasoning step, they tend to rely on heuristics to take the next reasoning step, such as lexical overlap with a question, leading to the wrong direction (red path).In contrast, when the goal is within a limited distance, they are more likely to take rational actions (green path) to reach the goal.</p>
<p>irrational conclusions (Du et al., 2022;Lai et al., 2021;Jia and Liang, 2017;Ye et al., 2023;Chen et al., 2024).</p>
<p>In this paper, we demonstrate that LMs rely on shallow heuristics more frequently in the earlier phase of multi-step reasoning, and then gradually switch their reasoning strategy to be more rational and goal-oriented to make the right choice to reach the goal.From an engineering perspective, this highlights a limitation of modern LMs, including GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), in searching for a solution at the initial stage of step-by-step reasoning, particularly when tasks require many-steplong solutions, implying that they can backtrack only a limited number of future steps from the answer to the current progress of reasoning.From a cognitive perspective, their behaviors would be somewhat human-like in the sense that the models try to employ heuristics first in solving a complex problem.Moreover, this paper is the first to show that models are equipped with both heuristic and goal-oriented reasoning and dynamically switch between them as needed.</p>
<p>Task</p>
<p>We adopt an arithmetic reasoning task as a controlled testbed to analyze LM's reasoning ability (Figure 2 left).We will use natural and artificially controlled datasets in the experiments, but let us use the latter, more formal examples to explain the task overview.</p>
<p>Arithmetic reasoning task: The problem consists of a set of premises P = {p 1 , • • • , p k } and a question q.Each premise describes either type of fact: (i) Person A has n items (A=n), or (ii) Person B has n more/fewer items than A has (B=A+n or B=A-n).The question q asks the exact number of specific items a particular person ultimately has (How many items does B have?).Here, one should consider multiple premises to derive the final answer, e.g., A=3; B=2+A; B=2+3=5.Notably, some premises are irrelevant to the answer; thus, models have to track which premise is necessary to reach the final answer.</p>
<p>Reasoning step: Let f be a model that is instructed to solve the task step-by-step.In each reasoning step t, the model f selects a particular premise p i ∈ P and paraphrases it into a new fact z t by eagerly resolving reference expressions based on the already stated facts
z &lt;t = [z 1 , • • • , z t−1 ]
as in equation ( 1):
(p i , z t ) = f (P, q, z &lt;t ) .(1)
For example, in Figure 2, when p 2 , Walter has 2 more apples than Peggy., is selected at a particular reasoning step, the respective z t should be Walter has 2+5=7 apples.if z &lt;t already contains the number of apples Peggy has, i.e., p 1 .2Starting with an empty set of stated facts z = {}, the model recursively performs a reasoning step and can stop when outputting a special symbol EOS or answering the question q.Here, we denote the whole history of selected premises as h = [p i , • • • , p j ] ∈ P * , where P * is Kleene closure of P .Its t-th element h t is the premise to derive the t-th reasoning step z t .Henceforth, we call h reasoning steps and focus on the ability to search for the right h.</p>
<p>Solutions: Among the possible reasoning steps P * , there is a set of solutions H  10). Notably, we do not care about the ability to correctly introduce a new fact z t (Eq.1), e.g., the accuracy of arithmetic operation (e.g., 5+2=7), but separately focus on their search strategy to select the relevant premise to perform the next reasoning step.</p>
<p>Heuristics</p>
<p>Given existing studies on LMs' use of heuristics ( §5), we focus on the following types of heuristics:</p>
<p>Lexical overlap between premise and question (OVERLAP): Neural models generally tend to rely on superficial, shallow similarity of texts when considering their associations.We specifically examine whether models select premises with the same person name (PN) as the one in question as a representative of such biases.For example, given a question how many apples Judy has, premises such as Judy's mother got 3 apples might be selected as a relevant fact, regardless of its necessity to reach the answer.</p>
<p>Position of premise (POSITION): It has been reported that models tend to select information, e.g., first and last, in specific positions in the context (Liu et al., 2024).We examine whether models tend to select the premise in the initial position of context.</p>
<p>Grammatical feature of premise (NEGATIVE):</p>
<p>Given that a specific grammatical feature, e.g., negation word, is often a superficial cue (Du et al., 2021;Niven and Kao, 2019), we specifically analyze the bias that models avoid selecting premise with negation word, i.e., not.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>We first confirm that models indeed rely on particular types of heuristics in our setting ( §4.1).Then, we investigate when in the step-by-step reasoning, such heuristics are more frequently exploited ( §4.2).</p>
<p>General settings: We use four representative variants of large language models (LLMs): textbison-001 version of Google'sPaLM2 (Anil et al., 2023), Llama2-13B (Touvron et al., 2023), gpt-3.5-turbo-0125and gpt-4-0613 snapshots of Ope-nAI's GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI, 2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023).These models are instructed to yield a minimum solution via prompting.</p>
<p>Preliminary experiments</p>
<p>First, we confirm that LLMs exploit specific heuristics in natural and artificially controlled datasets during step-by-step reasoning.</p>
<p>Settings for Negative) than the BASE scores across models and datasets.This indicates that LLMs, on average, tend to rely on our targeted heuristics ( §3).Interestingly, different models yield different preferences towards distractor types; for example, Llama2 and GPT-3.5 have more biased premise positions than PaLM2 and GPT-4.Note that whether or not a distractor was selected was determined by some rules.Such details are exmplained in the Appendices A.2 and B.2.</p>
<p>Main experiments</p>
<p>Then, we further investigate the LMs' dynamic use of heuristics.We hypothesized that the more distant the current reasoning step is from the answer (higher d in §2), the more heavily models rely on heuristics.Again, generating the minimal solution requires the model to track/plan the future path (remaining necessary and sufficient information) to reach the final answer, and its remaining length becomes longer at the initial phase of reasoning.If models have a limited capacity to track the future path, they may have to give up rational reasoning and rely on heuristics, particularly at the earlier stage of reasoning, where the volume of the remaining future path is likely to exceed the model's capacity.</p>
<p>Distractor and evaluation: To investigate the relationship between the distance to the answer and the models' reliance on heuristics, we identify at which steps heuristics are more likely to be exploited.Ideally, to facilitate a fair step-wise comparison, one should design a distractor equally attractive to all the reasoning steps in h * and analyze when it is selected during the reasoning; however, such a distractor is inherently difficult</p>
<p>Context: Peggy has 5 apples.Walter has 2 more apples than Peggy.Judy's mother has 3 less apples than Peggy.Judy has 4 more apples than Walter has.Question: How many apples does Judy have?</p>
<p>Table 2: Example of a distractor examined in §4.2.Suppose that h * 1 is "Peggy has 5 apples."Two candidate premises with "Peggy" seem to be plausible continuations as h *</p>
<p>2 , but only one is relevant to the final answer (green), and the other is a distractor (orange).to implement.Instead, we prepare multiple distractors P to the problem in artificial data; each of them pt ∈ P correspond to each reasoning step h * t in the sense that both share the same person name that appeared in the previous step h * t−1 (Table 2).3Similar to §4.1, we further modify each distractor pt ∈ P to match each heuristic (Overlap with question or Position in §3). 4 In evaluation, for each t, partial correct reasoning steps h * &lt;t are teacher-forced to a model, and we analyze whether the model selects the right next step h * t or its respective distractor pt .Specifically, we calculate the frequency #(•) of models' selecting pt or h * t ; then, the ratio of exploiting a distractor r = #pt #pt+#h * t is reported.The chance rate should be 0.5.</p>
<p>Note that we could not use the GSM8K dataset in this experiment since designing such controlled distractors for each reasoning step was not feasible, i.e., our creation of artificial, controlled data enables this kind of analysis.In addition, we will not analyze the NEGATIVE heuristic in this experiment because it is a bias in the direction of avoidance, making the experimental design complicated.</p>
<p>Data: We used 5-step artificial reasoning data; that is, the distance to the answer is five at first d = 5 and will monotonically decrease (d = 5 → 4 → • • • → 0) through the steps in the minimal solution.The first (d = 5 → 4) and the last (d = 1 → 0) steps are excluded from our analysis for their special properties; e.g., the right last step can be identified simply by detecting the lexical overlap with the question.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>The results are shown in Figure 3.The x-axis is the change of remaining steps d to the goal in the respective reasoning step, and the yaxis is the ratio r of selecting distractors pt .The more distant the current step is from the answer (larger d), the more frequently the distractor is selected (larger r), which is typically above the chance rate.PaLM2 and GPT-4 exhibited apparent tendencies of the negative slopes between d and r.These results match the hypothesized behavior, the model's less rational behavior in earlier reasoning steps, and imply that they have a limited capacity to track the future reasoning path.</p>
<p>Related work</p>
<p>Multi-step symbolic reasoning: Given the general contrast between the symbolic and neuralbased approaches in the artificial intelligence field (Hamilton et al., 2022), the community has questioned the ability of neural LMs in emulating particular symbolic operations, e.g., graph search algorithm (Aoki et al., 2023;Yao et al., 2023;Fang et al., 2024).In contrast, to identify what kind of symbolic tasks are (im)possible to solve for LMs by varying task complexities (Clark et al., 2020), we investigate the inherent, systematic biases in solving a particular symbolic reasoning task.</p>
<p>Heuristics in LM: Neural models have typically been distracted by superficial biases (Du et al., 2022).For example, they tend to use superficial linguistic artifacts (Lai et al., 2021;Sen and Saffari, 2020;Du et al., 2021;Niven and Kao, 2019), or more simply, positional features (Ko et al., 2020), even with chain-of-thought prompting (Madaan and Yazdanbakhsh, 2022); these motivated our experiments.This paper shows that the LLMs' reliance on such heuristics changes dynamically as the reasoning progresses.</p>
<p>Search algorithm: Finding the shortest path between the start and the goal on a graph is a standard problem in computer science (Russell and Norvig, 1995).Our investigation of LMs on the arithmetic tasks can be seen as characterizing LMs' biases as a search algorithm.The use of heuristics in graph search is, more or less, related to the A<em> search algorithm (Hart et al., 1968), although heuristics in A</em> search is a more narrow concept regarding the distance to the goal than those employed by LMs.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We have found a systematic strategy for the use of heuristics in LMs' multi-step reasoning-a dynamic transition from a heuristic to a rational reasoning strategy during LMs' step-by-step reasoning.These results are hopefully helpful for researchers to understand their underlying mechanism as well as for LM users to consider the inherent biases systems have.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>This study focused only on four specific language models and two arithmetic tasks.Increasing the coverage of models and tasks is a possible future direction, although we ensured that our finding generalizes at least several models and task settings.In §4.2, we only used artificial datasets for designing controlled experiments to reduce confounding factors.Constructing a controlled but natural dataset to evaluate the reasoning strategies of LMs should be encouraged.Furthermore, our findings are based solely on the model's outputs, i.e., behaviors.Elucidating the underlying mechanisms inside the model and the source of these biases (e.g., statistical patterns in training data) should be investigated in future work.</p>

<p>Person's Names： James Numbers： 3,60 A GSM8K experiments in §4.1</p>
<p>A.1 Dataset construction process</p>
<p>As described in 4.1, we modify the existing multihop numerical reasoning dataset, GSM8K (distributed under the MIT license), to construct the evaluation dataset.The dataset construction process is divided into two steps: 1. Extracting instances from GSM8K, and 2. Inserting distractors according to the heuristic we want to evaluate for each extracted problem statement.</p>
<p>A.1.1 Instance extraction</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that the premises added during data expansion will not affect the solution.Therefore, instances are extracted in which the addition of premises has little effect on the solution.Specifically, we extract instances from the GSM8K evaluation dataset following the process below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We manually create a list of 50 person names (PNs) from a subset of the GSM8K evaluation dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using regular expressions, we identify PNs from this list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We identify pronouns and numerical expressions present in each instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We extracted instances that included precisely one from our list in both the context and the question, and where either the PN or a pronoun appears in the question (e.g., Table 3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We replaced all pronouns within the extracted instances with the corresponding person's name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following process, information on persons not appearing in the problem statement is added as distractors.The instance questions extracted above are about persons in the problem statement.Therefore, it can be guaranteed that adding a distractor will not change the answer by such a process.</p>
<p>A.1.2 Distractor insertion</p>
<p>Subsequently, we added distractors to the extracted instances according to each heuristic, thereby constructing 76 instances for the evaluation dataset.Below, we will describe the process of creating the evaluation dataset for each heuristic.</p>
<p>Base We insert a template-based random distractor (i.e., p) into each instance as a baseline.</p>
<p>The distractor was created using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We randomly selected one sentence from the instance that included a PN or pronoun and a numerical expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We replaced the PN or pronoun in the selected sentence with a placeholder, [name].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We replaced the numerical expression in the selected sentence with a placeholder, [num].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We replaced [name] with a randomly selected name from the list of PNs created in A.1.1,excluding the name already present in the instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We replaced [num] with another value.5</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>6.We inserted the created distractor into a random position in the context other than the beginning of the instance.</p>
<p>For example, When the sentence "James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week." is selected from the instance in Overlap To evaluate whether the Overlap heuristic influences the model, we insert distractors p into each instance following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We substituted the placeholder [name] within the Base distractor template with the person' s name found in the instance, appended by relational phrases such as "'s mother", "'s father", "'s son", or "'s neighborhood" (e.g., in the instance from Table 3, this would become "James's mother").</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We replaced the number in the sentence with another numerical value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We placed the constructed distractor into context at the location where the Base distractor was positioned in the instance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Position To evaluate whether the heuristic of Position induces the model, we insert distractors p into each instance.Each distractor is identical to the Base distractor except for its insertion point.Specifically, we relocated the distractor's insertion point to a random position closer to the beginning of the context than the position used for the Base distractor.</p>
<p>Negative To evaluate the model's response to the Negative heuristic, we insert distractors p into each instance created based on the following template:</p>
<p>[name] doesn't have [num] [object].</p>
<p>In this template:</p>
<p>• [name] is substituted with a random PN included in the instance.</p>
<p>• [object] is replaced with one of the following items: "apples," "bananas," "grapes," "pencils," or "books."</p>
<p>• [num] is replaced with a different numerical value, using the same algorithm for creating the Base distractor.</p>
<p>A.2 Evaluation</p>
<p>To determine whether the LMs selected the distractor during reasoning, we check if the numbers in the distractor p are in the facts z.We calculate the frequency of instances where the distractor is selected.Base We construct the artificial data using the method outlined below, based on the template presented in Table 4.</p>
<p>• Randomly assign one of the following names to the placeholders [nameA] to [nameE]: "Alice," "Bob," "Carol," "Dave," "Eve," "Frank," "Grace," "Heidi," "Ivan," "Judy," "Kevin," "Larry," "Mallory," "Nancy," "Olivia," "Peggy," "Quentin," "Rob," "Sybil," "Trent," "Ursula," "Victor," "Walter," "Xavier," "Yvonne," or "Zoe."</p>
<p>• Assign a randomly selected value from [nameA] to [nameD] to the placeholder [nameX].</p>
<p>• Assign a random number from 0 to 100 to the placeholder [num].</p>
<p>• Assign one of the objects "apples," "bananas," "grapes," "pencils," or "books" to the placeholder [object].</p>
<p>• Assign either "more" or "fewer" to the placeholder [relation].</p>
<p>• Randomly shuffle the order of the sentences.</p>
<p>Overlap We constructed a dataset to evaluate whether the Overlap heuristic induced the model by making certain modifications to the Base distractor for each instance.Specifically, we modified the value of [nameD] by appending relational phrases such as " 's mother", " 's father", " 's son", or " 's neighborhood" to the existing value of [nameD].We then assigned this modified value to [nameE].</p>
<p>B.2 Evaluation</p>
<p>To determine whether the LMs selected the distractor during reasoning, we check if the subject of the distractor (i.e., [nameE]) is included in the facts z.We calculate the frequency of instances where the distractor is selected.</p>
<p>C Artificial data in §4.2</p>
<p>We prepare a template similar to a Table 5 and assign values to the template according to the following steps:</p>
<p>• We create template as shown in table4.</p>
<p>• Within the template, placeholders [nameA] to [nameQ] is filled randomly with names such as "Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "Dave", "Eve", "Frank", "Grace", "Heidi", "Ivan", "Judy", "Kevin", "Larry", "Mallory", "Nancy", "Olivia", "Peggy", "Quentin", "Rob", "Sybil", "Trent", "Ursula", "Victor", "Walter", "Xavier", "Yvonne", "Zoe".</p>
<p>• The placeholder [num] is filled with a random number from 0 to 100.</p>
<p>• The placeholder [object] is filled randomly with items such as "apples", "bananas", "grapes", "pencils", "books".</p>
<p>• The placeholder [relation] is assigned either "more" or "fewer".</p>
<p>• Sentences within the context are shuffled randomly.</p>
<p>• A distractor is inserted at a random position.</p>
<p>Then, using the following procedures, We create each expanded dataset.Each targeted heuristic strongly influences the heuristic distractors designed in this study.Each dataset consists of 300 problems.</p>
<p>• For the Overlap dataset, the values "'s mother", "'s father", "'s son", and "'s neighborhood" are appended to [nameE]  • For the Negative dataset, the form of the heuristic distractor is changed to a negative form.</p>
<p>In §4.2, the method to identify which premises are used for reasoning was similar to that in App.B, relying on regular expressions.</p>
<p>D Mearuing accuracy in §4.1</p>
<p>This paper was mainly concerned with the frequency of distractor selection.To ensure that the model is not producing crappy output in these experiments, we measure the accuracy.GSM8K.Additionally, Table 7 below shows the accuracy rates of each model on artificial data.</p>
<p>From the Table 6, 7, it is shown that GPT-4 had the highest accuracy rates across the datasets, while Llama2 had the lowest.It is expected that these outcomes are due to differences in the number of parameters in the model.</p>
<p>E Generation settings</p>
<p>When using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, the settings are adjusted to temperature=0.0, fre-quency_penalty=0, and presence_penalty=0.Similarly, for PaLM2 and Llama2, the temperature is set to 0, with no sampling.</p>
<p>We use NVIDIA RTX A6000 (48GB) GPUs for inference with Llama2.</p>
<p>F Few-shot examples</p>
<p>The few-shot examples for models regarding datasets GSM8K and artificial data are shown in the respective Tables 9, 10.</p>
<p>G Effect of few-shot examples</p>
<p>We investigate whether the few-shot examples trigger the model's heuristic.Specifically, we replace the few-shot examples in the following ways to study the relationship between the model's heuristic and its inputs: 1.We change the few-shot examples to induce Overlap (as shown in  an increase in reasoning frequency with the use of distractors in the Position dataset compared to Table 1.</p>
<ol>
<li>We change the few-shot examples to induce Negative (as shown in Table 13), and investigate if there's a decrease in reasoning frequency with the use of distractors in the Negative dataset compared to Table 1.We measure the frequency of selecting p in §4.1.The results are presented in Table 8.As shown in Tables 1, 8, although the few-shot examples fed into the models such as GPT-3.5,GPT-4, and PaLM2 was changed, there was no significant change in reasoning frequency as described.This suggests that the model's heuristic does not merely mimic the examples provided as input.On the other hand, the Llama2 model was more prone to being misled by changes in input, and smaller models demonstrated a reduced capacity to reach the correct answers.</li>
</ol>
<p>H Effects of increasing the number of distructors</p>
<p>We investigate whether the same results could be obtained when the number of distractors that do not include heuristics increases.Specifically, we prepare the same settings as in §4.2 and add distractors that do not include heuristics.We define the distractors that include heuristics as pt,heuristic and those that do not as pt,non-heuristic .The ratio of pt,heuristic to pt,non-heuristic in the problem text is 1:8.In this experiment, we use a model that could produce reasonable output even when the context length increases.Specifically, we use only the GPT-3.5-turboand GPT-4.Figures 4 and 5 show how many times out of 100 times the model selected pt,heuristic , pt,non-heuristic , and h * t at each step.Figures 4 and 5 show the experimental results for the cases where the heuristics included in the distructor are overlap and position, respectively.Figures 4 and 5 show that the number of cases in which the shortest path Answer the context question using the following example.</p>
<p>Context: Leo's assignment was divided into three parts.Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting.It took Leo twice as long to finish the second part.Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting.Question: How much did Weng earn?Answer: Weng earns 12/60 = 0.2 per minute.Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = 10.The final answer is 10.</p>
<p>Context: Betty is saving money for a new wallet, which costs $100.Betty has only half of the money she needs.Alice is saving money for a new wallet, which costs $2000.Betty's parents decided to give Betty $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents.Question: How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?Question: How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?Answer:</p>
<p>In the beginning, Betty has only 100 / 2 = 50.Betty's parents gave her 15.Betty's grandparents gave her 15 * 2 = 30.This means Betty needs 100 -50 -15 -30 = 5 more.The final answer is 5.</p>
<p>Context: Julie is reading a 120-page book.Yesterday, Julie was able to read 12 pages, and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday.Julie's mother makes $18.00 an hour.Question: If Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many are left to read?Answer: Julie read 12 x 2 = «12*2=24»24 pages today So, she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = 36 pages since yesterday.There are 120 -36 = 84 pages left to be read.Since she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read 84/2 = 42 pages.The final answer is 42.</p>
<p>Context: James writes a 2-page letter to 4 different friends who live in America twice a week.James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends who live in Japan twice a week.Question: How many pages does James write each friend who lived in Japan for a year?Answer: He writes each friend 3<em>2=6 pages a week.So, he writes 6</em>2=12 pages every week.That means he writes 12*52=624 pages a year.The final answer is 624.d).The heuristic to be included in the distructor is overlap.</p>
<p>is selected increases as the goal is reached.The ratio of distructors that include heuristics to those that do not is 1:8, but the ratio of distructors that include heuristics when distructors are selected is higher than 1/(1+8).Therefore, this suggests that premises are being selected using heuristics.Except for the GPT-3.5 (overlap) results, the number  d).The heuristic to be included in the distructor is position.</p>
<p>of cases where a destructor is selected decreases as the goal is approached.These results are as with the results for 4.2.The results of  may indicate that the increase in the number of distructors has reduced the focus on distructors, including heuristics.</p>

So, Yvonne has 15-3=12 apples.The final answer is 12.Question: How many grapes does Kevin have?Answer:Rob has 55 grapes, and Trent has 40 more grapes than Rob. So, Trent has 55+40=95 grapes.Trent has 95 grapes, and Sybil has 55 fewer grapes than Trent. So, Sybil has 95-55=40 grapes.Sybil has 40 grapes, and Zoe has 88 more grapes than Sybil. So, Zoe has 40+88=128 grapes.Zoe has 128 grapes, and Kevin has 43 fewer grapes than Zoe. So, Kevin has 128-43=85 grapes.The final answer is 85.

<p>If the reference can not be resolved with z&lt;t, the model repeats the selected premise pi as zt.
To rule out the shortcut cue regarding the reference frequencies of each person name, we further added distractor premises to make the frequencies uniform.
  4  We excluded the Negative (avoidance) bias because if a model avoids negation in the latter step, we cannot distinguish whether it was due to the heuristic or rational search.
The replacement number was calculated by multiplying each number appearing in the sentence by either 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.5, or 2 and then rounding down to the nearest whole number.
