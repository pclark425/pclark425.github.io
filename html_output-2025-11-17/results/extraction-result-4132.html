Furthermore, in NDAN brains, binding of Aβ oligomers to synapses is prevented, resulting in decreased glial activation and reduced neuroinflammation. Overall, the evidence stated here strengthens the idea that some individuals are more resistant to AD pathology, or at least show an elongation of the asymptomatic state of the disease compared to others. Insights into the mechanisms underlying this resistance could provide new insight in understanding normal aging and AD itself. Further research should focus on factors and mechanisms that govern the NDAN cognitive resilience in order to find clues on novel biomarkers, targets, and better treatments of AD.</p>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and typically characterized by the accumulation amyloid-␤ plaques and tau tangles. Intriguingly, there also exists a group of elderly which do not develop dementia during their life, despite the AD neuropathology, the so-called non-demented individuals with AD neuropathology (NDAN). In this review, we provide extensive background on AD pathology and normal aging and discuss potential mechanisms that enable these NDAN individuals to remain cognitively intact. Studies presented in this review show that NDAN subjects are generally higher educated and have a larger cognitive reserve. Furthermore, enhanced neural hypertrophy could compensate for hippocampal and cingulate neural atrophy in NDAN individuals. On a cellular level, these individuals show increased levels of neural stem cells and 'von Economo neurons'. Furthermore, in NDAN brains, binding of A␤ oligomers to synapses is prevented, resulting in decreased glial activation and reduced neuroinflammation. Overall, the evidence stated here strengthens the idea that some individuals are more resistant to AD pathology, or at least show an elongation of the asymptomatic state of the disease compared to others. Insights into the mechanisms underlying this resistance could provide new insight in understanding normal aging and AD itself. Further research should focus on factors and mechanisms that govern the NDAN cognitive resilience in order to find clues on novel biomarkers, targets, and better treatments of AD.U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f2 F.K. Kok et al. / Resistance to Dementia in NDAN progressive cognitive impairment (e.g., memory 35 loss), associated with dementia [2-5]. So far, drug 36 development has been mainly focused on agents 37 decelerating or preventing the progression of AD; 38 however, most anti-AD therapies have been unsuc-39 cessful [6] and many promising findings in AD mouse 40 models failed in translation to the clinical situation 41 [7]. More recently, research is focused on iden-42 tifying novel biomarkers and developing methods 43 for early detection of AD. Currently, suggested AD 44 biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are A␤ 42 ; 45 the A␤ 42/40 ratio; phosphorylated tau at threonine 46 residue 181 (pTau181) and tau protein [8]. 47 Intriguingly, a multiplicity of literature originating 48 from a variety of locations of the world has emerged 49 that offers contradicting, yet intriguing, findings on 50 the A␤-and tau-hypotheses, as these histopatho-51 logic changes associated with AD have also been 52 discovered post-mortem in non-demented older indi-53 viduals. This suggests the existence of a group of 54 non-demented, cognitively normal individuals carry-55 ing AD neuropathology. 56 In different recent studies, several synonyms 57 (Table 1) have been used to describe these non-58 demented individuals, including but not limited to, 59 non-demented individuals with AD neuropathol-60 ogy (NDAN) [9, 10]; non-demented high potential 61 controls [11]; asymptomatic persons with AD neu-62 ropathology [12]; intermediate and high probability 63 mismatches [13]; SuperAgers [14-16]; and asymp-64 tomatic AD (ASYMAD) [17-20]. All these studies 65 have investigated older adults (65 + of age) with 66 A␤-and/or tau-deposition in absence of cognitive 67 decline, dementia (Table 1). In this review, NDAN 68 is defined as individuals that do not show the typical 69 clinical-pathological correlation associated with AD, 70 in other words individuals that carry AD pathology, as 71 assessed post-mortem, but who despite this patholog-72 ical burden performed cognitive normal antemortem. 73 Important to note is that, in general, normal aging 74 elderly show some degree of AD pathology and of 75 cognitive deterioration, but not to the extent that they 76 identify as 'NDAN' or become demented. Looking at 77 the Gaussian distribution of the association between 78 AD pathology and cognitive impairment on a popu-79 lation scale, these individuals are located on the tail 80 of the Gaussian, as they are relatively rare, with for 81 instance 6 to 15 out of over 3200 volunteers in the Bal-82 timore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) study 83 [17, 21, 22]. But even though they might be excep-84 tions to the average disease progression, at the same 85 time, this makes them even more interesting to study 86 in the search for a better drug target and treatment 87 for AD. 88 U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f F.K. Kok et al. / Resistance to Dementia in NDAN 3 To disentangle NDAN from normal aging and AD, 89 different mechanisms have been studied as summa-90 rized in Figs. 1 and 2. While some studies suggest that 91 this asymptomatic form of AD is caused by resilience 92 or resistance for A␤ toxicity, others focus on alter-93 native potential mechanisms, such as the status of 94 the risk gene for the apolipoprotein E (APOE), the 95 immune system or neurogenesis. 96 This review provides an overview on literature that 97 focusses on NDAN, referring to all asymptomatic 98 individuals with A␤-and tau-pathology (Table 1), 99 thereby aiming to provide more insight into poten-100 tial mechanisms underlying AD pathology in absence 101 of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Mecha-102nisms underlying NDAN will also be compared to 103 those underlying "normal" aging and AD inFig. 2.PHYSIOLOGY OF THE AGING BRAIN104Normal aging 105    An important characteristic of AD is cognitive 106 decline, i.e., reduction of memory, attention, pro-107 cessing speed, visuospatial abilities, and executive 108 functions. However, some degree of cognitive decline 109 has also been associated with "normal" aging, as 110 older individuals are often less efficient in cogni-111 tive tasks than younger people [23], but, which in 112 general, does not convert into dementia [24]. To 113 gain a better understanding in the process of normal 114 aging, researchers from the Gerontology Branch at 115 the National Institution of Health (NIH) launched 116 the BLSA-study [22]. By following over 3,200 117 U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f F.K. Kok et al. / Resistance to Dementia in NDAN 5 volunteers for more than 60 years, this study shed 118 light on the relationship between aging and cognitive 119 health by looking at occurring changes in brain tissue 120 and cognition over time. Both healthy and demented 121 older volunteers appeared to lose a significant amount 122 of both grey and white matter [25]. In the case of 123 grey matter atrophy, especially the frontal and parietal 124 volume declined over time. And both the ventricles 125 in the brain as well as the volume of ventricular 126 CSF increased over time [25]. These findings suggest 127 that both atrophy and increased ventricles reflect nor-128 mal aging. However, these physiological changes are 129 brain region dependent, e.g., the mesial temporal and 130 frontal areas are more susceptive to AD pathology, 131 rather than to normal aging [25]. 132 The brain atrophy as seen in the aging brain 133 could either result from neurodegeneration or from 134 alternations in neurogenesis. Neurogenesis (or gli-135 ogenesis) is responsible for the production of new 136 brain cells, such as neurons and the glial cells like 137 astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells 138 [26]. In contrast to neurons which conduct action 139 potentials, glial cells do not, but instead maintain 140 homeostasis, and protect and support neurons. An 141 important type of glial cell involved in the pathol-142 ogy of AD are microglia [27-30]. Unlike other 143 glial cells, microglia do not derive from neuroge-144 nesis, but from hematopoietic stem cells [31, 32]. 145 Microglia play an important role in neuroinflam-146 mation, functioning as resident macrophages of the 147 central nervous system. In order to understand nor-148 mal physiological changes during aging, Mayne et 149 al. (2020) discussed functional decline of the adap-150 tive immune system in healthy aging in comparison to 151several neurodegenerative diseases [33]. They illus-152 trate that the response of microglia and astrocytes to 153 pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in brains 154 of aging mice indicating higher sensitivity to inflam-155 matory events [33, 34]. Furthermore, the increased 156 secretion of interferon-␥ by cytotoxic CD8 + T cells 157 led to decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus 158 [33, 35]. Overall, their findings clearly indicated a 159 role of the immune system in the reduction in neu-160 rogenesis in the aging brain. In addition to T-cells, 161 natural killer cells have been implicated in impaired 162 neurogenesis [35, 36], as well as oxidative stress and 163 impaired DNA repair [37]. Interestingly, while neu-164 rogenesis can be reduced due to aging, the brain's 165 plasticity was found to be enhanced, yet dysregulated 166 in aged rats [38]. 167 Another feature of "normal" aging is the presence 168 of NFT and A␤, as found in brains of cognitively 169 normal elderly [39, 40-44]. In "normal" cellular 170 metabolism, the enzymes ␤and ␥-secretase are 171 responsible for cleavage of the amyloid-␤ protein 172 precursor (A␤PP), yielding A␤ peptides [45]. A␤ 173 peptides can aggregate to form soluble oligomers 174 and insoluble fibrils and plaques (Fig. 3). Perhaps 175 counter intuitively, not the insoluble but the soluble 176 oligomeric A␤ cause more neural damage as it binds 177 easier to synapses, as has been proven extensively 178 [46]. Normal A␤ production and degradation is bal-179 anced out by proteolytic degradation, deposition into 180 insoluble plaques and cell-mediated clearance [45]. 181 Tau is "normally" present in the aging brain as a 182 highly soluble protein that primarily maintains micro-183 tubules in axons [47]. When tau proteins become 184 hyperphosphorylated, it aggregates and NFTs are 185 formed. As deposition of NFT and A␤ are both 186 associated with AD patients and "normal" aging, an 187 important question is if these NDAN individuals are 188 resilient to tau-and A␤-pathology. In experiments 189 with virally induced human tau in entorhinal cortex 190 neurons of young and old mice, it was shown that tau 191 Fig. 3. Aggregation of A␤, from monomers to plaques. Soluble A␤ monomers aggregate together to form dimers and oligomers, that can form soluble protofibrils. These protofibrils aggregate to form insoluble fibrils, that can form amyloid plaques. U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f 6 F.K. Kok et al. / Resistance to Dementia in NDAN spreading was not only age-but also region depen-192 dent [48]. More specifically, the human tau expanded 193 from the entorhinal cortex, to the hippocampus and 194 the temporal lobe in old mice. In line with these 195 findings in mice, it was found that NFTs can be dis-196 tributed to the entorhinal cortex, olfactory nucleus 197 and the parahippocampal gyrus in non-demented 198 aging humans [49]. In mildly demented cases, distri-199 bution was similar to non-demented cases, but much 200 more tangles were found in these areas. Only in the 201 severely demented cases, NFTs were found also in 202 the neocortex [49]. Conversely to NFT, consistency 203 in the distribution of A␤ in "normal" aging has not 204 been found yet. In 2005, Piccini et al. did hypothesize 205 that the molecular composition of soluble A␤ aggre-206 gates could differ between "normal" aging and AD 207 [50]. 208 MECHANISMS UNDERLYING 209 ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 210 AD can be heritable, attributed to mutations in the 211 potential genes that encode for amyloid precursor 212 protein (APP) and presenilins (PSEN) 1 and 2 [51].213 Mutations in one of these genes result in increased 214 production of the protein A␤ 42 . In contrast to the her-215 itable familiar AD cases, in the sporadic AD cases, 216 risk factors consist more of environmental and as well 217 as genetic factors. One well known genetic risk fac-218 tor is the APOE allele 4, which increases the risk of 219 AD but is not determinative for the disease [52, 53]. 220 Under healthy conditions, ApoE enhances binding 221 to, transportation of, and metabolism of lipids. How-222 ever, in AD pathology, ApoE binds additionally to A␤ 223 peptides and also regulates A␤ aggregation and clear-224 ance [54]. Moreover, the ApoE lipoproteins regulate 225 neuronal signaling, glucose metabolism, and neu-226 roinflammation, all mechanisms implicated with AD, 227 as will be discussed further in this review. Another 228 important causative factor in the pathology of AD 229 is the protein tau. Hyperphosphorylation of tau pro-230 tein results in the formation of NFTs [55]. Together 231 with A␤ pathology, NFTs are defined as the typical 232 hallmarks of AD. 233 AD on a body level 234 Looking at AD on a body level, studies have been 235 focusing on multiple risk factors that are able to mod-236 ify the onset and the rate of decline seen in AD. Inves-237 tigated risk factors include age, gender, education, 238 neuropathology, personality, genetics, lifestyle, and 239 cognitive functioning [56-60]. 240 AD symptoms in patients mostly consist of cog-241 nitive and functional impairment-dementia. The 242 progressive course of AD is divided in several stages 243 [23]. The first stage, preclinical AD stage, was ini-244 tially defined as cognitively unimpaired individuals, 245 who contained AD lesions in their brain as identified 246 postmortem [61]. During this stage, clinical symp-247 toms are not yet noticeable [62]. Since individuals in 248 the preclinical stages and NDAN individuals both dis-249 play AD neuropathology in the brain, but symptoms 250 are not (yet) evident, this preclinical stage provides 251 an interesting perspective for NDAN research [63, 252 64]. The first clinical stage of cognitive decline starts 253 with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), defined as 254 a very early and subtle cognitive decline which pre-255 cedes objective cognitive decline [65]. The second 256 stage is called the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 257 stage [66]. This MCI stage lays between expected 258 cognitive decline associated with normal aging and 259 more severe decline associated with dementia. This 260 MCI stage is marked by symptoms of short term 261 memory loss, especially in retrieving learned facts, 262 and inability to acquire new information [67]. More-263 over, deficits occur in planning, executive functions, 264 attentiveness, and impairments in semantic memory 265 (refer to general knowledge). All these MCI symp-266 toms are hard to distinguish from normal aging and 267 can improve over time, remain stable for years, or 268 progress to AD or another type of dementia. During 269 the SCD and MCI stages, diagnoses of patients is 270 difficult, since these first symptoms of AD are hard 271 to distinguish from normal aging. In later stages, 272 the final stage of AD, memory problems become 273 overshadowed by new difficulties: aphasia (difficulty 274 communicating), agnosia (difficulty processing sen-275 sory information), and apraxia (inability in executing 276 motor tasks) [68, 69]. During this final AD stage of the 277 disease, it becomes more difficult for patients to exe-278 cute tasks and therefore, most AD patients eventually 279 need assistance. 280 To provide good care and disease intervention, a 281 correct diagnosis of the disease is necessary. The 282 current standard to diagnose AD is based on the 283 definition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-284 ual (DSM)-IIIR for dementia and AD criteria and 285 the diagnostic guidelines from the National Institute 286 on Aging-Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) [70]. 287 This diagnostic method is based on medical history 288 and cognitive testing after ruling out other possi-289 ble causes. Over the years, these criteria have been 290 U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f F.K. Kok et al. / Resistance to Dementia in NDAN 7 specified further to improved accuracy, using imaging 291 and blood tests [62, 66, 71]. Nevertheless, post-292 mortem confirmation of the AD hallmarks is still 293 required for a definitive diagnosis of AD. 294 With respect to postmortem confirmation, several 295 methods can be used to verify and classify AD. Tra-296 ditionally, NFT pathology has been assessed using 297 Braak staging system [72, 73] (Fig. 4). The Braak 298 staging system is used to classify the morpholog-299 ical changes that occur over time in AD patients. 300 For long, this system has been used to predict 301 AD, as the latter Braak stages typically indicate a 302 Fig. 4. The Braak staging system adapted fromŠimić et al. (2017) [84]. Topographic atrophic progression of AD caused by neurofibrillary degeneration. Initial memory loss correlates with hippocampal atrophy (stages I-II). Next, disturbance in language &amp; planning function, correlating with atrophy in temporal, frontal, and parietal cortex (stages III-IV). Finally, impaired perception and movement, associated with primary sensory and motor cortex (stage V-VI). clinical outcome of dementia, even though the system 303 was not developed for clinical-pathological correla-304 tion. Nelson et al. (2012) reviewed the validity of 305 the clinical-pathological correlation in AD thereby 306 focusing on neuropathological (A␤ and tau) changes 307 and cognitive impairment using Mini-Mental State 308 Examination (MMSE) scores [74]. The authors state 309 that the cognitive impairment in AD correlates bet-310 ter with neocortical NFT pathology than with A␤ 311 plaque. However, NFT pathology also occurs in nor-312 mal aging, as described in the previous section. For 313 this reason, it could be questioned if Braak stag-314 ing provides a valid prediction for AD, and also 315 for NDAN [75, 76]. Especially during the slow-316 developing pathology of AD, morphological changes 317 in the brain do not always directly translate into 318 behavioral differences. However, at this point the 319 question remains, is this a defect in the pathologi-320 cal evaluation itself, and can Braak staging be used 321 to evaluate AD and NDAN, or is there something 322 else missing? Another neuropathological diagnostic 323 criteria instrument is the Consortium to Establish a 324 Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) which 325 evaluates the density of neocortical senile plaques 326 [77-79]. 327 Altogether, the slow and gradual decline observed 328 in AD ensures the challenges in treatment of this dis-329 ease. The AD-associated processes will be discussed 330 next on the organ levels, followed by the cellular and 331 biochemical level to gain deeper understanding of 332 AD, and for the ultimate comparison of AD patients 333 and NDAN individuals. 334 AD on an organ level 335 AD is characterized by neurodegeneration in spe-336 cific areas of the brain, causing the cognitive decline 337 as described in the previous section. Typically, his-338 tological changes first appear in the limbic system, 339 especially the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 340 [80]. In particular, atrophy in the CA1 region of 341 the hippocampus is indicative of AD, not of aging 342 [81, 82]. This suggests that memory loss in AD is 343 enhanced by CA1 atrophy, resulting in a greater mem-344 ory decline than observed in normal aging. After CA1 345 atrophy, the atrophy affects the temporal and frontal 346 cortex, and parts of the cingulate gyrus and parietal 347 lobe (reviewed in [83, 84]). As a result of this neuronal 348 loss, the ventricular system extends. Meanwhile, the 349 spinal cord and cerebellum seem to stay unaffected 350 [80]. 351 U n c o r r e c t e d A u t h o r P r o o f 8 F.K. Kok et al. / Resistance to Dementia in NDAN As described in the previous section, the post-352 mortem classification of AD is performed by the 353 Braak staging system (Fig. 4), based on the charac-354 teristic distribution pattern of neurofibrillary changes 355 throughout the brain [73]. Initially, the trans entorhi-356 nal to the hippocampal region become affected (Stage 357 I &amp; II), thereafter the temporal, frontal, and parietal 358 neocortex (Stage III &amp; IV), and eventually followed 359 by alterations in the primary sensory and motor 360 areas (Stage V &amp; VI). The affected regions correlate 361 with loss of recent memories (stages I-II), impair-362 ment of language and planning areas (stages III-IV), 363 and finally malfunctioning of object recognition and 364 motor skills (stages V-VI). 365 Several AD subtypes have been defined based on 366 the atrophy pattern [85-89].

(2017) 367 used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict 368 and investigates three subtypes of AD: typical AD, 369 limbic-predominant, and hippocampal-sparing forms 370 of AD [89]. In typical AD brains, neurodegenera-371 tion appeared in the mesial temporal lobe and in the 372 posterior cortex and/or frontal cortex. In contrast to 373 the typical AD, the limbic-predominant subtype was 374 defined as atrophy in the mesial temporal lobe only, 375 whereas in the hippocampal-sparing AD subtype, this 376 mesial temporal lobe was spared. The latter generally 377 did not experience amnesia. Furthermore, another 378 study identified a subtype of patients with neither hip-379 pocampal nor cortical atrophy [90]. This AD subtype 380 did show cognitive impairment, despite their seem-381 ingly spared brain areas. This could be explained by 382 possible limitations in the diagnostic accuracy guide-383 lines from the NIA-AA or due to other factors that are 384 not yet identified in the mechanism of AD. 385 Another aspect of AD is reduction of the cerebral 386 blood flow (CBF). In AD, A␤ peptides indirectly can 387 cause a reduction of CBF due to interference with 388 nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation [91]. Reduction 389 of CBF results in impaired supply of glucose, nutri-390 ents, and oxygen, and diminished elimination of toxic 391 products. Therefore, reduction of CBF contributes to 392 neuronal damage. In parallel, A␤ induces reactive 393 oxygen species that activate the release of endothelin-394 1, which in their turn elicits constriction of pericytes 395 which results in capillary constriction and reduced 396 CBF [92]. Particularly, regional CBF (rCBF) reduc-397 tion is one of the earlier markers for dysfunction in 398 specific areas associated with AD [93]. This rCBF 399 reduction follows the same trend as the observed areas 400 affected in AD pathology: the posterior cingulate, 401 praecuneus, and mesial temporal lobes. However, 402 rCBF is further reduced in AD patients, namely in the 403 hippocampus, caudate, and thalamus [94]. For this 404 reason, measuring the CBF in these regions, using 405 MRI or positron emission tomography (PET), is a 406 useful method to predict cognitive decline [95, 96]. 407 AD on a cellular level 408 During AD, neurons and synapses lose their struc-409 ture and function, and eventually die, resulting in 410 atrophy as described above. Altogether this is referred 411 to as neurodegeneration, hence AD is a neurodegener-412 ative disease. Neurodegeneration as observed in AD 413 results from to neurotoxic tau and A␤, together with 414 aging and inflammation [97]. 415 To get a better idea of neurodegeneration, it is 416 important to not only investigate neuronal death but 417 also neuronal production. Neurons themselves do not 418 proliferate in adult life; however, new neurons can be 419 derived from neuronal stem cells (NSC) by the pro-420 cess of neurogenesis [26]. Adult neurogenesis has 421 been observed in two regions of the brain, namely 422 cognitive loss in the investigated cohort [207].</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>In the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), two 28 pivotal key hallmarks have been known and described 29 for decades: amyloid-beta (A␤) senile plaques and 30 hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that form neurofib-31 rillary tangles (NFT) [1]. Extensive research has 32 shown that abnormal deposition of A␤ plaques and 33 NFTs leads to synaptic damage and eventually to Table 1 Studies that described non-demented individuals with AD neuropathology (NDAN), using different synonyms. These studies all focus on non-demented individuals with AD neuropathology or preclinical AD, studying brain tissue and/or data on cognitive performance. Cognitive assessment and AD pathology scores are specified in Tables 2 and 3, respectively Synonyms of NDAN Cohort study/Data set Reference Non-demented individuals with Alzheimer's Neuropathology (NDAN) Oregon Brain Bank at Oregon Health and Science University [9,10,223] Nondemented high potential controls (ND-HPC)</p>
<p>Banner Sun Health Research Institute: Brain and Body Donation Program [11] Asymptomatic person with AD neuropathology  NDAN and AD brain. Top left: Increase of (re)active microglia and astrocytes accompanied with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-␣) in AD. In NDAN brain glial activation is decreased and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-4, IL-10) levels are increased. Top right: In AD, proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs) is decreased and 'von Economo neurons' (VENs) are degenerated, while in NDAN NSC proliferation is increased as well as VEN density. Bottom left: Volume of the hippocampus and corpus collosum is increased in NDAN. Bottom right: In AD, A␤ oligomers are able to bind the postsynaptic membrane and induce synaptotoxicity. In NDAN, binding of A␤ oligomers is prevented. Overall grey matter volume shrinks in AD but increases in NDAN brain. In NDAN the cingulate gyrus is thicker, and the hippocampus is spared, or increased in some cases. Neurons: Neurogenesis is decreased, and brain plasticity is increased in normal aging. In AD, NSCs proliferate less in the subventricular zone and hippocampus and VEN cells degenerate. NSC proliferation in the hippocampus of NDAN brain is increased, as well as VEN density. Inflammation: Microglia and astrocyte response to pro-inflammatory cytokines is increased in normal aging hippocampus. Microglia and astrocytes become more (re)active in AD, due to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-␣). Glial activation is decreased in superior temporal sulcus of NDAN, as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) are increased. A␤: The molecular composition of A␤ molecules in normal aging is different than in AD and not distributed to specific areas. In AD, A␤ oligomers bind to synapses and induce synaptotoxicity. In NDAN, postsynaptic binding of A␤ oligomers is prevented by neuromodulators (Zn 2+ [230] and Reelin [232]), Insulin [235] and specific APP miRNAs [182]. Tau: NFT distribution in normal aging is restricted to specific areas: entorhinal cortex, olfactory nucleus, and parahippocampal gyrus [49]. NFT levels in these areas are elevated in AD and also spread to the neocortex. In NDAN, NFT formation is inhibited in the temporal cortex, due to lower 0N3R expression [236]. A proposed mechanism for NDAN is to investigate the composition and location of different tau species.</p>
<p>the mature subventricular zone of the lateral ventri- of AD pathology [109]. 451 In addition to the two hallmarks of AD (A␤ plaques 452 and NFT), neuroinflammation is considered to be the next most important contributor to the progression 454 of AD. Over the last decade, the importance of this 455 process has emerged more and more and in 2020, the 456 link between neuroinflammation and AD has been 457 elaborately discussed in reviews [110,111].  flammation in AD has been observed in human brain 459 tissue and on a molecular imaging level [112][113][114][115]. 460 More specifically, on the one hand, astrocytes become 461 more reactive in response to A␤, releasing pro-462 inflammatory cytokines [116,117]. On the other 463 hand, there is increased interest in the brains-resident 464 immune cell, the microglia. As explained earlier, 465 these particular glial cells are the resident immune 466 cells of the brain, that can phagocytose pathogens 467 and display antigens to activate T-lymphocytes [30]. 468 In AD, microglia play a major role in endocytosis 469 and degradation of soluble and fibrillar A␤ species In short, multiple processes in the brain are affected 544 by AD pathology (Fig. 2  performed regarding these NDAN cases (Table 1).</p>

<p>Although a variety of synonyms have been used, 749 some studies focus on a specific age interval and can provide useful insight into the resilience of AD.</p>

<p>POTENTIAL MECHANISMS</p>

<p>UNDERLYING NDAN</p>
<p>810</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, already multiple risk factors 811 for AD have been examined by previous researchers.   NDAN's resistance to cognitive decline [194][195][196][197][198]. about the cells that secrete them [224]. Moreover, </p>

<p>The key implication to draw from these two stud-1240 ies is that neurogenesis seems to be preserved in Interestingly, in the HP cases IL-1␤, IL-6, IL-13, 1319 and IL-4 were found to be upregulated, while IL-  Amyloid-β pathology 1351 One key player in the neuropathology of AD is A␤.     in older adults [44].

In longitudinal studies (e.g., cohort studies), the same subjects are observed at multiple points to cognitively normal elderly [14,190] </p>

<p>cles and the dentate gyrus part of the hippocampus 424 [98, 99]. As indicated previously, mild memory loss 425 is associated with "normal" aging, which could be the 426 result of region-specific neuronal alterations caused 427 by brain plasticity [100] (Fig. 2). Alternatively, neu-428 rogenesis in the hippocampus declines with age and 429 therefore causes potential complications in memory 430 function [101]. In AD, neurogenesis is impaired. 431 Studies in AD mice revealed that NSCs in the adult 432 subventricular zone proliferate less and fail to differ-433 entiate into healthy mature neurons [102]. Scopa et 434 al. (2020) concluded that neurogenesis in this zone 435 was already impaired in the early stages of AD, due 436 to A␤ oligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum of 437 NSCs. For many years, researchers speculated that 438 AD pathology affected neurogenesis and that neu-439 rogenetic misfunction correlated with neuronal loss 440 as seen in AD [103-105]. More recent attention has 441 focused on the groundwork of adult hippocampal 442 neurogenesis in over 90-year-old individuals with 443 MCI and AD [106, 107]. Specifically, MCI patients 444 showed reduced numbers of neuroblasts, premature 445 neurons originating from NSCs [107, 108]. This data 446 suggests that neurogenesis may already decline dur-447 ing MCI. In line with this finding, it is not surprising 448 that adult neurogenesis in the human hippocampus 449 was found to be impaired already in the early stages450</p>
<p>727
More recently, a group in Paris investigates the 728 compensation mechanisms in individuals with AD 729 lesions that maintain their cognitive capabilities. To 730 this aim, the "INveStIGation of AlzHeimer's Pre-731 dicTors" (INSIGHT-preAD) study was launched in 732 2013 and is still ongoing [172]. Within the INSIGHT-733 preAD cohort, positive amyloid deposition was found 734 in asymptomatic individuals [173]. Taken together, 735 these studies indicate the existence of a group of 736 elderly that do not develop dementia during their 737 life, despite the AD neuropathological burden in their 738 brains. Therefore, it is thought that other factors, or 739 maybe even an undetected hallmark in the pathol-740 ogy of AD, play an important role in altering the risk 741 for AD or the progression of AD. So, what distin-742 guishes NDAN individuals from normal AD patients 743 and "normal" aging, and what key features are still 744 missing? 745 As was pointed out in the introduction of this 746 review, already many different studies have been 747</p>
<p>others investigated the preclinical state of the dis-751 ease. Moreover, the conditions by which individuals 752 are labeled as NDAN differ between studies. Never-753 theless, all these studies have been investigating the 754 potential missing link between the two hallmarks of 755 AD and the cognitive outcome that is expected in 756 this disease. Already at the end of the last century, researchers tried to distinguish normal aging from 758 the preclinical state of AD, in which the quantity of 759 neuropathological changes has not yet affected cogni-760 tive behavior. Morris et al. (1996) discussed whether 761 the cerebral deposition of A␤ in nondemented elderly 762 indicated early AD in its presymptomatic phase or 763 simply "normal" aging [63]. Moreover, Schmitt et 764 al. (2000) referred to preclinical AD subjects as 765 having AD-like changes, but exhibiting no cogni-766 tive differences [64]. Moreover, they suggested that 767 the aging brain might cope with these changes and 768 remain normal cognitive functioning. Both Morris et 769 al. and Schmitt et al. refer to this phenomenon as 770 the delay in time between the pathological progres-771 sion and the expression of disease and symptoms. 772 Later researchers started to use the term cognitive 773 reserve (or buffer), in expectance that symptoms will 774 eventually occur [174, 175]. Another synonym that is 775 being used to describe NDAN specifically focusses 776 on non-demented individuals within a certain age 777 range. So did Maarouf et al. (2011) who described 778 a group cognitively intact nonagenarians with high 779 amyloid plaque loads and classified these as non-780 demented high pathology controls [11]. Similarly, the 781 term 'SuperAgers' was used to refer to 80-year-old 782 elderly, with a level of episodic memory that is equal 783 or better than those between 50-to 60-year-old [14, 784 15, 176, 177]. Alternatively, the group of Gómez-785 Isla described these non-demented individuals with 786 significant amounts of AD changes as high or inter-787 mediate probability mismatches or resilient to the AD 788 pathology [13, 178]. Additionally, scientists even use 789 different terms to refer to a non-symptomatic behav-790 ior of AD, dementia, observed in individuals with 791 significant AD neuropathology. The group of Tron-792 coso investigated asymptomatic AD (ASYMAD) in 793 BLSA and conducted their research on a histolog-794 ical, proteomic, and transcriptomic level [21, 179, 795 180]. Lastly, the synonym that is used in this review, 796 'NDAN', was already described by Zolochevska and 797 Taglialatela [9, 181, 182]. Altogether, these scientists 798 have all contributed to unravel the underlying mech-799 anisms that differentiate NDAN from normal aging 800 and AD. Some of these studies mainly focused on 801 delaying the effects of aging, as aging is an inevitable 802 process that can be seen as a risk factor for AD. At 803 the same time, delaying the effects of aging itself 804</p>
<p>812
These factors-age, gender, education, neuropathol-813 ogy, personality, genetics, lifestyle, and cognitive 814 function-can modify the onset and rate of decline 815 of AD and therefore also need to be considered in 816 NDAN research[56]. Morphological changes of the 817 brain and the neurons, inflammation, A␤, and tau818 have already been discussed in the context of normal 819 aging and AD (Fig. 2) and will here be discussed in 820 the context of NDAN. First, NDAN is discussed on an 821 organism level from an age, education, and cognitive 822 perspective. 823 NDAN on a body level 824 Typically in AD, patients encounter dementia-like 825 symptoms, including memory impairment, difficul-826 ties with language, and moving difficulties [183, 827 184]. Diagnostic classification of AD is initially exe-828 cuted using several cognitive performance tests on, 829 for instance, memory recalling, perceptual speed, 830 and verbal fluency. As explained earlier, patholog-831 ical diagnoses and cognitive testing is needed to 832 confirm the AD diagnosis, using Braak staging sys-833 tem, CERAD, and NIA-AA neuropathologic criteria 834 for AD. These neuropathologic criteria have also 835 been used to examine cognitive functioning in non-836 demented elderly [185]. The study by Bennett et al. 837 (2006) found that some of these non-demented indi-838 viduals were allocated with an intermediate or high 839 likelihood to develop AD, a crucial discovery, as it 840 demonstrates the heterogeneity in the extent to which 841 AD pathology correlates with cognitive impairment. 842 Several studies performed among different popu-843 lations worldwide have demonstrated A␤ aggregates 844 and NFT in 20-40% of the cognitively intact elderly 845 [63, 71, 186-190]. Specifically, the study performed 846 by Driscoll et al. (2006) assessed cognitive per-847 formances of cognitively normal elderly controls, 848 individuals with MCI or AD, and NDAN individ-849 uals over a time span of 16 years or longer [190].850 These individuals underwent prospective neuro-851 logical evaluations on several cognitive domains, 852 including memory, visuospatial abilities, attention, 853 and word knowledge, and eventually underwent 854 autopsy</p>
<p>these vesicles have been reported to spread patho-1221 logical proteins and lipids involved in AD [225]. 1222 To investigate whether exosomes originating from 1223 neuronal stem cells can prevent synaptic loss and 1224 memory impairment, Micci et al., 2019 cultured adult 1225 rat hippocampus NSCs and injected their exosomes 1226 intracerebroventricularly in healthy mice, and found 1227 that the NSC-secreted exosomes showed reduction in A␤ oligomer-binding to synapses, and neutraleffects, highlighting the importance of NSCs and 1233 neurogenesis. miRNA analysis of the exosomes orig-1234 inating from both cell cultures showed an enrichment 1235 of miR-485, miR-322, and miR-17 in NSC-derived 1236 exosomes. The use of miRNA mimics further vali-1237 dated the role of miR-17 and miR-485 in protecting 1238 synapses from A␤ oligomer-binding [223].</p>
<p>-10 were found to be upregulated in the 1321 IP resilient cases. This brings back the hypothe-1322 sis stated at the beginning of this section, namely 1323 that toxicity of AD pathology might depend on 1324 the balance between the classic pro-inflammatory 1325 M1 microglia population relative to the alternative 1326 anti-inflammatory, wound healing M2 microglia population, as classic activation of microglia (M1) is mainly mediated through TNF-␣, IL-1, IL-12, IL-23, have already been discussed on an organism, 1346 organ, and cellular level. For this section, several bio-1347 chemical mechanisms will be discussed as potential 1348 mechanisms that could explain the resilience to AD 1349 in NDAN individuals.</p>
<p>1352
Unfortunately, the amount of amyloid plaques used1353 to identify NDAN individuals differs per author, as 1354 is reflected in the different CERAD scores, a semi-1355 quantitative measure for neuritic amyloid plaques, in 1356</p>
<p>1377 ( 2012 )
13772012showed that the levels of A␤ plaques, tau tan-1378 gles, A␤ 42 , and low molecular weight A␤ oligomeric 1379 species in brains of NDAN were comparable to the 1380 levels in AD brains [230]. Despite the similar lev-1381 els of A␤ species in both AD and NDAN brains, A␤ 1382 oligomers did not bind the synapses nor affected the 1383 post-synaptic density. Interestingly, using immuno-1384 histochemistry and conformation-specific antibodies 1385 that recognized A␤ oligomer deposits (NAB61), 1386 Perez-Nievas et al. (2013) observed a significant 1387 decrease in the load of A␤ oligomeric deposits, in 1388 the group they termed 'high probability mismatches', 1389</p>
<p>ings were supported byBilousova et al. (2016), who1394    found higher levels of soluble oligomeric A␤ surviv-1395 ing within synaptic terminals in demented cases, but 1396 not inNDAN [231].1397    Furthermore, the study ofBjorklund et al. (2012)    1398 found that in contrast to AD cases, NDAN individ-1399 uals did not show A␤ oligomers in the hippocampal 1400 postsynapses, even though the A␤ oligomers were 1401 present in the 'soluble fraction' of the synaptic frac-1402 tionation performed on the hippocampal tissue [230].1403 This observation is crucial because it suggests that A␤ 1404 oligomeric binding to synapses is needed to maneu-1405 ver AD pathology into dementia and furthermore 1406 suggests a potential safety mechanism in NDAN 1407 that prevent binding to synapses. Interestingly, in 1408 line with this hypothesis, the same study showed 1409 that while the hippocampi of AD cases contained 1410 elevated synaptic Zn 2+ levels, both in the 'soluble 1411 fraction' and the synaptic vesicles, NDAN cases only 1412 showed elevated levels of Zn 2+ at the synaptic vesi-1413 cles [230]. These findings correlated with regular 1414 expression of the synaptic Zn 2+ transporter ZnT3, 1415 which was impaired in the AD cases [230]. These 1416 findings indicate that NDAN cases can better main-1417 tain synaptic Zn 2+ homeostasis and thereby regulate 1418 synaptic binding of A␤ oligomers. This understand-1419 ing is crucial because it could lead to new therapeutic 1420 insights to prevent AD.1421 As discussed in the section AD on a biochemical 1422 level, amyloid-␤ pathology, soluble A␤ oligomers 1423 induce synaptic damage thereby leading to inhibi-1424 tion of long-term potentiation [148]. Interestingly, 1425 the neuromodulator Reelin has been suggested to 1426 have an A␤-antagonist-like function at the synapses 1427 [232]. Typically, Reelin contributes to the regulation 1428 of neuronal migration in the brain development by 1429 controlling cell-cell interactions mediated by bind-1430 ing to the postsynaptic APOE receptors VLDLR 1431 and APOER2. By binding to VLDLR and APOER2, 1432 Reelin is thought to counteract A␤-induced synaptic 1433 suppression [232]. Interestingly, also elevated levels 1434 of Reelin were observed in the hippocampal pyrami-1435 dal neurons of NDAN individuals [233], suggesting a 1436 potential compensatory mechanism. However, Reelin 1437 was also upregulated in the cortex and CSF of patients 1438 with AD [234], and it has been proposed that ele-1439 vated levels of Reelin do not necessarily contribute 1440 to, or are not sufficient for, the resistance of AD culture models, De Felice et al. (2009) 1446 observed that soluble A␤ oligomers induced down-1447 regulation of the insulin receptor at the plasma 1448 membrane [235]. In fact, adding insulin itself pre-1449 vented not only binding of soluble A␤ oligomers to 1450 the synapses and downregulation of the insulin recep-1451 tor, but was also able to abolish A␤-induced oxidative 1452 stress and able to prevent A␤-mediated synapse loss 1453 [235]. Interestingly, the protective role of insulin 1454 dependent on the kinase activity of the receptor, 1455 indicating that insulin signaling is responsible for 1456 the protective effect. In a review paper, Taglialatela 1457 reported unpublished data on decreased signaling 1458 components of the insulin transduction pathway in 1459 AD hippocampi compared to controls and NDAN 1460 [181]. Furthermore, in the hippocampus of NDAN 1461 individuals an even higher pathway activation was 1462 observed compared to AD and controls cases [181]. 1463 Overall, this suggests that maintenance of the insulin 1464 signaling pathway contributes to the preservation of 1465 synapses and cognitive integrity.1466 As described before in the context of neurons in 1467 NDAN, NSC-secreted exosomes were able to prevent 1468 synaptic degradation through upregulation of specific 1469 miRNAs [223]. In line with this finding, the synaptic 1470 miRNA expression was investigated in hippocam-1471 pal tissue of NDAN subjects [182]. Specifically, 1472 they identified three miRNAs, miRNA-485, miRNA-1473 4723, and miRNA-149, to be differently expressed in 1474 hippocampal tissue of NDAN and AD, compared to 1475 controls [182]. All three miRNAs regulate the pro-1476 tein expression of synaptic genes, such as APP and 1477 ␤-secretase 1, and intracerebroventricularly adminis-1478 tration to adult wild-type mice resulted in increased 1479 synaptic resilience to A␤ oligomers [182]. While a 1480 very interesting discovery, focus lied on upregula-1481 tion of these miRNAs, knockdown studies in cell 1482 culture systems and/or animals would provide cru-1483 cial insights whether the disruption of these miRNAs 1484 will lead to or enhance A␤-toxicity. 1485 Overall, it seems that A␤ oligomers bind to 1486 synapses, thereby resulting in synaptic dysfunction 1487 in AD. Various observations in NDAN individu-1488 als together gave insights on potential mechanisms 1489 preventing A␤-mediated synapse loss: better main-1490 tained Zn 2+ homeostasis, upregulation of Reelin, 1491 increased levels of insulin signaling components, 1492 and miRNAs that regulate the protein expression of APP and ␤-secretase genes in synapses. However, key player in the neuropathology of 1503 AD is aggregation of the protein tau. Similar to A␤ 1504 aggregation, tau aggregation can also be observed 1505 in normal aging (section on Normal aging). One of 1506 the biochemical mechanisms that could potentially 1507 be underlying NDAN resistance to AD pathology is 1508 the inhibition of NFT formation resulting from for 1509 instance changes in tau isoform expression, as well as 1510 changes in activities of tau kinases and phosphatases.1511One study investigated tau isoforms in brain areas 1512 affected and unaffected by NFT, in both AD and con-1513 trol using RT-PCR and they showed that the relative 1514 expression of tau isoform 0N3R was higher in the 1515 affected temporal cortex than in the unaffected cere-1516 bellar cortex, in bothAD and control [236]. It would 1517 be interesting to investigate the tau isoform expres-1518 sion in NDAN to provide more inside into the NFT 1519 formation in NDAN. As was pointed out in the section 1520 "normal" aging, tau deposition is generally observed 1521</p>
<p>of individuals with Braak stages V and VI were sig-1552 nificantly different from each other. Therefore it was 1553 stated in this paper that these two Braak stages should 1554 not be combined in the determination of NDAN 1555 individuals [193]. Moreover, there were no cogni-1556 tive intact individuals found with the highest Braak 1557 stage in this study. Therefore, it is necessary to form 1558 concrete inclusion criteria to categorize NDAN indiand changes in gene expression in 1562 NDAN brains can provide insight into the upstream 1563 mechanism underlying dementia. Liang et al. (2010) 1564 performed postmortem transcriptomics analysis on 1565 6 different brain regions comparing AD individu-1566 als, NDAN individuals, and healthy elderly controls 1567 [237]. They found that, while both NDAD and AD 1568 brains showed similar expression changes in tangle-1569 and plaque related pathways and ubiquitin-pro-1570 teasomal pathways, NDAN individuals displayed 1571 unique expression changes in most brain regions 1572 in genes correlating with learning and/or memory 1573 processes. More specifically, they found a downreg-1574 ulation several genes, including APOE, while genes 1575 such as MAPT and ephrin-B2, involved in cell-1576 cell signaling and mediating neural development, 1577 were upregulated [237]. These finding suggest that 1578 the transcriptomic changes may represent compen-1579 satory mechanisms against cognitive decline. This 1580 study stresses the importance of transcriptomic in 1581 the quest to unravel underlying mechanisms, focus-1582 ing on expression of notorious AD-related genes.</p>
<p>in time, whereas cross-sectional studies take a snap-1752 shot by investigating a population at a fixed time 1753 point, for example, postmortem. Looking at the con-1754 tribution of time in the presented studies, a limitation 1755 of postmortem brain analysis in cross-sectional stud-1756 ies is the absence of information on the subjects' 1757 brain during life. The NDAN subjects in the stud-1758 ies described in this review had intermediate to high 1759 AD pathology in their brains. However, it could never 1760 be confirmed with certainty that these subjects would 1761 not eventually have developed dementia and a cer-1762 tain time delay between cognitive testing and death 1763 is inevitable. As discussed in the section NDAN on 1764 a body level, both Driscoll et al. (2006) and Dang 1765 et al. (2019) observed that cognitive functioning of 1766 their NDAN group declined over time, comparable 1767</p>
<p>progression. The impact on AD progression is par-the early stages of AD pathophysiology, breakdown and dysfunction of the BBB occurs. This BBB breakdown results in leakage throughout the cerebrum, due to dilatation of the BBB's tight junctions[134]. The integrity of these tight junctions is,470 </p>
<p>[29]. Initially, this process is beneficial to prevent </p>
<p>471 </p>
<p>A␤ accumulation, but as soon as the A␤ levels </p>
<p>472 </p>
<p>are chronically elevated, microglia activation will </p>
<p>473 </p>
<p>result in prolonged inflammation and enhances AD </p>
<p>474 </p>
<p>475 </p>
<p>ticularly influenced by the phenotype of microglia </p>
<p>476 </p>
<p>(M1 or M2) involved, as type M1 microglia enhance </p>
<p>477 </p>
<p>cellular immune responses while type M2 inhibit </p>
<p>478 </p>
<p>classic inflammation and promote wound healing </p>
<p>479 </p>
<p>[118, 119]. The mixed population of microglia results </p>
<p>480 </p>
<p>in a heterogenic neuroinflammatory response that </p>
<p>481 </p>
<p>influences AD progression and effectiveness of pos-</p>
<p>482 </p>
<p>sible treatments, notably in adults with early AD </p>
<p>483 </p>
<p>[112]. </p>
<p>484 </p>
<p>Besides (re)active glial cells, several cytokines </p>
<p>485 </p>
<p>have been associated with AD. The deposition of </p>
<p>486 </p>
<p>A␤ activates astrocytes and microglia that trigger </p>
<p>487 </p>
<p>the secretion of several inflammatory cytokines. </p>
<p>488 </p>
<p>Firstly, interleukin (IL)-1 can increase A␤PP syn-</p>
<p>489 </p>
<p>thesis and secretion, and subsequently generation </p>
<p>490 </p>
<p>of A␤ [120]. Furthermore, microglial production </p>
<p>491 </p>
<p>of IL-1 activates the p38 mitogen-activated protein </p>
<p>492 </p>
<p>kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway and thereby increases </p>
<p>493 </p>
<p>the phosphorylation of tau [121]. Secondly, elevated </p>
<p>494 </p>
<p>levels of IL-6 have been found in AD brains, which </p>
<p>495 </p>
<p>can increase the expression of A␤PP as well [122]. </p>
<p>496 </p>
<p>Thirdly, IL-10 inhibits the macrophagic function of </p>
<p>497 </p>
<p>microglia and thereby indirectly decreases cerebral </p>
<p>498 </p>
<p>A␤ clearance [123]. Lastly, tumor necrosis factor </p>
<p>499 </p>
<p>(TNF)-␣ stimulates the activity of ␥-secretase, result-</p>
<p>500 </p>
<p>ing in an increased production of A␤ from A␤PP </p>
<p>501 </p>
<p>[120]. Increased levels of this pro-inflammatory </p>
<p>502 </p>
<p>cytokine were also found in CSF and blood of MCI </p>
<p>503 </p>
<p>patients, who later progressed to AD [124]. More-</p>
<p>504 </p>
<p>over, results from a cell culture study indicated </p>
<p>505 </p>
<p>that microglia, when activated by A␤, release </p>
<p>506 </p>
<p>reactive oxygen species and also TNF-␣, creat-</p>
<p>507 </p>
<p>ing a positive feedback loop of enhanced A␤ and </p>
<p>508 </p>
<p>microglial induced inflammation [125]. Together, </p>
<p>509 </p>
<p>these cytokines affect the proliferation and survival of </p>
<p>510 </p>
<p>both neurons and NSCs and enhance the progression </p>
<p>511 </p>
<p>of AD. To conclude, these studies clearly indicate </p>
<p>512 </p>
<p>that there is a strong relationship between neuroin-</p>
<p>513 </p>
<p>flammation and the progression of AD, which needs </p>
<p>514 </p>
<p>to be considered in the pathology of the disease. </p>
<p>515 </p>
<p>In literature, many different theories of AD eti-</p>
<p>516 </p>
<p>ology have been proposed, including the vascular </p>
<p>517 </p>
<p>hypothesis that states a reduction in CBF [126]. The </p>
<p>518 </p>
<p>reduction in CBF may result from blood-brain bar-</p>
<p>519 </p>
<p>rier (BBB) dysfunction as indicated by recent studies </p>
<p>520 </p>
<p>[127-132], suggesting a potential causal relationship </p>
<p>521 </p>
<p>between AD and cardiovascular dysfunction. Under </p>
<p>522 </p>
<p>healthy conditions, the BBB protects the brain by </p>
<p>523 </p>
<p>preventing access for blood cells, pathogens, and </p>
<p>524 </p>
<p>neurotoxic components in the blood [133]. During </p>
<p>525 </p>
<p>526 </p>
<p>527 </p>
<p>528 </p>
<p>529 </p>
<p>530 </p>
<p>among others, regulated by APOE, which is, as men-</p>
<p>531 </p>
<p>tioned above, an extensively investigated risk gene </p>
<p>532 </p>
<p>in AD research [135]. Additionally, another study </p>
<p>533 </p>
<p>showed that increased BBB permeability resulted </p>
<p>534 </p>
<p>from A␤-induced pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic </p>
<p>535 </p>
<p>events [136]. Together, this indicates that AD is </p>
<p>536 </p>
<p>indirectly associated with increased BBB permeabil-</p>
<p>537 </p>
<p>ity. Furthermore, Montagne et al. (2015) observed a </p>
<p>538 </p>
<p>breakdown of the BBB in hippocampal areas, CA1, </p>
<p>539 </p>
<p>and dentate gyrus in healthy elderly [127]. These find-</p>
<p>540 </p>
<p>ings suggest that the breakdown of BBB contributes </p>
<p>541 </p>
<p>to the cognitive impaired symptoms that are associ-</p>
<p>542 </p>
<p>ated with aging and AD. </p>
<p>543 </p>
<p>). In AD, neurons degener-545 </p>
<p>ate, while the formation of new neurons is impaired </p>
<p>546 </p>
<p>at the same time. Moreover, astrocytes and microglia </p>
<p>547 </p>
<p>become reactive in the presence of A␤, triggering the </p>
<p>548 </p>
<p>release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. This </p>
<p>549 </p>
<p>cytokine release could be associated with the decline </p>
<p>550 </p>
<p>observed in BBB tight junction integrity, causing </p>
<p>551 </p>
<p>more neurotoxic components to enter the brain and </p>
<p>552 </p>
<p>inducing an immune response. Furthermore, CBF </p>
<p>553 </p>
<p>is reduced in AD brains, suggesting a decrease in </p>
<p>554 </p>
<p>blood supply and decreased synaptic activity. All </p>
<p>555 </p>
<p>these mechanisms can be caused by A␤ and NFT </p>
<p>556 </p>
<p>pathology of AD, which will be discussed next. 
AD on a biochemical level </p>
<p>557 </p>
<p>Amyloid-β pathology </p>
<p>558 </p>
<p>The A␤ molecules exist of peptides derived from </p>
<p>559 </p>
<p>A␤PP; an integral membrane protein expressed in </p>
<p>560 </p>
<p>synapses. It is thought that A␤PP functions as a regu-</p>
<p>561 </p>
<p>lator of neural plasticity and synapse formation [137, </p>
<p>562 </p>
<p>138]. Mouse studies suggested that A␤PP plays an </p>
<p>563 </p>
<p>important factor in neurogenesis, as APP-/-mice </p>
<p>564 </p>
<p>showed no increase in neuronal proliferation and </p>
<p>565 </p>
<p>reduction in brain weight [139]. Nevertheless, A␤PP </p>
<p>566 </p>
<p>itself is not responsible for the pathological devel-</p>
<p>567 </p>
<p>opment occurring in AD. When A␤PP is cleaved by </p>
<p>568 </p>
<p>␤-and ␥-secretase, it generates A␤ peptides from dif-</p>
<p>569 </p>
<p>ferent sizes [140-142]. These A␤ isoforms vary from </p>
<p>570 </p>
<p>30 to 51 amino acid residues. The two most preva-</p>
<p>571 </p>
<p>lent isoforms are A␤ 40 and A␤ 42 , which are produced </p>
<p>572 </p>
<p>in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells. The ratio of </p>
<p>573 </p>
<p>A␤ 42/40 is an important factor to determine fibril-</p>
<p>574 </p>
<p>lar formation and consequent toxicity of A␤ [143]. </p>
<p>575 </p>
<p>A␤ 40 is produced in the trans-Golgi network, while </p>
<p>576 </p>
<p>A␤ 42 is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) </p>
<p>577 </p>
<p>[144]. Especially, the ER-derived isoform, A␤ 42 , is </p>
<p>578 </p>
<p>notorious as it is best at misfolding and forming the </p>
<p>579 </p>
<p>toxic A␤ oligomers [145] and consequently, with a </p>
<p>580 </p>
<p>higher ratio of A␤ 42/40 more toxic oligomers are </p>
<p>581 </p>
<p>formed. Neuronal cell culture studies demonstrated </p>
<p>582 </p>
<p>that A␤ oligomer exposure induced cell death, which </p>
<p>583 </p>
<p>was mediated by acute toxicity triggered by oxidative </p>
<p>584 </p>
<p>stress [146, 147]. </p>
<p>585 </p>
<p>Not only insoluble A␤ oligomers (which lead to </p>
<p>586 </p>
<p>plaque formation), but also soluble A␤ oligomers </p>
<p>587 </p>
<p>(Fig. 3) play an important role in the pathology of AD </p>
<p>588 </p>
<p>[148] and the presence of high A␤ oligomer levels in </p>
<p>589 </p>
<p>CSF of AD patients may indicate an increased risk </p>
<p>590 </p>
<p>of AD [149]. In another study, significantly higher </p>
<p>591 </p>
<p>levels of A␤ oligomers were found in CSF samples </p>
<p>592 </p>
<p>from AD patients compared to controls, as well as an </p>
<p>593 </p>
<p>elevated ratio of A␤ oligomers to A␤ 42 [150], which, </p>
<p>594 </p>
<p>in A␤PP-expressing cultured cell lines, were associ-</p>
<p>595 </p>
<p>ated with loss of dendritic spines and loss of synaptic </p>
<p>596 </p>
<p>function [46]. This observation is crucial because A␤ </p>
<p>597 </p>
<p>oligomer-induced synaptic loss results in disruption </p>
<p>598 </p>
<p>of neuronal communication. </p>
<p>599 </p>
<p>Shankar et al. (2008) also found that these A␤ </p>
<p>600 </p>
<p>oligomers were bound to the synapses and inhibited </p>
<p>601 </p>
<p>long-term potentiation, while enhancing long-term </p>
<p>602 </p>
<p>depression (LTD). Enhancing LTD in the hippocam-</p>
<p>603 </p>
<p>pus, together with the reduced dendritic spine density, </p>
<p>604 </p>
<p>eventually results in interruption of memory and </p>
<p>605 </p>
<p>learning ability. Furthermore, Shankar et al. (2008) </p>
<p>606 </p>
<p>illustrated the synaptotoxic role of A␤ dimers in this </p>
<p>607 </p>
<p>process, as A␤ dimers solubilize amyloid plaques </p>
<p>608 </p>
<p>and disrupt glutamatergic synaptic transmission that </p>
<p>609 </p>
<p>is necessary for the LTD. It is believed that the mis-</p>
<p>610 </p>
<p>folded A␤ fulfills a prion function: misfolded proteins </p>
<p>611 </p>
<p>that can convey their misfolded shape onto other pro-</p>
<p>612 </p>
<p>teins [151-153]. Not only A␤, but also tau proteins </p>
<p>613 </p>
<p>can be misshaped as a result of these misfolded A␤ </p>
<p>614 </p>
<p>[154]. The toxic behavior of misfolding also perturbs </p>
<p>615 </p>
<p>when misfolded A␤ and tau enter neurons which </p>
<p>616 </p>
<p>contained properly folded and functioning A␤ and </p>
<p>617 </p>
<p>tau. </p>
<p>618 </p>
<p>To detect A␤ plaques, a radioactive analogue of </p>
<p>619 </p>
<p>thioflavin T, Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) is used. </p>
<p>620 </p>
<p>This compound, 2-(4'-[ 11 C]methylaminophenyl)-6-</p>
<p>621 </p>
<p>hydroxybenzothiazole ( 11 C-PiB), can bind to A␤ </p>
<p>622 </p>
<p>fibrils and is visible through PET imaging [155]. </p>
<p>623 </p>
<p>Binding of 11 C-PiB to A␤ enables us to diagnose AD </p>
<p>624 </p>
<p>pathology and investigate the areas that are affected </p>
<p>625 </p>
<p>by A␤. Yet, A␤ pathology was not significantly </p>
<p>626 </p>
<p>associated with cognitive AD symptoms and had, </p>
<p>627 </p>
<p>therefore, no predictive advantage, while NFT does </p>
<p>628 </p>
<p>[156] (see below). This conclusion contradicts that </p>
<p>629 </p>
<p>of Pike et al. (2007) who found a strong correlation </p>
<p>630 </p>
<p>between impaired episodic memory and increased </p>
<p>631 </p>
<p>binding of PiB [157]. But, as impaired episodic mem-</p>
<p>632 </p>
<p>ory is not the only symptom indicative for AD, this </p>
<p>633 </p>
<p>approach can be used to fulfil some of the antemortem </p>
<p>634 </p>
<p>detection of A␤, but cannot assess the degree of cog-</p>
<p>635 </p>
<p>nitive impairment. </p>
<p>636 </p>
<p>Tau pathology </p>
<p>637 </p>
<p>The other hallmark of AD are tau proteins, which </p>
<p>638 </p>
<p>aggregates into NFTs. Under healthy conditions, </p>
<p>639 </p>
<p>tau proteins are highly soluble proteins with differ-</p>
<p>640 </p>
<p>ent isoforms produced by alternative splicing from </p>
<p>641 </p>
<p>the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene </p>
<p>642 </p>
<p>[158] (Supplementary Figure 1). Primarily, the role </p>
<p>643 </p>
<p>of tau in the central nervous system is to stabilize the </p>
<p>644 </p>
<p>microtubules in axons; however, these proteins can </p>
<p>645 </p>
<p>also be expressed in non-neuronal cells, including </p>
<p>646 </p>
<p>astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [159]. Tau proteins </p>
<p>647 </p>
<p>can become phosphorylated by different protein </p>
<p>648 </p>
<p>kinases on various sites that regulate microtubule </p>
<p>649 </p>
<p>binding [160]. In total approximately 45 phosphory-</p>
<p>650 </p>
<p>lation sites have been reported, either being tyrosine, </p>
<p>651 </p>
<p>threonine, or serine residues (Supplementary Fig-</p>
<p>652 </p>
<p>ure 2). Phosphorylation of these different residues </p>
<p>653 </p>
<p>is regulated by different kinases including GSK-</p>
<p>654 </p>
<p>3, PKN, and CDK5 [161, 162]. Phosphorylation </p>
<p>655 </p>
<p>interferes with microtubule binding; consequently, </p>
<p>656 </p>
<p>the hyperphosphorylated state of tau decreases the 
solubility of the protein, resulting in its aggregation </p>
<p>658 </p>
<p>into bundles of paired helical filaments, the NFTs </p>
<p>659 </p>
<p>[163]. During AD, this hyperphosphorylated, insol-</p>
<p>660 </p>
<p>uble form can no longer bind and stabilize the </p>
<p>661 </p>
<p>microtubules, and therefore indirectly demolishes the </p>
<p>662 </p>
<p>microtubules, thereby weakening the cytoskeleton </p>
<p>663 </p>
<p>and obstructing axonal transport [161]. Inhibition of </p>
<p>664 </p>
<p>axonal transport can lead to oxidative stress in mito-</p>
<p>665 </p>
<p>chondria and eventually cell death [164]. Moreover, </p>
<p>666 </p>
<p>tau's indirect inhibition of axonal transport leads to </p>
<p>667 </p>
<p>the accumulation of A␤PP, the precursor of the other </p>
<p>668 </p>
<p>AD hallmark (see the section on Amyloid-␤ pathol-</p>
<p>669 </p>
<p>ogy above). The quantity and distribution pattern of </p>
<p>670 </p>
<p>tau correlate with the degree of decreasing cogni-</p>
<p>671 </p>
<p>tive performance and memory in AD. Tau staining </p>
<p>672 </p>
<p>is performed using silver and immunohistochemical </p>
<p>673 </p>
<p>staining for hyperphosphorylated tau [72, 73]. As dis-</p>
<p>674 </p>
<p>cussed previously (see the sections AD on a body &amp; </p>
<p>675 </p>
<p>organ level above), the Braak staging system is based </p>
<p>676 </p>
<p>on the deposition of tau, the formation of NFT and </p>
<p>677 </p>
<p>neuropil threads in neurites [72, 73]. Apart from this </p>
<p>678 </p>
<p>system to identify AD stages, Braak et al. pointed </p>
<p>679 </p>
<p>out the importance of hyperphosphorylation of tau, </p>
<p>680 </p>
<p>as accumulation of tau already starts years before the </p>
<p>681 </p>
<p>first signs of AD occur. This highlights the impor-</p>
<p>682 </p>
<p>tance of tau as a valuable hallmark for AD. However, </p>
<p>683 </p>
<p>NFT distribution was also seen in "normal" aging </p>
<p>684 </p>
<p>(Fig. 2); therefore, it is important to also investigate </p>
<p>685 </p>
<p>the distribution and composition of tau species in </p>
<p>686 </p>
<p>NDAN. </p>
<p>687 </p>
<p>NON-DEMENTED INDIVIDUALS WITH </p>
<p>688 </p>
<p>AD NEUROPATHOLOGY </p>
<p>689 </p>
<p>Until the past decade, researchers in the field of </p>
<p>690 </p>
<p>AD have been focusing on the link between the clin-</p>
<p>691 </p>
<p>ical symptoms of dementia and the two hallmarks: </p>
<p>692 </p>
<p>A␤ and tau. However, several longitudinal, cohort </p>
<p>693 </p>
<p>studies have been suggesting that it is not as straight-</p>
<p>694 </p>
<p>forward as was anticipated. One review discussed </p>
<p>695 </p>
<p>demented patients, without amyloid or tau pathology, </p>
<p>696 </p>
<p>as well as cognitively intact individuals with severe </p>
<p>697 </p>
<p>AD pathology [165]. Nelson et al. (2009) illustrated </p>
<p>698 </p>
<p>that individuals without or with mild dementia tend to </p>
<p>699 </p>
<p>have less NFT counts in the neocortex, while when </p>
<p>700 </p>
<p>NFT counts are over a certain threshold, cognitive </p>
<p>701 </p>
<p>impairment is inescapable. Moreover, in cases with </p>
<p>702 </p>
<p>many NFT counts, the combined amount neuritic </p>
<p>703 </p>
<p>and diffuse amyloid plaques was increased. There-</p>
<p>704 </p>
<p>fore, Nelson et al. (2009) strongly agreed with the </p>
<p>705 </p>
<p>clinical-pathological correlation of NFT and neuritic </p>
<p>706 </p>
<p>and diffuse amyloid plaques to cognitive impairment. </p>
<p>707 </p>
<p>In 1958, the BLSA started investigating the normal </p>
<p>708 </p>
<p>progression of aging [22]. In this program, the pres-</p>
<p>709 </p>
<p>ence of AD neuropathological changes was found </p>
<p>710 </p>
<p>in several of the autopsies of individuals that dis-</p>
<p>711 </p>
<p>played normal, non-demented behavior prior to their </p>
<p>712 </p>
<p>death. Another longitudinal aging study, the Nun </p>
<p>713 </p>
<p>Study (1986), found that 12% of the cognitively </p>
<p>714 </p>
<p>intact participants showed abundant A␤ plaques and </p>
<p>715 </p>
<p>NFT during postmortem examination [166-168]. </p>
<p>716 </p>
<p>After the successful findings of the Nun Study, the </p>
<p>717 </p>
<p>Rush Religious Orders Study (1992) was executed </p>
<p>718 </p>
<p>[169]. The Rush Religious Orders researchers, Ben-</p>
<p>719 </p>
<p>nett and Schneider, found that one-third of older </p>
<p>720 </p>
<p>people's brains had serious AD lesions, while these </p>
<p>721 </p>
<p>people were not cognitively impaired. Not only in </p>
<p>722 </p>
<p>America, but also in Australia an aging and AD </p>
<p>723 </p>
<p>study was launched in 2004: the Australian Imag-</p>
<p>724 </p>
<p>ing, Biomarker &amp; Lifestyle Flagship (AIBL) Study </p>
<p>725 </p>
<p>[14, 170], and found a significant A␤ deposition in </p>
<p>726 </p>
<p>the brains of some non-demented individuals [171]. </p>
<p>. Interestingly, the authors found that the cog-NDAN that are resistant to neurodegeneration associated withage and A␤ [14]. In this study, SuperAgers pared to control subjects. It can thus be suggested that these individuals are resilient to AD pathology.Since the discovery of NDAN cases, an Alzthe NIA-AA) which would allow for the separation877 of NDAN individuals from typical AD patients [71]. Consequently, many researchers started assessing the 879 cognitive function of their subjects using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score and/or MMSE 881(Table 2)[191, 192]. Most of the cited studies sumstudies and that the group of NDAN individuals is rare or at least difficult to recruit or study. Some scientists analyzed the clinical-pathological correlation by investigating the correlation between MMSE scores and Braak stages[193]. According to these authors, 892 a "ultimate NDAN", having a MMSE score of 30 and end-stage tau pathology combined in one individual, did not exist in their analyzed datasets of 3,310 cases. This outcome provides another prospective in the NDAN research. However, the research goal is not to find and then study the "ultimate NDAN", but to gain insights in the missing link between the currently accepted AD pathology and the actual clinical AD outcome. To achieve this goal, the "ultimate NDAN" cannot and does not have to be the golden standard for NDAN. However, it remains debatable what would be the best cut-off point of the MMSE or CDR score to Looking at scoring the cognitive functions of individuals, the CDR is used to distinguish three stages of dementia from healthy individuals, based on their performance in memory, orientation, problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care[191]. Each category is scored independently ing healthy or very questionable dementia (Table 2).The study ofUpadhaya et al. (2014)  had two855 </p>

<p>856 </p>
<p>individuals and NDAN, declines similarly, whereas 
the cognitive trajectories of individuals with AD or </p>

<p>MCI showed an accelerated decline. Surprisingly, </p>
<p>859 </p>
<p>this accelerated decline could be observed already </p>
<p>860 </p>
<p>prior to the diagnosis of AD or MCI. In other studies, </p>

<p>And another study suggested that a higher cognitive MCI or AD, regardless of cognitive reserve. rCBF could be observed in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and anterior insula over time[17].Despite the limited sample size in this BLSA study, it can be hypothesized that the resilience observed in NDAN individuals could be mostly contributed to the 1151 hippocampal area, the main affected area by AD.As was briefly introduced in the previous sec-be that neurogenesis is preserved in NDAN individuals. In agreement with this hypothesis, a recent study found an elevated amount of NSCs and newly 1199 matured neurons in NDAN individuals[9].

Interestingly, a positive correlation was found between the fraction of SOX2 positive cells and cognitive functioning prior to death.971 </p>

<p>982 </p>
<p>1990, Katzman et al. reported that lower education </p>
<p>983 </p>
<p>was indicative for a higher AD prevalence [200]. </p>
<p>984 </p>
<p>The Rotterdam Study confirmed these results, as </p>
<p>985 </p>
<p>they found as well that an increased risk of AD was </p>
<p>986 </p>
<p>associated with a lower educational level [201]. Addi-</p>
<p>987 </p>
<p>tionally, a meta-analysis suggested that for every year </p>
<p>988 </p>
<p>increase in education, the prevalence of dementia was </p>
<p>989 </p>
<p>diminished by 7% [202]. Hence, it could conceivably </p>
<p>990 </p>
<p>be hypothesized that NDAN individuals attained a </p>
<p>991 </p>
<p>higher education level than AD individuals. In line </p>
<p>992 </p>
<p>with this hypothesis, Iacono et al. (2015) investi-</p>
<p>993 </p>
<p>gated the level of education of subjects from the Nun </p>
<p>994 </p>
<p>Study [18]. These authors found a significantly higher </p>
<p>995 </p>
<p>level of education (Masters or higher) in NDAN cases </p>
<p>996 </p>
<p>(61.5%), compared to both MCI (33.3%) and AD </p>
<p>997 </p>
<p>(29.3%) subjects. Similarly, in SuperAgers, cogni-</p>
<p>998 </p>
<p>tive reserve was suggested to be mainly developed </p>
<p>999 </p>
<p>over years of education [203]. Moreover, this link </p>
<p>1000 </p>
<p>between level of education and dementia was thought </p>
<p>1001 </p>
<p>to be caused by the putative unhealthy lifestyles of </p>
<p>1002 </p>
<p>lower educated individuals. In an attempt to evaluate </p>
<p>1003 </p>
<p>this hypothesis, Ngandu et al. (2007) demonstrated </p>
<p>1004 </p>
<p>that unhealthy lifestyles may only independently </p>
<p>1005 </p>
<p>contribute to reduction of cognitive reserve, not con-</p>
<p>1006 </p>
<p>tribute to increased prevalence of AD itself [204]. </p>
<p>1007 </p>
<p>With respect to the mechanisms underlying education </p>
<p>1008 </p>
<p>and cognitive function in AD, researchers proposed </p>
<p>1009 </p>
<p>that this was only associated with amyloid, not NFT </p>
<p>1010 </p>
<p>[205]. To conclude, considering all this evidence it </p>
<p>1011 </p>
<p>seems that NDAN individuals generally attended a </p>
<p>1012 </p>
<p>higher educational level and/or were educated for </p>
<p>1013 </p>
<p>a longer time, resulting in an increased cognitive </p>
<p>1014 </p>
<p>reserve. </p>
<p>1015 </p>
<p>So higher educated individuals seem to have a </p>
<p>1016 </p>
<p>greater reserve. However, when individuals with a </p>
<p>1017 </p>
<p>higher IQ do decline, the terminal cognitive decline </p>
<p>1018 </p>
<p>is much steeper compared to individuals with a lower </p>
<p>1019 </p>
<p>IQ, as was concluded by investigating the rate and </p>
<p>1020 </p>
<p>acceleration of cognitive decline in the final years </p>
<p>1021 </p>
<p>of disease prior to death [206]. Additionally, another </p>
<p>1022 </p>
<p>recently published study, which did not specifically </p>
<p>1023 </p>
<p>look at IQ, but that investigated person-specific cog-</p>
<p>1024 </p>
<p>nitive trajectories, also found that terminal decline </p>

<p>contributes on average for about 70% to late-life 
As was mentioned before, AD is characterized by </p>
<p>1041 </p>
<p>neuronal atrophy in various regions of the brain (see </p>
<p>1042 </p>
<p>the section on AD on an organ level). Various sub-</p>
<p>1043 </p>
<p>types of AD have been described in this section, </p>
<p>1044 </p>
<p>including cognitively impaired individuals without </p>
<p>1045 </p>
<p>any hippocampal or cortical atrophy [90]. A possi-</p>
<p>1046 </p>
<p>ble explanation for these subtypes may be the lack of </p>
<p>1047 </p>
<p>adequate knowledge in the pathology, one link that </p>
<p>1048 </p>
<p>is repeatedly observed in NDAN. Are NDAN brains </p>
<p>1049 </p>
<p>resilient to AD pathology or do they also encounter </p>
<p>1050 </p>
<p>atrophy? </p>
<p>1051 </p>
<p>Hippocampal volume </p>
<p>1052 </p>
<p>The volume of the hippocampus is an indepen-</p>
<p>1053 </p>
<p>dent criterion to distinguish between healthy and </p>
<p>1054 </p>
<p>AD individuals. In one of the investigations from </p>
<p>1055 </p>
<p>the Nun Study, they found that AD neuropathology </p>
<p>1056 </p>
<p>was associated with a reduction of the hippocam-</p>
<p>1057 </p>
<p>pal volume and that the brains of NDAN individuals </p>
<p>1058 </p>
<p>did show hippocampal atrophy [209]. In contrast to </p>
<p>1059 </p>
<p>Gosche et al. (2002), others reported that the volume </p>
<p>1060 </p>
<p>of both the total brain and hippocampus were ele-</p>
<p>1061 </p>
<p>vated in cognitively normal individuals with high AD </p>
<p>1062 </p>
<p>neuropathology, compared to AD [210, 211]. Fur-</p>
<p>1063 </p>
<p>thermore, in baseline measurements of SuperAgers </p>
<p>1064 </p>
<p>(80+-year-old NDAN group), hippocampal volumes </p>
<p>1065 </p>
<p>were found to be significantly larger compared to the </p>
<p>1066 </p>
<p>normal aging controls [176]. These opposing findings </p>
<p>1067 </p>
<p>suggest that brain and hippocampal volume by itself </p>
<p>1068 </p>
<p>cannot explain the clinical-pathologic correlation in </p>
<p>1069 </p>
<p>NDAN. </p>
<p>1070 </p>
<p>The genome-wide associated study performed by </p>
<p>1071 </p>
<p>Guo et al. (2019) associated three small nucleotide </p>
<p>1072 </p>
<p>polymorphisms in the TOMM40-APOC1 region, </p>
<p>1073 </p>
<p>located on chromosome 19q13.32, with hippocam-</p>
<p>1074 </p>
<p>pal atrophy and cognitive decline in non-demented </p>
<p>1075 </p>
<p>older adults [212], indicating that genetic background </p>
<p>1076 </p>
<p>affects hippocampal atrophy. Furthermore, another </p>
<p>1077 </p>
<p>study indicated that hippocampal atrophy in AD is </p>
<p>1078 </p>
<p>associated with vascular damage [213]. So far, how-</p>
<p>1079 </p>
<p>ever, it remains unknown whether the hippocampal </p>
<p>1080 </p>
<p>and brain atrophy would be directly caused by NFT </p>
<p>1081 </p>
<p>and A␤ plaques, since NDAN individuals do not nec-</p>
<p>1082 </p>
<p>essarily show reduced hippocampal volume and/or </p>
<p>1083 </p>
<p>brain atrophy despite their AD pathology. </p>
<p>1084 </p>
<p>Collectively, in NDAN, multiple studies indicate </p>
<p>1085 </p>
<p>hippocampal volume changes while one study does </p>
<p>1086 </p>
<p>not. As far as neurodegeneration is concerned, the </p>
<p>1087 </p>
<p>most important factor remains age. One study did </p>
<p>1088 </p>
<p>consider age in their analysis and reported that sim-</p>
<p>1089 </p>
<p>ilar rates of atrophy were observed in both control </p>
<p>1090 </p>
<p>and A␤-resilient cases [14], suggesting that larger </p>
<p>1091 </p>
<p>hippocampal volume could contribute to resilience to </p>
<p>1092 </p>
<p>A␤, but that structural decline eventually does occur </p>
<p>1093 </p>
<p>over time. </p>
<p>1094 </p>
<p>Brain area dependency </p>
<p>1095 </p>
<p>Next to cognitive reserve (see the section on NDAN </p>
<p>1096 </p>
<p>on a body level) resiliency to cognitive decline in </p>
<p>1097 </p>
<p>NDAN could result from brain reserve [174, 175, </p>
<p>1098 </p>
<p>214]. Brain reserve refers to the ability to endure age-</p>
<p>1099 </p>
<p>related changes and pathological damage, without </p>
<p>1100 </p>
<p>developing symptoms. As mentioned above, the hip-</p>
<p>1101 </p>
<p>pocampal volume is one of the mechanisms in brain </p>
<p>1102 </p>
<p>reserve. Moreover, other structural changes or differ-</p>
<p>1103 </p>
<p>ences in the brain might be involved in the coping </p>
<p>1104 </p>
<p>mechanism in NDAN individuals. Research from the </p>
<p>1105 </p>
<p>AIBL study of Aging group (Table 1) used 11 C-PiB </p>
<p>1106 </p>
<p>PET and MRI brain scans to investigate A␤ depo-</p>
<p>1107 </p>
<p>sition in typical AD and NDAN subjects [215]. The </p>
<p>1108 </p>
<p>authors found a greater temporal grey matter volume </p>
<p>1109 </p>
<p>in 'high-PiB healthy controls', compared to 'low-</p>
<p>1110 </p>
<p>PiB healthy controls'. In other words, brain scans of </p>
<p>1111 </p>
<p>NDAN subjects with high A␤ load showed a larger </p>
<p>1112 </p>
<p>grey matter volume than healthy controls without A␤ </p>
<p>1113 </p>
<p>in the temporal lobe. </p>
<p>1114 </p>
<p>Typically in AD, the hippocampus, particularly </p>
<p>1115 </p>
<p>CA1 region, and entorhinal cortex are the first regions </p>
<p>1116 </p>
<p>that are affected [73]. Afterwards, other parts of the </p>
<p>1117 </p>
<p>temporal and parietal lobes and some of the frontal </p>
<p>1118 </p>
<p>cortex and cingulate gyrus are affected. Surprisingly, </p>
<p>1119 </p>
<p>in the 80+-year-old NDAN group, SuperAgers, a sig-</p>
<p>1120 </p>
<p>nificantly thicker left anterior cingulate gyrus was </p>
<p>1121 </p>
<p>found in comparison to both other 80+-year-olds 
and middle-aged controls [216]. Later these findings 
were confirmed by Gefen et al. (2015) who further </p>

<p>reported that this region contains a lower NFT den-</p>

NDAN and will be discussed in the section NDAN </p>
<p>1131 </p>
<p>on a cellular level. In the BLSA Study, the rCBF, </p>
<p>1132 </p>
<p>a measure for local neuronal activity, was measured </p>
<p>1133 </p>
<p>longitudinally up to 10 years prior to death by PET </p>

<p>1135 </p>
<p>pared to cognitively impaired and cognitively normal </p>
<p>1136 </p>
<p>older subjects [17]. Their analysis demonstrated that </p>
<p>1137 </p>
<p>both the NDAN and the cognitively impaired group </p>
<p>1138 </p>
<p>show similar rCBF declines in the precuneus and </p>
<p>1139 </p>
<p>mesial temporal cortex over time. These results are </p>
<p>1140 </p>
<p>consistent with observations seen in subjects with </p>
<p>1141 </p>

<p>1142 </p>

<p>1157 </p>
<p>which correlated with a higher density of the neu-</p>
<p>1158 </p>

<p>1159 </p>
<p>al. (2015) reported that the VEN density in Super-</p>
<p>1160 </p>
<p>Agers was approximately 3-to 5-fold higher than in </p>
<p>1161 </p>
<p>elderly control. VENs are rare, spindle neurons, that </p>

<p>are characterized as slim, bipolar neurons located in </p>

<p>1170 </p>
<p>dle neurons has not yet been completely clarified. </p>
<p>1171 </p>
<p>Gefen et al. (2018) found no significant association </p>
<p>1172 </p>
<p>between the density of VENs and Braak stages [16]. </p>
<p>1173 </p>
<p>However, in the same study, lower VEN density was </p>

<p>observed in AD and in amnestic MCI cases, compared </p>

<p>Neuronal hypertrophy is a hypothesized compen-</p>

<p>1183 </p>
<p>Hypertrophy refers to an increase in size, in this </p>
<p>1184 </p>
<p>case of neural cells. Studies performed by Iacono et </p>
<p>1185 </p>
<p>al. reported significant hypertrophy of neuronal cell </p>
<p>1186 </p>
<p>bodies, nuclei, and nucleoli in NDAN individuals, </p>
<p>1187 </p>
<p>particularly in the CA1 region of the hippocampus </p>
<p>1188 </p>
<p>and the anterior cingulate gyrus [197, 221]. This </p>
<p>1189 </p>
<p>observation was in agreement with findings of the </p>
<p>1190 </p>
<p>BLSA study, in which neuronal hypertrophy was pro-</p>
<p>1191 </p>
<p>posed as a compensatory mechanism for atrophy that </p>
<p>1192 </p>
<p>prevents AD pathology [222]. </p>
<p>1193 </p>
<p>As discussed earlier in this review, adult hippocam-</p>
<p>1194 </p>
<p>pal neurogenesis is reduced in AD and MCI brains. </p>
<p>1195 </p>
<p>Moreover, an interesting working hypothesis could </p>

<p>1197 </p>
<p>1198 </p>
<p>1200 </p>
<p>1201 </p>
<p>hippocampi of NDAN revealed that NDAN expressed </p>
<p>1202 </p>
<p>lower levels of miRNAs known to regulate neuroge-</p>
<p>1203 </p>
<p>nesis (miR-9, miR-25, miR-29a, miR-124, miR-132, </p>
<p>1204 </p>
<p>miR-137) compared to controls, MCI, and AD [9]. </p>
<p>1205 </p>
<p>Moreover, in the dentate gyrus, immunofluorescence </p>
<p>1206 </p>
<p>studies for SOX2, a transcription factor crucial for </p>
<p>1207 </p>
<p>maintenance of neuronal stem cells, also showed a </p>

<p>higher amount of SOX2 positive NSCs, compared to </p>
<p>1209 </p>
<p>1210 </p>
<p>1211 </p>
<p>1212 </p>
<p>Taken together, these findings indicate a role of neu-</p>
<p>1213 </p>
<p>rogenesis as a possible mechanism allowing for the </p>
<p>1214 </p>
<p>resistance of AD pathology [9]. In another study, </p>
<p>1215 </p>
<p>NSC culture-derived exosomes were investigated for </p>
<p>1216 </p>
<p>their function in neurogenesis [223]. Exosomes are </p>
<p>1217 </p>
<p>nano-sized extracellular vesicles, that contain infor-</p>
<p>1218 </p>
<p>mation (e.g., lipids, proteins, RNAs, genetic material) </p>
<p>1219 </p>
<p>ing in NDAN individuals.Taken together, it seems that specialized neurons in1250 the hippocampus, VENs and NSCs, are particularly 1251 upregulated in NDAN individuals. This resistance 1252 could be parallel to or causal to hippocampal hyper-of astrocytes, in the superior temporal sulcus of their NDAN group [13]. In this study, the NDAN group 1300 was divided into high probability (HP, Braak stage V-VI) to develop AD and intermediate probability (IP, Braak stage III-IV) to develop AD.

<p>1242 </p>

<p>and these NSC may secrete exosomes, transporting </p>
<p>1244 </p>
<p>particular miRNAs that protect synapses against A␤ </p>

<p>Immune cells </p>
<p>1256 </p>
<p>As was pointed out earlier (see the section AD on </p>
<p>1257 </p>
<p>a cellular level), the important contribution of neu-</p>
<p>1258 </p>
<p>roinflammation in the pathology of AD is becoming </p>
<p>1259 </p>
<p>more and more acknowledged. Already in the early </p>
<p>1260 </p>
<p>stages of AD, neuroinflammatory responses are very </p>
<p>1261 </p>
<p>diverse between individuals [112]. Interestingly, it is </p>
<p>1262 </p>
<p>believed that inflammation during the early stages </p>
<p>1263 </p>
<p>of AD contributes to the development of AD and </p>
<p>1264 </p>
<p>cognitive impairment later in life [112]. Considering </p>
<p>1265 </p>
<p>NDAN, it could be that inflammation is decreased </p>
<p>1266 </p>
<p>and therefore inhibits progression of dementia. This </p>
<p>1267 </p>
<p>could be attributed to the microglial phenotype, M1 </p>
<p>1268 </p>
<p>and M2, and the ratio in which they have proliferated </p>
<p>1269 </p>
<p>in the brain after detection of A␤ or tau protein aggre-</p>
<p>1270 </p>
<p>gates. Hence, it could be hypothesized that in NDAN </p>
<p>1271 </p>
<p>the AD pathology does not result in proliferation of, </p>
<p>1272 </p>
<p>and differentiation into the M1 microglia, but in M2 </p>
<p>1273 </p>
<p>microglia, showing a stronger phenotype of classic </p>
<p>1274 </p>
<p>inflammation inhibition. To best of our knowledge to </p>
<p>1275 </p>
<p>date, however, no single study exists that discrimi-</p>
<p>1276 </p>
<p>nates between the different microglial phenotypes in </p>
<p>1277 </p>
<p>NDAN. </p>
<p>1278 </p>
<p>The study by Melah et al. (2016) showed that neu-</p>
<p>1279 </p>
<p>roinflammation aggravates neural damage, as they </p>
<p>1280 </p>
<p>found a correlation between the neuroinflammatory </p>
<p>1281 </p>
<p>markers, YKL-40 and MCP1, and the neural damage </p>

<p>1283 </p>
<p>tomatic adults with AD pathology carrying the risk </p>
<p>1284 </p>
<p>gene APOE 4 [226]. However, they did not specif-</p>
<p>1285 </p>
<p>ically look at microglia. In another study, microglial </p>
<p>1286 </p>
<p>activation was evaluated in brains of SuperAgers, </p>
<p>1287 </p>
<p>to investigate the response to age-related pathology </p>
<p>1288 </p>
<p>[227]. Older adults in this study showed increased </p>
<p>1289 </p>
<p>microglial density in white matter regions that corre-</p>
<p>1290 </p>
<p>late with the affected regions in AD as described in the </p>
<p>1291 </p>
<p>section o AD on an organ level. On the other hand, </p>
<p>1292 </p>
<p>this increased microglial density was not observed </p>
<p>1293 </p>
<p>in SuperAgers, giving us another interesting possi-</p>
<p>1294 </p>
<p>ble explanation for the high cognitive functioning in </p>
<p>1295 </p>
<p>these individuals. These results match those observed </p>
<p>1296 </p>
<p>in the study of Perez-Nievas et al. (2013), who found </p>
<p>1297 </p>
<p>a significantly lower amount of microglia, and also </p>

<p>neuronal hypertrophy in NDAN's hippocampal neurons. Moreover, the cingulate gyrus was found to be thicker and overall the grey volume was larger1628    in NDAN, compared to AD cases. Besides neuronal hypertrophy, two different studies each looking at only one specific cell-type found an elevated presence of specialized neurons, such asVENs and NSCs,   in NDAN individuals. Furthermore, adult neurogenesis seems to be preserved in NDAN individuals, which can be attributed to increased levels of hippocampal NSCs and their elevated SOX2-expression allowing for stem-cell renewal. Thirdly, neuroinflammation is suppressed in NDAN as associated with 1638 decreased glial activation. Moreover, compared to AD cases, the cytokine signature in NDAN individuals represented more an anti-inflammatory state, with elevated levels IL-4 and IL-13, further thus 1642 supporting the hypothesis that neuroinflammation is 1643 decreased in NDAN cases. Lastly, looking at the AD 1644 hallmarks A␤ and tau pathology, NDAN cases have more tau monomers and less accumulation of soluble hyperphosphorylated tau at the synapses, but 1647 further research is needed, including elucidation of the different tau species and their distribution in NDAN cases compared to control and AD cases. Looking at the A␤ pathology, in NDAN several biochemical mechanisms for synaptic resilience to A␤-oligomeric binding have been suggested, namely preserved synaptic Zn 2+ homeostasis, better mainte-nance of the insulin signaling pathway and increased expression of three miRNAs involved in the regulation of expression of synaptic genes. Altogether, these different mechanisms discussed in this review shed new light into the underlying 1659 mechanism of NDAN cases, "normal" aging, and AD 1660 (Fig. 2). It is clear that despite the growing literature 1661 regarding NDAN, additional studies will be needed 1662 to develop a better picture of NDAN to disentangle NDAN cases from "normal" aging and AD and 1664 to gain insights into possible drug targets for AD. Regarding resilience to AD pathology on an organ 1666 level, NDAN researchers have been focused primarily on the hippocampus, while cortical regions that 1668 are affected in AD, are not taken into account in most investigations in NDAN individuals. Moreover, literature regarding hippocampal volume in NDAN cases show contradicting findings, suggesting that further research is required. Furthermore, other circumstances, including time and aging, that could 1674 affect the hippocampal volume and neurogenetic factors will provide further crucial insights. Based on 1676 the cytokines profiles of NDAN cases, we hypothesized that NDAN individuals display a different ratio 1678 of M1 and M2 microglial phenotypes, specifically we hypothesized that in NDAN, classic inflammation is inhibited by M2-microglial cells for which so far no experimental data is available. On the topic A␤ toxicity, the observation that A␤-oligomeric binding to synapses is reduced in NDAN, brings new insights into the development of novel therapeutic 1685 approaches aiming to improve synaptic resistance 1686 to A␤ oligomeric toxicity. Regarding the other AD hallmark, tau, the mechanisms involved in NDAN have to be investigated more extensively, therefore it 1689 was proposed to investigate what type of tau species 1690 was found in NDAN brain, compared to normal aging and AD, and where it distributed to. What was already found in literature is that NFT formation in 1693 the temporal cortex was inhibited, due to lower 0N3R Various observations in NDAN individuals have 1696 tried to provide an explanation how A␤-synapse binding is mediated: Zn 2+ homeostasis, the extracellular matrix protein Reelin, insulin signaling, and 1699 miRNAs that regulate APP and ␤-secretase expression levels in synapses. Unfortunately, these are all different mechanisms studied independently, and a more comprehensive and holistic study looking at these mechanisms all in the same individual, to the best of our knowledge, so far has been lacking. Further a holistic research approach is required to form a coherent entity that explains the role of A␤ oligomer binding to preserve cognition and prevent 1708 dementia. The observation that neurogenesis is more 1709 pronounced in NDAN individuals than in AD, also provides and interesting therapeutic potential, for 1711 instance focused on NSC proliferation in the hippocampus. Similar to the longitudinal cohort studies that have 1714 been performed in America and Australia, among 1715 others, more recently, researchers in The Netherlands 1716 launched two cohort studies to investigate several 1717 types of diseases in elderly [239, 240]. They both 1718 investigated the increasing prevalence of dementia 1719 with age and investigated the impact of lifestyle factors on AD. However, they did not yet study or publish whether a group of NDAN would exist in this cohort, for the potential reason that they did not yet performed autopsies in this study. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see also the NDAN individuals in 1725 these cohorts. A major limitation of the field, and thereby as 1727 well of this review, is that most research groups use 1728 their own synonym to refer to non-demented elderly 1729 with AD pathology. Not only do different studies 1730 use different synonyms, but also use different measurements and thresholds to classify these subjects. While some studies expect that these subjects will eventually develop dementia, so study them as preclinical, other studies focused only on the individuals 1735 with really severe AD pathology. Another issue is the 1736 lack of awareness regarding the non-demented individuals in most AD studies. Despite the alterations made by the Alzheimer's Association to separate the NDAN from AD cases, not all researchers considered NDAN in their study design. Also, we have to consider that NDAN individuals included in the studies generally attended higher education, suggesting that these individuals have already been cognitively stronger than the ones with lower education, creating educational bias. Then, the biggest question 1746 in NDAN is time, in particular the contribution of aging in the pathology of AD. In this review, both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies have been1583 </p>
<p>Nevertheless, recently a study was conducted sug-</p>
<p>1584 </p>
<p>gesting another potential component that reduces the </p>
<p>1585 </p>
<p>risk for AD and other types of dementia. In this </p>
<p>1586 </p>
<p>study, a genetic variant in the phospholipase C␥2 </p>
<p>1587 </p>
<p>(PLCG2) gene was suggested to reduce AD risk </p>
<p>1588 </p>
<p>[238]. The PLCG2 gene was found to have a role </p>
<p>1589 </p>
<p>in immune system signaling, suggesting a protective </p>
<p>1590 </p>
<p>effect against neurodegenerative diseases, including </p>
<p>1591 </p>
<p>AD. The authors in this study indicate that the genetic </p>
<p>1592 </p>
<p>variant of this gene is associated with an increased </p>
<p>1593 </p>
<p>longevity and reduced AD risk [238]. It is therefore 
not unlikely that a connection exists between this </p>
<p>1595 </p>
<p>genetic variant and NDAN. </p>
<p>1596 </p>
<p>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS </p>
<p>1597 </p>
<p>The aim of this review was to achieve more insight </p>
<p>1598 </p>
<p>into the mechanism underlying NDAN resistance to </p>
<p>1599 </p>
<p>dementia. Thus far, we have evaluated various mecha-</p>
<p>1600 </p>
<p>nism on a body, organ, cellular, and biochemical level </p>
<p>1601 </p>
<p>based on a large variety of studies. All the included </p>
<p>1602 </p>
<p>studies in this review were based on cognitively nor-</p>
<p>1603 </p>
<p>mal elderly, defined as a MMSE score &gt; 24, and with </p>
<p>1604 </p>
<p>age 60 years or older, carrying the AD pathology </p>
<p>1605 </p>
<p>(Table 2). So far in literature, there has not been a con-</p>
<p>1606 </p>
<p>crete definition for NDAN-like individuals, and it can </p>
<p>1607 </p>
<p>be debated which MMSE cut-off score best reflects </p>
<p>1608 </p>
<p>cognitively intact elderly. Similarly, the degree of AD </p>
<p>1609 </p>
<p>pathology in literature, as summarized in Table 3, is </p>
<p>1610 </p>
<p>inconsistent. Therefore, for future studies, clarity is </p>
<p>1611 </p>
<p>needed to form concrete inclusion criteria for NDAN, </p>
<p>1612 </p>
<p>for which Tables 2 and 3 can be used to form an </p>
<p>1613 </p>
<p>overview. </p>
<p>1614 </p>
<p>Key findings that could partly explain why this </p>
<p>1615 </p>
<p>small group of NDAN individuals, which carry AD </p>
<p>1616 </p>
<p>pathology but stay cognitively intact, are summarized </p>
<p>1617 </p>
<p>here. Generally, NDAN individuals have attended </p>
<p>1618 </p>
<p>higher education, than individuals with MCI or AD, </p>
<p>1619 </p>
<p>and therefore may possibly have a higher cognitive </p>
<p>1620 </p>
<p>reserve. Secondly, researchers debate on the rela-</p>
<p>1621 </p>
<p>tionship between hippocampal volume and NDAN </p>
<p>1622 </p>
<p>resilience to dementia. However, most of the stud-</p>
<p>1623 </p>
<p>ies indicate that hippocampal atrophy is compensated </p>
<p>1624 </p>

<p>. This suggests that despite their resilience to AD pathology, time remains one of the most important factors in 1770 the pathology. Hence, Goldberg (2019) reviews these SuperAger studies, suggesting that age needs to be considered more[241]. Moreover, he implied that SuperAgers are not necessarily superior, but rather 1774 "LuckyAgers", questioning the resilience, cognitive reserve, and neurological changes in these individ-uals. From this perspective, aging itself seems one of the largest risks for neurodegenerative diseases, as confirmed by the Nun Study. On the other hand, some studies indicated the uniqueness of NDAN individuals, as being cognitively intact despite AD pathology [17, 61]. Especially Dubois et al. (2018), who launched a longitudinal study aiming to discover new insight into the compensation mechanism in cognitively intact individuals with AD pathology [172]. The last issue we would like to raise is that the current literature on NDAN-like individuals implemented their test group by different conditions, therefore comparing different studies could be unjustly or at least requires some caution. So far, no concrete inclusion criteria have been defined to categorize NDAN Despite evidence on both sides, resilience to pathology or simply a preclinical indication, it is most important that the contribution of age to AD pathology is not forgotten in any NDAN research, as well as that we would consider NDAN subjects as a unique group that could provide crucial insights into compensation mechanisms in the prevention of dementia. This review intended to form a broad overview into the different aspects that are involved in NDAN and compared these mechanisms to those in "normal" aging and AD itself. The suggestions given in this review lay the groundwork for future research into the mechanism that prevents clinical progression to We wish to express appreciation to Christiaan van Leerdam for making all graphical figures that are present in this review. www.j-alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/21-0607r2).
