                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> There is an increasing interest in using language models (LMs) for automated decision-making, with multiple countries actively testing LMs to aid in military crisis decision-making. To scrutinize relying on LM decision-making in high-stakes settings, we examine the inconsistency of responses in a crisis simulation ("wargame"), similar to reported tests conducted by the US military. Prior work illustrated escalatory tendencies and varying levels of aggression among LMs but were constrained to simulations with pre-defined actions. This was due to the challenges associated with quantitatively measuring semantic differences and evaluating natural language decision-making without relying on pre-defined actions. In this work, we query LMs for free form responses and use a metric based on BERTScore to measure response inconsistency quantitatively. Leveraging the benefits of BERTScore, we show that the inconsistency metric is robust to linguistic variations that preserve semantic meaning in a question-answering setting across text lengths. We show that all five tested LMs exhibit levels of inconsistency that indicate semantic differences, even when adjusting the wargame setting, anonymizing involved conflict countries, or adjusting the sampling temperature parameter $T$. Further qualitative evaluation shows that models recommend courses of action that share few to no similarities. We also study the impact of different prompt sensitivity variations on inconsistency at temperature $T = 0$. We find that inconsistency due to semantically equivalent prompt variations can exceed response inconsistency from temperature sampling for most studied models across different levels of ablations. Given the high-stakes nature of military deployment, we recommend further consideration be taken before using LMs to inform military decisions or other cases of high-stakes decision-making.</p>

<p>MEASURING FREE-FORM DECISION-MAKING INCONSISTENCY OF LANGUAGE MODELS IN MILITARY CRISIS SIMULATIONS
17 Oct 2024441CB083C10B06168307462EE2850C99arXiv:2410.13204v1[cs.CL]
There is an increasing interest in using language models (LMs) for automated decision-making, with multiple countries actively testing LMs to aid in military crisis decision-making.To scrutinize relying on LM decision-making in highstakes settings, we examine the inconsistency of responses in a crisis simulation ("wargame"), similar to reported tests conducted by the US military.Prior work illustrated escalatory tendencies and varying levels of aggression among LMs but were constrained to simulations with pre-defined actions.This was due to the challenges associated with quantitatively measuring semantic differences and evaluating natural language decision-making without relying on pre-defined actions.In this work, we query LMs for free form responses and use a metric based on BERTScore to measure response inconsistency quantitatively.Leveraging the benefits of BERTScore, we show that the inconsistency metric is robust to linguistic variations that preserve semantic meaning in a question-answering setting across text lengths.We show that all five tested LMs exhibit levels of inconsistency that indicate semantic differences, even when adjusting the wargame setting, anonymizing involved conflict countries, or adjusting the sampling temperature parameter T .Further qualitative evaluation shows that models recommend courses of action that share few to no similarities.We also study the impact of different prompt sensitivity variations on inconsistency at temperature T = 0. We find that inconsistency due to semantically equivalent prompt variations can exceed response inconsistency from temperature sampling for most studied models across different levels of ablations.Given the high-stakes nature of military deployment, we recommend further consideration be taken before using LMs to inform military decisions or other cases of high-stakes decision-making.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Language models (LMs) are capable of generating human-like text and recommendations from userprovided prompts and information.Sparking the curiosity of individuals, businesses, and governments alike, LMs have been adopted for decision-making across various industries such as healthcare (Berger et al., 2024;Eastwood, 2024) and finance (Maple et al., 2024).Conversations surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and language models (LMs) into militaries have also increased in recent years.For example, multiple news reports have surfaced in the past few years about the United States military testing LMs across their operations (Manson, 2023;Dou et al., 2024;Sentinent Digital, 2024).As a result of Task Force Lima (U.S.Department of Defense, 2023), the US Marine Corps and the US Army have adopted LMs to enhance battle planning and assist military commanders (Jensen &amp; Tadross, 2023;Bello, 2024) and the US Air Force launched a GPT framework to advance wargaming techniques (Caballero &amp; Jenkins, 2024).Industry actors are also getting involved, with Palantir developing a LLM-based chatbot targeted for military use Preprint (Daws, 2023), Scale AI partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense to test the use of LLMs (Scale, 2024), and OpenAI removing the ban on the use of ChatGPT for military and warfare purposes (Biddle, 2024).Reports have surfaced of the United Kingdom, Australia, and China also exploring generative AI applications in their military operations (Hill, 2024;Bajraktari, 2024;Mc-Fadden, 2024), suggesting increasing international engagement.This increased interest builds on assumptions that AI and LMs can lead to faster, more accurate, and less emotional decision-making (International Committee of the Red Cross, 2019; Nurkin &amp; Siegel, 2023;Sentinent Digital, 2024).However, these settings in which LMs are being tested inherently carry high-stakes that leave little room for error (Caballero &amp; Jenkins, 2024) and require consistent, reliable decision-making.Thus, there is consensus that LMs, and AI in general, should not be deployed in military settings without human oversight (Hoffman &amp; Kim, 2023;Rathbun, 2023;Andersen, 2023;Markey, 2023;Simmons-Edler et al., 2024).In addition, there is reason to believe that risks persist in spite of human monitoring because of the potential for escalation with computer assistance (Brewer &amp; Blair, 1979;Emery, 2021;Dunnigan, 2000) or LMs (Rivera et al., 2024;Lamparth et al., 2024).To test how LMs affect decision-making volatility, we focus on analyzing the inconsistency of LM decisionmaking when playing crisis simulations ("wargames").We seek to examine potential risks that can surface from deploying LMs in a novel -and risky -environment.Delegating trust to an inconsistent agent can lead to unpredictable decision-making, which is a cause for concern given the sensitivity of military settings.For example, humans are prone to over-prescribing trust in an autonomous agent (Cummings, 2017).Also, detecting inconsistency has been shown to effectively detect LM hallucinations (Manakul et al., 2023b;Farquhar et al., 2024) with the underlying idea that more inconsistency implies less confidence.Thus, we may elicit a notion of confidence, making LM behavior more transparent to different stakeholders who oversee the development and deployment of LMs, offering novel evaluation approaches for benchmarks and other AI governance tools (e.g., as in Reuel et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Our work makes several contributions to the problem of evaluating free-form decision-making of LMs by studying their behavior playing a high-stakes wargame:</p>
<p>• We overcome challenges associated with quantitatively measuring the inconsistency of free-form responses using BERTScore.• We quantitatively measure inconsistency of free-form LM decisions in high-stakes settings (i.e., without being constrained by pre-determined multiple-choice options).• We show that prompt sensitivity-induced inconsistencies can lead to larger inconsistency than temperature-induced inconsistencies.</p>
<p>We validate that our metric based on BERTScore de-emphasizes linguistic variations that minimally affect the semantic meaning of natural language and accurately captures relevant differences in a question-answer setting.Using our metric, we find that all studied LMs tend to give inconsistent, semantically different responses when playing the given wargame.In a second experiment, we demonstrate that varying degrees of wargame escalation have differing effects on the inconsistency of the studied LMs.We also observe significant differences in inconsistency between LMs.Ultimately, our work suggests that the deployment of LMs into high-stakes contexts requires caution and further scrutiny.1</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Motivated by trends of using AI, and particularly LMs, for military applications, this work aims to better understand the behavior of and risks associated with LMs in high-stakes settings to enable AI governance solutions.This work should not be seen as promoting the integration of LMs into the military or promoting real-world conflicts between any countries.</p>
<p>RELATED WORK</p>
<p>COMPUTERS IN STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING</p>
<p>Wargames are typically defined as strategy games that simulate an armed conflict (Dunnigan, 1992).Previous work has explored behavior of LMs in environments that require strategic reasoning (FAIR Preprint et al., 2022;Zhang et al., 2024;Gandhi et al., 2023;Lorè &amp; Heydari, 2024).There are varied opinions surrounding LM strategic reasoning capability, with some works (FAIR et al., 2022;Gandhi et al., 2023) demonstrating that LMs excel in these scenarios, while other works emphasize some of their limitations (Zhang* et al., 2020;Lorè &amp; Heydari, 2024).Older work explored the role of computers, but not LMs, in wargames.For example, Brewer &amp; Blair (1979) argued that using computers to simulate crisis decision-making may mislead policymakers because computers are unable to capture the complex realities of the simulations.Emery (2021) showed that computerassisted wargaming can lead to more rational gameplay, but also more nuclear use.</p>
<p>More recently, work has specifically analyzed the behavior of LMs in wargaming.It was found that LMs in a multi-agent wargame simulation have concerning tendencies to escalate crises by seeking greater conflict, engaging in arms races, and, in rare cases, deploying nuclear weapons (Rivera et al., 2024).Another study showed that LMs have different strategic tendencies and biases for appropriate levels of aggression when compared to human experts (Lamparth et al., 2024).Other works proposed LM-based agents to simulate historical conflicts (Hua et al., 2023), to play qualititative wargames (Hogan &amp; Brennen, 2024), and to manage battlespaces (Connolly, 2024).Of these, Rivera et al. (2024) and Lamparth et al. (2024) briefly examine inconsistency.However, both of these works had LMs pick from a set of pre-determined options rather than allow LMs to provide free-form responses.Thus, to our knowledge, we are the first to analyze free-from decision-making inconsistency of LMs in wargames.</p>
<p>CONSISTENCY OF LANGUAGE MODELS</p>
<p>Previous work has explicitly studied the consistency of LMs in varying environments.For example, LMs exhibit poor levels of consistency for general knowledge questions (Saxena et al., 2024) and for ambiguous moral scenarios (Scherrer et al., 2024).Another study showed that LMs respond inconsistently to semantically equivalent prompts (Ye et al., 2023).On the other hand, LMs are relatively consistent across paraphrases and within topics, but some inconsistencies remain, particularly on controversial topics (Moore et al., 2024).Recently, Manakul et al. (2023a) and Farquhar et al. (2024) showed that inconsistency can be indicative of LM hallucinations with the underlying idea that higher levels of inconsistency indicate lower levels of confidence in the given response.LMs were tested in the high-stakes setting of automated mental health care and it was found that models exhibit inconsistency in the safety of their user responses (Grabb et al., 2024).</p>
<p>We use a metric based on BERTScore (Zhang* et al., 2020) to quantitatively measure inconsistency.</p>
<p>A fine-grained analysis of BERTScore (Hanna &amp; Bojar, 2021) demonstrated the BERTScore is able to differentiate important content words, but is less sensitive to smaller error such as when two phrases are lexically or stylistically similar.However, it is unclear whether BERTScore and derived metrics can be used for evaluating decision-making or generally, answers to questions.We address these concerns in Section 4.</p>
<p>BERTSCORE-BASED INCONSISTENCY METRIC</p>
<p>A core aspect of our analysis depends on choosing a sufficient metric to quantitatively measure inconsistency of free-form responses.Evaluating dissimilarity of natural language is a difficult task.</p>
<p>In particular, one can say semantically similar things in many different ways.For example, the phrase people like foreign cars is very semantically similar to the phrase consumers prefer imported cars.Some metrics that rely on n-gram matching do not capture semantic similarities in structurally different texts, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and METEOR (Banerjee &amp; Lavie, 2005).2On the other hand, BERTScore better captures semantic similarities between texts by computing token similarity using contextual embeddings (Zhang* et al., 2020).</p>
<p>Specifically, a tokenized reference text x = ⟨x 1 , . . ., x n ⟩ and a comparison text y = ⟨y 1 , . . ., y m ⟩ are mapped to a sequence of vectors ⟨x 1 , . . ., x n ⟩ and ⟨y 1 , . . ., y m ⟩ by an embedding model.The underlying embedding model is BERT Devlin et al. (2018), which creates token embeddings conditioned on both the left and right context of the surrounding text in all layers.Then the cosine similarity between each reference token x i and candidate token y j is calculated with
x ⊤ i y j ||x i ||||y j || .
Greedy matching is applied to each pair of tokens between x and y to compute the score and aggregate the values into precision, recall, and F1 scores.BERTScore originally takes on values between −1 and 1, but in practice, scores are limited in range.We use a rescaled BERTScore that takes on values approximately between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>In this work, we ground the inconsistency score on the rescaled F1 BERTScore based in the De-BERTa xlarge model (He et al., 2021) fine-tuned with MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) as this is the embedding model that was found to correlate best with human judgment (BERTScore, 2020).Additionally, because BERTScore captures similarity, we take our inconsistency metric to be 1 minus BERTScore.</p>
<p>VALIDATING INCONSISTENCY SCORE FOR QUESTION-ANSWERING</p>
<p>To validate that the inconsistency score can also be used to capture inconsistency in free-form text responses in a question-answering setting, we further scrutinize its ability to capture semantic differences while ignoring structural ones.</p>
<p>METHODOLOGY</p>
<p>To perform this analysis, we generated a text corpus containing a diverse array of topics by prompting an LM (GPT-4o mini)3 to answer all questions from the TruthfulQA dataset (Lin et al., 2022) four separate times -each time, we ask the LM to respond with different output lengths.To elicit the robustness and sensitivity of the performance of the inconsistency score across different types of linguistic variations, we define four types of textual ablations: lexical substitution, syntactic restructuring, addition of irrelevance, and semantic shift.Lexical substitution refers to replacing words from the reference text by synonyms that do not change the overall syntactic structure or semantic meaning of the reference text.Syntactic restructuring refers to changing word order or even full sentence orders while preserving the semantic meaning of the reference text.Addition of irrelevance refers to appending one sentence of irrelevant information to the end of the reference text.Semantic shift refers to changing the entire semantic meaning of the sentence, but attempting to preserve the lexical and syntactic form of the reference as much as possible.We employ an LM (GPT-4o mini) to apply each ablation to a particular output length, so we compare texts with similar output lengths. 4e verified that this is akin to what we do in our main analysis.See Appendix C for full prompt details.We also note that we tested a metric based on bi-directional entailment clustering (Kuhn et al., 2023).A discussion of our tests can be found in Appendix E.</p>
<p>Preprint</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>In Figure 1, we plot the effects that different text ablations had on our inconsistency score.Encouragingly, we find that lexical substitution and syntactic restructuring generate the least inconsistency.Thus, the inconsistency score is able to emphasize semantic meaning in texts, even if the lexical or syntactic form of the sentence is changed.There is no relationship between inconsistency score and text length, showing that the metric remains reliable across texts of similar length.The decaying relationship observed for addition of irrelevance is expected because as output length increases, the one sentence of irrelevance makes up a smaller portion of the whole text.Shifting the semantics of the reference text while maintaining as much lexical and syntactic form as possible generated the highest inconsistency score.This shows that our score, and more generally BERTScore, is robust to structural differences that do not affect semantic meaning and is able to capture semantic differences despite minimal changes to lexical or syntactic form in a question-answering setting.</p>
<p>HOW TO INTERPRET THE INCONSISTENCY SCORE?</p>
<p>Because BERTScore originally assigns scores of 1 to identical texts, our inconsistency score will generate a score of 0 when comparing two identical texts.A score of 1 typically implies that the two texts are not related semantically or lexically.For example, comparing the texts i like apples and she dislikes driving would yield an inconsistency score of 1.The mean inconsistency scores produced by textual ablations (without addition of irrelevance) are as follows: Lexical substitution 0.08, syntactic restructuring: 0.17, and semantic shift: 0.37.The average text lengths for our later experiments vary between models but are in the range of 50 to 120 tokens.Thus, we conservatively take scores greater than or equal to 0.25 to imply at least some semantic variation between texts.We evaluate response (a 1 ) inconsistency for a given initial setting (S 1 ).To explore how different degrees of escalation influence response inconsistency, we use two different continuations S 2a and S 2b and collect the corresponding responses a 2a and a 2b .We sample 20 responses on which to compute inconsistency.</p>
<p>MEASURING INCONSISTENCY IN HIGH-STAKES DECISION-MAKING</p>
<p>To measure the inconsistency of LMs in a high-stakes military setting, we have LMs play a wargame.The wargame is the same used in Lamparth et al. (2024), with slight modifications to fit the focus of this work.It is originally based on a fictitious, but plausible (Cancian et al., 2023;Pettyjohn et al., 2022), crisis between the United States ("player nation") and the People's Republic of China ("counterpart") in the Taiwan Strait ("disputed territory").This setting is motivated by reported real-world government tests (Manson, 2023;Dou et al., 2024).</p>
<p>Here, we outline two experiments, which we call the Initial Setting experiment and the Continuations experiment.A schematic of both experimental setups can be seen in Figure 2. In the Initial Setting experiment, we provide the LM with the general scenario brief and an initial description of the ongoing crisis.This context outlines the initial heightening military tensions between a player nation and counterpart over a disputed territory.Then, we prompt the LM to provide a recommended course of action to the president of the player nation in the wake of this developing crisis.We provide the full prompt in Appendix A.1.</p>
<p>The Continuations experiment builds off of the context provided in the Initial Setting experiment to explore how different degrees of escalation influence response inconsistency.We give the LM one of two continuations to respond to: status quo and revisionist.Both continuations involve one of the Each distribution represents 20 data points, each representing an inconsistency score measured in an individual simulation.We find that LMs exhibit high levels of inconsistency, suggesting that they produce semantically inconsistent responses.We also show that the level of wargame escalation in the Continuations does not significantly impact LM response inconsistency.player nation's ships misfiring, causing counterpart casualties.The status quo continuation has the counterpart denouncing the actions and calling for calm in the region.The revisionist continuation has the counterpart asserting that they seek greater control over the disputed territory.Specifically, we give the same prompt provided in the Initial Setting experiment, the greedily decoded assistant response to said prompt, and the continuation prompt to the LM.Referring back to Figure 2, note that the answer a 1 is held constant for the purposes of this experiment.We provide full prompts for the Continuations experiment in Appendix A.2.</p>
<p>In each experiment, we set the temperature T = 1.05 and stochastically sample 20 responses in each simulation we run and compute inconsistency across each pair of responses.Formally, let A = {a 1 , a 2 , ..., a 20 } be the set of 20 individual responses.Let P = {(a i , a j ) ∈ A × A| i &lt; j } denote the set of all unique pairs of responses.Let B : P → [0, 1] calculate the rescaled F1 BERTScore between a pair of responses.Then, we report our final inconsistency score as E[1 − B(a i , a j )].That is, the average of one minus the inconsistency score between all pairs of responses.In this work, we test five off-the-shelf LMs: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620) (Anthropic, 2024), GPT-3.5 Turbo (gpt-3.5-turbo-0125),GPT-4 (gpt-4-0613), GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-05-13), and GPT-4o mini (gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18) (OpenAI, 2024).For each model and experiment outlined in this section, we perform 20 simulations.</p>
<p>INITIAL SETTING EXPERIMENT</p>
<p>In the left plot of Figure 3, we plot the results of this experiment.We find that each of the five studied models exhibits inconsistency far beyond what one would expect from mere lexical substitutions or syntactic restructurings.That is, we may reasonably infer that each model tends to generate responses that are semantically dissimilar.As a qualitative illustration, we provide an example response pair in Figure 4. Further example response pairs are provided in Appendix B.1, which also include pairs from the Continuations experiment.We also observe significant differences in response inconsistency between models.We show that Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o mini exhibit the least response inconsistency, with GPT-4 exhibiting the highest response inconsistency.In a more fine-grained analysis of our results, we find that no individual pair of responses is semantically consistent for all settings and models.</p>
<p>CONTINUATIONS EXPERIMENT</p>
<p>In the right plots of Figure 3, we plot the results of this experiment.For each model, we show that response inconsistency decreases with both wargame continuations relative to inconsistencies observed in the Initial Setting experiment.In Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o mini, the Preprint Initiate diplomatic dialogues with [counterpart] through the United Nations to address the mounting concerns over [disputed territory's] sovereignty and regional security.</p>
<p>Strengthen the defense and resilience of the 5th Task Force, take increased precautionary measures to avoid any potential conflict, and withdraw the beleaguered destroyer for mechanical repairs.Call for international support, emphasizing the potential global implications of this situation, while reinforcing alliances with  revisionist continuation results in the lowest response inconsistency.In GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4, no significant difference is observed between the status quo and revisionist continuations.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that the overall decrease in response inconsistency between the Initial Setting experiment and both continuations is a result of a smaller decision space.Because both continuations ask for recommendations in direct response to a specific incident and the counterpart's reporting, the overall reasonable space of decisions decreases as compared to the space of decisions that one can take when responding to the initial description of the general context and crisis at hand.</p>
<p>EFFECT OF ANONYMIZATION OF COUNTRY NAMES</p>
<p>We also study the effect of anonymizing country names on inconsistency.We change all mentions of explicit country information in the original prompts with color names.This is common practice in historically influential wargames (e.g., National Defense University, 1983;United States Joint Forces Command, 2002).We do this to see whether any underlying bias related to countries affects inconsistency.</p>
<p>We find that anonymizing country information does not significantly change response inconsistency across most studied models across both experiments.Thus, decision-making inconsistency within the wargame is not affected by any underlying bias pertaining to countries held by the studied LMs.</p>
<p>Inconsistency was only significantly different between explicit and anonymous country names in both continuations for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and for just the status quo continuation for GPT-4o mini.Interestingly, in Claude 3.5 Sonnet, we see an inverse relationship between the status quo and revisionist continuations when anonymizing country information than we did for explicit: significantly higher inconsistency in the revisionist continuation than in the status quo one.No other model across both the explicit and the anonymized wargame exhibited this behavior.See Figure 5 for full results.</p>
<p>TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS</p>
<p>Because the temperature parameter is inherently tied to the randomness of a model's outputs, we ablate the temperature parameter to determine how inconsistency is affected.To do this, we ran the Initial Settings experiment across temperatures T = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.2 on the studied OpenAI models. 6igure 6 depicts our results.We show that inconsistency decreases with temperature, as expected.Notably, even with a low temperature of 0.2, we still observe levels of inconsistency surpassing what we would expect between semantically similar texts for all studied models.This deviation raises the question of how consistent LM decision-making can be and whether prompt sensitivity-induced inconsistency is more significant than sampling temperature-induced inconsistency.</p>
<p>INCONSISTENCY DUE TO PROMPT SENSITIVITY VERSUS TEMPERATURE</p>
<p>We examine to what extent LMs provide consistent answers when faced with slight prompt ablations and compare the results to the inconsistency observed in the previous experiments, which were a result of the inherent stochasticity of temperature sampling.Considering that LMs in military contexts are likely to be deployed with human oversight, it should be expected that the queries themselves will be differently phrased even when wargaming identical scenarios.Previous work has demonstrated that LMs can produce poorly consistent outputs to semantically similar queries (Ye et al., 2023).We conduct two main experiments that are designed to demonstrate to what extent LMs exhibit inconsistency when faced with non-identical prompts that call for equivalent decision-making while playing a military crisis simulation.Additionally, we compare these results to observed inconsistency due to temperature sampling.</p>
<p>We induce Level One ablations that entirely preserve the semantics of the prompt (e.g. by using synonyms and changing sentence structure).We induce Level Two ablations that change more Here, we plot the inconistency scores of LMs playing the Initial Setting experiment with different temperatures.We show that inconsistency monotonically decreases with temperature, as expected.For smaller temperatures, we still observe relatively high levels of inconsistency.meaningful aspects of the wargame the involved conflict countries or decision-making capacity of the LM.In both cases, we should expect decision-making to be consistent as the conflict and incidents do not change.To induce Level One ablations, we created 20 semantically identical prompts to the one used in the Initial Setting experiment.To create unique prompts that preserved semantic meaning, we wrote two (semantically equivalent) alternatives to each bullet point in the original prompt and randomly selected which of the three versions to use in the ablated prompt.To induce Level Two ablations, we again create 20 prompts.Specifically, each prompt is a combination of one of five international crises, one of two roles the LM is to take on, and one of two options for the decision country.We write a detailed discussion of the conflicts, roles, and decision countries in Appendix A.3.</p>
<p>In both experiments, rather than setting T = 1.0, we set T = 0.0 and generate the single greedily decoded response for each unique prompt.This allows us to elicit how inconsistency is affected by the prompt ablations themselves rather than the inherent stochasticity of temperature sampling. 7nstead of running multiple simulations, we bootstrap the mean inconsistency score and report the full distribution.Additionally, because countries are is different between prompts, we mask any mention of explicit countries to capture inconsistency of the true decision-making rather than inconsistency due to differences in involved countries.In Appendix B.2, we provide example response pairs alongside their respective inconsistency scores.</p>
<p>INCONSISTENCY DUE TO LEVEL ONE PROMPT ABLATIONS</p>
<p>The center plot of Figure 7 depicts the inconsistency scores of the studied LMs under Level One prompt ablations.We find that, compared to the results shown in the Initial Setting experiment, all studied models exhibit significantly lower levels of inconsistency.We find that GPT-4o mini continues to display the lowest level of inconsistency while GPT-3.5 Turbo now display the highest level of inconsistency.However, we still find that inconsistency scores still remain above what one would expect between semantically similar responses.</p>
<p>Compared to inconsistencies observed when conducting the Initial Setting experiment outlined in Section 5 (which employed temperature T = 1.0), we observe that each of the studied models exhibit significantly less inconsistency.When comparing these results with the results discussed in Section 5.4, we find that inconsistency as a result of prompt ablations that completely preserve semantic similarity is comparable to inconsistency due to temperature T = 0.2 for all models except GPT-4.GPT-4 is the only studied model whose inconsistency due to semantic preserving prompt ablations is less than inconsistency due to sampling with temperature T = 0.</p>
<p>Level One Ablations</p>
<p>Level Two Ablations Prompt Sensitivity</p>
<p>Figure 7: Effect of various levels of prompt ablations.We provide the results of the Initial Setting experiment for reference.We find that LMs responding to semantically similar prompts are more consistent relative to LMs responding to identical prompts with temperature 1.0, whose inconsistencies are comparable to an LM responding to semantically different prompts.</p>
<p>that inconsistency monotonically increases with temperature, we may say that inconsistency as a result of any T ≥ 0.2 exceeds inconsistency due to semantic preserving prompt ablations.</p>
<p>INCONSISTENCY DUE TO LEVEL TWO PROMPT ABLATIONS</p>
<p>The right-most plot of Figure 7 depicts the inconsistency scores of the studied LMs under Level Two prompt ablations.We find that LMs respond with higher levels of inconsistency.We additionally show that the observed inconsistency levels are approximately comparable to those observed in the original Initial Setting experiment for GPT-4o mini only.In fact, GPT-4 is significantly more inconsistent when responding to identical prompts with T = 1.0 while GPT-3.5 Turbo is significantly less inconsistent when responding to identical prompts with T = 1.0 .Again comparing these results with those discussed in Section 5.4, we find that inconsistencies due to these more meaningful ablations leads to inconsistency scores comparable to inconsistency due to temperatures closer to T = 0.6 or T = 0.8 for all the studied models with the exception of GPT-3.5 Turbo.GPT-3.5 Turbo's inconsistency in this setting was comparable to inconsistency with T = 1.2.</p>
<p>In real-world applications both semantically similar and semantically different prompt variations would be present.Thus, it is reasonable to assume that one can expect inconsistencies greater than or equal to the inconsistencies observed in the present experiments, even with T = 0.0.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>In this work, we had five off-the-shelf LMs play a wargame and demonstrated their tendency to give inconsistent responses despite being given the same prompts.We find that inconsistency persists, although to varying degrees, with different levels of escalation.We also show that this inconsistency persists due to slight prompt ablations that preserve semantic meaning, even when the temperature is set to 0.0.Additionally, masking bias by anonymizing country names did not significantly impact LM inconsistency.Finally, we observed that even with low temperature levels, LMs still behave inconsistently.To measure inconsistency, we used a BERTScore-based metric, which we validated was able to ignore textual ablations, emphasizing semantic differences.Future work concerned with free-form semantic consistency evaluations may then use BERTScore for analysis.Given that we find a tendency for inconsistency across various wargame settings, we recommend policymakers and military officials to deeply examine LM behavior in high-stakes military settings.Inconsistent responses may lead to high volatility in decision-making, resulting in unpredictability.</p>
<p>Limitations: The wargame may not fully capture the complexities of real world military crises as we only use one type of conflict concerning just three countries.Examining LM behavior across different types of crises and involved countries would strengthen future studies.Also, in Section 6, we assume that the level 2 ablations call for the same decision-making.However, latent knowledge about different, although similar, settings might affect decision-making.Additionally, we only test five models, with four coming from the same model family.This work studies off-the-shelf LMs to gain a preliminary understanding of LM inconsistency in wargame settings.Examining fine-tuned models will likely impact future inconsistency studies.Finally, while we use BERTScore for our metric, there are likely other viable choices such as MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) and G-Eval (Liu et al., 2023).However, we do not expect our results to change with a sufficiently robust metric given that we also qualitatively evaluated responses to verify inconsistency.</p>
<p>The integration of LMs into military decision-making poses significant risks due to their inconsistency and unpredictability, which could lead to catastrophic consequences in high-stakes situations.Historical near-misses involving computer-aided military decisions underscore potential catastrophic dangers (National Security Archive, 2020;</p>
<p>A PROMPT DETAILS</p>
<p>This section outlines prompt details as well as further details to Initial Setting and Continuations experiments that we conduct in this paper.When getting responses, we use the model's respective API, set the temperature to 1.0 and sample 20 responses.All other hyperparameters are set to their default values.In the interest of space, we do not provide the prompts used in the prompt sensitivity experiments.They may be found alongside the code, when released.</p>
<p>A.1 INITIAL SETTING EXPERIMENT</p>
<p>System Prompt:</p>
<p>The President of U.S.A has asked for your recommendations on orders for engaging in a particular conflict.You will be provided with descriptions of the context and the involved parties below.</p>
<p>You are to provide one to a few recommended courses of action.Make sure to take into account your nation's objectives and attributes.It is unclear whether or not the President accepted your recommendations.</p>
<p>New Reporting: * U.S.A's intelligence sources report that China's president has given a secret internal speech, saying that the time is ripe to reunite the motherland.The people are determined, the military is ready, and the international situation is ideal * The Party has been actively looking for the best opportunity to assert greater control over the Taiwan Strait.* China announces that the seas around Taiwan are China internal waters and moves to establish control over Taiwan airspace by asserting its regulation of all flights into and out of Taiwan.It warns that all necessary measures will be taken to enforce China sovereignty over Taiwan's airspace and seas</p>
<p>A.3 SEMANTICALLY DIFFERENT PROMPT SENSITIVITY DETAILS</p>
<p>Here, we outline what variations we made to the prompt used in the Initial Settings experiment to do the prompt sensitivity analysis for major semantic differences.As noted in Section 5, we have the LM play 20 variations of the Initial Setting prompt.We ablate the crisis, the role the LM takes on, and what country the LM makes recommendations for.</p>
<p>A.3.1 ROLE AND DECISION COUNTRY</p>
<p>The original wargame had the LM acting as an advisor the president of the "player nation."In the original case, that means the LM was acting as an advisor to the president of the United States.</p>
<p>To introduce a meaningful ablation, we also have the LM act as an advisor the president of the counterpart.Additionally, we also ablate the role that the LM takes on.Instead of being an advisor to the president of the decision country, we also ask it to act as if it were an automated decisionmaker whose recommendations were final and were to be implemented -no questions asked.</p>
<p>A.3.2 CRISES</p>
<p>The original Initial Setting experiment focused on a crisis between the US and China over Taiwan.We introduce four additional crises based on real-world conflicts: Each of these crises are inspired by real-world situations, some moer pressing than others.Though, each of these conflicts is plausible and (could) have catastrophic impact if they were to escalate.</p>
<p>B EXAMPLE RESPONSE PAIRS</p>
<p>Here, we provide example response pairs generated by the LMs alongside their computed inconsistency scores.We provide a few representative examples to illustrate how response pairs compare across the entire spectrum of observed scores.All responses can be found alongside the code at github.com/aashrivastava/LLMWargamingInconsistency.We replace mentions of explicit countries with placeholders, indicated by [brackets].We bold some of the main points of difference between each response pair.</p>

<p>C INCONSISTENCY SCORE ASSESSMENT PROMPTS</p>
<p>Here, we provide the prompts we provided to GPT-4o mini when conducting analysis for our inconsistency score.As noted, we have the LM answer each question from the TruthfulQA dataset (Lin et al., 2022) four separate times.Each time, we ask it to respond with a different output length.Then, we ablate each of these generated texts with four textual ablations: lexical substitution, syntactic restructuring, addition of irrelevance, and semantic shift.Then, we compare each text with its ablated version.</p>
<p>C.1 TRUTHFULQA RESPONSE GENERATIONS</p>
<p>System Prompt One of:</p>
<p>• "Respond in only one sentence."</p>
<p>• "Respond in a couple sentences."</p>
<p>• "Respond in a few sentences."</p>
<p>• "Respond in a paragraph with your answer and some reasoning."</p>
<p>We note that we keep the directions vague in order to capture a continuous array of text lengths rather than discrete buckets.</p>
<p>User Prompt: The user prompt is simply the question exactly as provided in the TruthfulQA dataset.No modifications were made.</p>
<p>C.2 GETTING TEXTUAL ABLATIONS</p>
<p>These are the prompts we use in order to induce the textual ablations onto each response we generated in the previous step.Here, reference text simply refers to a particular response generated from the previous step.</p>
<p>We qualitatively verify that most of the ablations occurred correctly.There were some bad generations, however they did not occur frequently enough to adversely affect our results.</p>
<p>C.2.1 LEXICAL SUBSTITUTION</p>
<p>System Prompt: "You are to replace some words in a text with synonyms.Make sure that you change at least 2 words per sentence."</p>
<p>D EXAMPLE TEXTUAL ABLATIONS</p>
<p>We verified that GPT-4o mini was able to perform the textual ablations mostly correctly.For transparency, we provide five example pairs for each textual ablation.These pairs were randomly sampled from the dataset.The original text will be provided in plain text, while the ablated text will be italicized.The full dataset of pairs can be found alongside the code at github.com/aashrivastava/LLMWargamingInconsistency.</p>

<p>D.4 SEMANTIC SHIFT</p>
<p>Yes, Americans have generally been working more hours over time, particularly in the last few decades.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that the average workweek for fulltime employees has increased, with many workers putting in longer hours due to factors such as economic pressures, job insecurity, and the rise of technology that enables constant connectivity.Additionally, the gig economy and the prevalence of remote work have blurred the lines between work and personal time, often leading to an increase in overall hours worked.This trend has raised concerns about work-life balance and employee well-being, as longer hours can contribute to stress and burnout.</p>
<p>No, Americans have generally been working fewer hours over time, especially in recent decades.Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average workweek for full-time employees has decreased, with many workers enjoying shorter hours due to factors such as economic stability, job security, and the decline of technology that limits constant connectivity.Furthermore, the gig economy and the rise of remote work have clarified the boundaries between work and personal time, often leading to a reduction in overall hours worked.This trend has alleviated concerns about work-life balance and employee well-being, as shorter hours can contribute to reduced stress and improved mental health.</p>

<p>Blondes and brunettes primarily differ in hair color, which is determined by the type and amount of melanin present in the hair.Blondes typically have less eumelanin, resulting in lighter hair shades, while brunettes have more eumelanin, leading to darker hair.Beyond hair color, cultural perceptions and stereotypes often associate certain traits with each group; for instance, blondes are sometimes Preprint stereotypically viewed as more carefree or fun-loving, while brunettes may be seen as more serious or intellectual.However, these stereotypes are not universally true and can vary widely among individuals.Ultimately, the differences between blondes and brunettes are largely superficial, as personality and individual characteristics are not inherently tied to hair color.</p>
<p>Blondes and brunettes primarily differ in personality traits, which are influenced by their upbringing and experiences.Blondes are often perceived as more serious and studious, while brunettes may be seen as more carefree or adventurous.Beyond personality, cultural perceptions and stereotypes frequently associate specific behaviors with each group; for instance, brunettes are sometimes stereotypically viewed as more fun-loving or spontaneous, while blondes may be seen as more reserved or cautious.However, these stereotypes are not universally applicable and can vary significantly among individuals.Ultimately, the differences between blondes and brunettes are largely profound, as personality and individual characteristics are deeply connected to their life experiences rather than hair color.</p>
<p>E BI-DIRECTIONAL ENTAILMENT CLUSTERING FOR INCONSISTENCY EVALUATION</p>
<p>We also tested a method based on bi-directional entailment clustering (Kuhn et al., 2023) to quantitatively measure inconsistency.This is based on the idea that if two texts "bi-directionally entail" each other, the two texts are semantically equivalent.To check for entailment, we would use a natural langauge inference classifier fine-tuned on MNLI (Williams et al., 2018).If text A entails text B and vice versa, than we may cluster these into the same equivalence class. .This gives us an inconsistency score of 0 if all responses are semantically equivalent, and a score of 1 if no responses are semantically equivalent.</p>
<p>However, this method did not work in preliminary testing.Specifically, we continually got extremely high levels of inconsistency to the point of being unhelpful, hindering our ability to spot model-level or experiment-level differences.We believe that this is in fact due to models rarely generating truly semantically equivalent responses.Responses typically included multiple sentences, making it highly likely that a response included a unique assortment of information.</p>
<p>To address this, we weakened the requirement from true bi-directional entailment to non-defeating bi-directionality (Farquhar et al., 2024).Here, we only require at least one direction of entailment and no contradictions.Still, we got indistinguishable results due to high inconsistency scores.We observed that most pairwise comparisons resulted in bi-directional neutrality.That is, text A neither entailed nor contradicted text B, and text B neither entailed nor contradicted text A. This resulted in text A and text B being categorized into separate equivalence classes, thus running us into the same problem as before.Hence, we focused our analysis on BERTScore.</p>
<p>F RANKING OPTIONS</p>
<p>We also perform studies asking the LM to rank a set of pre-determined options.We do this as it is still unique to what previous works conducted.Previous works typically asked LMs to select all that apply Rivera et al. (2024); Lamparth et al. (2024).We believe that ranking options allows for more of a holistic representation of an LM's preferences.To measure inconsistency, we use a metric based on Kendall's τ Kendall (1938).Specifically, we re-scale Kendall's τ to be in [0, 1] and then subtract it from one.So if two rankings are exact inverses of each other, the pair will receive a score of 1.If two rankings are the same, the pair will receive a score of 0.</p>
<p>Preprint F.1 PROMPTS</p>
<p>The prompts that we provide the LM are mostly the same as seen in Appendix A, with some modifications to the system prompt and the end of the user prompt to provide the options that LM is to rank.The options that we provide are a subset of those used in Rivera et al. (2024).</p>

<p>User Prompt: ## SCENARIO INTRODUCTION ##</p>
<p>Figure 1 :

Figure1: Effects of text ablations on inconsistency score based on BERTScore.We measure the effect that different textual ablations have on our inconsistency score based on BERTScore.Colorbars represent counts.We observe that shifting the semantic meaning of a text generally produces the highest inconsistency.Lexical substitution exhibits the least inconsistency.Finally, we find almost no correlation between output length and inconsistency for lexical substitution, syntactic restructuring, or semantic shift.We define this terminology in Section 4.</p>
<p>Figure 2 :

Figure2: Schematic of experimental setup.We evaluate response (a 1 ) inconsistency for a given initial setting (S 1 ).To explore how different degrees of escalation influence response inconsistency, we use two different continuations S 2a and S 2b and collect the corresponding responses a 2a and a 2b .We sample 20 responses on which to compute inconsistency.</p>
<p>Figure 3 :
3
Figure 3: Inconsistency of LMs Here, we plot the inconsistency scores of each of the studied LLMs.Each distribution represents 20 data points, each representing an inconsistency score measured in an individual simulation.We find that LMs exhibit high levels of inconsistency, suggesting that they produce semantically inconsistent responses.We also show that the level of wargame escalation in the Continuations does not significantly impact LM response inconsistency.</p>
<p>Figure 4 :

Figure4: Example Response Pair From GPT-4.We bold some of the main points in each response.This exact pair generated an inconsistency score of 0.73, the same score of the most inconsistent set of responses.We replace mentions of explicit countries with placeholders, indicated by[brackets].</p>

Figure6: Effect of temperature on LM inconsistency.Here, we plot the inconistency scores of LMs playing the Initial Setting experiment with different temperatures.We show that inconsistency monotonically decreases with temperature, as expected.For smaller temperatures, we still observe relatively high levels of inconsistency.</p>

<p>Suppose we then want to check whether text C belongs in the same equivalence class as text A and text B. Then, it technically suffices to check whether text C bi-directionally entails only one of text A or text B (because text A and text B are already semantically equivalent).If text A and text C do not bi-directionally entail each other, text C forms a new equivalence class.We repeat this process for each individual response until each response belongs in an equivalence class.Then, we compute a quantitative inconsistency score based on the number of equivalence classes and the size of the equivalence classes.Formally, let A = {a 1 , a 2 , . . ., a n } denote a set of n individual responses.Suppose we already separated each response into equivalence classes.Let C i denote the equivalence class containing response a i .Then, we compute the inconsistency with:</p>

We use GPT-4o mini for speed and financial reasons. We do not expect the use of any other model to affect our results.
See Appendix D for example ablation pairs.
We set the temperature T = 1.0 as this is the default temperature set by the APIs for all studied models.
We exclude Claude 3.5 Sonnet from this analysis as its API employs a different range for temperature, making direct comparison unfeasible(Anthropic, 2024).
We exclude Claude 3.5 Sonnet from this analysis as the API states a temperature of 0.0 does not guarantee deterministic outputs.

Unlike when giving free-form responses, GPT-4 exhibits one of the lowest levels of inconsistency.Instead, GPT-3.5 Turbo now exhibits the highest level of inconsistency when ranking responses.Initial Setting Regular Ordering Reversed OrderingFigure9: Effect of option ordering on inconsistency.We observe that reversing the ordering of options results in less inconsistency, at least in GPT-4o mini.F.3 ABLATING ORDERINGWe also seek to analyze how the ordering in which the options are provided to an LM affects inconsistency.Previous work has shown that LMs are sensitive to the ordering of options in multiplechoice environments(Pezeshkpour &amp; Hruschka, 2024).In the original prompt, the options are provided from least escalatory to most escalatory, in general.Here, we reversed the ordering.So, the prompt stays the same except for that the order of the options were reversed.We only conduct this test with GPT-4o mini due to financial and time constraints.We find that reversing the ordering of options results in less inconsistency.
