<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to techniques used to build systems that emulate human intelligence.It encompasses various components of intelligence, including reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and linguistic understanding [1].</p>
<p>Machine Learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on developing algorithms and statistical models.These models learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit instructions.During training, ML models acquire knowledge from data, drawing from probability theory and linear algebra.Key parameters and processes required to implement a machine learning model have been summarized in Table 1.There are two main types of ML:</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Supervised Machine Learning: In supervised ML, both the data and the problem is known.When given a set of features (x), we can predict the value of y.It includes both classification (assigning data to categories) and regression (predicting numerical values).The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in pharmaceutical sciences has brought about a transformative impact on various facets of the field.These cutting-edge technologies have revolutionized drug discovery, development, and patient care by leveraging advanced computational algorithms to analyze extensive datasets encompassing genomics, proteomics, and chemical structures [12].Through the prediction of drug-target interactions, identification of novel drug candidates, and optimization of molecular compounds, AI/ML methodologies enable researchers to gain insights into disease mechanisms at a molecular level, facilitating the design of more The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in pharmaceutical sciences has brought about a transformative impact on various facets of the field.These cutting-edge technologies have revolutionized drug discovery, development, and patient care by leveraging advanced computational algorithms to analyze extensive datasets encompassing genomics, proteomics, and chemical structures [12].Through the prediction of drug-target interactions, identification of novel drug candidates, and optimization of molecular compounds, AI/ML methodologies enable researchers to gain insights into disease mechanisms at a molecular level, facilitating the design of more efficacious therapies [13].Notably, recent advancements in deep learning models, such as graph neural networks, have significantly expedited drug discovery processes by accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinities [12].AI/ML also plays a pivotal role in enhancing various aspects of clinical trial design and execution.These technologies aid in optimizing patient recruitment by identifying suitable candidates based on genetic profiles and clinical characteristics, thereby facilitating adaptive trial designs that minimize costs and time [14].Real-world data (RWD) from wearable devices, electronic health records, and imaging studies are harnessed to provide valuable insights, which AI algorithms analyze to personalize treatment regimens, predict adverse events, and stratify patient populations [15].For instance, AIpowered algorithms can predict patient responses to immunotherapies by scrutinizing tumor microenvironment features.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the domain of pharmacovigilance and safety surveillance, AI/ML algorithms are instrumental in post-market surveillance for monitoring drug safety.By analyzing adverse event reports, electronic health records, and social media data, these tools promptly detect safety signals, thereby enhancing pharmacovigilance by identifying rare adverse events that might otherwise go unnoticed [16].Additionally, the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models facilitates the extraction of valuable information from unstructured text, enabling efficient analysis of medical literature and adverse event narratives [17].</p>
<p>In the context of pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control, AI/ML technologies optimize manufacturing processes to ensure consistent drug quality [18].Predictive maintenance models are employed to prevent equipment failures, thereby minimizing production downtime.Quality control procedures benefit from AI-driven image analysis, as machine vision systems detect defects in drug formulations, packaging, and labeling, thereby ensuring compliance with regulatory standards [19].</p>
<p>As AI/ML models become increasingly integral to decision-making processes, ethical considerations become paramount.Ensuring transparency and interpretability of these models is crucial, prompting researchers to develop explainable AI techniques to comprehend model predictions and address biases.Collaborative efforts among pharmaceutical scientists, clinicians, and data scientists are deemed essential for the responsible adoption of AI in healthcare.</p>
<p>Drug Discovery and Development</p>
<p>The journey of developing new drugs involves recognizing drug targets, validating them, progressing from hits to lead compounds, refining leads, identifying preclinical molecules, evaluating them preclinically, and conducting clinical trials to bring a new drug to market [20].The average pre-tax expenditure to bring a new prescription drug to market is around USD 2.6 billion, spanning a period of 5.9-7.2 years for non-oncological drugs and 13-15 years for oncological drugs [12].Despite the substantial financial commitment, the success rate for novel small drugs gaining clinical approval is only 13%, with a significant risk of failure [21].The complex and vast data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials present a significant challenge in the drug discovery pipeline [22].The advent of computer-assisted drug design technology is viewed as a promising solution to enhance this challenging landscape by streamlining the drug development process effectively [20].Furthermore, employing computational methods that incorporate multi-objective refinement can help decrease the failure rate of preclinical lead compounds [2].Within the scope of drug development, artificial intelligence (AI) utilizes computer software to analyze, learn from, and interpret vast pharmaceutical data, leveraging advancements in machine learning (ML) to streamline the discovery of new drug molecules in a cohesive and automated manner [22].</p>
<p>Presently, AI technologies, particularly Deep Learning (DL) methodologies, show great potential in drug design because of their remarkable ability to generalize and extract features [23].Traditional machine learning methods rely on manually designed features, whereas Deep Learning techniques can autonomously learn features from input data, transforming basic attributes into complex characteristics through multi-layer feature extraction [24].Figure 2</p>
<p>Predictive Modeling for Target Identification</p>
<p>The strategy of altering a target's activity to combat a disease is a common approach in drug discovery.Identifying new targets that can be modulated to achieve a therapeutic effect with an acceptable safety profile is often the initial step in drug development.While there is a growing emphasis on discovering novel therapeutic targets associated with diseases, the experimental validation of these targets is both time-consuming and expensive [25,26].To streamline the selection of the most promising target candidates for future investigations, researchers have turned to AI and machine learning (ML) techniques.</p>
<p>Lipinski's Rule of Five (Ro5), established in 1997 based on Phase II drug physicochemical profiles, guides the design of developable molecules by flagging potential issues like excessive hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors, high molecular weight, and elevated Log p values [20].While Ro5 has been instrumental in designing compounds for known targets, there is a growing need for innovation to target new biological pathways.Beyond Ro5, emerging modalities like bifunctional small molecules, peptides, and oligonucleotides offer novel avenues for drug discovery [27].Carbohydrate-based drug research is gaining traction, with over 170 approved drugs showcasing their potential across various therapeutic areas [28].Lipids, crucial for cellular function, present a rich source of drug targets, particularly in lipid signaling pathways and proteins [29].Druggable proteins, essential for small molecule interactions, remain a key focus in drug development, although the landscape of potential targets is still being explored.The challenge lies in efficiently delivering therapeutic agents, with traditional computational methods facing limitations in accurately predicting interactions.The wealth of complex</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced big data analytics in biomedical research by offering a wide array of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for extracting valuable insights from complex datasets.In the context of drug discovery, AI-driven models complement Ro5 by refining drug-likeness assessments and predicting molecular properties such as solubility, permeability, and metabolism with greater accuracy.AI enables the identification of exceptions to Ro5, allowing researchers to explore non-traditional drug candidates such as peptides and biologics that may not conform to classic small-molecule guidelines [10].In target identification, gene expression features are commonly utilized to unravel disease mechanisms and pinpoint genes associated with specific disorders [30].Repositories like NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provide extensive gene expression data for analysis [20].Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) play a crucial role in understanding the genetic basis of complex disorders, with platforms like GWAS Central and NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalogue containing valuable genetic data [31,32].For instance, Ref. [33] utilized multiple functional gene networks and a kernel-based method to prioritize genes based on disease MeSH keywords, enhancing the process of prioritizing disease-related genes.</p>
<p>AI tools like Google's DeepMind's AlphaFold, trained on protein structural data, can predict protein 3D structures from amino acid sequences [34], while text mining-based tools leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract structured data from unstructured text, aiding in traditional drug discovery processes [20].Notably, AlphaFold has been instrumental in determining the structure of previously unsolved proteins, such as those related to SARS-CoV-2, aiding in the rapid development of antiviral treatments [35].Additionally, AI-driven platforms like Insilico Medicine's PandaOmics have successfully identified novel drug targets for fibrosis and cancer, accelerating preclinical research [36].Text mining-based tools leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as IBM Watson, have also been employed in pharmaceutical research to scan vast biomedical literature and extract relevant drug-target interactions, expediting hypothesis generation for new therapeutics [37].These AI-driven approaches hold promise in accelerating target identification, drug development, and personalized medicine in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Drug Repurposing Using AI and ML Techniques</p>
<p>Drug repositioning in drug design and discovery involves exploring drugs that were initially developed for one disease and repurposing them for other conditions [38].The success of repositioning drugs is attributed to their ability to interact with multiple targets across various diseases, potentially leading to enhanced clinical efficacy.By leveraging this polypharmacology phenomenon, drug repositioning aims to identify new therapeutic opportunities by reevaluating existing compounds for different medical indications [39].This approach offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development, bypassing certain phases and reducing the overall time and investment required for bringing a new drug to market [40].</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in drug repositioning lies in customizing and optimizing methods to develop efficient and affordable drug repositioning pipelines for complex diseases [41].Screening methods for drug reuse are crucial, and approaches in drug repositioning can be categorized as drug-oriented, target-oriented, or disease/therapy-oriented based on available information quality and quantity.Additionally, classification can be based on network-based, ligand-based, chemogenomic, and machine learning (ML) approaches.With the rise of high-throughput technologies, computational analysis and mining tools are essential to explore vast amounts of data.In silico drug repositioning, driven by hypothesis, translates omics data into predictions of druggable targets, leveraging various data sources.AI and ML methods, utilizing publicly available databases, have significantly impacted drug discovery.For instance, DSP-1181, the first repurposed drug discovered through AI, entered clinical trials in less than 12 months, showcasing the accelerated drug development process.AI-based approaches have revolutionized drug development by rapidly identifying bioactive compounds from large candidate pools, facilitating precision medicine.Moreover, AI has enabled the creation of reverse vaccinology virtual frameworks and ML models that learn patterns from data, including deep learning for enhanced learning processes in drug discovery.</p>
<p>ML algorithms are replacing traditional methods like chemical similarity and molecular docking with new systems biology approaches to assess drug effects.This shift has led to the development of various AI-based algorithms and web tools such as DrugNet, DRIMC, DPDR-CPI, PHARMGKB, PROMISCUOUS 2.0, and DRRS in recent times.</p>
<p>Lead Optimization Through Machine Learning Algorithms</p>
<p>Integrating computational modeling with domain-aware machine learning (ML) models, followed by iterative experimental validation, can speed up the identification of possible therapeutic candidates.Although thousands of new candidates can be produced by generative deep learning models, their physiochemical and biochemical attributes are usually not fully optimized [42].There are several ways ML can be applied to accelerate lead optimization:</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Structural Alert and Toxicity Analysis: ML can be used to predict the toxicity of a compound based on its structure [43].</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>High-Throughput Virtual Screening: ML algorithms can quickly screen large databases of compounds to identify potential leads [44].</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>3D Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR): ML can be used to predict the biological activity of a compound based on its 3D structure [44].</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Multi-Parameter Optimization: ML can optimize multiple parameters simultaneously to find the best lead compounds [42].</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>Graph Neural Networks: These can be used to predict the properties of a compound based on its molecular graph [10].</p>
<p>De Novo Drug Design with Generative Models</p>
<p>A promising area in computational chemistry and drug discovery is de novo drug design using generative models.This is the process of creating new chemical compounds that may one day be used as medications using machine learning models [45].</p>
<p>The application of generative models for conditional graphs is one strategy.These models produce molecules by generating a series of graphs, each of which shows a potential intermediate state during the molecule's synthesis [45].This approach is quite flexible and works well for generation with several goals in mind.It performs better than models that produce SMILES strings, particularly in terms of the output rate that is valid [45].</p>
<p>A different strategy is to employ 3D deep generative models.For instance, the DeepLig-Builder programme uses an innovative graph generative model called Ligand Neural Network (L-Net) to construct 3D molecules with high drug-likeness that are both chemically and conformationally valid from start to finish.This model is used for structure-based de novo drug design tasks, in conjunction with Monte Carlo tree search [46,47].</p>
<p>For de novo molecular design, reinforcement learning can also be used with deep generative models.By using this method, the generative model can be adjusted to produce molecules with different sets of desirable properties [48].</p>
<p>These techniques have been used to address a number of drug design issues, such as the synthesis of compounds with a specified scaffold, molecules that meet particular requirements for synthetic accessibility and drug-likeness, and dual inhibitors against particular targets [26].However, it's crucial to remember that, despite their potential, these techniques are still in the research and development stages, and it is yet unclear how useful they will be in the actual process of finding drugs.Figure 3 demonstrates the integration of AI/ML algorithms across the drug discovery continuum.</p>
<p>Cheminformatics and Computational Chemistry</p>
<p>Cheminformatics, or chemoinformatics, stands at the intersection of physical chemistry theory and computer science techniques, offering a multidisciplinary approach to solving descriptive and prescriptive challenges within chemistry and its applications to related fields like biology [49].This field is founded on the principles of effective data representation and manipulation, harnessing the power of computers to store and process chemical formulas, properties, and pertinent information.Its primary objective is to develop tools and methodologies for managing vast sets of chemical data, enabling tasks such as data mining, machine learning, and predictive modeling [50].In parallel, computational chemistry, with its emphasis on computational methods, provides a complementary avenue for understanding molecular systems.Utilizing techniques like quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and density functional theory (DFT), computational chemists delve into the electronic structures, molecular dynamics, and properties of chemical compounds [51].</p>
<p>Virtual Screening of Compound Libraries</p>
<p>Discovering new scaffolds and chemotypes through high-throughput screening is incredibly challenging due to its labor-intensive and resource-heavy nature.The vast number of commercially available small molecules makes conducting comprehensive in vitro tests practically intractable [52].Drug discovery, particularly within biopharmaceutical companies, is among the most costly, time-consuming, and complex endeavors.It involves identifying and optimizing lead compounds from large chemical libraries, which must exhibit high-affinity binding and specificity for disease-associated targets,</p>

<p>Discovering new scaffolds and chemotypes through high-throughput screening is incredibly challenging due to its labor-intensive and resource-heavy nature.The vast number of commercially available small molecules makes conducting comprehensive in vitro tests practically intractable [52].Drug discovery, particularly within biopharmaceutical companies, is among the most costly, time-consuming, and complex endeavors.It involves identifying and optimizing lead compounds from large chemical libraries, which must exhibit high-affinity binding and specificity for disease-associated targets, along with favorable pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties (ADMET properties) [44].This process represents a multivariable optimization task typically conducted on supercomputers using reliable scoring functions to assess the binding affinity or inhibition potential of potential drug-like compounds [53].The main challenge stems from the sheer number of compounds in chemical spaces, making computational drug discovery demanding, albeit more cost-effective and time-efficient than experimental high-throughput screening.The primary objective is to identify the most stable (global) minima among numerous proteinligand complexes, which can range from 10 6 to 10 12 [54,55].To tackle this challenge, the parallel implementation of in silico virtual screening is essential to ensure drug discovery within feasible timeframes.In the field of drug discovery, virtual screening of compound libraries using AI/ML techniques is rapidly evolving.Several notable approaches have been developed to streamline this process including Virtual Synthon Hierarchical Enumeration Screening (V-SYNTHES), which significantly reduces the number of molecules requiring assessment in large chemical libraries.For example, from an 11 billion-molecule library, approximately 2 million are prioritized for screening based on their 3D structure and the target site [56].</p>
<p>VSFlow, an open-source ligand-based virtual screening tool, incorporates substructure-, fingerprint-, and shape-based virtual screening, offering high customizability [57].</p>
<p>AI Accelerated Virtual Screening Platform integrates AI algorithms to efficiently screen multi-billion compound libraries against diverse targets [58].</p>
<p>Machine Learning on DNA-encoded libraries, demonstrated by Google Research and X-Chem, combines physical screening with DNA-encoded small-molecule libraries and virtual screening using a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) [59].</p>
<p>Lig3DLens is an end-to-end computational toolbox for 3D virtual screening based on shape and electrostatics similarity to a reference (hit) compound [58].These methodologies harness the capabilities of AI/ML to expedite the drug discovery process by effectively navigating through extensive compound libraries.They signify significant progress in the field of computational chemistry and drug design, promising enhanced efficiency and efficacy in identifying potential therapeutics.</p>
<p>QSAR Modeling for Predicting Compound Properties</p>
<p>Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling is a computational technique used to establish a mathematical relationship between the chemical structure of molecules and their biological or chemical activities.The fundamental idea behind QSAR is that the biological activity of a compound is closely related to its molecular structure, and by quantifying molecular features, it is possible to predict the activity of new compounds [60].This approach is widely utilized in drug discovery, toxicology, and environmental chemistry to identify potential lead compounds, optimize existing molecules, and assess the risks of chemical substances.</p>
<p>QSAR models rely on the generation of molecular descriptors, which are numerical representations of a compound's physicochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity, size, charge distribution, and shape [61].These descriptors serve as the input variables for statistical or machine learning models, which attempt to correlate these molecular characteristics with the observed biological activity, such as potency, toxicity, or binding affinity.Common methods employed to build QSAR models include linear regression, partial least squares, support vector machines, and neural networks [61].</p>
<p>A key advantage of QSAR modeling is its ability to predict the activity of untested compounds, saving time and resources in experimental studies.However, the accuracy of QSAR models depends heavily on the quality and diversity of the data used to train them [62].Proper dataset selection is essential to ensure that the models are both robust and generalizable.Furthermore, QSAR models are limited by the quality of the descriptors chosen, as they must accurately capture the molecular features that influence biological activity.Despite these challenges, QSAR remains a powerful tool in computational chemistry, enabling more efficient drug design and risk assessment processes [62].</p>
<p>To address challenges and enhance predictive accuracy, ensemble-based machine learning approaches have emerged as valuable solutions.These methodologies construct a diverse array of models and amalgamate their predictions, aiming to overcome limitations and bolster reliability.However, prevalent approaches like random forests and other ensemble techniques in QSAR prediction often restrict their model diversity to a single subject, prompting the need for advancements in this domain [62].</p>
<p>In recent developments, Auto-ML tools have garnered attention for their efficacy in molecule property prediction tasks.Notable among these is Uni-QSAR, a tool that integrates molecular representation learning (MRL) encompassing 1D sequential tokens, 2D topology graphs, and 3D conformers.By incorporating pretraining models and harnessing rich representations from extensive unlabeled data, Uni-QSAR demonstrates promising capabilities in enhancing prediction accuracy [63].Similarly, tools such as DeepAutoQSAR and ChemProp have surfaced, offering versatile and widely utilized options in real-world applications [63].</p>
<p>Furthermore, the field has witnessed strides in Conformal Prediction (CP) algorithms tailored to advanced machine learning models such as Deep Neural Networks and Gradient Boosting Machines.CP represents a promising avenue due to its algorithm-agnostic nature, enabling the generation of valid prediction intervals under certain mild assumptions regarding the data distribution.Techniques such as Random Forest, Neural Networks, deep learning, and the Monte Carlo method have demonstrated success in generating robust QSAR models [61,64].</p>
<p>A notable strategy in QSAR modeling is the consensus approach, which aims to refine and enhance model predictions by leveraging new, advanced machine learning algorithms.This approach focuses on standardizing, streamlining, and automating various steps within the QSAR modeling process, culminating in a final prediction that synthesizes the outputs of multiple models [65].</p>
<p>Activity-cliff prediction is a concept addressing pairs of compounds that are structurally similar yet exhibit significant differences in binding affinity for a given target.These pairs, known as activity cliffs (ACs), pose challenges for QSAR models, often resulting in prediction errors.While it has been hypothesized that modern QSAR methods struggle with AC prediction, the quantitative relationship between AC prediction power and general QSAR performance remains an area of ongoing exploration [66].</p>
<p>Ensemble methods have emerged as valuable tools extensively employed in drug research within the QSAR domain.These methods encompass a diverse range of approaches, including data sampling ensembles, such as neural network ensembles based on bootstrap sampling in QSAR; method ensembles, involving ensembles against different learning methods for drug-drug interaction; qualitative and quantitative SAR models using ensemble learning; hybrid QSAR prediction models employing various learning methods; ensembles utilizing different boosting methods; hybrid approaches that combine feature selection and feature learning in QSAR modeling; and representation ensembles, leveraging ensembles against diverse chemicals for carcinogenicity prediction [62].</p>
<p>These ensemble methods represent a versatile and powerful collection within QSAR modeling, offering strategies to improve prediction accuracy and address complex challenges in understanding chemical-biological relationships.</p>

<p>Molecular Docking and Dynamics Simulations</p>
<p>Molecular Docking involves using computational methods to forecast how one molecule will position itself in relation to another when they bind together to create a stable complex.This technique is frequently employed in the strategic development of medications, offering insights into how small molecule drug candidates bind to their protein targets [67,68].</p>
<p>Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) offer valuable insights into the functional mechanisms of proteins, peptides, and other biomolecules.MDS can complement tradi- For example, Ambure et al. have created the user-friendly standalone program "QSAR-Co" version 1.0.0, which may be downloaded for free from https://sites.google.com/view/qsar-co (accessed on 4 January 2025) [64].The goal of this software is to create reliable QSAR models based on categorization for a wide range of data sets, even if the response data set values relate to several theoretical or experimental settings or to several biological targets.Using two well-known techniques-LDA and RF-the program offers all the necessary functionality to create classification-based QSAR models.In addition, it provides the necessary methods (such as ROC analysis and the Y-randomization test) to evaluate the robustness of the created models.These tools allow users to calculate the models' application domain and the prediction reliability for query chemicals.All the procedures needed to construct classification-based QSAR models are carried out by only clicking a button once all the parameters and approaches have been established [64].</p>

<p>Molecular Dynamics Simulations (MDS) offer valuable insights into the functional mechanisms of proteins, peptides, and other biomolecules.MDS can complement traditional experiments by providing a detailed understanding of biological processes at the molecular level [69].</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) can be integrated with these techniques to improve their predictive accuracy and efficiency.For example, AI/ML can predict the binding strength between a ligand and a receptor based on features derived from docking results, expediting drug discovery by narrowing down potential compounds for lab testing [70].</p>
<p>In a recent investigation, scientists utilized molecular docking and dynamics simulations to explore the potential inhibitory effects of ACE inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 targeting the hACE2 receptor.They discovered that Alacepril and Lisinopril interacted with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), which serves as the entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein [71].</p>
<p>Another study employed an unsupervised deep-learning framework to analyze the more flexible SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro).They conducted MD simulations of Mpro with various ligands, focusing on binding-site residues and stable protein conformations over time.The chosen optimal descriptor was the distance between residues and the center of the binding pocket.Using this method, they generated a local dynamic ensemble and utilized a neural network to compute Wasserstein distances across different system pairs, revealing ligand-induced conformational differences in Mpro [72].</p>
<p>Despite their promising results, it's crucial to acknowledge that these are computational predictions that require validation through experimental data to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Structure-Based Drug Design Aided by AI</p>
<p>Structure-based drug design empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a rapidly advancing field in recent years, fundamentally changing the way we identify or create effective molecular structures against disease targets with desired drug properties.This integration of AI has the potential to make the drug discovery process much simpler, faster, and more cost-effective [73].</p>
<p>An example of this game-changing approach is the Artificial Intelligence-driven Drug Design (AIDD) platform.This innovative platform uses advanced computer algorithms to automate the process of designing new drugs.It combines simulations and predictions for how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, excreted, and their potential toxicity (known as ADMET properties) with a powerful evolutionary algorithm [74].</p>
<p>Instead of relying solely on traditional methods that focus on making incremental changes to existing molecular structures in order to enhance their binding to target proteins [75], the AIDD platform takes a completely different approach.It uses an iterative optimization process that takes into account multiple factors such as target affinity, activity, as well as important pharmacokinetic and ADMET properties.This allows it to generate entirely new molecules that have similar properties to known lead compounds [76].</p>
<p>Clinical Trials Optimization</p>
<p>Patient Recruitment and Eligibility Assessment Using AI Algorithms</p>
<p>AI has the potential to greatly improve patient recruitment and eligibility assessment in clinical trials.By analyzing large datasets, AI can identify specific groups of patients who may benefit more from certain treatments.This helps researchers target their recruitment efforts towards those who are most likely to respond positively to the intervention [77].</p>
<p>AI algorithms can extract useful information from social media posts, such as discussions about symptoms or experiences with a particular condition.These data can then be used to identify geographical areas where the condition is more prevalent, making it easier to find suitable participants for a clinical trial.Instead of manually reviewing hundreds or even thousands of electronic health records, AI can quickly scan through them to identify individuals who meet the eligibility criteria for a study [78].This saves time and resources for both researchers and healthcare providers.Once potential participants have been identified, AI systems can automatically send notifications to both the healthcare provider and the patient, informing them about the opportunity to join a clinical trial [78].This proactive approach helps ensure that eligible individuals are aware of the option and can consider participating.Figure 5 shows various AI tools and their uses across the clinical trial process.</p>
