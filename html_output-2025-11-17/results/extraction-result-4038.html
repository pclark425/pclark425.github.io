                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> A mouse model of early sporadic tau pathology induces neurogenic plasticity in the hippocampus</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration and the accumulation of insoluble amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. However, at the earliest stages of the disease cell death and pathological tau are localized to the entorhinal cortex. In particular, the lateral entorhinal cortex, and its functions in object-related memory, are among the most vulnerable in aging. Notably, the entorhinal cortex projects directly to the dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis proceeds throughout adult life. Immature, adult-born neurons provide a robust source of plasticity to the entorhinal-dentate pathway and they may be uniquely responsive, or vulnerable, to early entorhinal tau pathology. To test this, we injected a human tau-expressing recombinant adeno-associated virus into the lateral entorhinal cortex and used AsclCreER mice to birthdate downstream dentate neurons born in early postnatal development or adulthood. Consistent with known roles in neurodegeneration, lateral entorhinal tau expression caused a loss of mushroom spines in downstream dentate neurons and reduced dendritic complexity of adult-born neurons in male mice. Presynaptic tau also increased neurogenesis levels and increased the density of thin spines on adult-born neurons. Despite these morphological effects, tau did not alter synaptic strength or the magnitude of long-term potentiation at entorhinal synapses onto adult- or developmentally-born neurons. Thus, in a novel model of early sporadic tau pathology, there are morphological changes consistent with neurodegeneration but also compensatory neuroplastic changes, caused by neurogenesis. Since immature neurons have also been identified in the human dentate gyrus, a similar neurogenic plasticity may help maintain entorhinal-hippocampal formation in pathological aging.</p>

<p>A mouse model of early sporadic tau pathology induces neurogenic plasticity in the hippocampus

Alzheimer's disease is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration and the accumulation of insoluble amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.However, at the earliest stages of the disease cell death and pathological tau are localized to the entorhinal cortex.In particular, the lateral entorhinal cortex, and its functions in object-related memory, are among the most vulnerable in aging.Notably, the entorhinal cortex projects directly to the dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus, where neurogenesis proceeds throughout adult life.Immature, adult-born neurons provide a robust source of plasticity to the entorhinal-dentate pathway and they may be uniquely responsive, or vulnerable, to early entorhinal tau pathology.To test this, we injected a human tauexpressing recombinant adeno-associated virus into the lateral entorhinal cortex and used AsclCreER mice to birthdate downstream dentate neurons born in early postnatal development or adulthood.Consistent with known roles in neurodegeneration, lateral entorhinal tau expression caused a loss of mushroom spines in downstream dentate neurons and reduced dendritic complexity of adult-born neurons in male mice.Presynaptic tau also increased neurogenesis levels and increased the density of thin spines on adult-born neurons.Despite these morphological effects, tau did not alter synaptic strength or the magnitude of long-term potentiation at entorhinal synapses onto adult-or developmentally-born neurons.Thus, in a novel model of early sporadic tau pathology, there are morphological changes consistent with neurodegeneration but also compensatory neuroplastic changes, caused by neurogenesis.Since immature neurons have also been identified in the human dentate gyrus, a similar neurogenic plasticity may help maintain entorhinal-hippocampal formation in pathological aging.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As baby boomers age, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is predicted to increase in prevalence such that over 1% of the world's population may soon have the disease [1].Unfortunately, AD pathology spreads irreversibly [2] and neuropathologic changes are often present at the earliest stages of the disease continuum [3].Despite these stark statistics, offsetting disease progression for even a short duration can have a meaningful impact by reducing the amount of time patients are afflicted [1,4,5].It is critical, therefore, that the earliest stages of the disease are better understood so that treatments that offset AD progression can be developed.</p>
<p>Alzheimer's disease is traditionally associated with widespread accumulation of insoluble Aβ plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates (tangles).However, in early stages of sporadic AD and human aging, tau pathology is found primarily in the entorhinal cortex (EC) before spreading, possibly through synaptic pathways, to the rest of the brain [6][7][8].The EC is the primary source of synaptic input to the hippocampus, providing highly processed sensory information for memory encoding [9].It is specifically layer II neurons, the subpopulation that projects to the dentate gyrus (DG) subregion of the hippocampus, that appear to be the most vulnerable: both mild cognitive impairment and the earliest stages of AD are associated with &gt; 50% loss of layer II EC neurons [10,11] and high-resolution imaging reveals specific age-related thinning of this pathway in humans [12].Alzheimer's Disease has classically been viewed as disease of the synapse [13,14].Indeed, synapse loss in the EC-DG pathway has been touted as the most reliable biological correlate of dementia [15], where memory deficits arise due to a hippocampus that is functionally disconnected from the neocortex [16].</p>
<p>The EC is not homogeneous but consists of medial (MEC) and lateral (LEC) subdivisions that convey information about the context and content of experience, respectively [17,18].Recent work has identified an anterolateral portion of the human EC that is homologous to the rodent LEC [19,20] and accumulates tau [7] preclinically.Behavioral studies in humans also point to earlier decline of the LEC, which is linked to specific initial disruption of LEC functions in object-related memory [21][22][23][24].Age-related vulnerability in the LEC-DG pathway may be conserved, as LTP at this pathway declines as early as 8 months of age in rodents (i.e.early middle age).</p>
<p>There is also heterogeneity in a major target of the EC, the DG, due to ongoing neurogenesis and the presence of immature neurons [25].It is typically appreciated that adultborn neurons pass through an immature critical period from ~3-6 weeks of age when they have enhanced afferent [26][27][28] and efferent [29] synaptic plasticity and greater intrinsic excitability [30].The question arises as to whether mature vs immature neurons may be differentially impacted by the types of presynaptic tau pathology that are observed in aging and the earliest stages of AD.Intriguing support for a possible regenerative function comes from evidence that adult-born neurons preferentially connect with the LEC [31,32] and develop the capacity for long-term synaptic plasticity at their LEC inputs over an extended window of time [33].</p>
<p>Transgenic mice expressing familial amyloid-related mutations have been the predominant model for studying age-related dementia, often revealing impaired EC-DG synaptic plasticity, DG neuronal atrophy and impairments in learning and memory [34][35][36].More recent models have incorporated tau and reveal damage in the EC-DG system [37,38].However, a limitation of most existing models is that tau expression does not recapitulate the pattern that is observed in sporadic human aging and AD pathology, where abnormal tau originates in the EC.To begin to address this issue the neuropsin promoter [39] has been used in an attempt to restrict tau expression to the EC.While these mice also exhibit deficits in EC-DG synaptic plasticity, impaired hippocampal learning, and spreading of tau into the DG [7,[40][41][42][43], detailed examination has revealed ectopic tau expression outside of the EC [44].Interestingly, even though tau is largely expressed in the MEC in these mice, it is the LEC that ultimately displays the greatest pathology [7].</p>
<p>To model the pattern of pathology observed in humans, with pathway-and cell-specific pathology, here we used a viral approach to localize tau pathology specifically to the LEC.Using transgenic mice to birthdate DG neurons we then examined how tau pathology impacts morphometric and electrophysiological properties of new and old neurons in the LEC-DG circuit.</p>
<p>METHODS</p>
<p>Animals and Treatments</p>
<p>All procedures were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of British Columbia and conducted in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.Mice had ad libitum access to food and water and were housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle with lights on at 7 AM.The general experimental design and timeline is presented in Fig. 1.Ascl1CreERT2 mice [45] were crossed with CAGfloxStopTdTomato mice [46] (Ai14; The Jackson Laboratory) to generate 82 male and female experimental mice whose precursor cells/newborn neurons could be induced to express tdTomato via tamoxifen injection [33,[47][48][49][50][51].All mice received recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) injections at 3-6 months of age to express Tau-GFP or GFP in the LEC and lateral perforant pathway to the DG.Tamoxifen (Sigma; T5648) was injected either on postnatal day 1 (1 x 75 mg/kg, in sunflower oil) to label developmentally-born neurons (DBNs) or 3 months after rAAV injection (1 x 150 mg/kg), to label adult-born neurons (ABNs).Brains were harvested for morphological and electrophysiological analyses at 4 months after rAAV injection.Sample sizes are described in the results section for each experiment.rAAV production Two vectors were used in this project: rAAV9-hTau40-Ubi-C-IRES-GFP and control virus rAAV9-Ubi-C-IRES-GFP.The human full length Tau is driven by the human Ubiquitin ligase C promoter followed by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) driven expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP).rAAV were generated as previously described [52].Briefly, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with either the pTR-GFP plasmid or the pTR-hTau-GFP plasmid, in addition to the pXX6 helper plasmid and pAAV9 serotype plasmid.Transfection was performed using polyethyleneimine reagent.The virus was harvested from cells and purified using an iodixanol gradient and concentrated using centrifugal filtration.Viral titer was determined with the dot blot assay described previously [52].Vectors are described as vector genomes (vg)/mL.Stereotaxic surgery and injection of tau-expressing rAAV Tau pathology was induced by locally expressing full length wild type human Tau (hTau; Tau40, 2N4R) in the LEC.Wild type, 4-repeat (4R) tau was chosen because sporadic age-related tau pathology is not associated with mutations in the tau gene, and overexpression of 4R tau is observed in Alzheimer's disease [53] .rAAV9-hTau40-Ubi-C-IRES-GFP (rAAV-hTau-GFP; 9.6 x 10 12 vg/ml) or control virus rAAV9-Ubi-C-IRES-GFP (rAAV-GFP; 1.4 x 10 13 vg/ml) was injected into the LEC of 6-to 9-month-old mice according to sterile surgical procedures (ages balanced across DBN and ABN groups).Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane, given Meloxicam (5 mg/kg, SQ), local bupivacaine (8 mg/kg, SQ) and lactated ringers solution (10 ml/kg) at the start of surgery.Following standard stereotaxic techniques, bilateral rAAV injections into the LEC were made at -3.6 mm posterior, ±4.7 mm mediolateral and −2.6 mm ventral relative to bregma.One μl of virus was injected into each hemisphere, at a speed of 200 nl/min, using a 30-gauge Hamilton needle and 10 μl Hamilton syringe with a microsyringe pump (World Precision Instruments).The needle remained in place for 5 min after the injection to allow diffusion.Tissue Processing and immunohistochemistry Mice were transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and brains remained in paraformaldehyde for 48 h prior to sectioning.Brain hemispheres were sectioned using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S), with one hemisphere cut at 100 µm for morphological analysis and the other cut at 40 μm for all other histological analyses.Brain sections were stored in cryoprotectant at −20°C until immunohistochemical processing.</p>
<p>For free-floating fluorescent immunostaining of red fluorescent protein (RFP; tdTomato), sections were first washed with PBS (3 x 5 min).The sections were incubated with a blocking solution of 3% horse-serum in 0.5% PBS-Triton X for 30 min, and then incubated with rabbit anti-RFP antibody (1:2000 in blocking solution; Rockland 600-401-379) for 48 hours on a shaker plate at 4°C.Then tissue was washed with 0.5% PBS-Triton X and incubated with secondary antibody (1:250 donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 555) for 1 hr and then washed with PBS.</p>
<p>For free-floating fluorescent immunostaining of tau protein, sections were retrieved from the cryoprotectant solution and washed with PBS.Brain sections were incubated in 0.01M citric acid at 98 degrees C for 10 minutes.The tissue was then immersed in 3% horse-serum in 0.5% PBS-Triton X for 30 min, and incubated with either a rabbit polyclonal anti-human tau (hTau) antibody (Invitrogen PA527287), a phospho-tau monoclonal antibody to detect AT8 (Invitrogen MN1020), a rabbit polyclonal phospho-tau Ser396 (Invitrogen 44-752G) or chicken anti-GFP (Aves Labs GFP-1010) for 3 days on a shaker plate at 4°C.After the primary antibody incubation, slices were washed with 0.5% PBS-Triton X and incubated with their respective secondary antibodies for 1 h (1:250 donkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 antibody; 1:250 donkey antirabbit Alexa 647 antibody; 1:250 donkey anti-chicken Alexa 488 antibody) followed by a PBS wash for 5 min.</p>
<p>All sections were stained with DAPI in PBS (1:1000) to visualise cell nuclei.Brain slices were mounted on slides and cover-slipped with mounting medium PVA-DABCO to prevent fluorescent fading.</p>
<p>Imaging and morphological analyses Images were acquired with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope for all analyses.For confirmation of surgical hits and viral spread from the LEC to the DG, tau and GFP were imaged along the anterior-posterior axis using a 10X objective.Images were qualitatively assessed for anatomical spread and presence of hTau and phosphorylated Tau variants.For cell density quantification, images of the LEC region were collected at approximately -3.8 mm (AP) from Bregma with 40X oil immersion objective at 1024 x 1024 resolution along a 1 µm thick z-section in the middle of the stack at 1X zoom.</p>
<p>For morphological quantification, 100 µm thick sections labelled for RFP were imaged from the dorsal DG (-1.2 mm to -2.2 mm AP relative to Bregma).Dendritic branching and spine analyses were performed on cells located in the suprapyramidal blade from animals that had hTau in the LEC and outer molecular layer of the DG.To measure dendritic branching, images of RFP-labelled neurons in the DG (n =3 per animal) were collected at 1024 x 1024 resolution with a z-stack step size of 1 µm with a 25X water objective (N.A.= 0.95) at 1X zoom.Dendrites were traced in ImageJ with the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin [54] to obtain dendritic length and number of branch points along dendritic tree throughout the 3D z-stack.Sholl analyses were performed to analyze complexity of dendritic branching [55,56] .</p>
<p>For measuring dendritic spines, images were acquired with a glycerol-immersion 63X objective (N.A.=1.40), at 1024 x 1024 resolution, 0.33 µm z-step size and 5X zoom.Dendritic segments from the same cells were sampled from the inner, middle and outer molecular layers to analyze whether spine counts varied in dendritic regions that receive hilar, medial entorhinal, and lateral entorhinal inputs, respectively.Thin spines (postsynaptic spines with thin neck and bulbous head) and mushroom spines (mature spines with a large head ≥ 0.6 µm in diameter) were counted with the ImageJ Cell Counter plugin and categorized according to established criteria [57].All spine counts were normalized to the dendrite length.</p>
<p>For measuring large mossy fiber bouton (MFB) terminals of granule neuron axons, images were acquired with a glycerol-immersion 63X objective, at 1024 x 1024 resolution, 1 µm z-step size and 5X zoom.The MFBs were sampled along CA3 subregions (CA3a, CA3b, CA3c) with an average of 5 boutons measured per region, for a total of 15 boutons per animal.The area of each bouton was measured the maximum projection of the z-stack sections using ImageJ.</p>
<p>MFB-associated filopodia protrusions, which contact inhibitory interneurons, were also counted and their lengths were measured.</p>
<p>Cell counting Quantification of DAPI-stained nuclei was performed in LEC layer II to determine cell loss under tau pathology.DAPI + cells were counted between -3.6 to -3.8 mm from bregma (virus injection site) in one section per animal from a slice taken mid z-stack with ImageJ Cell Counter plugin.Tissue area was obtained by tracing the 2D area of the LEC layer II and cell density was quantified by dividing cell counts by total area (to get cells per mm 2 ).For consistency, the ROI measured for cell quantification was similar in size across animals (average area = 0.16 mm 2 ).</p>
<p>Brain slice preparation Mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, I.P.) and were perfused with icecold cutting solution containing (in mM): 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 3 sodium pyruvate, 10 n-acetyl cysteine, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 MgCl2 (pH-adjusted to 7.4 with HCl and equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, ~310 mOsm).Transverse hippocampal slices were cut on a vibratome and transferred to NMDG-containing cutting solution at 35ºC for 20 minutes, before being transferred to a storage solution containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 75 sucrose, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgCl2 (equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, ~325 mOsm) at 35ºC before starting experiments.</p>
<p>Electrophysiology</p>
<p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made at near-physiological temperature (~32ºC) from identified tdTomato + granule cells in the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus.Slices were superfused with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 25 glucose, 1.2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2 (equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, ~320 mOsm).In all experiments GABAergic inhibition was blocked with bicuculline methiodide (10 uM).Recording pipettes were fabricated from 2.0 mm / 1.16 mM (OD/ID) borosilicate glass capillaries and had resistance ~5 MOhm with an internal solution containing (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 15 KCl, 2 MgATP, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 0.3 Na2GTP, 7 Na2-phosphocreatine (pH 7.28 with KOH, ~300 mOsm).Current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed at -80 mV.Only recordings with high seal resistance (several gigaohms) and low holding current (less than 50 pA) were included in analyses.For current-clamp recordings, series resistance and pipette capacitance were compensated with the bridge balance and capacitance neutralization circuits of the amplifier.A bipolar electrode was placed in the outer 1/3 of the molecular layer to stimulate the lateral perforant path (LPP) fibers.Stimuli (0.1 ms) were delivered through a stimulus isolator (A-M Systems analog stimulus isolator model 2200).Paired-pulse facilitation was assessed using 50-Hz pairs of pulses.For LTP experiments, single EPSPs (~3-5 mV) were evoked every thirty seconds before and after a single theta-burst stimulation (TBS) consisting of 10 trains of 10 pulses (100-Hz), delivered at 5-Hz, and repeated four times at 0.1 Hz, paired with postsynaptic current injection (100 pA, 100 ms).</p>
<p>Statistical Analyses</p>
<p>Analyses were performed in Prism 9.0 (Graphpad) and R. Cell counts were analyzed by unpaired t-test (DAPI) or sex x treatment ANOVAs (DCX)).Morphological and electrophysiological properties of tdTomato + cells were analyzed with mixed effects models (using the nlme package in R) rather than ANOVA, to account for correlations between cells that were sampled from the same animal [58].Likewise, Sholl data were analyzed by mixed effects models as described [59] and adapted for R [60].All post hoc contrasts were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Sidak method.All tests had significance set as alpha &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>RESULTS</p>
<p>Tau expression and histopathology in the entorhinal-hippocampal axis rAAV was injected into the LEC to induce hTau-GFP or GFP expression primarily in DGprojecting layer 2 neurons (Fig. 1, 2).A single injection resulted in widespread tau expression along the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes of the DG molecular layer, reflecting expression in perforant path axons.Only the very ventral DG failed to show expression (Fig. 2A).Expression was always strongest in the lateral perforant path, which targets the distal dendrites of DG granule neurons.In some mice there was also limited expression in the temperoammonic pathway targeting distal CA1 dendrites, which originates in LEC layer 3 neurons (Fig. 2).As expected, no hTau expression was observed in mice that were injected with rAAV-GFP (Fig. 2C).The pathological effects of tau are, in part, the result of increased phosphorylation and aggregation into paired helical filaments [61] .We therefore examined whether our model led to expression of these pathological forms of tau.Indeed, immunostaining with a phospho-S396 targeting antibody confirmed the presence of phosphorylated tau in the LEC and in the perforant pathway projection to the DG (Fig. 2D).Similarly, AT8 immunoreactivity revealed paired helical filament tau species in both the LEC and perforant path projection (Fig. 2E).Finally, we quantified cell density in LEC layer 2 since these neurons are particularly vulnerable in human aging and the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease.We found no significant difference between mice injected with rAAV-hTau-GFP vs rAAV-GFP (t19 = 0.45, p = 0.66).This suggests that our model may be most reflective of the earliest stages of age-related cognitive decline, when pathological tau has begun to be expressed in EC circuits but before any cell death has occurred.</p>
<p>Neurogenesis in hTau-expressing circuits Adult neurogenesis is reduced in most mouse models of Alzheimer's disease [62] and human neurogenesis levels, as measured by DCX expression, inversely correlates with the severity of Alzheimer's disease [63].To determine whether neurogenesis is altered in our model of early entorhinal tau pathology, we quantified immature DCX + cells in mice injected with rAAV-GFP (N=10 male, 5 female) vs rAAV-hTau-GFP (N=6 male, 6 female).Here we found that presynaptic hTau expression was associated with ~30% more DCX + neurons (Fig. 3).Neurogenesis was also higher in male mice than in female mice (2 way ANOVA; effect of sex: F1,20=4.9,P=0.039; effect of hTau: F1,20=6.2,P=0.022; interaction: F1,20=0.6,P=0.44).</p>
<p>LEC hTau reduces dendritic complexity in male mice</p>
<p>The morphological development of ABNs is highly sensitive to experience, activity and pathology.To test whether functionally-relevant morphological properties of ABNs are affected by presynaptic tau pathology we first analyzed the dendritic structure of developing, ~1-monthold ABNs with mixed effects models (GFP mice: N=22 male, 14 female; hTau mice: N=29 male, 15 female; labelling was too dense to permit accurate dendritic reconstruction of DBNs).There was no effect of hTau (T24=0.74,P=0.47) or sex (T24=1.4,P=0.19) on total dendritic length (Fig. 4).While the hTau x sex interaction was not statistically significant (T24=-2.0,P=0.054), the average dendritic length was 17% lower in male hTau mice as compared to GFP controls, but female hTau mice were 7% higher.We next examined the total number of dendritic branches and found that this was not altered by hTau (effect of hTau: T24=-0.08,P=0.93, effect of sex: T24=0.41,P=0.69; interaction: T24=-0.94,P=0.36).Since Alzheimer's pathology has been found to alter the primary dendrites of ABNs [64] we measured primary dendrite length but found no differences (effect of hTau: T24=0.07,P=0.95, effect of sex: T24=-0.39,P=0.70; interaction: T24=-0.36,P=0.72).</p>
<p>We hypothesized that presynaptic hTau at distal dendrites could alter the distribution of dendritic branches without affecting their length or total number.We therefore performed a Sholl analysis to quantify dendritic branching at various distances from the soma.Again, we used a mixed-effects model to account for correlations in the data that result from analyzing multiple cells from the same animal, and analyzing the same cells at multiple distances from the soma [59,60].An initial analysis, with hTau, sex and distance as predictors, revealed significant effects of hTau (T2472=6.7,P&lt;0.0001) and a significant hTau x sex interaction (T2472=-6.0,P&lt;0.0001) suggesting that hTau may have different effects on dendritic complexity in males and females.We therefore separately analyzed dendritic complexity in males and females.In females there was no effect of hTau on dendritic complexity (T943=-0.78,P=0.43; Fig. 4).In contrast, in males, hTau significantly reduced the number of dendritic intersections (T1394=7.2,P&lt;0.0001), particularly in dendritic branches located in the molecular layer ~160-260 µm from the soma.</p>

<p>To determine whether presynaptic hTau specifically affects post-synaptic sites we quantified the density of thin spines (which make up the majority of dendritic protrusions) on ABNs and DBNs, from GFP and hTau mice (ABNs: average 37 cells/mouse, 7 mice per group; DBNs: 11 cells/mouse, 3 mice per group).In ABNs from both male and female mice, hTau caused an increase in the overall number of post-synaptic spines (Fig. 5; effect of hTau: T27=2.5, P=0.02; effect of sex: T27=0.96,P=0.34, interaction: T27=0.1,P=0.92).This effect was similar in the inner (primarily associational/commissural inputs), middle (primarily MEC inputs), and outer (primarily LEC inputs) molecular layers (sexes pooled; layer effects and interactions all P&gt;0.47).We next examined DBNs to determine whether this difference was specific to ABNs.While we were unable to sample as many DBNs, due to the high density of labelling, our data suggests that hTau did not alter thin spine density on DBNs (effect of hTau: T9=0.46,P=0.65; effect of sex: T9=1.56,P=0.15, interaction: T9=1.51,P=0.16).There was also no effect of hTau on DBNs when examined as a function of molecular layer subregion (P&gt;0.46 for all layer-specific effects of hTau).</p>
<p>Thick, mushroom-shaped spines are more stable over time and may reflect long-term memory substrates [57,65].We therefore analyzed the density of mushroom spines in ABNs and DBNs.In contrast to the findings for thin spines, above, here we found a consistent decrease in the density of mushroom spines in hTau mice regardless of when the cell was born (Fig. 5; ABNs: effect of hTau: T27=2.9,P=0.008; effect of sex: T27=0.13,P=0.90, interaction: T27=0.62,P=0.54; DBNs: effect of hTau: T9=4.9, P=0.008; effect of sex: T9=1.1, P=0.32, interaction: T9=0.90, P=0.39).Finally, the loss of mushroom spines was observed in all areas of the molecular layer in both ABNs and DBNs (ABNs: segment and segment x hTau interactions all P&gt;0.21; DBNs: segment and segment x hTau interactions all P&gt;0.29).</p>
<p>LEC hTau reduced mossy fiber terminal size in CA3c</p>
<p>Tau pathology propagates throughout neurons and spreads across synaptically-connected pathways.While we did not observe tau spreading, to determine whether hTau-induced morphological changes are observed at sites that are downstream from the entorhinal input synapses we examined the structural properties of the output mossy fiber terminals of ABNs and DBNs (ABNs: average 32 boutons from each of 6-9 mice/sex/treatment; DBNs: average 21 boutons from each of 3-7 mice/sex/treatment).We first examined presynaptic terminal size, which serves as a proxy for synaptic strength [66].In both ABNs and DBNs, we found no significant differences between boutons from mice treated with the hTau-expressing rAAV vs GFP controls (Fig. 6; ABNs: effect of hTau: T25=1.0,P=0.32, effect of sex: T25=0.22,P=0.82, sex x hTau interaction: T25=0.64,P=0.52; DBNs: effect of hTau: T249=0.7,P=0.48, effect of sex: T14=1.04,P=0.32, sex x hTau interaction: T14=1.4,P=0.18).Since CA3a/b/c subregions have distinct functions in pattern separation and completion [67], we explored subregional differences and found that in ABNs there was a significant hTau-related reduction in bouton size in CA3c, whereas there were none in DBNs (ABNs: hTau x subregion interaction: T371=2.5,P=0.012, GFP vs hTau P=0.98 (CA3a), P=0.45 (CA3b), P=0.016 (CA3c); DBNs: hTau x subregion interaction: T245=0.18,P=0.86).</p>
<p>Mossy fiber terminals have filopodial extensions that contain presynaptic terminals that innervate inhibitory interneurons [68] and contribute to the sparse hippocampal coding necessary for memory [69,70].We therefore quantified the length and frequency of bouton-associated filopodia on ABNs and DBNs.For both measures, we found no hTau-related differences (Filopodia Length: ABNs: effect of hTau: T25=0.85,P=0.40, effect of sex: T25=0.33,P=0.74, interaction: T25=0.29,P=0.77; DBNs: effect of hTau: T73=0.81,P=0.42, effect of sex: T14=0.93,P=0.37, interaction: T14=0.52,P=0.61.Filopodia per bouton: ABNs: effect of hTau: T25=0.72,P=0.48, effect of sex: T25=0.25,P=0.80, interaction: T25=0.09,P=0.93; DBNs: effect of hTau: T250=1.14,P=0.26, effect of sex: T14=0.53,P=0.60, interaction: T14=0.68,P=0.51).</p>
<p>LEC hTau did not alter synaptic transmission and plasticity at lateral perforant path input synapses</p>
<p>The morphological analyses pointed to differences primarily in afferent structures, therefore we examined the physiological strength of LEC input synapses in the outer molecular layer.Excitatory postsynaptic currents increased in magnitude with greater stimulation intensity in both ABNs and DBNs (ABNs: 9 cells from 7 GFP mice, 16 cells from 11 hTau mice; DBNs: 13 cells from 8 GFP mice, 13 cells from 9 hTau mice).However, for both ABNs and DBNs, there were no statistically significant differences in EPSC size between hTau and GFP mice (Fig. 7A,C; ABNs: effect of stimulation intensity: T221=5.2,P&lt;0.0001; effect of hTau: T14=0.01,P=0.99; effect of sex: T14=0.1,P=0.92; hTau x sex interaction: T14=0.05,P=0.96; ; hTau x stimulation intensity interaction: T221=0.7,P=0.48; hTau x sex x stimulation intensity interaction: T221=3.6,P=0.0004; hTau vs GFP P&gt;0.5 for both males and females; DBNs: effect of stimulation intensity: T230=6.7,P&lt;0.0001; effect of hTau: T13=0.92,P=0.37; effect of sex: T13=0.80,P=0.44; hTau x sex interaction: T13=0.7,P=0.49; hTau x stimulation intensity interaction: T230=3.0,P=0.003; hTau x sex x stimulation intensity interaction: T230=1.9,P=0.06).</p>
<p>In our model, hTau is expressed presynaptically and previous work has found that the P301L mutation, when expressed in the medial entorhinal cortex, induces presynaptic deficits [71].We therefore examined paired pulse ratios, which can be used to assess changes in transmitter release probability and short term synaptic dynamics.As expected for LEC inputs, postsynaptic responses to paired pulses (50 Hz) were facilitating.They were also not different indicating no major changes in short-term presynaptic dynamics as a result of hTau expression (Fig. 7B,D; ABNs: T20=0.26,P=0.79; DBNs: T16=0.11,P=0.91).</p>
<p>To test whether hTau altered long-term synaptic plasticity, which could contribute to memory impairments in aging and Alzheimer's disease, we delivered high-frequency theta burst stimulation to the lateral perforant path and recorded EPSPs in current clamp.Both ABNs and DBNs displayed robust long-term potentiation, which did not differ between GFP-and hTauexpressing mice (Fig. 7E,F; ABNs: effect of hTau: T14=1.0,P=0.32, effect of sex: T14=1.1,P=0.28, sex x hTau interaction: T14=-1.2,P=0.25; DBNs: effect of hTau: T12=0.003,P=1.0, effect of sex: T12=1.6,P=0.15, sex x hTau interaction: T12=-0.79,P=0.45).</p>
<p>DISCUSSION</p>
<p>Here we tested how a mouse model of early sporadic LEC Tau pathology affects structural and physiological plasticity at the LEC-DG pathway.By targeting human Tau40 (2N/4R) to the LEC we induced preferential expression in the lateral perforant pathway to the DG, which was associated with tau phosphorylation and AT8-immunoreactivity for paired helical tau but no obvious cell death in the LEC or spreading of tau into other brain regions.The level of pathology could therefore be viewed as modelling an early stage in the process of pathological aging.In terms of downstream effects, LEC hTau caused a mix of neurodegenerative and, possibly compensatory, neuroplastic effects.With respect to neurodegenerative effects, hTau reduced dendritic complexity in male ABNs, reduced mushroom spines in ABNs and DBNs, and reduced the size of ABN mossy fiber terminals in CA3c.In terms of compensatory neuroplasticity, hTau increased levels of adult neurogenesis and it increased the density of thin spines, which comprise the majority of protrusions on DG granule cells.Despite these structural changes, there were no significant changes in synaptic physiology or plasticity.Thus, in the face of modest presynaptic hTau pathology, downstream DG neurons display some signs of degeneration but also react with growth-associated plasticity, in part through adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>Aging is associated with a stereotyped pattern of pathology and cognitive decline, where the lateral entorhinal cortex, and associated functions in memory, are among the first to deteriorate [7,21,23,72].Even in mild cognitive impairment and the earliest stages of Alzheimer's Disease, the majority of entorhinal layer 2 neurons have died [10,11].These cells provide the primary input to the hippocampus and therefore their loss deprives the hippocampus of sensory information needed to encode and retrieve memories.However, it is likely that entorhinal pathology begins long before frank cell loss.In rodents, lateral perforant path LTP declines as early as 6-9 months of age (i.e.early middle age) [73].In humans, histological staining for AT8 immunoreactivity has revealed a pattern whereby misfolded tau appears in the transentorhinal cortex as early as young adulthood [6] .While it is debated whether early abnormal tau is a fundamental component of Alzheimer's disease [74,75], the early rise in tau is toxic to neurons and synapses, in both animals [64,76] and humans [77][78][79], and is clearly a prominent component of early pathological aging.</p>
<p>Our observation of plasticity in both neural structure and function would appear to conflict with the common finding that abnormal tau has primarily neurogenerative effects including reducing neurogenesis, inducing cell death and atrophy of dendrites and synaptic structures, and causing deficits in synaptic strength and plasticity [40,64,76,[80][81][82][83].This discrepancy is likely because our model reflects a less aggressive and/or earlier stage of pathology, where we also restricted expression to the LEC as compared to brain-wide or larger regional expression.Thus, our model may more closely mimic the pattern of human early sporadic tau pathology, and our data indicates the potential for substantial compensatory plasticity.This is consistent with early findings that entorhinal damage in animals and Alzheimer's patients induces reactive innervation of the DG by entorhinal, commissural and sepal afferents [84,85].In mouse models of amyloid pathology, there are also examples of compensatory growth of new spines, a capacity that is lost as animals age beyond young adulthood [86,87].While there is evidence that tau can lead to an increase in both the formation and loss of spines [82], here we provide new evidence that spine plasticity may lead to a net increase in spine numbers early in pathological aging.While our limited sampling of DBNs may prevent any strong conclusions about their ability to undergo compensatory spinogenesis, the apparently selective plasticity of ABNs aligns with findings that ABNs in rodents ultimately have 60% more spines than DBNs [56].</p>
<p>The birth of new DG neurons declines dramatically with age in all mammals and, while there are initial species differences in neurodevelopmental timing, neurogenesis in both humans and rodents plateaus to comparable levels for much of the lifespan [25].Therefore the important question is whether there is sufficient neurogenic plasticity to offset pathological aging.To our knowledge, no one has directly tested whether neurogenesis contributes to behavior in aging; one study has manipulated neurogenesis in middle age but all others have manipulated neurogenesis in adolescence or young adulthood [25].Nonetheless, it is estimated that there is 0.04% of daily cell addition in aging, which is sufficient to add ~15% of DG neurons over the course of a decade, a number that may be relevant for combating the progression of age-related pathology [25].New neurons compete with older neurons for synaptic space [88][89][90][91] and also appear to replace them as a part of physiological aging [92][93][94].Thus, enhanced neurogenesis and spinogenesis could serve to replace synapses from DBNs that may be culled from the circuit.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is the possible long-term contribution of new neurons beyond the traditional (rodent) 4-6 week critical period of plasticity.Using zif268 as a marker of activity, adult-born neurons can be recruited during learning even when they are 19 months old, at rates that appear higher than embryonic-born neurons [95].Adult-born neurons also develop morphologically over 6 months (~25% of the lifespan) [56] and, unlike other (presumably developmentally-born) granule neurons, they undergo experience-dependent dendritogenesis and spinogenesis even when they are several months old [96,97].This extended plasticity may be particularly relevant for offsetting age-related LEC pathology since there are multiple lines of evidence that adult-born neurons preferentially connect with the LEC [31,32].Functionally, LTP at their LEC also develops over a much longer interval (months) than inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex [33].Given evidence that new neurons mature much slower with age [98,99] and in longer-lived mammals such as primates [100], there may be a substantial reserve of neurogenic plasticity in humans, even after proliferation rates have declined.While evidence from humans is limited, it is notable that human DG neurons appear to continue to grow dendrites well into old age [101,102].Immature DCX + neurons are present in the aging brain but are reduced in Alzheimer's disease [63] and a recent transcriptomics study suggests that in humans there is a pool of immature neurons that persists into aging [103].It remains unclear whether these examples of human DG plasticity reflect adult-born neurons, later-born neurons, or merely old neurons that maintain a persistently immature phenotype.However, it points to a population of plastic neurons that may be comparable to those that we have identified here, which engage in a synaptogenic response to presynaptic Tau and may help preserve the functionality of this pathway in aging.A first step towards addressing this question might be to include behavioral analyses of LEC-DG function, and to examine aged mice, or mice with more severe tau pathology (e.g.longer rAAV-testing intervals) since our hTau model failed to produce any electrophysiological changes.</p>
