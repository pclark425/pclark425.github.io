                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This research paper focuses on the challenges posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), particularly in the context of the medical domain. Hallucination, wherein these models generate plausible yet unverified or incorrect information, can have serious consequences in healthcare applications. We propose a new benchmark and dataset, Med-HALT (Medical Domain Hallucination Test), designed specifically to evaluate and reduce hallucinations. Med-HALT provides a diverse multinational dataset derived from medical examinations across various countries and includes multiple innovative testing modalities. Med-HALT includes two categories of tests reasoning and memory-based hallucination tests, designed to assess LLMs’ problem-solving and information retrieval abilities. Our study evaluated leading LLMs, including Text Davinci, GPT-3.5, LlaMa-2, MPT, and Falcon, revealing significant differences in their performance. The paper provides detailed insights into the dataset, promoting transparency and reproducibility. Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of safer and more reliable language models in healthcare. Our benchmark can be found at medhalt.github.io</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>This research paper focuses on the challenges posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), particularly in the context of the medical domain. Hallucination, wherein these models generate plausible yet unverified or incorrect information, can have serious consequences in healthcare applications. We propose a new benchmark and dataset, Med-HALT (Medical Domain Hallucination Test), designed specifically to evaluate and reduce hallucinations. Med-HALT provides a diverse multinational dataset derived from medical examinations across various countries and includes multiple innovative testing modalities. Med-HALT includes two categories of tests reasoning and memory-based hallucination tests, designed to assess LLMs' problem-solving and information retrieval abilities. Our study evaluated leading LLMs, including Text Davinci, GPT-3.5, LlaMa-2, MPT, and Falcon, revealing significant differences in their performance. The paper provides detailed insights into the dataset, promoting transparency and reproducibility. Through this work, we aim to contribute to the development of safer and more reliable language models in healthcare. Our benchmark can be found at medhalt.github.io</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of large language models (LLMs) (Agrawal et al., 2022; Radford et al., 2019), have led to transformative applications across various domains, including healthcare (Singhal et al., 2022). These models possess the ability to understand and generate human-like text, by learning patterns from vast corpora of text data. and making them valuable resources for medical professionals, researchers, and students. (Singhal et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023b) Despite their impressive capabilities, they are also subject to unique challenges</p>
<p>Medical Hallucination LLM Benchmark

<p>Figure 1: Med-HALT: A new benchmark dataset for LLM to test Hallucination in Medical Domain
such as hallucination. (Ji et al., 2022; Bang et al., 2023), where they generate plausible \&amp; confident yet incorrect or unverified information. Such hallucinations may be of minimal consequence in casual conversation or other contexts but can pose significant risks when applied to the healthcare sector, where accuracy and reliability are of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Misinformation in the medical domain can lead to severe health consequences on patient care and outcomes, the accuracy and reliability of information provided by language models can be a matter of life or death. They pose real-life risks, as they could potentially affect healthcare decisions, diagnosis, and treatment plans. Hence, the development of methods to evaluate and mitigate such hallucinations is not just of academic interest but of practical importance.</p>
<p>Efforts have been taken to mitigate the occurrence of hallucinations in large language models (Li et al., 2023a; Shuster et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), but not in the medical field. The purpose of this research work is to address the issue of hallucination in large language models specifically within the medical domain. We propose a novel dataset</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Example of Hallucination Of GPT-3.5
and benchmark, named Med-HALT (Medical Domain Hallucination Test), a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to measure, and evaluate hallucination in these models. More specifically, It enables researchers to assess the performance of new models, identify and mitigate potential hallucination risks, and ultimately enhance the safety and reliability of these models in critical medical applications.To the best of our knowledge, this dataset and benchmark is the first of its kind to evaluate the hallucinations of LLMs in the medical domain.</p>
<p>The Framework is divided into two categories of hallucination tests, namely the reasoning hallucination tests and the memory-based hallucination tests. The former category is designed to assess how well an LLM can reason about a given problem by means of False Confidence Test (FCT), None of the Above (NOTA) Test, and Fake Questions Test (FQT). The memory-based hallucination tests, on the other hand, focus on evaluating the model's ability to retrieve accurate information from its en-
coded training data, a critical task in the medical domain where information needs to be accurate, reliable, and easily retrievable.</p>
<p>Throughout this research paper, we evaluate and compare the performance of various large language models, including Text Davinci (Brown et al., 2020), GPT-3.5, LlaMa-2 (Touvron et al., 2023) , MPT (MosaicML, 2023), Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023a). By presenting the results and analysing their strengths and weaknesses, we aim to provide an in-depth analysis of their hallucination tendencies within the medical domain. We hope to contribute to the development of more reliable and trustworthy language models in the medical field. Fig. 1 shows the overview of the framework.</p>
<p>In brief, the contributions of this study are as follows</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposing New Datasets and Benchmark</li>
</ul>
<p>The study proposes a new benchmark and dataset called Med-HALT, specifically designed to reduce test, and evaluate hallucina-</p>
<p>tions of large language models in the medical domain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Diverse Multinational Medical Examination Dataset The work leverages a uniquely diverse dataset combining multiple choice questions from various medical examinations across Spain, India, the U.S., and Taiwan. The dataset spans across multiple medical subdisciplines, introducing variability and complexity to the hallucination tests.</li>
<li>Innovative Testing Modalities The paper introduces multiple tests including reasoning hallucination tests. Furthermore, the paper also proposes four tests for evaluating the retrieval or fetching capability of large language models from memory.</li>
<li>Rich Dataset Statistics and Detailed Analysis The paper provides comprehensive statistics and insights about the collected dataset from each medical exam across different countries. We have evaluated some of the most advanced language models available such as OpenAI's Text-Davinci-003, GPT-3.5, Meta's LlaMA-2 and TIIUAE's Falcon on our newly proposed tasks.</li>
<li>Contribution to Transparency and Reproducibility The Med-HALT framework, test designs, and dataset statistics will be openly shared, facilitating further research on mitigating hallucination in medical domain language models and promoting reproducibility of the results. Our benchmark can be found at medhalt.github.io</li>

<h3>1.1 Task Definition</h3>
<p>Reasoning Hallucination Test (RHT) The RHT task is formulated as a set $\mathbf{X}={\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{O}}$ where $\mathbf{Q}$ represents the questions in the sample, $\mathbf{O}$ represents the candidate options $\mathbf{O}=O_{1}, O_{2}, \ldots, O_{n}$. The output of an evaluated model is $\mathbf{y}=$ $y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{n}$ where $y_{i} \in 0,1$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Here, $y_{i}=1$ indicates the model chooses the appropriate option and $y_{i}=0$ otherwise. The objective of the RHT task is to measure the likelihood of a model to hallucinate in medical domain-based reasoning by assessing its performance.</p>
<p>Memory Hallucination Test (MHT) The MHT task can be described as a set $\mathbf{X}={\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{I}}$ where
$D$ represents the input data (e.g., abstract, PMID, title, or link), and $I$ represents the information to be retrieved (e.g., link, title, etc.). The output of an evaluated model is $y_{i} \in 0,1$, where $y_{i}=1$ indicates a correct retrieval and $y_{i}=0$ indicates an incorrect retrieval. The objective of the MHT task is to assess a model's capability to retrieve biomedical information accurately and measure the model's ability to avoid generating incorrect or incomplete biomedical or clinical information from memory.</p>

<h2>3 Types of Hallucination Evaluated</h2>
<p>The Med-HALT framework proposes a two-tiered approach to evaluate the presence and impact of hallucinations in generated outputs.</p>
<h3>3.1 Reasoning Hallucination Tests (RHTs)</h3>
<p>These tests assess how accurately the language model performs reasoning over the medical input data and whether it generates logically coherent and factually accurate output, without creating fake information. It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>False Confidence Test (FCT): The False Confidence Test (FCT) involves presenting a multiple-choice medical question and a randomly suggested correct answer to the language model, tasking it with evaluating the validity of the proposed answer, and providing detailed explanations for its correctness or incorrectness, in addition to explaining why the other options are wrong.
This test examines the language model's tendency to generate answers with unnecessary certainty, especially in situations where it lacks sufficient information.</li>

<p>Through these diverse evaluation metrics, the MedHALT framework aims to comprehensively evaluate language models for both reasoning and recall capabilities, thereby detecting different types of hallucination patterns and improving the robustness of the model against them.
<img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: Relative sizes of Reasoning Types in Med-HALT</p>
<h2>4 Data Analysis</h2>
<h3>4.1 Subject and Topic Analysis</h3>
<p>The Med-HALT dataset includes a wide variety of subjects and topics, showcasing the depth and breadth of medical knowledge. Subjects span from common ones like Physiology and Pharmacology to more specialized areas like Forensic Medicine and Radio diagnosis.</p>
<p>Nearly $95 \%$ of subjects include over 50 topics, and $70 \%$ exceed 100, demonstrating a vast range of medical content. An analysis was performed to count the samples per subject across each exam. The distribution and representation of each subject are presented in Fig. 4. This representation highlights the dataset's diversity and wide-ranging applicability, making Med-HALT a robust benchmark for evaluating medical large language models</p>
<h3>4.2 Exam Types Analysis</h3>
<p>The Med-HALT dataset incorporates a diverse set of medical entrance exams from various countries, allowing for a rich, multicultural examination of medical knowledge and practice. These exams include the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS PG) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET PG) from India, Exámenes de residencia médica from Spain, the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), and Taiwan Medical Licensing Examination (TMLE).</p>
<p>A comparative analysis of the ratio of samples from each exam, presented in Fig. 8, provides an understanding of the representation and diversity of different countries' medical exams in the dataset. This diversity encourages the development and testing of AI models that can handle a wide range of medical knowledge structures and exam patterns, increasing the robustness and versatility of MedHALT as a benchmarking tool for AI in medicine.</p>
<p><img alt="img-3.jpeg" src="img-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: Distribution of subjects count per exam \&amp; Cumulative Frequency Graph in the union of exams in Med-HALT dataset.</p>
<h3>4.3 Difficulty and Diversity of Questions</h3>
<p>we selected $30 \%$ random sample from various exam datasets and PubMed articles to understand the dataset's complexity and types of reasoning required. This analysis led to the categorization of reasoning into multiple types, including factual, diagnosis, fact-based reasoning, exclusion of distractors, question logic, multihop reasoning, explanation/description, mathematical, fill in the blanks, comparison, and natural language inference. Detailed analysis is provided in appendix A. 1 and Examples of these reasoning types are provided in Appendix 8, helping to illustrate the diversity and difficulty of questions within the dataset. Fig. 3 shows the relative sizes of reasoning types.</p>
<h2>5 Experiments</h2>
<h3>5.1 Baseline Models</h3>
<p>we utilized OpenAI's Text-Davinci. Furthermore, we incorporated OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo, a successor to Text-Davinci, in our core experimental evaluations. This model, while maintaining the robustness of its predecessor, also offers enhanced performance characteristics. Lastly, we incorporated state of the art open source language models like Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023b), MPT (MosaicML, 2023) and Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023). it offers unique capabilities and extends the scope of our evaluations.</p>
<p>These models were assessed in their default configurations, without any specific fine-tuning or hyperparameter adjustments, thus allowing us to understand their innate capabilities within the context of the Med-HALT framework.</p>
<h3>5.2 Implementation Details</h3>
<p>Our evaluation process for the OpenAI models is implemented via the Azure OpenAI ChatGPT API. Throughout the full dataset analysis, we set a temperature of 0.7 , defined a limit for token generation, and configured the frequency penalty to zero and top-p (Holtzman et al., 2019) to 1.0. For the evaluation of Open source models, we leverage Pytorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and Huggingface's (Wolf et al., 2019) Text-generation-inference library. The models were deployed on a Quadro RTX 8000 with 48GB of VRAM. We set a temperature of 0.6 and a top-p of 0.95 to generate the response.</p>
<h3>5.3 Evaluation matrices</h3>
<p>Accuracy : Accuracy gives us a simple and straightforward understanding of how often the models generate the correct responses. It's a ratio of the correct predictions to the total predictions made by the model.</p>
<p>Pointwise Score: This is a more in-depth evaluation metric that takes into account the positive score for correct answers and a negative penalty for incorrect ones, a structure commonly found in many medical exams. Each correct prediction is awarded +1 point, while each incorrect prediction incurs a penalty of -0.25 points. The final Pointwise Score is an average of these individual scores. The formula for this is shown in Equation 1</p>
<p>$$
S=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(I\left(y_{i}=\hat{y}<em c="c">{i}\right) \cdot P</em>}+I\left(y_{i} \neq \hat{y<em w="w">{i}\right) \cdot P</em>\right)
$$</p>
<p>Where $S$ is the final score, $N$ is the total number of samples, $y_{i}$ is the true label of the $i$-th sam-</p>

<h1>6 Results</h1>
<p>Our evaluation results, presented in Table 2 and Table 3 reveal that open access models Falcon and LlaMa-2 outperform commercial variants such as GPT-3.5 and Text-Davinci in all hallucination tasks.</p>
<p>Llama-2 70B outperformed other models with an accuracy of $42.21 \%$ and a score of 52.37 in the Reasoning FCT task. It is important to note that none of the models reached an acceptable level of accuracy on this task, highlighting the challenge of reasoning hallucination tests for current models.</p>
<p>In contrast, Falcon 40B excelled in the Reasoning Fake task with an accuracy of $99.89 \%$ and a score of 18.56 , demonstrating its ability to distinguish between real and fake questions. Falcon 40B Instruct achieved a similarly impressive accuracy of $99.35 \%$ and a score of 18.56 in this task. Llama2 70B performed best in the Reasoning Nota task, achieving an accuracy of $77.53 \%$ and a score of 188.6</p>
<p>In Information Retrieval tasks in Table 3 Falcon models (both Falcon 40B and Falcon 40B Instruct) outperformed OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and TextDavinci.Overall, Falcon 40B had the highest average accuracy across all tasks ( $42.46 \%$ ), Moreover it also achieved the best average pointwise score across all the IR tasks. Nonetheless, there is still substantial room for improvement across all models. Fig. 2 shows the example of hallucination in GPT-3.5 and Tables from 17 - 21 in Appendix shows different hallucination examples of LLMs.

<p>Figure 5: Variation in accuracy for different temperature values</p>
<h3>6.1 Effect of Instruction tuning</h3>
<p>Instruction tuned (Wei et al., 2021; Bai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022) models have shown to improve the zero shot ability to follow instructions and adapt to new tasks. However, the results from our hallucination tests indicate that there is a detrimental effect on model's ability to control hallucination after instruction tuning and RLHF. The effect is less for the Open AI ( Text-Davinci and GPT-3.5) and Falcon models. The effect is more pronounced in the Llama based models.</p>
<h2>7 Exploratory Analysis</h2>
<p>For the exploratory analysis, we randomly sampled $30 \%$ of questions from each exam dataset and PubMed articles. To ensure diversity and balance, we stratified our sampling by country, type of exam, and difficulty level of the questions.</p>
<h3>7.1 Effect of Temperature parameter</h3>
<p>In this section, we investigate the influence of the decoding parameters especially the temperature on the model's hallucination. To do this analysis we take GPT-3.5 and measure the performance across different temperature values on sampled examples. Fig. 5 shows the variation in accuracy for different temperature values. We could observe that the</p>

variation is minimal.
These results suggest that the temperature adjustments can influence model accuracy however the effect is negligible which suggests that other factors also matter in reducing hallucinations in medical tasks.</p>
<h3>7.2 Impact of number of few shot examples</h3>
<p>This section analyzes the impact of varying the number of few shot examples on the model's hallucination. We take GPT-3.5 to perform the tests and the results are summarized in Fig. 6. As expected, The accuracy of the model improves with an increase in the number of exemplars. At zero shot, the model's accuracy is just $7.31 \%$, which is quite low. This suggests that without any prior examples, GPT-3.5 largely hallucinates in the medical domain. As we introduce more exemplars in the prompt, the performance of the model increases. However, The level of performance improvement decreases as we increase the shot count beyond 3. These findings suggest that while providing more exemplars can indeed enhance the model's performance and reduce hallucination to a certain extent, the accuracy gains plateau after a certain number of exemplars.</p>
<h3>7.3 Sensitivity to Prompt Framing</h3>
<p>Our analysis in Table 4. shows that prompt framing influences the performance of large language models in Med-HALT tasks. As the prompts are changed from ambiguous to more specific and direct, the accuracy of the tasks improved. The details of the prompt and examples are shown in appendix Table $9-15$</p>
<p>These results demonstrate the importance of careful and strategic prompt design and stress the necessity for explicit, directed prompts to ensure that these models generate useful, accurate, and safe information.</p>

<h3>7.4 Repetition Experiments</h3>
<p>While the generation of the open source models can be controlled and made repeatable by setting seed and other required parameters, The commercial variants like OpenAI does not allow for that level of control. As a result, the generations from these APIs may differ even with the same input and parameters. To assess the consistency and accuracy of the GPT-3.5 model on our benchmark, we repeated a sample of questions multiple times. Across multiple attempts, the model's performance remained relatively stable with slight fluctuations. The highest accuracy was on the fourth attempt at $28.52 \%$, while the lowest was on the second and fifth tries, around $27.87 \%$. Results are presented in Fig. 7 Despite these minor variances, such discrepancies raise concerns in sensitive applications such as healthcare.</p>

<h3>7.5 Brittleness of LLMs</h3>
<p>During our evaluation we found that the LLMs were sensitive to prompt framing and decoding parameters. Altering the parameters even slightly resulted in models that earlier produced correct examples to hallucinate with wrong answers. This warrants for more research in this area to make LLMs more robust to all these settings. The applications using the LLMs to recognize these shortcomings and use the models with responsibility, especially in critical domains like Healthcare.</p>
<h2>8 Conclusion</h2>
<p>This research advances our understanding of hallucination in large language models (LLMs) within the medical domain, introducing the Med-HALT dataset and benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating and mitigating such issues. Our comparative analysis of models, including OpenAI's Text-Davinci, GPT-3.5, Llama-2, and Falcon, has revealed considerable room for improvement.</p>

<h2>A Med-HALT Selection Criteria</h2>
<p>The datasets of Med-HALT were selected in alignment with the following key criteria:</p>
<p>Domain-Specificity: The datasets utilized in MedHALT should ideally be related to the medical field. They should contain a broad variety of medical topics and discussions to challenge the language models sufficiently.
Authenticity: The data should be derived from realworld medical literature and resources. It's crucial for the data to reflect genuine, non-hallucinated medical knowledge to ground the study in reality and enable the creation of reliable outputs.</p>
<p>Groundedness vs. Hallucination: The datasets should ideally contain both grounded and hallucinated examples. The inclusion of both types would facilitate the direct examination of hallucination detection and mitigation techniques.</p>
<p>Size \&amp; Diversity: The datasets should be large and diverse enough to ensure the robustness of the findings. Small datasets might lead to overfitting and might not represent the complexities of real-world medical literature adequately. Diverse datasets, containing various medical topics, can help ensure the generality of the results.</p>
<p>Accessibility: The datasets should be publicly available and well-documented, ensuring that the study is reproducible and that other researchers can build upon the work in Med-HALT.</p>
<p>Difficulty: The datasets should pose a significant challenge for state-of-the-art language models</p>
<h2>A. 1 Difficulty and Diversity of Questions</h2>
<p>In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's complexity and the types of reasoning required, We conducted an in-depth analysis of a representative sample from each of the exam datasets and PubMed articles. a sample of $30 \%$ questions from each exam dataset and PubMed articles was randomly selected and manually analyzed. This analysis helped categorize the reasoning required to answer the questions into various types:</p>
<p>Factual: These are straightforward questions with fact-based answers, often requiring direct recall of established medical knowledge.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: These questions requires identifying the correct cause of a given disease or condition, requiring both a depth of medical knowledge and the ability to apply it in a diagnostic context.</p>
<p>Fact-Based Reasoning: This type of question requires the application of established facts to reason through a novel problem or scenario.</p>
<p>Exclusion of Distractors: These questions involve identifying and eliminating incorrect or less suitable options to arrive at the correct answer.</p>
<p>Question Logic: These questions test reasoning ability by requiring the test-taker to guide through complex question structures, often involving multiple sub-questions or conditions.</p>
<p>Multihop Reasoning: These questions require synthesizing information from multiple passages to reach a correct answer</p>
<p>Explanation/Description: These are the questions that require a detailed definition, explanation, or description of a specific term or phenomenon</p>
<p>Mathematical: These questions requires mathematical critical thinking and logical reasoning, often involving calculations or statistical reasoning</p>
<p>Fill in the Blanks: In these questions, the responder selects the most appropriate term or phrase to complete a given statement</p>
<p>Comparison: These questions require comparing and contrasting different options or scenarios</p>
<p>Natural Language Inference: This category includes questions that require understanding implied information, correlations, and logical inferences in

<p>Table 8 shows the examples of different reasoning types in the dataset.</p>
<h2>B Parsing Output and Handling Exceptions</h2>
<p>A major element of our study is the reliance on structured, valid JSON output from large language models (LLMs) in response to our tasks and prompts. However, ensuring that these models return the expected output format is a challenge. There are instances where the LLMs did not adhere strictly to the provided output format, resulting in malformed JSON outputs that need to be correctly parsed and processed. When handling these parsing exceptions, we have adopted a multi-process strategy to ensure robustness and correctness of our analysis:
Basic Parsing In evaluating the models' ability to follow instructions, we used the Promptify (Pal, 2022) Module. This direct parsing approach works for a significant proportion of the samples.
Escaped Character Handling To handle cases where the output contained both single and double quotes, we used a regex-based escaping function to properly format the string before running Promptify. This handles instances such as "The patient's symptoms are ...", which could cause errors in the parsing process.
Counting Unparsable Outputs However, for several prompts a high ratio of outputs remained unparseable even after using above methods. In these cases, rather than continuously re-prompting, we counted each malformed output as a failure of the model to follow instructions. This allowed us to calculate the rate at which models deviated from the requested output format across prompts.</p>
<p>Specific numbers on instruction following errors per model are presented in Table 5. While not a direct measure of hallucination, a model's tendency</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>We would like to express our deepest appreciation to the anonymous reviewers who have provided insightful and constructive feedback on this work. Their comments and suggestions have greatly improved the quality of our research.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the medical experts who kindly gave their time and shared their expertise to support our study. We would especially like to thank Samuel Gurudas, whose help with the visuals greatly enhanced the clarity and impact of our work. We would also like to thank Arul Murugavel for his work on the medhalt.github.io website.</p>
<h2>Limitations \&amp; Future Scope</h2>
<p>Our study has a few limitations and also presents some exciting opportunities for future research. The assessment of the models' capabilities was limited to reasoning and information retrieval tasks. This narrow focus could constrain the interpretation of these models' overall performance across various task types. More research needs to be conducted to understand the impact of factors such as model structure, training data diversity, and task nature on the performance of these models. In our research, we found that instruction tuning can sometimes make hallucination control worse. But, we didn't look into other methods that could help control hallucinations. In future studies, we could try using strategies like adding external knowledge or setting specific training objectives to reduce hallucination tendencies.</p>
<p>We did look at how changing the temperature parameters affected the model's hallucination and found some interesting things. But, we still need to do more research to understand how temperature interacts with things like the model's structure, the diversity of the data used to train it, and the type of task. We also need to test whether the ideal temperature range we found is the same for other large
language models or if it's unique to GPT-3.5. We also acknowledged the financial constraints of our study, which prevented us from including GPT-4 in our research. Future studies could seek to incorporate this model to enrich our understanding of large language model capabilities and performance, particularly in the medical domain.</p>
<p>Future research is needed to extend these findings by openly sharing the Med-HALT framework, test designs, and dataset statistics, we aim to encourage further research to improve the reliability and safety of large language models in the medical domain and to promote the pursuit of reproducible results.</p>

<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">GPT-3.5 Explanation</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Barret's esophagus is a condition in which the normal squamous lining of the esophagus is replaced by glandular epithelium, often with goblet cells. This glandular epithelium is called specialized columnar epithelium (SCE) and is the hallmark of Barret's esophagus. SCE is not normally present in the esophagus, but it can develop in response to chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This process is thought to be a metaplastic response to the chronic acid irritation. In mermaids, the diagnosis of Barret's esophagus would similarly be made by the presence of SCE with goblet cells in a biopsy specimen of the esophagus. Option 0 is incorrect because papillomatous flat epithelium is not a characteristic finding of Barret's esophagus. Option 2 is incorrect because inflammatory infiltrates are not a specific or sensitive finding of Barret's esophagus. Option 3 is incorrect because glycogenic acanthosis is not a specific or sensitive finding of Barret's esophagus. Option 4 is incorrect because it does not provide any information about how to diagnose Barret's esophagus, but rather concedes defeat. Option 5 is incorrect because it is not an explanation of how to diagnose Barret's esophagus, but rather a statement of ignorance</td>

All of the other options are incorrect because they are histological findings that could indicate certain medical conditions, but none of them are related to Barrett's esophagus. Papillomatous flat epithelium is associated with squamous cell carcinoma, specialized columnar epithelium with goblet cells is associated with intestinal metaplasia, infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells is associated with infectious diseases, and glycogenic acanthosis is associated with diabetes mellitus. $\checkmark$</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">GPT-3.5 Explanation</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">The term 'clean tooth never decays' is attributed to Pierre Fauchard, who is considered the father of modern dentistry. Fauchard was a French physician who published a book on dentistry in 1728 called 'The Surgeon Dentist'. In this book, he emphasized the importance of oral hygiene and advocated for preventative measures to maintain oral health. Option B, 'none of the above', is incorrect because the term 'clean tooth never decays' was actually given by Pierre Fauchard. Option C, Dean, is incorrect because there is no known association between this term and a person named Dean. Option D, MJ Rihanna, is incorrect because there is no known association between this term and either Michael Jackson or Rihanna. $\boldsymbol{X}$</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">Davinci Explanation</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">The term "Clean Tooth Never Decays" was not given by any of the options presented. It was in fact coined by dental pioneer Dr. William J. Gies in 1921 in an article he wrote titled "A Rationale of Dental Hygiene". Therefore, the correct answer to this question is "None of the Above". Option A, Perrie Fauchard, is incorrect because Perrie Fauchard was a French dentist who lived from 1678-1761, and was not the one who coined the phrase Clean Tooth Never Decays. Option B, Dean, is incorrect because there is no information about who Dean is, and therefore it cannot be established that he was the one who coined the phrase. Option C, MJ Rihanna, is incorrect because MJ Rihanna is not a dentist or dental expert, and therefore it is not likely that they coined the phrase. $\boldsymbol{X}$</td>

<td style="text-align: left;">Abstract</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Background: In the land of undead, there exists a magical flower with the power to <br> suppress osteoblastogenesis and mineralization. We explored the phosphatidylinositol 3- <br> kinases/Akt pathway as a potential mechanism for unlocking the power of this immortal <br> flower. Methods: Using a blend of necromancy and fictional science, we conducted a <br> series of whimsical experiments to explore the interaction between bone morphogenetic <br> protein-2 and the flower. Results: Our results showed that the flower had the power <br> to suppress osteoblastogenesis and mineralization, but only in the land of the undead. <br> Additionally, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/Akt pathway played a crucial role in <br> this process, as it enabled the flower to unleash its full potential. Conclusion: Our study <br> provides a novel insight into the magical properties of the immortal flower of the land of <br> undead, as well as the potential of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/Akt pathway for <br> suppressing osteoblastogenesis and mineralization in the realm of fictional medicine.</td>
