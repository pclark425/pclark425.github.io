<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>In the last year, new models and methods for pretraining and transfer learning have driven striking performance improvements across a range of language understanding tasks. The GLUE benchmark, introduced a little over one year ago, offers a single-number metric that summarizes progress on a diverse set of such tasks, but performance on the benchmark has recently surpassed the level of non-expert humans, suggesting limited headroom for further research. In this paper we present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks, a software toolkit, and a public leaderboard. SuperGLUE is available at super.gluebenchmark.com.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Recently there has been notable progress across many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, led by methods such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018), and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning from massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks. The tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual entailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).</p>
<p>In this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation framework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is a collection of nine language understanding tasks built on existing public datasets, together with private test data, an evaluation server, a single-number target metric, and an accompanying expertconstructed diagnostic set. GLUE was designed to provide a general-purpose evaluation of language understanding that covers a range of training data volumes, task genres, and task formulations. We believe it was these aspects that made GLUE particularly appropriate for exhibiting the transferlearning potential of approaches like OpenAI GPT and BERT.</p>
<p>The progress of the last twelve months has eroded headroom on the GLUE benchmark dramatically. While some tasks (Figure 1) and some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2 in Appendix B) measured in GLUE remain difficult, the current state of the art GLUE Score as of early July 2019 (88.4 from Yang et al., 2019) surpasses human performance ( 87.1 from Nangia and Bowman, 2019) by 1.3 points, and in fact exceeds this human performance estimate on four tasks. Consequently, while there</p>

<p>Figure 1: GLUE benchmark performance for submitted systems, rescaled to set human performance to 1.0, shown as a single number score, and broken down into the nine constituent task performances. For tasks with multiple metrics, we use an average of the metrics. More information on the tasks included in GLUE can be found in Wang et al. (2019a) and in Warstadt et al. (2019, CoLA), Socher et al. (2013, SST-2), Dolan and Brockett (2005, MRPC), Cer et al. (2017, STS-B), and Williams et al. (2018, MNLI), and Rajpurkar et al. (2016, the original data source for QNLI).
remains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE's high-level goals, the original version of the benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.</p>
<p>In response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of language understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a simple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technologies for English. We anticipate that significant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive innovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efficient, transfer, multitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.</p>
<p>SuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around eight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number performance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:
More challenging tasks: SuperGLUE retains the two hardest tasks in GLUE. The remaining tasks were identified from those submitted to an open call for task proposals and were selected based on difficulty for current NLP approaches.
More diverse task formats: The task formats in GLUE are limited to sentence- and sentence-pair classification. We expand the set of task formats in SuperGLUE to include coreference resolution and question answering (QA).
Comprehensive human baselines: We include human performance estimates for all benchmark tasks, which verify that substantial headroom exists between a strong BERT-based baseline and human performance.
Improved code support: SuperGLUE is distributed with a new, modular toolkit for work on pretraining, multi-task learning, and transfer learning in NLP, built around standard tools including PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017) and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017).
Refined usage rules: The conditions for inclusion on the SuperGLUE leaderboard have been revamped to ensure fair competition, an informative leaderboard, and full credit assignment to data and task creators.</p>

<p>(Collobert and Weston, 2008; Dai and Le, 2015; Kiros et al., 2015; Hill et al., 2016; Conneau and Kiela, 2018; McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018). GLUE was presented as a formal challenge affording straightforward comparison between such task-agnostic transfer learning techniques. Other similarly-motivated benchmarks include SentEval (Conneau and Kiela, 2018), which specifically evaluates fixed-size sentence embeddings, and DecaNLP (McCann et al., 2018), which recasts a set of target tasks into a general question-answering format and prohibits task-specific parameters. In contrast, GLUE provides a lightweight classification API and no restrictions on model architecture or parameter sharing, which seems to have been well-suited to recent work in this area.</p>
<p>Since its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several influential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown in Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking. On GLUE, GPT and BERT achieved scores of 72.8 and 80.2 respectively, relative to 66.5 for an ELMo-based model (Peters et al., 2018) and 63.7 for the strongest baseline with no multitask learning or pretraining above the word level. Recent models (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) have clearly surpassed estimates of non-expert human performance on GLUE (Nangia and Bowman, 2019). The success of these models on GLUE has been driven by ever-increasing model capacity, compute power, and data quantity, as well as innovations in model expressivity (from recurrent to bidirectional recurrent to multi-headed transformer encoders) and degree of contextualization (from learning representation of words in isolation to using uni-directional contexts and ultimately to leveraging bidirectional contexts).</p>
<p>In parallel to work scaling up pretrained models, several studies have focused on complementary methods for augmenting performance of pretrained models. Phang et al. (2018) show that BERT can be improved using two-stage pretraining, i.e., fine-tuning the pretrained model on an intermediate data-rich supervised task before fine-tuning it again on a data-poor target task. Liu et al. (2019d,c) and Bach et al. (2018) get further improvements respectively via multi-task finetuning and using massive amounts of weak supervision. Clark et al. (2019b) demonstrate that knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015; Furlanello et al., 2018) can lead to student networks that outperform their teachers. Overall, the quantity and quality of research contributions aimed at the challenges posed by GLUE underline the utility of this style of benchmark for machine learning researchers looking to evaluate new application-agnostic methods on language understanding.
Limits to current approaches are also apparent via the GLUE suite. Performance on the GLUE diagnostic entailment dataset, at $0.42 R_{3}$, falls far below the average human performance of 0.80 $R_{3}$ reported in the original GLUE publication, with models performing near, or even below, chance on some linguistic phenomena (Figure 2, Appendix B). While some initially difficult categories saw gains from advances on GLUE (e.g., double negation), others remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotonicity). This suggests that even as unsupervised pretraining produces ever-better statistical summaries of text, it remains difficult to extract many details crucial to semantics without the right kind of supervision. Much recent work has made similar observations about the limitations of existing pretrained models (Jia and Liang, 2017; Naik et al., 2018; McCoy and Linzen, 2019; McCoy et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019a,b).</p>

<h1>3 SuperGLUE Overview</h1>
<h3>3.1 Design Process</h3>
<p>The goal of SuperGLUE is to provide a simple, robust evaluation metric of any method capable of being applied to a broad range of language understanding tasks. To that end, in designing SuperGLUE, we identify the following desiderata of tasks in the benchmark:</p>
<p>Task substance: Tasks should test a system's ability to understand and reason about texts in English.
Task difficulty: Tasks should be beyond the scope of current state-of-the-art systems, but solvable by most college-educated English speakers. We exclude tasks that require domain-specific knowledge, e.g. medical notes or scientific papers.</p>
<p>Evaluability: Tasks must have an automatic performance metric that corresponds well to human judgments of output quality. Some text generation tasks fail to meet this criteria due to issues with automatic metrics like ROUGE and BLEU (Callison-Burch et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016, i.a.).</p>
<p>Public data: We require that tasks have existing public training data in order to minimize the risks involved in newly-created datasets. We also prefer tasks for which we have access to (or could create) a test set with private labels.</p>
<p>Task format: We prefer tasks that had relatively simple input and output formats, to avoid incentivizing the users of the benchmark to create complex task-specific model architectures. Still, while GLUE is restricted to tasks involving single sentence or sentence pair inputs, for SuperGLUE we expand the scope to consider tasks with longer inputs. This yields a set of tasks that requires understanding individual tokens in context, complete sentences, inter-sentence relations, and entire paragraphs.</p>
<p>License: Task data must be available under licences that allow use and redistribution for research purposes.</p>
<p>To identify possible tasks for SuperGLUE, we disseminated a public call for task proposals to the NLP community, and received approximately 30 proposals. We filtered these proposals according to our criteria. Many proposals were not suitable due to licensing issues, complex formats, and insufficient headroom; we provide examples of such tasks in Appendix D. For each of the remaining tasks, we ran a BERT-based baseline and a human baseline, and filtered out tasks which were either too challenging for humans without extensive training or too easy for our machine baselines.</p>
<h1>3.2 Selected Tasks</h1>
<p>Following this process, we arrived at eight tasks to use in SuperGLUE. See Tables 1 and 2 for details and specific examples of each task.</p>
<p>BoolQ (Boolean Questions, Clark et al., 2019a) is a QA task where each example consists of a short passage and a yes/no question about the passage. The questions are provided anonymously and unsolicited by users of the Google search engine, and afterwards paired with a paragraph from a Wikipedia article containing the answer. Following the original work, we evaluate with accuracy.</p>
<p>CB (CommitmentBank, de Marneffe et al., 2019) is a corpus of short texts in which at least one sentence contains an embedded clause. Each of these embedded clauses is annotated with the degree to which it appears the person who wrote the text is committed to the truth of the clause. The resulting task framed as three-class textual entailment on examples that are drawn from the Wall Street Journal, fiction from the British National Corpus, and Switchboard. Each example consists of a premise containing an embedded clause and the corresponding hypothesis is the extraction of that clause. We use a subset of the data that had inter-annotator agreement above $80 \%$. The data is imbalanced (relatively fewer neutral examples), so we evaluate using accuracy and F1, where for multi-class F1 we compute the unweighted average of the F1 per class.</p>
<p>COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives, Roemmele et al., 2011) is a causal reasoning task in which a system is given a premise sentence and must determine either the cause or effect of the premise from two possible choices. All examples are handcrafted and focus on topics from blogs and a photography-related encyclopedia. Following the original work, we evaluate using accuracy.</p>
<p>MultiRC (Multi-Sentence Reading Comprehension, Khashabi et al., 2018) is a QA task where each example consists of a context paragraph, a question about that paragraph, and a list of possible answers. The system must predict which answers are true and which are false. While many QA tasks exist, we use MultiRC because of a number of desirable properties: (i) each question can have multiple possible correct answers, so each question-answer pair must be evaluated independent of other pairs, (ii) the questions are designed such that answering each question requires drawing facts from multiple context sentences, and (iii) the question-answer pair format more closely matches the API of other tasks in SuperGLUE than the more popular span-extractive QA format does. The paragraphs are drawn from seven domains including news, fiction, and historical text. The evaluation metrics are F1 over all answer-options ( $\mathrm{F} 1_{\alpha}$ ) and exact match of each question's set of answers (EM).</p>
<p>ReCoRD (Reading Comprehension with Commonsense Reasoning Dataset, Zhang et al., 2018) is a multiple-choice QA task. Each example consists of a news article and a Cloze-style question about the article in which one entity is masked out. The system must predict the masked out entity from a list of possible entities in the provided passage, where the same entity may be expressed with multiple different surface forms, which are all considered correct. Articles are from CNN and Daily Mail. We evaluate with max (over all mentions) token-level F1 and exact match (EM).</p>
<p>RTE (Recognizing Textual Entailment) datasets come from a series of annual competitions on textual entailment. RTE is included in GLUE, and we use the same data and format as GLUE: We merge data from RTE1 (Dagan et al., 2006), RTE2 (Bar Haim et al., 2006), RTE3 (Giampiccolo et al., 2007), and RTE5 (Bentivogli et al., 2009). All datasets are combined and converted to two-class classification: entailment and not_entailment. Of all the GLUE tasks, RTE is among those that benefits from transfer learning the most, with performance jumping from near random-chance ( $\sim 56 \%$ ) at the time of GLUE's launch to $86.3 \%$ accuracy (Liu et al., 2019d; Yang et al., 2019) at the time of writing. Given the nearly eight point gap with respect to human performance, however, the task is not yet solved by machines, and we expect the remaining gap to be difficult to close.
WiC (Word-in-Context, Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados, 2019) is a word sense disambiguation task cast as binary classification of sentence pairs. Given two text snippets and a polysemous word that appears in both sentences, the task is to determine whether the word is used with the same sense in both sentences. Sentences are drawn from WordNet (Miller, 1995), VerbNet (Schuler, 2005), and Wiktionary. We follow the original work and evaluate using accuracy.
WSC (Winograd Schema Challenge, Levesque et al., 2012) is a coreference resolution task in which examples consist of a sentence with a pronoun and a list of noun phrases from the sentence. The system must determine the correct referrent of the pronoun from among the provided choices. Winograd schemas are designed to require everyday knowledge and commonsense reasoning to solve.
GLUE includes a version of WSC recast as NLI, known as WNLI. Until very recently, no substantial progress had been made on WNLI, with many submissions opting to submit majority class predictions. ${ }^{2}$ In the past few months, several works (Kocijan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019d) have made rapid progress via a hueristic data augmentation scheme, raising machine performance to $90.4 \%$ accuracy. Given estimated human performance of $\sim 96 \%$, there is still a gap between machine and human performance, which we expect will be relatively difficult to close. We therefore include a version of WSC cast as binary classification, where each example consists of a sentence with a marked pronoun and noun, and the task is to determine if the pronoun refers to that noun. The training and validation examples are drawn from the original WSC data (Levesque et al., 2012), as well as those distributed by the affiliated organization Commonsense Reasoning. ${ }^{3}$ The test examples are derived from fiction books and have been shared with us by the authors of the original dataset. We evaluate using accuracy.</p>
<h1>3.3 Scoring</h1>
<p>As with GLUE, we seek to give a sense of aggregate system performance over all tasks by averaging scores of all tasks. Lacking a fair criterion with which to weight the contributions of each task to the overall score, we opt for the simple approach of weighing each task equally, and for tasks with multiple metrics, first averaging those metrics to get a task score.</p>
<h3>3.4 Tools for Model Analysis</h3>
<p>Analyzing Linguistic and World Knowledge in Models GLUE includes an expert-constructed, diagnostic dataset that automatically tests models for a broad range of linguistic, commonsense, and world knowledge. Each example in this broad-coverage diagnostic is a sentence pair labeled with a three-way entailment relation (entailment, neutral, or contradiction) and tagged with labels that indicate the phenomena that characterize the relationship between the two sentences. Submissions to the GLUE leaderboard are required to include predictions from the submission's MultiNLI classifier on the diagnostic dataset, and analyses of the results were shown alongside the main leaderboard. Since this diagnostic task has proved difficult for top models, we retain it in SuperGLUE. However, since MultiNLI is not part of SuperGLUE, we collapse contradiction and neutral into a single not_entailment label, and request that submissions include predictions on the resulting set from the model used for the RTE task. We estimate human performance following the same procedure we use</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>for the benchmark tasks (Section C). We estimate an accuracy of $88 \%$ and a Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC, the two-class variant of the $R_{3}$ metric used in GLUE) of 0.77 .</p>
<p>Analyzing Gender Bias in Models Recent work has identified the presence and amplification of many social biases in data-driven machine learning models (Lu et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018, i.a.). To promote the detection of such biases, we include Winogender (Rudinger et al., 2018) as an additional diagnostic dataset. Winogender is designed to measure gender bias in coreference resolution systems. We use the Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection (Poliak et al., 2018) version that casts Winogender as a textual entailment task.Each example consists of a premise sentence with a male or female pronoun and a hypothesis giving a possible antecedent of the pronoun. Examples occur in minimal pairs, where the only difference between an example and its pair is the gender of the pronoun in the premise. Performance on Winogender is measured with accuracy and the gender parity score: the percentage of minimal pairs for which the predictions are the same. A system can trivially obtain a perfect gender parity score by guessing the same class for all examples, so a high gender parity score is meaningless unless accompanied by high accuracy. We collect non-expert annotations to estimate human performance, and observe an accuracy of $99.7 \%$ and a gender parity score of 0.99 .
Like any diagnostic, Winogender has limitations. It offers only positive predictive value: A poor bias score is clear evidence that a model exhibits gender bias, but a good score does not mean that the model is unbiased. More specifically, in the DNC version of the task, a low gender parity score means that a model's prediction of textual entailment can be changed with a change in pronouns, all else equal. It is plausible that there are forms of bias that are relevant to target tasks of interest, but that do not surface in this setting (Gonen and Goldberg, 2019). Also, Winogender does not cover all forms of social bias, or even all forms of gender. For instance, the version of the data used here offers no coverage of gender-neutral they or non-binary pronouns. Despite these limitations, we believe that Winogender's inclusion is worthwhile in providing a coarse sense of how social biases evolve with model performance and for keeping attention on the social ramifications of NLP models.</p>
<h1>4 Using SuperGLUE</h1>
<p>Software Tools To facilitate using SuperGLUE, we release jiant (Wang et al., 2019b), ${ }^{4}$ a modular software toolkit, built with PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2017), components from AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2017), and the transformers package. ${ }^{5}$ jiant implements our baselines and supports the evaluation of custom models and training methods on the benchmark tasks. The toolkit includes support for existing popular pretrained models such as OpenAI GPT and BERT, as well as support for multistage and multitask learning of the kind seen in the strongest models on GLUE.</p>
<p>Eligibility Any system or method that can produce predictions for the SuperGLUE tasks is eligible for submission to the leaderboard, subject to the data-use and submission frequency policies stated immediately below. There are no restrictions on the type of methods that may be used, and there is no requirement that any form of parameter sharing or shared initialization be used across the tasks in the benchmark. To limit overfitting to the private test data, users are limited to a maximum of two submissions per day and six submissions per month.</p>
<p>Data Data for the tasks are available for download through the SuperGLUE site and through a download script included with the software toolkit. Each task comes with a standardized training set, development set, and unlabeled test set. Submitted systems may use any public or private data when developing their systems, with a few exceptions: Systems may only use the SuperGLUE-distributed versions of the task datasets, as these use different train/validation/test splits from other public versions in some cases. Systems also may not use the unlabeled test data for the tasks in system development in any way, may not use the structured source data that was used to collect the WiC labels (sense-annotated example sentences from WordNet, VerbNet, and Wiktionary) in any way, and may not build systems that share information across separate test examples in any way.
To ensure reasonable credit assignment, because we build very directly on prior work, we ask the authors of submitted systems to directly name and cite the specific datasets that they use, including the benchmark datasets. We will enforce this as a requirement for papers to be listed on the leaderboard.</p>

<h1>5 Experiments</h1>
<h3>5.1 Baselines</h3>
<p>BERT Our main baselines are built around BERT, variants of which are among the most successful approach on GLUE at the time of writing. Specifically, we use the bert-large-cased variant. Following the practice recommended in Devlin et al. (2019), for each task, we use the simplest possible architecture on top of BERT. We fine-tune a copy of the pretrained BERT model separately for each task, and leave the development of multi-task learning models to future work. For training, we use the procedure specified in Devlin et al. (2019): We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) with an initial learning rate of $10^{-5}$ and fine-tune for a maximum of 10 epochs.
For classification tasks with sentence-pair inputs (BoolQ, CB, RTE, WiC), we concatenate the sentences with a [SEP] token, feed the fused input to BERT, and use a logistic regression classifier that sees the representation corresponding to [CLS]. For WiC, we also concatenate the representation of the marked word. For COPA, MultiRC, and ReCoRD, for each answer choice, we similarly concatenate the context with that answer choice and feed the resulting sequence into BERT to produce an answer representation. For COPA, we project these representations into a scalar, and take as the answer the choice with the highest associated scalar. For MultiRC, because each question can have more than one correct answer, we feed each answer representation into a logistic regression classifier. For ReCoRD, we also evaluate the probability of each candidate independent of other candidates, and take the most likely candidate as the model's prediction. For WSC, which is a span-based task, we use a model inspired by Tenney et al. (2019). Given the BERT representation for each word in the original sentence, we get span representations of the pronoun and noun phrase via a self-attention span-pooling operator (Lee et al., 2017), before feeding it into a logistic regression classifier.</p>
<p>BERT++ We also report results using BERT with additional training on related datasets before fine-tuning on the benchmark tasks, following the STILTs style of transfer learning (Phang et al., 2018). Given the productive use of MultiNLI in pretraining and intermediate fine-tuning of pretrained language models (Conneau et al., 2017; Phang et al., 2018, i.a.), for CB, RTE, and BoolQ, we use MultiNLI as a transfer task by first using the above procedure on MultiNLI. Similarly, given the similarity of COPA to SWAG (Zellers et al., 2018), we first fine-tune BERT on SWAG. These results are reported as BERT++. For all other tasks, we reuse the results of BERT fine-tuned on just that task.</p>
<p>Other Baselines We include a baseline where for each task we simply predict the majority class, ${ }^{6}$ as well as a bag-of-words baseline where each input is represented as an average of its tokens' GloVe word vectors (the 300D/840B release from Pennington et al., 2014). Finally, we list the best known result on each task as of May 2019, except on tasks which we recast (WSC), resplit (CB), or achieve</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>the best known result (WiC). The outside results for COPA, MultiRC, and RTE are from Sap et al. (2019), Trivedi et al. (2019), and Liu et al. (2019d) respectively.</p>
<p>Human Performance Pilehvar and Camacho-Collados (2019), Khashabi et al. (2018), Nangia and Bowman (2019), and Zhang et al. (2018) respectively provide estimates for human performance on WiC, MultiRC, RTE, and ReCoRD. For the remaining tasks, including the diagnostic set, we estimate human performance by hiring crowdworker annotators through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform to reannotate a sample of each test set. We follow a two step procedure where a crowd worker completes a short training phase before proceeding to the annotation phase, modeled after the method used by Nangia and Bowman (2019) for GLUE. See Appendix C for details.</p>
<h1>5.2 Results</h1>
<p>Table 3 shows results for all baselines. The most frequent class and CBOW baselines do not perform well overall, achieving near chance performance for several of the tasks. Using BERT increases the average SuperGLUE score by 25 points, attaining significant gains on all of the benchmark tasks, particularly MultiRC, ReCoRD, and RTE. On WSC, BERT actually performs worse than the simple baselines, likely due to the small size of the dataset and the lack of data augmentation. Using MultiNLI as an additional source of supervision for BoolQ, CB, and RTE leads to a 2-5 point improvement on all tasks. Using SWAG as a transfer task for COPA sees an 8 point improvement.
Our best baselines still lag substantially behind human performance. On average, there is a nearly 20 point gap between BERT++ and human performance. The largest gap is on WSC, with a 35 point difference between the best model and human performance. The smallest margins are on BoolQ, CB, RTE, and WiC, with gaps of around 10 points on each of these. We believe these gaps will be challenging to close: On WSC and COPA, human performance is perfect. On three other tasks, it is in the mid-to-high 90s. On the diagnostics, all models continue to lag significantly behind humans. Though all models obtain near perfect gender parity scores on Winogender, this is due to the fact that they are obtaining accuracy near that of random guessing.</p>
<h2>6 Conclusion</h2>
<p>We present SuperGLUE, a new benchmark for evaluating general-purpose language understanding systems. SuperGLUE updates the GLUE benchmark by identifying a new set of challenging NLU tasks, as measured by the difference between human and machine baselines. The set of eight tasks in our benchmark emphasizes diverse task formats and low-data training data tasks, with nearly half the tasks having fewer than 1 k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10 k examples.
We evaluate BERT-based baselines and find that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points. Given the difficulty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer, and unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level performance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed for work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.</p>

<h1>A Development Set Results</h1>
<p>In Table 4, we present results of the baselines on the SuperGLUE tasks development sets.</p>
<h2>B Performance on GLUE Diagnostics</h2>
<p>Figure 2 shows the performance on the GLUE diagnostics dataset for systems submitted to the public leaderboard.
<img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Performance of GLUE submissions on selected diagnostic categories, reported using the $R_{3}$ metric scaled up by 100, as in Wang et al. (2019a, see paper for a description of the categories). Some initially difficult categories, like double negation, saw gains from advances on GLUE, but others remain hard (restrictivity) or even adversarial (disjunction, downward monotone).</p>
<h2>C Human Performance Estimation</h2>
<p>For collecting data to establish human performance on the SuperGLUE tasks, we follow a two step procedure where we first provide some training to the crowd workers before they proceed to annotation. For both steps and all tasks, the average pay rate is $\$ 23.75 / \mathrm{hr} .^{7}$
In the training phase, workers are provided with instructions on the task, linked to an FAQ page, and are asked to annotate up to 30 examples from the development set. After answering each example, workers are also asked to check their work against the provided ground truth label. After the training phase is complete, we provide the qualification to work on the annotation phase to all workers who annotated a minimum of five examples, i.e. completed five HITs during training and achieved performance at, or above the median performance across all workers during training.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref5:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In the annotation phase, workers are provided with the same instructions as the training phase, and are linked to the same FAQ page. The instructions for all tasks are provided in Appendix C. For the annotation phase we randomly sample 100 examples from the task's test set, with the exception of WSC where we annotate the full test set. For each example, we collect annotations from five workers and take a majority vote to estimate human performance. For additional details, see Appendix C.3.</p>
<h1>C. 1 Training Phase Instructions</h1>
<p>In the training step, we provide workers with brief instructions about the training phase. An example of these instructions is given Table 5. These training instructions are the same across tasks, only the task name in the instructions is changed.</p>
<h2>C. 2 Task Instructions</h2>
<p>During training and annotation for each task, we provide workers with brief instructions tailored to the task. We also link workers to an FAQ page for the task. Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9, show the instructions we used for all four tasks: COPA, CommitmentBank, WSC, and BoolQ respectively. The instructions given to crowd workers for annotations on the diagnostic and bias diagnostic datasets are shown in Table 11.</p>
<p>We collected data to produce conservative estimates for human performance on several tasks that we did not ultimately include in our benchmark, including GAP (Webster et al., 2018), PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019), Quora Insincere Questions, ${ }^{8}$ Ultrafine Entity Typing (Choi et al., 2018b), and Empathetic Reactions datasets (Buechel et al., 2018). The instructions we used for these tasks are shown in Tables 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.</p>
<h2>C. 3 Task Specific Details</h2>
<p>For WSC and COPA we provide annotators with a two way classification problem. We then use majority vote across annotations to calculate human performance.</p>
<p>CommitmentBank We follow the authors in providing annotators with a 7-way classification problem. We then collapse the annotations into 3 classes by using the same ranges for bucketing used by de Marneffe et al. (2019). We then use majority vote to get human performance numbers on the task.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for training on CommitmentBank we randomly sample examples from the low interannotator agreement portion of the CommitmentBank data that is not included in the benchmark version of the task. These low agreement examples are generally harder to classify since they are more ambiguous.</p>
<p>Diagnostic Dataset Since the diagnostic dataset does not come with accompanying training data, we train our workers on examples from RTE's development set. RTE is also a textual entailment task and is the most closely related task in the main benchmark. Providing the crowd workers with training on RTE enables them to learn label definitions which should generalize to the diagnostic dataset.</p>
<p>Ultrafine Entity Typing We cast the task into a binary classification problem to make it an easier task for non-expert crowd workers. We work in cooperation with the authors of the dataset (Choi et al., 2018b) to do this reformulation: We give workers one possible tag for a word or phrase and asked them to classify the tag as being applicable or not.
The authors used WordNet (Miller, 1995) to expand the set of labels to include synonyms and hypernyms from WordNet. They then asked five annotators to validate these tags. The tags from this validation had high agreement, and were included in the publicly available Ultrafine Entity Typing dataset, ${ }^{9}$ This constitutes our set of positive examples. The rest of the tags from the validation procedure that are not in the public dataset constitute our negative examples.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref6:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>GAP For the Gendered Ambiguous Pronoun Coreference task (GAP, Webster et al., 2018), we simplified the task by providing noun phrase spans as part of the input, thus reducing the original structure prediction task to a classification task. This task was presented to crowd workers as a three way classification problem: Choose span A, B, or neither.</p>
<h1>D Excluded Tasks</h1>
<p>In this section we provide some examples of tasks that we evaluated for inclusion but ultimately could not include. We report on these excluded tasks only with the permission of their authors. We turned down many medical text datasets because they are usually only accessible with explicit permission and credentials from the data owners.
Tasks like QuAC (Choi et al., 2018a) and STREUSLE (Schneider and Smith, 2015) differed substantially from the format of other tasks in our benchmark, which we worried would incentivize users to spend significant effort on task-specific model designs, rather than focusing on general-purpose techniques. It was challenging to train annotators to do well on Quora Insincere Questions ${ }^{10}$, Empathetic Reactions (Buechel et al., 2018), and a recast version of Ultra-Fine Entity Typing (Choi et al., 2018b, see Appendix C. 3 for details), leading to low human performance. BERT achieved very high or superhuman performance on Query Well-Formedness (Faruqui and Das, 2018), PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019), Discovering Ongoing Conversations (Zanzotto and Ferrone, 2017), and GAP (Webster et al., 2018).
During the process of selecting tasks for our benchmark, we collected human performance baselines and run BERT-based machine baselines for some tasks that we ultimately excluded from our task list. We chose to exclude these tasks because our BERT baseline performs better than our human performance baseline or if the gap between human and machine performance is small.
On Quora Insincere Questions our BERT baseline outperforms our human baseline by a small margin: an F1 score of 67.2 versus 66.7 for BERT and human baselines respectively. Similarly, on the Empathetic Reactions dataset, BERT outperforms our human baseline, where BERT's predictions have a Pearson correlation of 0.45 on empathy and 0.55 on distress, compared to 0.45 and 0.35 for our human baseline. For PAWS-Wiki, we report that BERT achieves an accuracy of $91.9 \%$, while our human baseline achieved $84 \%$ accuracy. These three tasks are excluded from the benchmark since our, admittedly conservative, human baselines are worse than machine performance. Our human performance baselines are subject to the clarity of our instructions (all instructions can be found in Appendix C), and crowd workers engagement and ability.
For the Query Well-Formedness task, the authors set an estimate human performance at $88.4 \%$ accuracy. Our BERT baseline model reaches an accuracy of $82.3 \%$. While there is a positive gap on this task, the gap was smaller than we were were willing to tolerate. Similarly, on our recast version of the Ultrafine Entity Typing, we observe too small a gap between human ( 60.2 F 1 ) and machine performance ( 55.0 F 1 ). Our recasting for this task is described in Appendix C.2. On GAP, when taken as a classification problem without the related task of span selection (details in C.2), BERT performs ( 91.0 F 1 ) comparably to our human baseline ( 94.9 F 1 ). Given this small margin, we also exclude GAP.
On Discovering Ongoing Conversations, our BERT baseline achieves an F1 of 51.9 on a version of the task cast as sentence pair classification (given two snippets of texts from plays, determine if the second snippet is a continuation of the first). This dataset is very class imbalanced ( $90 \%$ negative), so we also experimented with a class-balanced version on which our BERT baselines achieves 88.4 F1. Qualitatively, we also found the task challenging for humans as there was little context for the text snippets and the examples were drawn from plays using early English. Given this fairly high machine performance and challenging nature for humans, we exclude this task from our benchmark.</p>

<p>We will present you with a prompt sentence and a question. The question will either be about what caused the situation described in the prompt, or what a possible effect of that situation is. We will also give you two possible answers to this question. Your job is to decide, given the situation described in the prompt, which of the two options is a more plausible answer to the question:</p>
<p>In the following example, option $\underline{1}$, is a more plausible answer to the question about what caused the situation described in the prompt,</p>
<p>The girl received a trophy.
What's the CAUSE for this?</p>
<ol>
<li>She won a spelling bee.</li>
<li>She made a new friend.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following example, option $\underline{2}$, is a more plausible answer the question about what happened because of the situation described in the prompt,</p>
<p>The police aimed their weapons at the fugitive.
What happened as a RESULT?</p>
<ol>
<li>The fugitive fell to the ground.</li>
<li>The fugitive dropped his gun.</li>

<h1>Speaker Commitment Instructions</h1>
<p>The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>We will present you with a prompt taken from a piece of dialogue, this could be a single sentence, a few sentences, or a short exchange between people. Your job is to figure out, based on this first prompt (on top), how certain the speaker is about the truthfulness of the second prompt (on the bottom). You can choose from a 7 point scale ranging from (1) completely certain that the second prompt is true to (7) completely certain that the second prompt is false. Here are examples for a few of the labels:</p>
<p>Choose 1 (certain that it is true) if the speaker from the first prompt definitely believes or knows that the second prompt is true. For example,
"What fun to hear Artemis laugh. She's such a serious child. I didn't know she had a sense of humor."
"Artemis had a sense of humor"
Choose 4 (not certain if it is true or false) if the speaker from the first prompt is uncertain if the second prompt is true or false. For example,
"Tess is committed to track. She's always trained with all her heart and soul. One can only hope that she has recovered from the flu and will cross the finish line."
"Tess crossed the finish line."
Choose 7 (certain that it is false) if the speaker from the first prompt definitely believes or knows that the second prompt is false. For example,
"Did you hear about Olivia's chemistry test? She studied really hard. But even after putting in all that time and energy, she didn't manage to pass the test".
"Olivia passed the test."

<p>The New York University Center for Data Science is collecting your answers for use in research on computer understanding of English. Thank you for your help!</p>
<p>We will present you with a sentence that someone wrote, with one bolded pronoun. We will then ask if you if the pronoun refers to a specific word or phrase in the sentence. Your job is to figure out, based on the sentence, if the bolded pronoun refers to this selected word or phrase:</p>
<p>Choose Yes if the pronoun refers to the selected word or phrase. For example,
"I put the cake away in the refrigerator. It has a lot of butter in it."
Does It in "It has a lot" refer to cake?
Choose $\underline{\text { No }}$ if the pronoun does not refer to the selected word or phrase. For example,
"The large ball crashed right through the table because it was made of styrofoam."
Does it in "it was made" refer to ball?
