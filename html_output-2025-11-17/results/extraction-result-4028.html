                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> The potential clinical usefulness of single or multimodal imaging markers is being investigated in selected patient samples from clinical expert centres, but additional research is needed before these promising imaging markers can be successfully translated from research into clinical practice in routine care.</p>

<p><strong>The concept of MCI and its subcategories in the times of biomarker criteria for prodromal AD</strong></p>
<p>Even though more recent diagnostic criteria have abolished the explicit reference to the clinically defined syndrome of MCI^{1} or have further qualified it with the use of biomarkers^{2}, in our view the use of the term MCI remains relevant for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, the Dubois criteria^{1} rely on the demonstration of episodic memory impairment. This concept clearly resembles the concept of amnestic MCI, as defined earlier.^{3}^{, }^{4} Thus, the concept of MCI has not fully been abolished even with the Dubois criteria.</p>
<p>Secondly, the concept of prodromal AD as outlined in the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer's disease,^{2} requires the presence of clinically or neuropsychologically detectable cognitive decline consistent with a clinical syndrome of MCI.</p>
<p>Thirdly, screening for pre-dementia stages of disease is controversial, particularly in the absence of clinical symptoms.^{5} Therefore, in clinical care, only the presence of clinical symptoms, reported by the patient or his/her care-giver and confirmed by clinical and neuropsychological examination, should trigger further diagnostic procedures, including neuroimaging and biomarker examinations. Currently, the concept of MCI is most widely used to characterize a clinically relevant threshold of cognitive decline. More recent concepts, such as the concept of mild neurocognitive disorder as outlined in DSM V, are closely linked to the concept of MCI as well.^{6}</p>
<p>The concept of MCI, as originally defined,^{7} has further been differentiated into single domain and multiple domain amnestic and nonamnestic MCI.^{3}^{, }^{4} People with amnestic MCI and non-amnestic MCI differ in their risk of conversion to AD dementia.^{8}^{, }^{9} The majority of studies analyzing prediction accuracy of imaging markers for the conversion from MCI to AD dementia include amnestic MCI cases or MCI cases without further classification. In cross-sectional studies, representing about 400 MCI cases, AD type patterns of imaging findings were more prevalent in the amnestic than the nonamnestic subtype of MCI, including atrophy, amyloid uptake, and cerebral perfusion and metabolism.^{10-15} Interestingly, amyloid-positive nonamnestic and amnestic MCI cases had similar regional distribution of cortical amyloid uptake in a study on 26 MCI patients.^{16} This is consistent with the notion of a relatively poor correlation of amyloid load with cognitive performance,^{17-19} as recently confirmed in a longitudinal study with autopsy endpoint where amyloid load accounted only for 6% of variation in rates of antemortem cognitive decline (compared to 22% for tangle load).^{20} Longitudinal data on prediction accuracy of imaging markers for the conversion from nonamnestic MCI to AD dementia or other dementias are still scarce. In 45 amnestic MCI and 46 nonamnestic MCI cases, medial temporal lobe atrophy was a significant predictor for the transition into dementia irrespective of MCI subtype.^{21} In a study on 27 MCI cases, molecular imaging at baseline was more accurate than classification in MCI subtypes (amnestic, multiple domain, nonamnestic) for predicting the conversion into dementia and for predicting the type of dementia.^{22}</p>
<p>Thus, currently available evidence suggests that abnormal imaging patterns suggestive of AD are more prevalent in amnestic MCI than in nonamnestic MCI. However, once a global increase of amyloid is present, the pattern of amyloid accumulation may not be different between amnestic MCI and nonamnestic MCI. In the longitudinal course, imaging biomarkers may be superior compared to the discrimination between amnestic and nonamnestic MCI in predicting conversion to dementia, but this notion is based on very limited evidence today. The added value of a clinical subclassification of MCI in addition to imaging markers, and vice versa, with respect to the outcomes of conversion into dementia and conversion into a certain type of dementia has yet to be studied.</p>
