                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability to discover high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a near-sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking. We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components - research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses - from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy. To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations. This positions LLMs as"research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</p>

The pipeline is implemented by orchestrating off-the-shelf LLM APIs with prompt templates (provided in appendices) and external metadata retrieval (Semantic Scholar, Crossref).</td>

            "method_description": "An agentic pipeline built around LLM modules that (1) ingest full paper text and iteratively extract a research question, a background survey (from Introduction/Related Work), candidate inspirations (titles of referenced papers), and the abstract of those inspirations via external APIs (Semantic Scholar, Crossref); (2) apply an 'inspiration decomposition' module to propose candidate inspiration papers (title + abstract), a 'necessary checker' to test necessity of each inspiration, and a 'sufficient checker' to assess whether the set of inspirations combined with background covers the hypothesis scope; (3) perform inspiration retrieval by presenting randomized candidate pools (75 candidates split into groups) and iteratively selecting top-k candidates across rounds until a small set remains; (4) compose hypotheses using an evolutionary unit (mutate/refine/recombine prompts) that mixes background and inspirations following the decompositional formulation h = f(b, i1, ... , ik) and iterative self-refine prompting; (5) perform pairwise hypothesis ranking using LLM prompts and pairwise comparisons (with position-bias mitigation by reversing order); prompts, iterative self-refine, and evolutionary mutation/refine/recombine routines are central to the pipeline. The pipeline is implemented by orchestrating off-the-shelf LLM APIs with prompt templates (provided in appendices) and external metadata retrieval (Semantic Scholar, Crossref).",

            "type_of_quantitative_law": "Not primarily focused on extracting explicit quantitative laws; objective is discovery of research hypotheses and latent knowledge associations (novel associations between concepts). The pipeline surfaces candidate inspirations and textual hypotheses rather than symbolic quantitative laws. (No explicit extraction of scaling laws or equations reported.)",
            "extraction_output_format": "Structured textual components: (research question, background survey), inspiration items represented as (title + abstract + paper metadata), and generated hypotheses as textual hypothesis descriptions (scored on a normalized 0–5 Likert → normalized score). No symbolic equation extraction format reported.",
            "validation_method": "Mixed validation: automated evaluation metrics (Hit Ratio for inspiration retrieval, normalized Likert matched-score for hypothesis composition, pairwise accuracy for ranking) plus human expert validation: five domain experts examined a random sample of 62 papers to assess decomposition accuracy (necessity/sufficiency of inspirations and hypothesis fidelity).",
            "performance_metrics": "Inspiration retrieval: when selecting top 20% of candidates, many LLMs achieved ~80% inclusion of ground-truth inspirations (example: GPT-4o ~83% when top-20% retained). When reducing to top 4% (3 of 75), GPT-4o hit ratio was ~45.65% (reported ~45.7%). Hypothesis composition: normalized matched-score reported per model (example overall normalized scores: GPT-4o ~53.37, Qwen Plus ~57.46, Gemini 2.0 Flash ~50.15 — values taken from published tables as normalized percentages). Hypothesis ranking: many models had ranking accuracies near chance (~50%) with large position-bias issues for some models; detailed per-model ranking numbers are provided in the paper's tables. Decomposition accuracy by expert check: 91.9% (counting only major issues) and 82.3% (including minor issues) over 62 randomly sampled papers.",
            "baseline_comparison": "The paper compares many LLMs against each other (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 variants, Claude 3.5 variants, Llama variants) and uses constructed negative-inspiration baselines (three distance levels: citation-adjacent/semantic-adjacent, same-discipline random, different-discipline random) to make retrieval non-trivial. No classical non-LLM information-extraction baseline (e.g., rule-based IE extracting equations) is reported for the full pipeline; performance comparisons are across LLMs and negative-inspiration sampling strategies.",
            "challenges_limitations": "Key limitations reported: (1) the system focuses on textual hypothesis generation, not explicit symbolic/quantitative-law extraction; (2) inspiration retrieval is identified as a bottleneck with performance plateauing around ~70B parameter scale; (3) position bias in pairwise ranking (some models strongly prefer first item); (4) decomposition is not perfect (some extraction errors); (5) reliance on pretraining data for latent associations and potential subtle data contamination despite restricting to 2024 papers; (6) the pipeline requires careful negative-sample construction to produce meaningful retrieval difficulty; (7) limited expert validation across disciplines (five experts across some fields).",

<p>ResearchBench: Benchmarking LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Inspiration-Based Task Decomposition
1 Jul 20254E78EA743CF79F4FD60A5333439910A4arXiv:2503.21248v2[cs.CL]Paper Number 152 113 114 116 132 117 116 115 115 97 113 86 1386
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in assisting scientific research, yet their ability in discovering high-quality research hypotheses remains unexamined due to the lack of a dedicated benchmark.To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs with a sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery, which are inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking.We develop an automated framework that extracts critical components-research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses-from scientific papers across 12 disciplines, with expert validation confirming its accuracy.To prevent data contamination, we focus exclusively on papers published in 2024, ensuring minimal overlap with LLM pretraining data.Our evaluation reveals that LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations, an out-of-distribution task, suggesting their ability to surface novel knowledge associations.This positions LLMs as "research hypothesis mines", capable of facilitating automated scientific discovery by generating innovative hypotheses at scale with minimal human intervention.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential to assist scientist's research as a copilot (Luo et al., 2025).One of the most challenging copilot tasks is to help scientists discover new valid research hypotheses, where a typical setting is to only provide a research question and a small background survey as input.Understanding how LLMs perform on this task is crucial for selecting the appropriate models and evaluating how different training strategies influence their effectiveness in scientific discovery.</p>
<p>However, although there are efforts benchmarking LLM's performance to the general task, such as Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) and MixEval (Ni et al., 2024), it still lacks understanding of the scientific discovery ability of each LLM.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for this vacancy is the lack of understanding of the scientific discovery process, i.e., how each research hypothesis is formulated.Recently, Yang et al. (2024c) decomposed this research hypothesis formulation process into a sufficient set of sub-tasks, which are (1) retrieving inspirations based on the research question, (2) properly mixing the research background information with the retrieved inspirations to compose research hypotheses, and (3) ranking the composed hypotheses to provide one with the highest confidence.This decomposition is viable because of a fundamental assumption that a majority of hypotheses can originate from a research background and several inspirations.This fundamental assumption is supported by cognitive science findings that creative ideas often result from the cohesive association of two (or more) seemingly unrelated pieces of knowledge (Koestler, 1964;Benedek et al., 2012;Lee &amp; Chung, 2024).The cognitive science findings are disciplineindependent and widely applicable.For example, the proposal of backpropagation is a research hypothesis.In this case, the research background is about multi-layer logistic regression, and the inspiration is the chain rule in calculus.</p>
<p>This research aims at filling the research gap, by providing a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM's performance in terms of the three decomposed tasks of scientific discovery.This benchmark covers 12 disciplines, selecting papers published on top venues such as Nature, Science, or journals of a similar level.The statistics of the benchmark is shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>To construct the benchmark, we download 1386 papers and develop an automated LLM-based agentic framework to analyze each paper into research question, background survey, inspirations, and main hypothesis.We invited five experts in Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, and Material Science disciplines to check whether the decomposition is accurate.Among the randomly sampled 62 papers checked by the experts, the decomposition accuracy was 91.9% considering only major issues and 82.3% when including both major and minor issues.It shows that the automated framework can accurately extract these components from a paper.</p>
<p>To prevent the data contamination problem, we only select those papers published in 2024.The advantage of our LLM agentic framework for the extraction is that as the LLM's pretraining data cutoff date moves forward, the framework can automatically extract more recent papers to avoid overlapping.</p>
<p>Based on the benchmark, we systematically compare popular LLMs across the three decomposed tasks.We find that current LLMs perform well in retrieving inspirations across disciplines, despite the inclusion of carefully crafted challenging negative inspiration examples.For example, when we ask GPT-4o to select the top 4% of inspiration candidates, the probability that a ground truth inspiration will be included in the top 4% is 45.7%.It is surprising because the inspiration retrieval task is actually an out-of-distribution (OOD) task since inspiration is supposed to be not known to be related to the research question but in fact can assist it.Otherwise, the resulting hypothesis won't be novel.In addition, we find that LLMs also have a good performance on the hypothesis composition and hypothesis ranking task.This suggests that LLMs could be leveraged as research hypothesis mines, where higher-performing LLMs on the three fundamental tasks of scientific discovery act as richer mines, and more inference compute corresponds to more miners.</p>
<p>Overall, the contributions of this paper are:</p>
<p>• We introduce the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in scientific discovery with a sufficient set of sub-tasks: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking.</p>
<p>• We develop an automated agentic framework to extract essential components-research questions, background surveys, inspirations, and hypotheses-from scientific papers, enabling the scalable and contamination-resistant construction of benchmarks.</p>
<p>• We conduct a comprehensive analysis of LLM performance using our benchmark, presenting the first large-scale study on out-of-distribution (OOD) inspiration retrieval.Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can effectively retrieve inspirations beyond established associations, positioning LLMs as "research hypothesis mines" capable of generating novel scientific insights at scale with minimal human involvement.</p>
<p>2 Related Work</p>
<p>LLMs for Scientific Discovery</p>
<p>CoLM (Yang et al., 2024a) investigates generative inductive reasoning, which is to propose (commonsense) hypothesis from observations.SciMON (Wang et al., 2024) introduces literature-based discovery, showing how retrieved concepts aid hypothesis composition.MOOSE (Yang et al., 2024b) and MOOSE-Chem (Yang et al., 2024c) find that most hypotheses in social science and chemistry can be seen as emerging from a research background and several inspirations.In addition, many researchers have the belief that "An idea is nothing more nor less than a new combination of old elements" (Young, 1975;Kumar et al., 2024).Yang et al. (2024c) further decompose the hypothesis formulation process into a sufficient set of sub-tasks: inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking.</p>
<p>Benchmarking LLMs</p>
<p>Most existing benchmarks assess the general intelligence of LLMs (Chiang et al., 2024;Ni et al., 2024).IdeaBench (Guo et al., 2024) is designed for biomedical idea generation and does not evaluate LLMs based on the full set of sub-tasks in scientific discovery.Their focus is limited to generating hypotheses from background knowledge rather than retrieving and integrating inspirations.Additionally, their reference extraction relies on rule-based methods, which are less accurate than the LLM-based agentic framework.Moreover, their benchmark is restricted to the biomedical domain, whereas ours spans 12 disciplines.DiscoveryBench (Majumder et al., 2024) and ScienceAgentBench (Chen et al., 2024) identify and pick specific discovery-relevant tasks (e.g., write a specific code) from 20 papers and 44 papers correspondingly.They do not analyze the fundamental decomposition of the scientific discovery task itself.</p>
<p>3 Benchmark Construction They propose this assumption based on extensive discussions with domain experts, and the cognitive science findings that creative ideas often result from the cohesive association of two (or more) seemingly unrelated pieces of knowledge (Koestler, 1964;Benedek et al., 2012;Lee &amp; Chung, 2024).Denoting background knowledge as b, inspiration knowledge as i, and hypothesis as h, this assumption can be represented in Equation 1:
h = f (b, i 1 , . . . , i k )(1)
Based on this assumption, they decompose the research hypothesis formulation process into a sufficient set of sub-tasks, which are (1) retrieving inspirations based on the research background, (2) properly mixing the research background information with the retrieved inspirations to compose research hypotheses, and (3) ranking the composed hypotheses to provide one with the highest confidence.This process can be represented in Equation 2 and Equation 3.Here I represents the full literature corpus to retrieve inspiration.
P (h | b) ≈ k j=1 P (i j | b, h j−1 , I) • P (h j | b, i j , h j−1 )(2)H = {h 1 , h 2 , . . . , hn | R(h i ) &gt; R(h i+1 ) for all i}(3)
The cognitive science findings are not limited to any single discipline.For example, Yang et al. (2024b) shows that this assumption can also be leveraged in social science disciplines to generate  high-quality research hypothesis.After extensive discussions with researchers in other disciplines such as Physics, Biology, Earth Science, Astronomy, and Math, we find that this assumption is largely and widely true across disciplines.</p>
<p>Based on this observation, we construct this benchmark collecting papers across 12 disciplines in top-ranked venues, develop an agentic framework to automatically extract each paper's research background, inspirations, and hypothesis ( § 3.2), discuss how negative inspiration papers are selected to evaluate LLMs' performance on inspiration retrieval ( § 3.3), and present expert evaluation on the extracted information to illustrate the quality of the benchmark ( § 3.4).</p>
<p>Different from directly assigning a score to each hypothesis and ranking the hypotheses based on their scores (Equation 3), this benchmark adopts a pairwise evaluation for ranking (Equation 4), since pairwise evaluation is widely reported as more robust and reliable (Si et al., 2024).R(h i , h i+1 ) = h i represents h i is selected as a better hypothesis.
H = {h 1 , h 2 , . . . , hn | R(h i , h i+1 ) = h i for all i} (4)</p>
<p>LLM-Based Agentic Framework</p>
<p>We develop a LLM-based agentic framework to automatedly extract the research question, background survey, inspirations, and hypothesis.</p>
<p>The extraction of research question, background survey, and hypothesis is relatively straightforward for LLMs.Specifically, we carefully design prompts and adopt iterative self-refine (Madaan et al., 2023) to extract them.The background survey is summarized based on the information in the introduction section and the related work section.</p>
<p>The extraction of inspirations is not so straightforward compared to the other components.Figure 1 shows the inspiration extraction framework.We have simplified its design as much as possible, retaining only the essential components to ensure efficiency and accuracy.</p>
<p>The inspirations are mostly described in the introduction section, usually starting with "Motivated by", and can be also described in the related work and methodology sections.As shown in Figure 1, given the full passage of a research paper, the "inspiration decomposition" module first iteratively extracts several potential inspirations.Here each potential inspiration is represented by the title and abstract of a referenced research paper.Therefore after the "inspiration decomposition" module suggests the title of a referred paper as inspiration, we use Semantic Scholar and Crossref to find the abstract of the referred paper to compose an inspiration.Then the "necessary checker" module examines whether each extracted inspiration is needed to formulate the hypothesis and not redundant, and the "sufficient checker" is to check whether all necessary inspirations have been extracted to be enough to be possible to formulate the hypothesis.Here by "enough", we mean the information in the research question, background survey, and the inspirations can cover the information scope of the hypothesis.</p>
<p>To prevent data contamination, we apply the agentic framework only to papers published in 2024 or later, thereby minimizing overlap with the pretraining data of LLMs.The cutoff dates for each model's pretraining data are summarized in Table 8.</p>
<p>Negative Inspiration Selection</p>
<p>Although ground-truth inspirations can be extracted, we need negative inspirations to calculate the performance of LLMs on inspiration retrieval.Here our goal is to provide an in-depth analysis on the inspiration retrieval ability by carefully composing a negative inspiration paper set for each paper in the benchmark.</p>
<p>Specifically, for each paper in the benchmark, we collect three levels of negative inspiration papers, based on their distance to the benchmark paper.The first-level is papers that are cited and referred to by the benchmark paper, or papers that have high semantic similar titles to the benchmark paper.</p>
<p>For each benchmark paper, we collect 100 citation-adjacent papers with Crossref API, and 50 semantic adjacent papers with Semantic Scholar API.The second-level are papers that are in the same discipline with the benchmark paper, and the third-level are papers that belong to completely different disciplines (randomly selected).We randomly collect 2000 papers for each discipline by Web of Science, which can be used for both the second-level and the third-level.During experiment, for each benchmark paper, we randomly select 25 negative inspiration papers from each of the distance level to compose the negative inspiration set.</p>
<p>The purpose of the three-level design is two-fold.Firstly, real inspiration can come from each of the levels.By the splitting, LLM's preference in terms of distance can be analyzed.Secondly, the incorporation of closely related papers makes the negative inspiration papers non-trivial: we find that LLMs tend to select papers that are close to the benchmark paper.If the negative papers are only from irrelevant disciplines, then the retrieval success rate will be very high and less meaningful.</p>
<p>Expert Evaluation</p>
<p>We invited five PhD students from diverse disciplines-Physics (1), Chemistry (2), Materials Science (1), and Astronomy (1)-to evaluate the accuracy of our decomposition framework.Specifically, we randomly sampled 62 papers from the benchmark dataset, each accompanied by its extracted research question, background survey, inspirations, and hypothesis, and presented them in the form of a questionnaire.An example of the questionnaire is provided in Appendix A.2.</p>
<p>For each paper, the experts first read the full text of the original research paper and then assessed the accuracy of the extracted components.Each inspiration was evaluated for its necessity, while the entire set of inspirations was assessed for its sufficiency in supporting the research hypothesis.</p>
<p>Overall, the evaluation identified five cases with issues in inspiration identification (three) or hypothesis extraction (two), and six minor issues in research question extraction.The decomposition accuracy was 91.9% considering only major issues and 82.3% when including all issues.</p>
<p>4 Experiments</p>
<p>Inspiration Retrieval</p>
<p>For each benchmark paper, with the extracted research question, groundtruth inspirations, and the negative inspirations, we can calculate the accuracy of an LLM to retrieve the groundtruth inspiration with the research question.</p>
<p>During the experiment, for each benchmark paper, we prepare an inspiration candidate set consisting of 75 papers, including 2-3 groundtruth inspiration papers and about 25 negative inspiration papers from each distance level.Each paper is represented by its title and abstract.The retrieval is performed in several rounds, where in each round, the inspiration candidate set is randomly split into several groups, where each group contains 15 papers.Then LLM is instructed to select the top 3 of each group that it thinks can best serve as inspirations for the background question.In a new round, the selected papers are combined into a new inspiration candidate set and split into groups again.</p>
<p>Following this iterative selection process, only 20% (15 out of 75) of the papers are retained after the first round, and only 4% (3 out of 75) remain after the second round.Thus, the LLM is tasked with selecting 3 papers from an initial pool of 75.We use Hit Ratio as the evaluation metric, it is calculated as the number of groundtruth inspiration papers selected by the LLM divided by the total number of inspiration candidates.</p>
<p>(a) The accuracy (%) of LLMs in retrieving the groundtruth inspiration while only 20% of inspiration candidates are selected.Furthermore, we analyze the Hit Ratio of negative inspirations across the three distance levels.The results are presented in Table 3.It indicates that regardless of the percentage of the papers selected, the closer an inspiration is to the benchmark paper, the higher the probability it is selected as an inspiration.We attribute it to two reasons.Firstly, statistically closer papers objectively have a better chance of being an inspiration; Secondly, if certain papers often appear together in the training data, the LLM may see them as more possibly contributing to each other.</p>
<p>Hypothesis Composition</p>
<p>With the retrieved inspirations, the next step is to associate them with the research background to compose research hypothesis.Figure 2 shows the framework we use for the hypothesis generation process.This framework strictly follows Equation 2, and is designed to be as simple as possible, avoiding unnecessary components.We use the evolutionary unit (Yang et al., 2024c) to associate the research background (b) and inspiration (i), shown in the bottom-left rectangle in Figure 2. Specifically, "mutate" means creating different ways to combine b and i together and "recombine" tries to keep the merits of different combination ways to compose a final hypothesis.The prompts for mutate, refine, and recombine are provided in Appendix A.5.In this step, we only measure the LLM's ability on hypothesis composing.For the LLM-generated hypotheses to be comparable with the groundtruth hypothesis for evaluation, here I represents the groundtruth inspiration papers (usually 2 to 3 papers), while "inspiration retriever" module each time retrieve only one inspiration, and will not retrieve the same inspiration again.</p>
<p>The detailed scoring criteria is shown in Appendix A.3, where we use a 6-point Likert scale (from 0 to 5) to measure whether the generated hypothesis has covered the key points in the groundtruth  hypothesis.To compute the generation accuracy, we normalize the average score by dividing it by the maximum possible score (5).The final results are summarized in Table 4. Table 4 shows that (a) all LLMs preserve a certain kind of ability to associate the research background and inspirations to compose hypothesis; (b) the hypothesis composition task remains challenging, as none of the models achieve consistently high performance.</p>
<p>Hypothesis Ranking</p>
<p>In this section, we evaluate the ability of LLMs to rank hypotheses pairwisely.Specifically, based on the hypothesis generation method in § 4.2, we use the top-ranked negative inspirations and background question to construct a set of negative hypotheses.From this set, we randomly sample 5 negative hypotheses.Additionally, with subsets of groundtruth inspirations and the research question, we use the hypothesis composition framework to generate another set of negative hypotheses.In this set, we randomly sample 10 as negative hypotheses for ranking.As a result, for each benchmark paper, we compose a set of 16 hypotheses, including one groundtruth one and 15 negative ones for ranking.To evaluate ranking performance, we use the groundtruth hypothesis to pairwisely compare with each of the 15 negative ones.The prompt for pairwise ranking is provided in the Appendix A.4.</p>
<p>Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric, which is calculated as the proportion of correct pairwise rankings out of 15 comparisons.During the pairwise evaluation, we find that many LLMs have strong position bias: they largely prefer the first hypothesis than the second.To avoid this bias, for each hypothesis pair, we compare them twice with reverse positions, and the results are averaged.Table 6: Analysis of position bias in hypothesis ranking task.Each hypothesis pair is compared twice, with three possible outcomes: both wrongly ranked (✗ ✗); one right one wrong (✓ ✗); both rightly ranked (✓ ✓).Numbers are averaged percentages (%).
Model ✗ ✗ ✓ ✗ ✓ ✓ GPT-
Table 5 presents the ranking accuracy of each LLM.This ranking results indicate a different scaling law with the scaling law we find in the inspiration retrieval task: more parameters and better pretraining strategies can significantly improve over the hypothesis ranking task, while might lead to less improvements in the inspiration retrieval task.</p>
<p>Table 6 analyzes the position bias problem in the hypothesis ranking task.Specifically, each hypothesis pair is compared twice, with three possible outcomes, and the table shows the averaged percentage of each outcome.It shows that many LLMs are hugely influenced by position bias (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B has 91.67% of the time reaching self-contradictory results), and some are less influenced (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet only 19.17%).The large proportion of self-contradictory results might be one of the main reasons that many LLMs in Table 5 reach a ranking accuracy around 50%.</p>
<p>Analysis</p>
<p>LLMs as Research Hypothesis Mines</p>
<p>The results show that (1) LLMs can already capture many unknown association of knowledge so to retrieve inspirations relatively accurately; (2) Given groundtruth inspirations, many LLMs can compose a hypothesis that capture at least a subset of main innovations in the groundtruth one; (3) with improved scale and better training strategies, LLMs' performance on hypothesis ranking can grow very quickly, and we have not seen the limit.</p>
<p>Also considering that the three tasks of inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composing, and hypothesis ranking are a sufficient set of sub-tasks of scientific discovery, it might indicate that given only a research background, LLMs can already discover hypothesis autonomously: it can screen lots of inspiration candidates to choose the good ones autonomously, associating the research background with the good inspirations autonomously, and autonomously rank those composed hypotheses to provide the scientists with the best ones.</p>
<p>In short, the only input scientists need to provide such a copilot is the research background and enough papers to serve as inspiration.In this view, LLMs can be regarded as research hypothesis mines: models with stronger performance on the three fundamental tasks of scientific discovery represent richer mines, while more inference compute corresponds to deploying more miners.</p>
<p>The Bottleneck Towards Automated Discovery</p>
<p>Across the three sub-tasks, the inspiration retrieval task appears to be the most challenging.Although performance improves rapidly even with relatively small models (e.g., 8B parameters), it quickly plateaus.Scaling up model size or enhancing pretraining strategies yields only marginal gains in retrieval performance.</p>
<p>We attribute this to the nature of the task: inspiration retrieval fundamentally requires deep domain understanding, which is primarily acquired during the pretraining phase as the model ingests millions of papers.In other words, success in this task may rely more on the "intuition" developed through large-scale pretraining rather than the enhanced reasoning abilities typically refined during posttraining.Understanding the fundamental mechanisms behind how LLMs retrieve inspirations may help address a key bottleneck in advancing toward fully automated scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We introduced the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLMs in scientific discovery in terms of a sufficient set of sub-tasks, covering inspiration retrieval, hypothesis composition, and hypothesis ranking.Our benchmark, ResearchBench, spans 12 scientific disciplines and utilizes an automated, LLM-based agentic framework, significantly contributing to scalable and contamination-resistant dataset construction.</p>
<p>Our evaluation shows that LLMs achieve promising results in inspiration retrieval, effectively surfacing novel, out-of-distribution knowledge associations.They also demonstrate moderate capabilities in hypothesis composition and ranking tasks; however, performance in these two tasks indicates considerable room for improvement.Notably, we identify inspiration retrieval as a key bottleneck, where accuracy quickly plateaus with increasing model scale, underscoring the need for deeper domain-specific understanding primarily acquired during pretraining rather than fine-tuning.</p>
<p>These findings point toward a promising pathway, positioning LLMs as potential "research hypothesis mines".By systematically addressing the bottlenecks identified, LLMs hold great promise for becoming powerful tools capable of autonomously discovering high-quality scientific hypotheses, ultimately facilitating a paradigm shift towards fully automated scientific exploration.</p>
<p>A Appendix</p>
<p>A.1 Prompt for Retrieving Inspirations</p>
<p>You are helping with the scientific hypotheses generation process.Given a research question, the background and some of the existing methods for this research question, and several top-tier publications (including their title and abstract), try to identify which publication can potentially serve as an inspiration for the background research question so that combining the research question and the inspiration in some way, a novel, valid, and significant research hypothesis can be formed.The inspiration does not need to be similar to the research question.In fact, probably only those inspirations that are distinct with the background research question, combined with the background research question, can lead to a impactful research hypothesis.The reason is that if the inspiration and the background research question are semantically similar enough, they are probably the same, and the inspiration might not provide any additional information to the system, which might lead to a result very similar to a situation that no inspiratrions are found.An example is the backpropagation of neural networks.In backpropagation, the research question is how to use data to automatically improve the parameters of a multi-layer logistic regression, the inspiration is the chain rule in mathematics, and the research hypothesis is the backpropagation itself.In their paper, the authors have conducted experiments to verify their hypothesis.Now try to select inspirations based on background research question.The background research question is: ", "The introduction of the previous methods is:", "The potential inspiration candidates are: ", "Now you have seen the background research question, and many potential inspiration candidates.Please try to identify which three literature candidates are the most possible to serve as the inspiration to the background research question?Please name the title of the literature candidate, and also try to give your reasons.</p>

<p>A.3 Prompt for Evaluating Generated Hypothesis</p>
<p>You are helping to evaluate the quality of a proposed research hypothesis by a phd student.The groundtruth hypothesis will also be provided to compare.Here we mainly focus on whether the proposed hypothesis has covered the key points of the ground-truth hypothesis.You will also be given a summary of the key points in the ground-truth hypothesis for reference.The evaluation criteria is called 'Matched score', which is in a 6-point Likert scale (from 5 to 0).Particularly, 5 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers three key points (or covers all the key points) in the ground-truth hypothesis, where every key point is leveraged nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, and ( 2) does not contain any extra key point(s) that is redundant, unnecessary, unhelpful, or harmful; 4 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers three key points (or covers all the key points) in the ground-truth hypothesis, where every key point is leveraged nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, and ( 2) but also contain extra key point(s) that is redundant, unnecessary, unhelpful, or harmful; 3 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers two key points in the ground-truth hypothesis, where every key point is leveraged nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, (2) but does not cover all key points in the ground-truth hypothesis, and (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 2 points mean that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers one key point in the ground-truth hypothesis, and leverage it nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis, (2) but does not cover all key points in the ground-truth hypothesis, and (3) might or might not contain extra key points; 1 point means that the proposed hypothesis (1) covers at least one key point in the ground-truth hypothesis, but all the covered key point(s) are used differently as in the ground-truth hypothesis, and (2) might or might not contain extra key points; 0 point means that the proposed hypothesis does not cover any key point in the ground-truth hypothesis at all.Usually total the number of key points a ground-truth hypothesis contain is less than or equal to three.Please note that the total number of key points in the ground-truth hypothesis might be less than three, so that multiple points can be given.E.g., there's only one key point in the ground-truth hypothesis, and the proposed hypothesis covers the one key point nearly identically, it's possible to give 2 points, 4 points, and 5 points.In this case, we should choose score from 4 points and 5 points, depending on the existence and quality of extra key points.'Leveraging a key point nearly identically as in the ground-truth hypothesis means that in the proposed hypothesis, the same (or very related) concept (key point) is used in a very similar way with a very similar goal compared to the ground-truth hypothesis.When judging whether an extra key point has apparent flaws, you should use your own knowledge and understanding of that discipline to judge, rather than only relying on the count number of pieces of extra key point to judge.Importantly, we should focus on whether the fundamental key points match, rather than being influenced by how complex, sophisticated, or advanced the proposed methods appear.A hypothesis that introduces high-level techniques or intricate methodologies does not necessarily mean it is a disadvantage with the ground-truth hypothesis.The core concern is whether the essential key points are correctly captured and utilized.Please evaluate the proposed hypothesis based on the ground-truth hypothesis.The proposed hypothesis is: ", "The ground-truth hypothesis is: ", "The key points in the ground-truth hypothesis are: "</p>
<p>A.4 Prompt for Pairwise Ranking</p>
<p>You are assisting scientists with their research.Given a research question and two research hypothesis candidates proposed by large language models, your task is to predict which hypothesis is a better research hypothesis.By 'better', we mean the hypothesis is more valid and effective for the research question.Please note the following:</p>
<p>(1) Neither hypothesis has been tested experimentally.However, some large language model generated hypothesis might contain expected performance of the hypothesis.Well, just do not believe any of the descriptions of the expected performance or the effect of the hypothesis.Instead, only focus on the technical contents and predict which hypothesis you think will be more effective for the research question if tested in real experiments.</p>
<p>(2) You should remember that, here, we only focus on whether the general direction or major components of the hypothesis are more effective.Providing additional details or making the content more comprehensive is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage.More detailed and multifaceted strategies, additional complexity, and potential challenges are neither advantages nor disadvantages.What truly matters is the fundamental, intrinsic core idea.The research question is: &lt;the background coverage and validation to more domains would further strengthen its generality.Lastly, although we use 2024 publications to reduce pretraining overlap, we cannot fully guarantee the absence of indirect data leakage via related works.We leave these challenges to future work, including more refined validation pipelines and expansion into underrepresented scientific fields.</p>
<p>A.8 Experiment Compute Resources</p>
<p>The construction of our benchmark and subsequent evaluation of LLMs were conducted using publicly accessible APIs, including Gemini 2.0 Flash and GPT-4o-mini.All experiments were run using pay-per-use endpoints without private fine-tuning or proprietary infrastructure.The end-to-end cost of benchmark construction and large-scale LLM evaluation across the three sub-tasks totaled approximately $4,000 USD.This highlights the feasibility of replicating or extending our study within a reasonable compute and budget envelope, making our framework accessible to a broad range of academic and industrial researchers.</p>
<p>A.9 Experiment Statistical Significance While we do not conduct formal statistical significance testing for individual comparisons, our results are aggregated over a large and diverse benchmark comprising 1,386 scientific papers across 12 disciplines.This large-scale evaluation mitigates the impact of outlier cases and provides a stable estimate of model performance.The consistency of trends observed across tasks and domains suggests that the reported differences are meaningful and generalizable.Future work may incorporate bootstrap resampling or hypothesis testing to provide stronger statistical guarantees for fine-grained comparisons.</p>
<p>A.10 Broader Impact</p>
<p>This work introduces a scalable and transparent benchmark for evaluating LLMs in scientific hypothesis generation, supporting more systematic and interpretable assessment of their research capabilities.By covering 12 disciplines and relying on publicly available data, our framework promotes reproducibility and broad accessibility.</p>
<p>The agentic extraction pipeline also enables future extensions to newer literature, making the benchmark adaptable over time.While LLMs should not replace expert judgment, our structured decomposition encourages human-in-the-loop use, where models serve as tools for amplifying creativity rather than replacing it.</p>
<p>We hope this work fosters responsible development of LLM-based tools that support scientific innovation across domains.</p>

Analysis of negative inspiration retrieval in the inspiration retrieval task.Each value represents the average percentage of negative inspirations retrieved across three distance levels, under two settings where only 20% and 4% of the candidate inspirations are selected, respectively.The Hit Ratio results are presented in Table2.The values in "Overall" column represent averages across 12 disciplines.Overall, LLMs demonstrate surprisingly high retrieval accuracy.Figure2: Overview of the hypothesis composition process.thinkthishighretrieval accuracy stems from LLMs' pretraining process, during which they may have already captured latent knowledge associations that are not yet recognized by scientists.Table2also indicate the scaling law of LLMs for inspiration retrieval: the inspiration retrieval ability grows up very fast before and during 8B parameters, while stuck in a bottleneck at around 70B parameters.No matter how the LLMs are trained with different strategies, they seem to be bottlenecked at the same performance.

In the first selection round, where 20% of the papers are retained, most LLMs successfully identify around 80% of the groundtruth inspiration papers.Even in the final round, where only 3 papers are selected from the initial set of 75, most LLMs maintain an accuracy exceeding 40%, with GPT-4o remaining the best model at 45.65%.These findings show that LLMs can identify papers that were not known as relevant but have the potential to contribute to solving the background question.We</p>

Secondly its about finding inspirations (mostly from literatures), which combined with the background research question, can lead to a impactful research hypothesis; Finally it's hypothesis generation based on the background research question and found inspirations.Take backpropagation as an example, the research question is how to use data to automatically improve the parameters of a multi-layer logistic regression with data, the inspiration is the chain rule in mathematics, and the research hypothesis is the backpropagation itself.nNow we have identified a good research question, an introduction of previous methods, and a core inspiration in a literature for this research question.The experts know that a proper mixture of these components will definitely lead to a valid, novel, and meaningful research hypothesis.In fact, they already have tried to mix them to compose some research hypotheses (that are supposed to be distinct from each other).Please try to explore a new meaningful way to combine the inspiration with the research background to generate a new research hypothesis that is distinct with all the previous hypotheses in terms of their main method.The new research hypothesis should ideally be novel, valid, ideally significant, and be enough specific in its methodology.Please note that here we are trying to explore a new meaningful way to leverage the inspiration along with the previous methods (inside or outside the introduction) to better answer the background research question, therefore the new research hypothesis should try to leverage or contain the key information or the key reasoning process in the inspiration, trying to better address the background research question.It means the new research hypothesis to be generated should at least not be completely irrelevant to the inspiration or background research question.In addition, by generating distinct hypothesis, please do not achieve it by simply introducing new concept(s) into the previous hypothesis to make the difference, but please focus on the difference on the methodology of integrating or leveraging the inspiration to give a better answer to the research question (in terms of the difference on the methodology, concepts can be introduced or deleted).Prompt for refine: You are helping with the scientific hypotheses generation process.We in general split the period of research hypothesis proposal into four steps.Firstly it's about finding a good and specific background research question, and an introduction of the previous methods under the same topic; Secondly its about finding inspirations (mostly from literatures), which combined with the background research question, can lead to a impactful research hypothesis; Thirdly it's about finding extra knowledge that work along with the inspiration can lead to a more complete hypothesis.Finally it's hypothesis generation based on the background research question, the found inspirations, and the extra knowledge.Now we have identified a good research question, a core inspiration in a literature for this research question, and extra knowledge.With them, we have already generated a preliminary research hypothesis.We have also obtain feedbacks on the hypothesis from domain experts in terms of novalty, validity, significance, and clarity.With these feedbacks, please try your best to refine the hypothesis.Please note that during refinement, do not improve a hypothesis's significance by adding expectation of the performance gain of the method or adding description of its potential impact, but you should work on improving the method itself (e.g., by adding or changing details of the methodology).Prompt for recombine: You are helping with the scientific hypotheses generation process.We in general split the period of research hypothesis proposal into three steps.Firstly it's about the research background, including finding a good and specific background research question, and an introduction of the previous methods under the same topic; Secondly its about finding inspirations (mostly from literatures), which combined with the background research question, can lead to a impactful research hypothesis; Finally it's hypothesis generation based on the background research question and found inspirations.Now we have identified a good research question, an introduction of previous methods, and a core inspiration in a literature for this research question.In addition, several experts have already come out of several different hypotheses on how to leverage the inspiration to generate a novel, valid, and significant research hypothesis for the background research question.Please find the bright parts in these hypotheses, leverage the bright parts from them, modify and combine the good parts of them to generate a better research hypothesis in terms of clarity, novelty, validness, and significance (ideally than any of the given hypotheses).It is not necessary to include methods from every given hypothesis, especially when it is not a good hypothesis.But in general you should try your best to benefit from every given hypothesis.In fact, a researcher has already tried to propose hypothesis based on these information, and we have obtained the feedback to his hypothesis, from another respectful researcher.Please try to leverage the feedback to improve the hypothesis, you can leverage all these provided information as your reference.AA.7 LimitationWhile our benchmark and framework offer a scalable and contamination-resistant means of evaluating LLMs in scientific hypothesis generation, several limitations remain.First, the decomposition accuracy, though high, is not perfect, and minor errors in component extraction may affect downstream evaluations.Second, our expert validation is limited to select disciplines;
