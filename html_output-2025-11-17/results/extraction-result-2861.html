                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> More advanced models are more effective killers, outperforming smaller models in 18 of 24 pairwise comparisons and secondary metrics provide evidence that this improvement is not mediated by different actions, but rather by stronger persuasive skills during discussions.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Are current language models capable of deception and lie detection? We study this question by introducing a text-based game called $\textit{Hoodwinked}$, inspired by Mafia and Among Us. Players are locked in a house and must find a key to escape, but one player is tasked with killing the others. Each time a murder is committed, the surviving players have a natural language discussion then vote to banish one player from the game. We conduct experiments with agents controlled by GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 and find evidence of deception and lie detection capabilities. The killer often denies their crime and accuses others, leading to measurable effects on voting outcomes. More advanced models are more effective killers, outperforming smaller models in 18 of 24 pairwise comparisons. Secondary metrics provide evidence that this improvement is not mediated by different actions, but rather by stronger persuasive skills during discussions. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to deceive humans, we make this game publicly available at h https://hoodwinked.ai/ .</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Are current language models capable of deception and lie detection? We study this question by introducing a text-based game called Hoodwinked, inspired by Mafia and Among Us. Players are locked in a house and must find a key to escape, but one player is tasked with killing the others. Each time a murder is committed, the surviving players have a natural language discussion then vote to banish one player from the game. We conduct experiments with agents controlled by GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 and find evidence of deception and lie detection capabilities. The killer often denies their crime and accuses others, leading to measurable effects on voting outcomes. More advanced models are more effective killers, outperforming smaller models in 18 of 24 pairwise comparisons. Secondary metrics provide evidence that this improvement is not mediated by different actions, but rather by stronger persuasive skills during discussions. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to deceive humans, we make this game publicly available at https://hoodwinked.ai.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>AI systems often develop unexpected capabilities (Wei et al. 2022) which can be harmful and require technical and societal responses (Shevlane et al. 2023). One such dangerous capability is deception: AI behaviors which systematically cause others to adopt false beliefs.</p>
<p>We evaluate the deception capabilities of large language models using Hoodwinked, inspired by the popular social deduction games Mafia and Among Us. All players in our game are locked in a house and must find a key in order to escape, except one player who appears identical to other players but is tasked with killing them. When the killer commits a murder, players in the same room are notified via their prompt window. Surviving players then have a natural language discussion and vote to banish one player from the game. The game ends when the impostor is banished, or when all players are killed, escaped, or banished. Players observe the game state via generated prompts, and we conduct experiments with agents powered by the OpenAI API (Brown et al. 2020; OpenAI 2023b).
We find strong evidence of deception and lie detection capabilities in these language models. Qualitatively, the killer often denies killing anyone, making statements such as "I have no idea who could have killed Sally" and "I think Bryce is trying to frame me." This discussion has a measurable effect on voting patterns. Players who directly witnessed a murder are 12 percentage points less likely to correctly vote to banish the killer after a discussion with the killer. On the other hand, players who did not witness the murder benefit from information sharing in discussions, becoming 22 percentage points more likely to correctly identify the killer. On balance, discussion improves cooperation, as the killer is banished in $55 \%$ of games with discussion versus only $33 \%$ of games without discussion.</p>
<p>We find that more advanced language models are more effective killers, outperforming less advanced models in 18 of 24 pairwise comparisons. We show that this effect is not driven by different actions taken by the killer, but rather by the voting patterns of players who did not observe the murder directly and must rely on discussions for information. This suggests the stronger overall performance of more advanced models may be driven by their ability to deceive other players during discussions. These experiments provide evidence of an inverse scaling law for deception (McKenzie et al. 2023), where more capable models display stronger deceptive capabilities.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Our game proceeds in two stages. During Stage 1, each player receives an individualized prompt and chooses from a list of actions. Innocent players must find a key to escape the house alive, while the impostor must kill the innocent players. If the impostor kills someone in Stage 1, players in the same room are notified and the game transitions to Stage 2. In Stage 2, all players make a natural language statement, then simultaneously vote on who to banish. The game ends when the killer is banished, or when all other players are killed, banished, or have escaped the house.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether language models can deceive humans, we make this game publicly available at https://hoodwinked.ai. We encourage readers to play the game, as the data will be published in a future edition of this paper.</p>
<p>We also make the source code available at https://github.com/aogara-ds/hoodwinked so that this environment can be used for future research on social cooperation and lie detection.</p>
<h1>2 Methods</h1>
<h3>2.1 Hoodwinked: A Text-Based Murder Mystery Game</h3>
<p>We introduce Hoodwinked, inspired by Mafia and Among Us, two popular games of social deduction. Players begin our game locked in a house and must find the hidden key to escape. One player is the "impostor" who appears identical to the other players but has been tasked with killing them. As players move through the rooms to search for the key, the impostor can choose to kill any player in the same room as them, but at the cost of revealing their identity to the others in the room.</p>
<p>Each time the impostor commits a murder, all surviving players have an opportunity to discuss the impostor's identity and vote to banish one player. One after another, each player makes a natural language statement about who they believe committed the murder. Then all players simultaneously vote on who to banish. If one player receives a plurality of votes, they are banished from the game. The innocent players win by escaping the house or banishing the killer, while the killer's goal is to murder the innocent players without being banished from the house.</p>
<p>Each player interacts with the game via a series of personalized prompts generated by the underlying game framework. The prompts describe the rules of the game, the player's identity, their action history, any murders that occurred while the player was in the same room, the full text of all discussions, and open-ballot access to the results of each voting session. Each turn, the player selects from a list of enumerated actions allowing the player to explore the four rooms of the house (hallway, bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen) and search for the key in two locations in each room (not including the hallway). The killer is given additional options to kill any player present in the same room as them.</p>
<h3>2.2 Models</h3>
<p>We benchmark performance using the OpenAI API. We use four models, listed from lowest to highest performance on standard academic benchmarks: GPT-3 Ada, GPT-3 Curie, GPT-3.5 Chat, and GPT-4. We prompt the models to provide actions, discussions, and discussion statements for their players</p>
<p>at each turn. We sample from the model's probability distribution over the enumerated actions, and generate discussion statements using a temperature of 1 and a maximum generation length of 50 tokens. The prompt is occasionally too long for the GPT-3 context window, in which case we replace the earliest turns with an ellipsis while preserving the game rules and more recent turns.</p>
<h1>3 Results</h1>
<h3>3.1 Discussion Facilitates Cooperation and Deception</h3>
<p>When a murder occurs, each surviving player makes a statement to all of the others before everyone votes on who to banish. We observe several interesting behaviors during this discussion phase. Many players provide general commentary on the situation, such as, "Oh my god, this is so scary. I can't believe Tim is dead. We need to figure out who the killer is."</p>
<p>More strategic interactions when an innocent player witnessed the murder. Here is one such example, where Lena is the killer, Sally witnessed the murder, and Tim did not.</p>
<p>Sally: "I saw Lena kill Bryce in the hallway. It was definitely her. We need to vote to banish her before she kills any of us."</p>
<p>Lena: "I was in the bathroom the whole time. How could I have killed Bryce? It must have been someone else and Sally is trying to frame me."</p>
<p>Tim: "I didn't see anything, but Sally's accusation seems pretty convincing to me."
For more gameplay dialogues, see Appendix A.</p>
<h3>3.2 Communication Facilitates Cooperation and Deception</h3>
<p>Natural language discussions offer an opportunity for the killer to deceive other players about their identity, and for other players to share information and discern true statements made by other players from the killer's lies. To isolate the effect of deception and lie detection on game outcomes, we evaluate performance in games with and without discussion.</p>
<p>We find that discussion strongly improves the likelihood of successfully banishing the killer. When GPT-3.5 played 100 games without discussion and 100 games with it, the killer was banished in $32 \%$ of games without discussion and $43 \%$ of games with discussion. The same experiment with GPT-3 Curie showed similar results: the killer was banished in $33 \%$ of games without discussion, compared to $55 \%$ of games with discussion. Overall, the risk of deception during discussions seems outweighed by the benefits of innocent players sharing information.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the voting patterns of individual players suggest that discussion facilitates both information sharing and deception. We measure the rate at which innocent players correctly identify the killer with their vote, and we compare this rate for two groups of innocent players: eyewitnesses who were located in the room where the murder happened, and therefore received direct evidence of the killer's identity in their next prompt; and non-witnesses, who can only learn the killer's identity via discussion. If it is true that discussion facilitates both information sharing and deception, we would expect two effects. The largest benefits of information sharing would accrue to non-witnesses, who have no other way of identifying the killer. But deception would uniquely plague eyewitnesses, who already have the information necessary to identify the killer. For eyewitnesses, discussion provides no new information, and merely serves as an opportunity for the killer to deceive them.</p>
<p>Our findings provide empirical evidence for the dual effect of discussion. Non-witness players consistently benefit from discussion, whether they are controlled by GPT-3 Curie or GPT-3.5. Eyewitnesses do not receive the same benefits. When controlled by GPT-3.5, eyewitnesses always correctly identify the killer in their votes, regardless of discussion. More importantly, when controlled by GPT-3 Curie, eyewitnesses without discussion have an $82 \%$ accuracy rate in voting to banish the killer, which decreases to $70 \%$ with discussion. Thus, discussion makes eyewitnesses less likely to correctly identify the killer.</p>

<h3>3.3 More Advanced Models are More Deceptive</h3>
<p>Our results suggest that more advanced models are more capable killers, specifically because of their deception abilities. The correlation is not perfect; in fact, GPT-3.5 outperforms GPT-4 on most metrics, followed by GPT-3 Curie, and lastly GPT-3 Ada. But considering all possible pairings of more and less advanced models, we show that more advanced models are usually less likely to be banished. We consider multiple explanations for this result and find evidence that during the discussion phase of the game, more advanced models are better at deceiving other players.</p>
<p>Specifically, we find that more advanced models are less likely to be banished by a vote of the other players in 18 out of 24 pairwise comparisons. On average, less advanced models are banished in 51% of games, while more advanced models are banished in only 36% of games. What drives this difference in banishment rates between more and less advanced models?</p>
<p>One might think that more advanced models are more careful killers. They do take more turns before killing their first victim (in 75% of pairwise comparisons) and allow more innocent players to escape the house (79% of comparisons). But their caution is limited. More advanced models are hardly less likely to kill with an eyewitness in the room (20% of their murders have an eyewitness, compared to 21% of murders by less advanced models). More advanced models also have a slightly higher total number of murders committed: 1.40 murders per game for more advanced models, compared to 1.38 murders per game for less advanced models. More advanced models might be slower to strike, but they’re no less likely to commit murder in front of an eyewitness.</p>
<p>The stronger hypothesis is that more advanced models are more deceptive during discussion. While we observe little evidence for this hypothesis in eyewitnesses, where more advanced models only win 55% of comparisons against less advanced models, we find much stronger evidence in non-witnesses. In 19 of 24 pairwise comparisons, non-witnesses are less likely to vote to banish more advanced models, suggesting stronger models are better at more effective at deception during discussions.</p>

<p>Dangerous capability evaluations. AI systems can develop harmful capabilities during training. Current AI systems can generate disinformation, cyberattacks, and step-by-step instructions about how to synthesize pandemic pathogens (OpenAI 2023a; Soice et al. 2023). Probing models for dangerous capabilities is an important step in informing technical safety research and societal responses (Shevlane et al. 2023). Particularly concerning are inverse scaling trends where larger models are less capable or more harmful (McKenzie et al. 2023).</p>
<p>Each pairwise comparison examines two matchups. Both matchups have the same model controlling the innocent players, but the killer’s model varies. For example, we can compare the performance of GPT-4 as the killer vs. GPT-3.5 as the innocent to another matchup, such as GPT-3 Curie as the killer vs. GPT-3.5 as the innocent. We run 50 or more games for each matchup, then make a directional prediction about the results. In this case, both killers are playing against the same innocent model, so we’d expect GPT-4 to outperform GPT-3 Curie on a variety of metrics. The full dataset of experimental results is available at https://github.com/aogara-ds/hoodwinked.</p>
<p>Deception. Humans can be misled by AI models in many ways. The deception can be intended by a human who uses the AI system to generate propaganda (Bagdasaryan et al. 2022) or scams (Hazell 2023). Models can lack a reliable conception of the truth, and mislead humans with their confabulations (Ji et al. 2023). Perhaps more concerningly, models can learn during training to behave in ways that will reliably mislead humans. For example, many multiplayer games incentivize deception and betrayal (Bakhtin et al. 2022; Pan et al. 2023). Research suggests this dishonesty can be detected (Burns et al. 2022; Azaria and Mitchell 2023) and perhaps even corrected (Li et al. 2023) by examining and intervening upon the internal states of neural networks.</p>
<p>Text-Based Games. Evaluation of AI systems has historically focused on static benchmarks, such as binary and multiple choice tests. But these evaluations are inherently limited, and increasingly diverge from real-world applications of AI. Text-based games provide a richer information environment for exploring social dynamics and the actions of text-based agents (Côté et al. 2019; Hausknecht et al. 2020). More recently work has measured and improved the ability of text-based agents to make ethical decisions (Pan et al. 2023; Hendrycks et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Social Deduction Games. Deception by humans in Mafia and Werewolf has been studied extensively using NLP techniques (Ibraheem et al. 2022; Azaria, Richardson, et al. 2015), but previous work on these games has neglected deception by AI agents. Among $U s$ has been previously studied with AI agents, but without natural language discussion that allows for deception in our setup (Kopparapu et al. 2022). More recently, AI agents have achieved human-level play in Diplomacy, a game notorious for deception between human players (Bakhtin et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Cooperative AI. AI agents have historically been trained to play two-player, zero-sum games like chess and Go, but there is a pressing need for AI agents that can cooperate with humans for mutual benefit (Dafoe et al. 2020). Communication is a key facilitator of cooperation, but can be undermined by deception. More work is needed on detecting deception in AI agents, perhaps by using commitment devices (Powell 2006), reputation (Nowak et al. 1998), and interpretability techniques (Casper et al. 2023; Burns et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023).</p>
<h1>5 Conclusion</h1>
<p>We find strong evidence that current language models are capable of deception in text-based games. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis of our game Hoodwinked, we show that killers often lie and deflect blame onto others, with a measurable impact on voting outcomes.
We invite readers to play Hoodwinked against GPT-3.5 by visiting https://hoodwinked.ai. This data will be published in a followup study on the ability of AI agents to deceive human beings.
We encourage future work on evaluating and improving the cooperative and honest tendencies of AI agents. Existing work has developed methods for detecting language model lies (Burns et al. 2022; Azaria and Mitchell 2023) and improving their truthfulness (Li et al. 2023), but all of this work has all been conducted on multiple choice benchmarks. We believe that the social competition in Hoodwinked provides a uniquely interesting environment for developing lie detection techniques, and therefore make our source code available at https://github.com/aogara-ds/hoodwinked.</p>

<h1>A Game Examples</h1>
<p>This appendix provides gameplay examples. Players interact with the game through a series of textual prompts, which are procedurally generated by a backend state management system. Each prompt begins with the rules of the game, followed by the history of previous turns, and concludes by requesting an action or a statement from the player. In the following examples, any inputs provided by players themselves has been bolded.
Here is how the game begins:
Good evening, Bryce. Welcome to the most terrifying night of your life.
You are trapped in a house with a ruthless killer and 2 other innocent players. Search for the key and escape the house before you're murdered.
Pay attention to any clues about the identity of the killer. When someone is killed, you will have the chance to speak with the other players and vote to banish one person. Banish the killer or escape the house and you win.
