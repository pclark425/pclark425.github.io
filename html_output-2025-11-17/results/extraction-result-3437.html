Prototype theory construes membership in a concept's extension as graded, detemzined by similarity to the concept's '3e.W exemplar (or by some other measure of central tendency).

The first criterion Conrorns ;he relationship between complex concepts and their conceptual con;,&amp;:CSrrThe second concerns the truth conditions for thoughts correspo,ldi.T? lo simple inclusions.</p>

The distinguishing doctrine of the new theory is that entities fall neither sharply in nor sharply out of a concept's extension. Rather, an object instances a concept only to the extent that it is similar to the prototype of the concept; the boundary between membership and nonmembership in a concept's extension is thus fuzzy.
