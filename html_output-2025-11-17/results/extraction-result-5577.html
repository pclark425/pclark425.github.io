The operator deforming the theory is irrelevant and makes the boundaries bend inward toward the IR. This effect, reminiscent of two-dimensional dilaton gravities, renders the teleportation protocol more efficient and facilitates the transfer of information between the members of the dual Bell pair.

<p>Abstract: We construct worldsheet traversable wormholes by considering the effects of a double-trace deformation, $\delta \mathcal{L} \sim h \partial \phi_{L} \partial \phi_{R}$, coupling the endpoints of an open string in AdS space. The operator deforming the theory is irrelevant and makes the boundaries bend inward toward the IR. This effect, reminiscent of two-dimensional dilaton gravities, renders the teleportation protocol more efficient and facilitates the transfer of information between the members of the dual Bell pair. We compare our results with those obtained with the standard double-trace deformation, $\delta \mathcal{L} \sim h \phi_{L} \phi_{R}$, introduced by Gao, Jafferis and Wall.</p>

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The landscape of spacetimes that could emerge from Einstein's field equations began to take on a variety of novel configurations not long after general relativity was discovered. A noteworthy example is a solution discovered in the mid '30s by Einstein himself and Rosen, describing a bridge between worlds, and known thereafter under the name of Einstein-Rosen bridge [1]. An Einstein-Rosen bridge is a vacuum solution to Einstein's equations that link two otherwise spatially disconnected spacetimes, what in modern terminology is referred to as a maximally extended Schwarzschild solution. Many generalizations have appeared since, including bridges connecting distant but causally connected regions of the same geometry and, thus, representing actual shortcuts in spacetime. These solutions were popularized after a seminal paper by Misner and Wheeler in the late '50s [2], which coined the term wormholes.</p>
<p>A crucial property of these wormholes is that energy-violating matter is typically needed to support their throats, which makes them seem to belong only in science fiction. However, recent progress has shown that these violations may naturally occur in quantum mechanics, suggesting that real-world traversable wormholes might exist. This raises fascinating questions about their nature and phenomenology, with some even proposing that they may be created in a laboratory, and use them in experiments of quantum teleportation [3, 4].</p>
<p>The interest in wormhole solutions was reignited with the discovery of the AdS/CFT correspondence [5], a robust framework that allows us to pose questions about quantum gravity and reformulate them in the language of field theory. In this context, a maximally extended or two-sided AdS black hole is known to map to the canonical purification of the thermal density matrix, known as the thermofield double state [6]. This unique, maximally entangled state is thus represented by an Einstein-Rosen bridge embedded in AdS space, leading to one of the central theses of the AdS/CFT correspondence, namely, the fact that entanglement generates connectivity in the bulk spacetime [7]. The ER=EPR correspondence, which connects EPR-type entanglement in boundary theory with the presence of an Einstein-Rosen bridge in dual bulk spacetime, provides a qualitative yet catchy formulation of this claim. Evidence for this correspondence includes [9-13], showing that single Bell pairs in the field theory (EPR or Hawking) can be thought of as generating Planckian-size wormholes, holographically represented by strings in AdS with an Einstein-Rosen bridge in the induced geometry.</p>
<p>Einstein-Rosen bridges in AdS are, however, not traversable. This is consistent with the fact that while entangled, the theories in the thermofield double state do not interact. Traversable wormholes, on the other hand, require a violation of the so-called Average Null Energy Condition (ANEC). For a local quantum field theory, the ANEC states that the integral of the stress-energy tensor along a complete achronal null geodesic is non-negative</p>
<p>$$
\int T_{\mu \nu} k^{\mu} k^{\nu} d \lambda \geq 0
$$</p>
<p>where $k^{\mu}$ is the tangent vector and $\lambda$ is an affine parameter. Classically, a violation of ANEC is prevented by the Null energy Condition (NEC), $T_{\mu \nu} k^{\mu} k^{\nu} \geq 0$, which must be valid for any physically reasonable theory, and implies (1.1). However, quantum mechanical effects may induce negative null energy, leading to violations of the NEC and the ANEC. A prototypical example where such violations may be triggered was studied by Gao, Jafferis and Wall (GJW) [21], which showed that a double trace deformation of the form</p>
<p>$$
\delta H=\int d x h(t, x) \mathcal{O}<em R="R">{L}(-t, x) \mathcal{O}</em>(t, x)
$$</p>
<p>introduces the negative null energy in the bulk necessary to sustain a traversable wormhole. ${ }^{1}$ They worked within the semi-classical approximation, where matter fields are treated quantum mechanically, but the gravitational field, or the metric, is treated classically. In this context, one is to solve the semi-classical Einstein's equations</p>
<p>$$
G_{\mu \nu}=8 \pi G_{N}\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>where $G_{\mu \nu}$ is Einstein's tensor, and $\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle$ is the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in a given quantum state. GJW showed that for certain choices of the coupling $h(t, x)$, the</p>

<p>1-loop expectation value of the stress-energy tensor does indeed lead to</p>
<p>$$
\int\left\langle T_{\mu \nu}\right\rangle k^{\mu} k^{\nu} d \lambda&lt;0
$$</p>
<p>rendering an Einstein-Rosen bridge traversable. This allows the transfer of information between the two asymptotic boundaries, a process that can be viewed as a teleportation protocol [21]. GJW considered the specific case of a two-sided BTZ black hole, but their construction was subsequently extended in several directions, for example, to black holes solutions in JT gravity [23-25], higher-dimensional black holes [26-28], asymptotically flat black holes [29], multi-boundary traversable wormholes [30,31], eternal traversable wormholes [32-34], nearextremal black holes [35], and rotating black holes [36]. Other interesting developments include for instance [37-52]. For a recent review of wormholes in holography, see [53].</p>
<p>The stringy setups considered in [9-13], holographically dual to single entangled Bell pairs in the field theory, provide a natural and interesting environment where these ideas may be investigated. Indeed, the worldsheet theory of a string may be viewed as the simplest theory of 'quantum gravity' that one can solve [54]. Even though worldsheet theories do not contain explicit gravitational degrees of freedom, it is important to remember that they have several surprising qualities that are similar to gravity, including the absence of local off-shell observables, a minimal length, a maximum achievable Hagedorn temperature [54]. Further, their spectrum includes (integrable relatives of) black holes, which display fast scrambling and maximal chaos [55, 56]. This is evident from the fact that their low energy effective action includes a soft sector governed by a Schwarzian action which couples with other modes in the infrared [57-59], reminiscent of two-dimensional dilaton theories and the SYK model. Finally, in some cases worldsheet theories may be cast as $T \bar{T}$-deformed field theories [60-62], which have proved crucial for studies of holography at a finite cutoff, e.g., [63-65].</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows. We begin in Section 2 with a quick review of open strings on AdS and the holographic dictionary for the worldsheet theory. Focusing on string states with an induced two-sided $\mathrm{AdS}<em L="L">{2}$ black hole geometry, we then discuss the computation of correlation functions using the extrapolate dictionary and sketch the derivation of two- and four-point functions, appearing in previous literature. In Section 3 we consider the effects of a deformation that may naturally arise from interactions between the endpoints of the string. At the lowest order, this coupling is of the form $\delta \mathcal{L} \sim h \partial \phi</em>} \partial \phi_{R}$, in contrast with the standard deformation $\delta \mathcal{L} \sim h \phi_{L} \phi_{R}$ studied by Gao, Jafferis and Wall [21]. The effects of this deformation are studied in detail from the worldsheet perspective, drawing a comparison to the standard case that was considered in earlier research on $\mathrm{AdS<em 1="1">{2}$ holography [23]. ${ }^{2}$ The string coupling is irrelevant in the dual $\mathrm{CFT}</em>$ and, as expected from scaling arguments, does not lead to a large effect in the IR other than slightly opening the wormhole throat. However, the coupling induces a large backreaction in the UV, effectively pulling the AdS boundaries inward. This effect ultimately improves the bound on information transfer between one boundary to</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>another, effectively rendering the teleportation protocol more efficient. We close in Section 4 with a discussion of our results and open questions that remain for future work.</p>
<h1>2 Preliminaries: open strings and $\mathrm{AdS}<em 1="1">{2} / \mathrm{CFT}</em>$</h1>
<h3>2.1 Classical string solutions and worldsheet black holes</h3>
<p>Let us start by describing our holographic setup. We will consider a generic bulk geometry of the form $\operatorname{AdS}<em c="c">{d+1} \times X^{p}$, dual to some $d$-dimensional large- $N</em>$, where they end smoothly (meaning that one of their internal cycles shrinks down to zero size). A prototypical example is the standard D3/D7 system [67], however, will be largely agnostic about the precise details of the top-down construction.}$ field theory. We then consider a stack of $N_{f}$ flavor branes on top of this geometry, with $N_{f} \ll N_{c}$. In this limit, the flavor branes act as probe branes and one may neglect their backreaction. The flavor branes will be assumed to span all directions of the dual theory, however, they will have compact radial support, spanning from boundary $z=0$ up to some cutoff surface $z_{c</p>
<p>We then consider a fundamental open string in such AdS space, with its two endpoints attached to one of the flavor branes. ${ }^{3}$ The dynamics of the string are governed by the standard Nambu-Goto action,</p>
<p>$$
S_{\mathrm{NG}}=-\frac{1}{2 \pi \alpha^{\prime}} \int_{\Sigma} \sqrt{-\operatorname{det} \gamma_{\alpha \beta}}
$$</p>
<p>where $\gamma_{\alpha \beta}=g_{\mu \nu} \partial_{\alpha} X^{\mu} \partial_{\beta} X^{\nu}$ is the induced metric on the worldsheet and $X^{\mu}(\tau, \sigma)$ are the embedding functions into the target space.</p>
<p>We will now consider global $\mathrm{AdS}_{3}$ for concreteness, but the generalization to higher dimensions is straighforard. The bulk metric reads</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-\left(1+\frac{\rho^{2}}{\ell^{2}}\right) d \tau^{2}+\rho^{2} d \varphi^{2}+\frac{d \rho^{2}}{\left(1+\frac{\rho^{2}}{\ell^{2}}\right)}
$$</p>
<p>It can be checked that a static string lying at a fixed azimuthal angle,</p>
<p>$$
X^{\mu}(\tau, \rho)={\tau, \varphi(\tau, \rho)=\text { constant }, \rho}
$$</p>
<p>solves the equations of motion and is therefore a valid solution. This situation is depicted in Fig. 1. One may wonder how this solution looks like from the point of view of a Poincaré observer, which only has access to part of the spacetime - see Fig. 1 for an illustration. The bulk metric in this case takes the form</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=\frac{\ell^{2}}{u^{2}}\left[-d \mathbf{t}^{2}+d \mathbf{x}^{2}+d u^{2}\right]
$$</p>
<p>and the string profile maps to the well-known solution with constant acceleration [14, 15],</p>
<p>$$
X^{\mu}(\mathbf{t}, u)=\left{\mathbf{t}, \mathbf{x}(\mathbf{t}, u)=\sqrt{A^{-2}+\mathbf{t}^{2}-u^{2}}, u\right}
$$</p>
<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: Static string dual to a quark $q$ and anti-quark $\bar{q}$ pair in global AdS. The two null planes depicted in yellow delimit the interior of a Poincaré patch, as seen by an accelerated observer. From the point of view of this Poincaré observer, the $q \bar{q}$-pair undergoes back-to-back constant acceleration. The induced worldsheet geometry hence includes a two-sided horizon and a wormhole, which is classically non-traversable.</p>
<p>This profile is shown in Fig. 2. The accelerated solution contains a two-sided horizon and a wormhole in the induced worldsheet geometry [11]. As pointed out in this paper, one may deform this solution in a number of ways (as allowed by the classical equations of motion) but always in a way such that the corresponding wormhole remains non-traversable.</p>
<p>One can further specialize to the case of a Rindler observer in the bulk, in which case, only part of the string embedding is accessible. The bulk metric in this case takes the form of a (planar) BTZ black brane</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-r^{2} f(r) d t^{2}+r^{2} d x^{2}+\frac{d r^{2}}{r^{2} f(r)}, \quad f(r)=1-\left(\frac{r_{0}}{r}\right)^{2}
$$</p>
<p>and the embedding corresponds to a static vertical string that stretches between the AdS boundary and the horizon [16]</p>
<p>$$
X^{\mu}(t, r)={t, x(t, r)=0, r}
$$</p>

<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Left: uniformly-accelerated quark-anti-quark pair (qq) and their corresponding string dual, plotted in the Poincaré patch of AdS. The worldsheet geometry includes a two-sided horizon and a wormhole, which is classically non-traversable. Right: string embedding in a Rindler patch of AdS. This coordinate system only covers one side of the solution, corresponding to one of the quarks. The solution is static and stretches between the boundary of AdS and an accelerating horizon that develops in the bulk.</p>
<p>The induced metric on the worldsheet takes the form of a 2d black hole:</p>
<p>$$
\gamma_{\alpha \beta}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-r^{2} f(r) &amp; 0 \
0 &amp; \frac{1}{r^{2} f(r)}
\end{array}\right)
$$</p>
<p>which coincides with a constant- $x$ section of a BTZ black brane. Perturbations over the static string embedding thus correspond to perturbations on top of this 2d black hole. Since black holes are known to be fast scramblers and saturate the bound on the quantum Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_{L}$, this lead to the conjecture that open strings could also exhibit maximal chaos. Indeed, explicit calculation of the four-point OTOC [56] confirmed this intuition.</p>
<h1>2.2 Semi-classical worldsheet theory</h1>
<p>The worldsheet theory for fluctuations around the static string embedding can be understood as a QFT living on a black hole background. To see the details of this theory, we can expand the NG action around this solution, i.e., $X^{\mu}=X_{0}^{\mu}+\delta X^{\mu}$, where</p>
<p>$$
X_{0}^{\mu}(t, r)={t, x(t, r)=0, r}, \quad \delta X^{\mu}(t, r)={0, \delta x(t, r) \equiv \phi(t, r), 0}
$$</p>
<p>Plugging this into the action we obtain:</p>
<p>$$
S=S_{\text {free }}+S_{\text {int }}
$$</p>
<p>where $S_{\text {free }}$ is the action of the free theory and $S_{\text {int }}$ is the interaction piece, respectively:</p>
<p>$$
S_{\text {free }}=\frac{1}{2} \int d t d r\left(\frac{\dot{\phi}^{2}}{f}-r^{4} f \phi^{\prime 2}\right), \quad S_{\text {int }}=\frac{\kappa}{4} \int d t d r\left(\frac{\dot{\phi}^{2}}{f}-r^{4} f \phi^{\prime 2}\right)^{2}+\cdots
$$</p>
<p>For convenience, we have rescaled $\phi \rightarrow \sqrt{2 \pi \alpha^{\prime}} \phi$ and set $\kappa=\pi \alpha^{\prime}$. Also, notice that we have only included interactions up to quartic order, which are relevant for the calculation of twoand four-point functions at leading order in $\alpha^{\prime}$. In the next subsection, we will review the calculation of these correlators using the well-known 'extrapolate' prescription.</p>
<h1>2.2.1 Two- and four-point functions</h1>
<p>The equation of motion that follows from $S_{\text {free }}$ is:</p>
<p>$$
\left[-f^{-1} \partial_{t}^{2}+\partial_{r}\left(r^{4} f \partial_{r}\right)\right] \phi(t, r)=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad\left[f^{-1} \omega^{2}+\partial_{r}\left(r^{4} f \partial_{r}\right)\right] g(r)=0
$$</p>
<p>where we have set $\phi(t, r)=e^{-i \omega t} g(r)$. The two linearly independent solutions to this equation can be written as $g_{ \pm \omega}(r)$ where:</p>
<p>$$
g_{\omega}(r)=\frac{1}{1+i \nu} \frac{\rho+i \nu}{\rho}\left(\frac{\rho-1}{\rho+1}\right)^{i \nu / 2}
$$</p>
<p>and we have defined the following dimensionless variables:</p>
<p>$$
\rho \equiv \frac{r}{r_{0}}, \quad \nu \equiv \frac{\omega}{r_{0}}=\frac{\beta \omega}{2 \pi}
$$</p>
<p>These solutions satisfy $g_{\omega}(r)^{<em>}=g_{-\omega}(r)$ and are purely outgoing/ingoing, respectively. To see this, we can define the tortoise coordinate $r_{</em>}$ such that</p>
<p>$$
d r_{*}^{2}=\frac{d r^{2}}{r^{4} f(r)^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>This coordinate is convenient because the worldsheet metric becomes conformally flat and the fluctuations are easier to analyze. Integrating (2.15) we find</p>
<p>$$
r_{*}=-\frac{1}{r_{0}} \operatorname{arccoth}\left(\frac{r}{r_{0}}\right)
$$</p>
<p>As we can see, the horizon is mapped to $r_{<em>} \rightarrow-\infty$ while the boundary is now at $r_{</em>} \rightarrow 0$. In particular, in the near-horizon region, we have</p>
<p>$$
r_{*} \sim \frac{1}{2 r_{0}} \log \left(\frac{r}{r_{0}}-1\right)
$$</p>
<p>and the equation of motion becomes</p>
<p>$$
\left(\omega^{2}+\partial_{r_{*}}^{2}\right) g(r) \approx 0
$$</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the solutions should take the following form:</p>
<p>$$
g(r) \approx e^{i \omega r_{<em>}} \quad \text { (outgoing) }, \quad g(r) \approx e^{-i \omega r_{</em>}} \quad \text { (ingoing) }
$$</p>
<p>In terms of the tortoise coordinate, (2.13) becomes:</p>
<p>$$
g_{\omega}(r)=\frac{1}{1+i \nu} \frac{\rho+i \nu}{\rho} e^{i \omega r_{*}}
$$</p>
<p>so we can indeed identify $g_{\pm \omega}(r)$ as outgoing/ingoing solutions. Next, we impose a Neumann boundary condition for $\phi(r, t)$ in the UV, ${ }^{4}$</p>
<p>$$
\partial_{r} \phi\left(r_{c}, t\right)=0
$$</p>
<p>where $r_{c}=1 / z_{c}$ is a UV cutoff. This condition dictates that we take the linear combination:</p>
<p>$$
f_{\omega}(r)=g_{\omega}(r)+e^{i \theta_{\omega}} g_{-\omega}(r), \quad e^{i \theta_{\omega}}=-\frac{\partial_{r} g_{\omega}\left(r_{c}\right)}{\partial_{r} g_{-\omega}\left(r_{c}\right)}
$$</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the phase $\theta_{\omega}$ is real. The field $\phi$ can now be expanded as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\phi(t, r)=\frac{\sqrt{2 \pi \alpha^{\prime}}}{r_{H}} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \omega}}\left[f_{\omega}(r) e^{-i \omega t} a_{\omega}+f_{\omega}(r)^{*} e^{i \omega t} a_{\omega}^{\dagger}\right]
$$</p>
<p>The normalization constant in front of (2.23) appears after properly normalizing the mode functions $f_{\omega}(r)$ [17]. Moreover, since the system is at finite temperature $T$, the expectation value of the creation and annihilation operators should follow a Bose distribution:</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle a_{\omega}^{\dagger} a_{\omega^{\prime}}\right\rangle=\frac{2 \pi \delta\left(\omega-\omega^{\prime}\right)}{e^{\beta \omega}-1}
$$</p>
<p>We will be interested in the Wightman and retarded propagators, defined as follows:</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; D_{W}\left(t-t^{\prime}, r, r^{\prime}\right)=\left\langle\phi(t, r) \phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle \
&amp; D_{\mathrm{ret}}\left(t-t^{\prime}, r, r^{\prime}\right)=\theta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right)\left\langle\left[\phi(t, r), \phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right)\right]\right\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>Using the wave equation (2.12) and the canonical commutation relation</p>
<p>$$
\left[\phi(t, r), \dot{\phi}\left(t, r^{\prime}\right)\right]=2 \pi i \alpha^{\prime} f \delta\left(r-r^{\prime}\right)
$$</p>
<p>it can be shown that these propagators satisfy</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
&amp; {\left[-f^{-1} \partial_{t}^{2}+\partial_{r}\left(r^{4} f \partial_{r}\right)\right] D_{W}\left(t-t^{\prime}, r, r^{\prime}\right)=0} \
&amp; {\left[-f^{-1} \partial_{t}^{2}+\partial_{r}\left(r^{4} f \partial_{r}\right)\right] D_{\mathrm{ret}}\left(t-t^{\prime}, r, r^{\prime}\right)=2 \pi i \alpha^{\prime} \delta\left(t-t^{\prime}\right) \delta\left(r-r^{\prime}\right)}
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>It is then easy to show that the Wightman propagator can be written as</p>
<p>$$
D_{W}\left(\omega, r, r^{\prime}\right)=\frac{2 \pi \alpha^{\prime}}{r_{0}^{2}} \frac{f_{\omega}(r) f_{-\omega}\left(r^{\prime}\right)}{2 \omega\left(1-e^{-\beta \omega}\right)}
$$</p>
<p><sup id="fnref4:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>where $f_{-\omega}=f_{\omega}^{*}$. These correlators can also be derived using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism [18].</p>
<p>Depending on time ordering, there are a few possible four-point correlation functions that will be of interest to our purposes. These can be written as</p>
<p>$$
D\left(t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, t_{4}\right)=\left\langle W\left(t_{1}\right) V\left(t_{2}\right) W\left(t_{3}\right) V\left(t_{4}\right)\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>In this case, one may consider the standard Schwinger-Keldysh contour or a more general time-fold to obtain exotic time orderings (see e.g. [19]). The relevant one to study chaos is the out-of-time-order (OTOC) for which $t_{1}&gt;t_{2}$ and $t_{3}&gt;t_{4}$ but $t_{2}&lt;t_{3}$ and $t_{4}&lt;t_{1}$. This correlator was studied in [56] for the case at hand. The OTOC calculation boils down to computing a scattering amplitude in the near-horizon region, which may be obtained using the eikonal approximation. This gives the following result [19]</p>
<p>$$
D_{\text {otoc }}\left(t_{1}, t_{2}, t_{3}, t_{4}\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty} d p \psi_{1}(p) \psi_{3}^{<em>}(p) \int_{0}^{\infty} d q \psi_{2}(q) \psi_{4}^{</em>}(q) e^{i \delta}
$$</p>
<p>where the wave functions $\psi_{i}$ are Fourier transforms of bulk-to-boundary correlators</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\psi_{1}(p) &amp; =\left.\int d v e^{2 i p v}\left\langle\varphi_{V}(u, v) V\left(t_{1}\right)^{\dagger}\right\rangle\right|<em 2="2">{u=0} \

<p>$\varphi_{V}$ and $\varphi_{W}$ are the worldsheet fields dual to the boundary operators $V$ and $W$, and $u$ and $v$ are Kruskal coordinates (see (3.5)). The phase shift is given by</p>
<p>$$
\delta(s)=\frac{s \ell_{s}^{2}}{4}
$$</p>
<p>where $s=(\Delta E)^{2}$ is the standard Mandelstam variable and $\ell_{s} \equiv \sqrt{2 \pi \alpha^{\prime}}$. Evaluating (2.30) at leading order in $\ell_{s}^{2}$ for $t_{1}=i \epsilon_{1}, t_{2}=t+i \epsilon_{2}, t_{3}=i \epsilon_{3}$ and $t_{4}=t+i \epsilon_{4}$, and normalizing the correlator with respect to the leading order term, one finds [56]</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\left\langle V\left(i \epsilon_{1}\right) W\left(t+i \epsilon_{2}\right) V\left(i \epsilon_{3}\right) W\left(t+i \epsilon_{4}\right)\right\rangle}{\left\langle V\left(i \epsilon_{1}\right) V\left(i \epsilon_{3}\right)\right\rangle\left\langle W\left(t+i \epsilon_{2}\right) W\left(t+i \epsilon_{4}\right)\right\rangle}=1+\frac{2 i \ell_{s}^{2}}{\epsilon_{13} \epsilon_{24}^{*}} e^{2 \pi T t}
$$</p>
<p>where $\epsilon_{m n}=i\left(e^{i 2 \pi T \epsilon_{m}}-e^{i 2 \pi T \epsilon_{n}}\right)$. From (2.37) we can read off the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_{L}=2 \pi T$, which saturates the chaos bound [20].</p>
<h1>3 Making worldsheet traversable wormholes</h1>
<h3>3.1 Introducing a double trace deformation</h3>
<p>Following the seminal work of Gao, Jafferis and Wall [21], one may wonder if we can consider the effects of a non-local coupling to construct traversable wormholes in the worldsheet. In order to do so, we must first ask what the natural form of such a coupling may be. To start with, we note that each endpoint of the string can be coupled to a flavor brane via the boundary term (see e.g. [22])</p>
<p>$$
S_{F}=\int_{\partial \Sigma} A_{\mu} \dot{X}^{\mu}
$$</p>
<p>Normally, $A_{\mu}$ is meant to be taken as an external field on the brane, which one can turn on by hand. However, in our context, it is natural to take inspiration from the form of the backreacted field that arises from the presence of the second endpoint of the string. For a pointlike source, this field is expected to follow the standard Liénard-Wiechert form, $A_{\mu} \sim \delta \bar{X}_{\mu}$. In our conventions (2.9), then, we are then led to consider a coupling of the form: ${ }^{5}$</p>
<p>$$
S_{F}=h \int_{\partial \Sigma} \dot{\phi}<em R="R">{L} \dot{\phi}</em>
$$</p>
<p>where $h$ is a parameter that controls the strength of the backreaction. This is a bilocal coupling, as in [21], but involving derivatives. It is important to emphasize that backreaction itself is not enough to obtain such a coupling, as (3.2) requires to properly account for retarded times and, hence, cannot possibly be instantaneous. Nevertheless, terms like (3.2) are quite natural to describe the leading interactions between endpoints since it is $\partial \phi$, and not $\phi$, that represents a primary operator from the worldsheet perspective. In the following, we will thus proceed by assuming that such a coupling has been turned on and study its implications.</p>
<p>To construct the traversable wormhole it would suffice to consider the free theory $S_{\text {free }}$ (free massless scalar field) together with the non-local coupling (3.2), i.e., one can ignore the higher order interactions in a first approximation. However, the interaction terms in $S_{\text {int }}$ are important in order to actually study the information transfer, as one must take them into account for the computation of four- and higher-point correlators.</p>
<p>One difference between our work and the standard setup considered by Gao, Jafferis and Wall [21] is that our worldsheet metric $\gamma_{\alpha \beta}$ does not satisfy the semiclassical Einstein equation,</p>
<p>$$
R_{\alpha \beta}-\frac{1}{2} R \gamma_{\alpha \beta}+\Lambda \gamma_{\alpha_{\beta}}=\left\langle T_{\alpha \beta}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>or its equivalent in 2d dilaton gravity. Instead, it satisfies the (perhaps simpler) semiclassical equation</p>
<p>$$

<p>Figure 3: Penrose diagram for the eternal AdS black hole described by (3.6). In our conventions, time increases as one goes up (down) along the right (left) asymptotic boundary.</p>
<h1>3.2 Condition for traversability</h1>
<p>To understand the conditions under which the worldsheet wormhole becomes traversable, it is convenient to use Kruskal coordinates $(u, v)$ :</p>
<p>$$
e^{2 r_{0} t}=-\frac{u}{v}, \quad \frac{r}{r_{0}}=\frac{1-u v}{1+u v}
$$</p>
<p>and parametrize the embedding as $X^{\mu}=(u, v, X(u, v))$, which corresponds to a string stretching between the two asymptotic boundaries of an eternal AdS black hole. Considering a static solution $X(u, v)=0$, the worldsheet metric can be written as</p>
<p>$$
d s_{\mathrm{ws}}^{2}=-\frac{4 d u d v}{(1+u v)^{2}}
$$</p>
<p>The corresponding Penrose diagram is shown in Fig. 3.
We note that a null ray originating from the left asymptotic boundary and moving along the $v=0$ horizon reaches the future singularity, never crossing to the right exterior region. One might wonder whether fluctuations of the geometry (3.6) induced by string fluctuations can lead to a traversable wormhole. To analyze this, we start by parameterizing the string worldsheet with null coordinates $(u, v)$ and consider perturbations $\delta x(u, v)=\phi(u, v)$ around the static solution. In this case, the worldsheet metric (3.6) becomes</p>
<p>$$
d s^{2}=-\frac{4 d u d v}{(1+u v)^{2}}+\bar{\gamma}_{\alpha \beta} d x^{\alpha} d x^{\beta}
$$</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>$$
\bar{\gamma}<em x="x">{\alpha \beta}=g</em> \phi\right\rangle
$$}\left\langle\partial_{\alpha} \phi \partial_{\beta</p>
<p>Next, we consider a perturbation moving in the $v$ direction and take $\phi(u, v)=F(u)$, where $F(u)$ is assumed to vanish outside a window around $u=u_{0}$. It is easy to check that only $\bar{\gamma}_{u u}$</p>
<p>is non-zero, and is given by</p>
<p>$$
\bar{\gamma}_{u u}=\left(\frac{1-u v}{1+u v}\right)^{2} F^{\prime}(u)^{2}
$$</p>
<p>We can now determine how the above perturbation changes the trajectory of a null ray originating from the left asymptotic boundary and moving along the $v=0$ horizon. Let $u$ be the affine parameter along this ray. Along the trajectory of the ray, we have</p>
<p>$$
\left[-\frac{4 d u d v}{(1+u v)^{2}}+\left(\frac{1-u v}{1+u v}\right)^{2} F^{\prime}(u)^{2} d u^{2}\right]_{v=0}=0
$$</p>
<p>which implies</p>
<p>$$
d v=\frac{F^{\prime}(u)^{2}}{4} d u
$$</p>
<p>By integrating (3.11), we find that the null shift that the ray suffers as it crosses the perturbation at $u=u_{0}$ is given by</p>
<p>$$
\Delta v(u)=\frac{1}{4} \int_{-\infty}^{u} F^{\prime}(u)^{2} d u
$$</p>
<p>Note that $\Delta v$ may be related to the energy of the perturbation, which is given by [56]</p>
<p>$$
\Delta E=2 \int d u F^{\prime}(u)^{2}
$$</p>
<p>Therefore</p>
<p>$$
\Delta v=\frac{\Delta E}{8}
$$</p>
<p>The worldsheet wormhole becomes traversable if $\Delta v&lt;0$, which implies $\Delta E&lt;0$, i.e., the traversability requires the presence of a perturbation with negative energy. Of course, negative energy is forbidden for classical perturbations and so are worldsheet traversable wormholes [11]. This condition is analogous to the so-called Average Null Energy Condition (ANEC), which needs to be overcome for wormhole traversability to be possible. In the next subsection, we will see that quantum effects in the worldsheet, together with the double trace coupling (3.2), may indeed lead to a configuration where traversability is allowed.</p>
<h1>3.3 Wormhole opening</h1>
<p>Inspired by [21], we now compute the opening of the wormhole using a point-splitting technique. We start with the semiclassical equation</p>
<p>$$
\gamma_{\alpha_{\beta}}=g_{\mu \nu}\left\langle\partial_{\alpha} X^{\mu} \partial_{\beta} X^{\nu}\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>and its fluctuation version (3.8), from which we can obtain the opening of the wormhole as</p>
<p>$$
\Delta v(u)=-\frac{1}{2 \gamma_{u v}(0)} \int_{-\infty}^{u} \bar{\gamma}_{u u} d u
$$</p>
<p><img alt="img-3.jpeg" src="img-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: The non-local coupling between $V_{L}$ and $V_{R}$ introduces a negative-energy shock wave in the bulk that makes the wormhole traversable. The traversability can be diagnosed by a two-sided correlation function involving $W_{L}$ and $W_{R}$.</p>
<p>In the point splitting method, we can compute the metric perturbation (3.6) as</p>
<p>$$
\bar{\gamma}<em _sigma_prime="\sigma^{\prime">{\alpha \beta}=\lim </em>\right)
$$} \rightarrow \sigma} \partial_{\alpha} \partial_{\beta}^{\prime} G\left(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime</p>
<p>where $\sigma=(u, v)$ and $\sigma^{\prime}=\left(u^{\prime}, v^{\prime}\right)$ denote worldsheet points, and $G\left(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}\right)$ is a renormalized two-point function under the presence of a Hamiltonian deformation $\delta H(t)$ :</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
G\left(u, v ; u^{\prime}, v^{\prime}\right) &amp; =g_{x x}\left\langle\phi_{H}(u, v) \phi_{H}\left(u^{\prime}, v^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle=g_{x x}\left\langle\phi_{H}(t, r) \phi_{H}\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle \
&amp; =g_{x x}\left\langle U^{-1}\left(t, t_{0}\right) \phi_{I}(t, r) U\left(t, t_{0}\right) U^{-1}\left(t^{\prime}, t_{0}\right) \phi_{I}\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right) U\left(t^{\prime}, t_{0}\right)\right\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$</p>
<p>where $U\left(t, t_{0}\right)=\mathcal{T} e^{-i \int_{t_{0}}^{t} d t \delta H(t)}$ denotes the evolution operator in the interaction picture, while $g_{x x}=\frac{(1-u v)^{2}}{(1+u v)^{2}}$. The subscripts $H$ and $I$ in the first and second lines of (3.18) indicate a field in the Heisenberg and interaction pictures, respectively. In what follows, we will suppress the subscript $I$. Further, we will consider fields in the right exterior region of the geometry.</p>
<p>We are interested in the $u u$ component of the worldsheet metric, which only involves derivatives of $G\left(u, v ; u^{\prime}, v^{\prime}\right)$ with respect to $u$ and $u^{\prime}$. This leads to the following simplification</p>
<p>$$
\bar{\gamma}<em _left_u_prime="\left(u^{\prime">{u u}=\lim </em>\right)=\lim }, v^{\prime}\right) \rightarrow(u, v)} \partial_{u} \partial_{u^{\prime}} G\left(u, v ; u^{\prime}, v^{\prime<em u="u">{u^{\prime} \rightarrow u} \partial</em>, v\right)
$$} \partial_{u^{\prime}} G\left(u, v ; u^{\prime</p>
<p>Moreover, we only focus on $\bar{\gamma}_{u u}$ on the horizon $v=0$, which leads to</p>
<p>$$
\bar{\gamma}<em u_prime="u^{\prime">{u u}=\lim </em>, 0\right)
$$} \rightarrow u} \partial_{u} \partial_{u^{\prime}} G\left(u, 0 ; u^{\prime</p>
<p>Therefore, we only need to care about $G\left(u, 0 ; u^{\prime}, 0\right)$. Note that, by taking $v=v^{\prime}=0$ in (3.18) we obtain</p>
<p>$$
G\left(u, 0 ; u^{\prime}, 0\right)=\left\langle U^{-1} \phi(u, 0) U U^{-1} \phi\left(u^{\prime}, 0\right) U\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>We now compute $G\left(u, 0 ; u^{\prime}, 0\right)$ at first order in perturbation theory. We perform an expansion for small $h$ and write the two-point function $G\left(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}\right)$ as</p>
<p>$$
G\left(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}\right)=G_{0}\left(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}\right)+G_{h}\left(\sigma, \sigma^{\prime}\right) h+\cdots
$$</p>
<p>where $G_{0}$ is the unperturbed two-point function, while $G_{h}$ corresponds to the first correction induced by the deformation $\delta H$. Using (3.18), we can see that</p>
<p>$$
G_{h}=-i \int_{t_{0}}^{t} d t_{1}\left\langle\left[\phi(t, r), \delta H\left(t_{1}\right)\right] \phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle-i \int_{t_{0}}^{t^{\prime}} d t_{1}\langle\phi(t, r)\left[\phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right), \delta H\left(t_{1}\right)\right]\rangle
$$</p>
<p>Now we need to specify the deformation $\delta H$. We are going to consider two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case I:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\delta H(t)=h(t) \phi_{L}(-t) \phi_{R}(t) \text { with } h(t)=h\left(\frac{2 \pi}{\beta}\right)^{1-2 \Delta} \theta\left(\frac{2 \pi}{\beta}\left(t-t_{0}\right)\right)
$$</p>
<p>and</p>
<ul>
<li>Case II:</li>
</ul>
<p>$$
\delta H(t)=h(t) \dot{\phi}<em R="R">{L}(-t) \dot{\phi}</em>\right)\right)
$$}(t) \text { with } h(t)=h\left(\frac{2 \pi}{\beta}\right)^{-1-2 \Delta} \theta\left(\frac{2 \pi}{\beta}\left(t-t_{0</p>
<p>where $\beta=\frac{2 \pi \ell^{2}}{r_{0}}$ is the inverse temperature. The scaling factors $\left(\frac{2 \pi}{\beta}\right)^{1-2 \Delta}$ and $\left(\frac{2 \pi}{\beta}\right)^{-1-2 \Delta}$ are introduced here for convenience, to make $h$ dimensionless.</p>
<p>In the remaining of this section, we will set $r_{0}=\ell=1$ to lighten the notation, but they could be easily restored. The results for general values of $r_{0}$ can be found in Sec. 3.4. Further, we point out that the effects of the coupling I have been studied and reported in previous literature, originally in [21] for $d=2$ and in [40] for arbitrary $d$ (our case corresponds to $d=1$ ). We include the analysis of this coupling here for completeness.</p>
<p>Case I: $\delta H(t)=h(t) \phi_{L}(-t) \phi_{R}(t)$
In this case, we obtain ${ }^{6}$</p>
<p>$$

i G_{h}= &amp; \int_{t_{0}}^{t} d t_{1} h\left(t_{1}\right)\left\langle\left[\phi(t, r), \phi_{L}\left(-t_{1}\right) \phi_{R}\left(t_{1}\right)\right] \phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle+ \
&amp; +\int_{t_{0}}^{t^{\prime}} d t_{1} h\left(t_{1}\right)\left\langle\phi(t, r)\left[\phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right), \phi_{L}\left(-t_{1}\right) \phi_{R}\left(t_{1}\right)\right]\right\rangle

<p><sup id="fnref6:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Factorizing the above four-point functions in terms of a product of two-point functions and using causality, we can write</p>

G_{h}=-i \int_{t_{0}}^{t} d t_{1} h\left(t_{1}\right)\left\langle\phi\left(t^{\prime}, r^{\prime}\right) \phi_{L}\left(-t_{1}\right)\right\rangle\left\langle\left[\phi(t, r), \phi_{R}\left(t_{1}\right)\right]\right\rangle+\left(t \leftrightarrow t^{\prime}\right)
$$</p>
<p>Note this expression is not invariant under $L \leftrightarrow R$ because there are two operator insertions on the left boundary. Next, we use the KMS condition [68]:</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle\mathcal{O}<em L="L">{R}(t) \mathcal{O}</em>}\left(t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle_{\mathrm{TFD}}=\left\langle\mathcal{O<em R="R">{R}(t) \mathcal{O}</em>
$$}\left(t^{\prime}+i \beta / 2\right)\right\rangle_{\mathrm{TFD}</p>

\begin{aligned}
K\left(t-t^{\prime}, r\right) &amp; \equiv\left\langle\phi(t, r) \phi\left(t^{\prime}, \infty\right)\right\rangle \
K^{r}\left(t-t^{\prime}, r\right) &amp; =\left|K\left(t-t^{\prime}, r\right)\right| \theta(t) \theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{r^{2}-r_{0}^{2}}}{r_{0}} \cosh \left(t-t^{\prime}\right)-\frac{r}{r_{0}}\right)

$$</p>
<p>denote the Wightman bulk-to-boundary propagator and the retarded bulk-to-boundary propagator, respectively. In AdS-Rindler coordinates $(t, r)$, the bulk-to-boundary propagator for a scalar field dual to an operator of dimension $\Delta$ is</p>
<p>$$
K_{\Delta}(t, r)=c_{\Delta}\left[-\frac{\sqrt{r^{2}-r_{0}^{2}}}{r_{0}} \cosh \left(t-t^{\prime}\right)+\frac{r}{r_{0}}\right]^{-\Delta}
$$</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>$$
c_{\Delta}=\frac{\Gamma(\Delta)}{2^{\Delta+1} \pi^{1 / 2} \Gamma(\Delta+1 / 2)}
$$</p>
<p>For convenience, we will do the calculations for a generic scalar field of dimension $\Delta$ and we will set $\Delta=1$ at the end of our calculations. Furthermore, it is more convenient to use Kruskal coordinates $(u, v)$, in which terms the propagator becomes</p>
<p>$$
K_{\Delta}\left(u, v ; u_{1}\right)=c_{\Delta}\left[\frac{1+u v}{v u_{1}-\frac{u}{u_{1}}+1-u v}\right]^{\Delta}
$$</p>
<p>Thus, evaluated at $v=0$ in Kruskal coordinates, $G_{h}$ becomes</p>
<p>$$
G_{h}\left(u, u^{\prime}\right)=2 \ell_{s}^{2} \sin (\pi \Delta) c_{\Delta}^{2} \int \frac{d u_{1}}{u_{1}} h\left(u_{1}\right) \frac{\theta\left(\frac{u}{u_{1}}-1\right)}{\left(\frac{u}{u_{1}}-1\right)^{\Delta}} \frac{1}{\left(u_{1} u^{\prime}+1\right)^{\Delta}}+\left(u \leftrightarrow u^{\prime}\right) \equiv H\left(u, u^{\prime}\right)+H\left(u^{\prime}, u\right)
$$</p>
<p>where $u_{1}=e^{r_{0} t_{1}}$. Importantly, the above bulk-to-boundary propagators are appropriate for fluctuations with a canonical kinetic term, which is the case if we rescale the fluctuations as $\phi \rightarrow \ell_{s} \phi$ as in (2.11). This rescaling introduces a factor of $\ell_{s}^{2}$ in $G_{h}$.</p>

\end{aligned}

\Delta v^{\text {inst }}=-u_{0} \partial_{u_{0}} \Delta v=2 \pi h \ell_{s}^{2} \frac{\Delta(\Delta+1) \Gamma(2 \Delta) c_{\Delta}^{2}}{\Gamma(\Delta)^{2}} \frac{u_{0}^{2 \Delta+1}}{\left(1+u_{0}^{2}\right)^{2 \Delta+3}}\left[\Delta-2(\Delta+1) u_{0}^{2}+\Delta u_{0}^{4}\right]
$$</p>
<p>Interestingly, the above result for case II can be obtained from the case I result as follows. First, we consider a slightly more general type I deformation: $\delta H_{I}=h \phi_{L}\left(t_{L}\right) \phi_{R}\left(t_{R}\right)$. Following Sec. 2.2 of [40], we can see that the wormhole opening in this boosted frame reads: ${ }^{8}$</p>
<p>$$
\Delta v_{I}\left(t_{L}, t_{R}\right)=\frac{\pi c_{\Delta}^{2} \Gamma(2 \Delta+1)}{2^{2+4 \Delta} \Gamma(\Delta)^{2}} \exp \left(-\frac{\pi}{\beta}\left(t_{L}+t_{R}\right)\right)\left[\frac{1}{2} \cosh \left(\frac{\pi}{\beta}\left(t_{R}-t_{L}\right)\right)\right]^{-2 \Delta-1}

<p>Figure 5: $\Delta v$ versus $u_{0}=e^{t_{0}}$ for the cases I (blue curves) and II (red curves). Here, we set $h=\ell_{s}^{2}=1$. We fix $\Delta=1$ because the double trace deformation involves a massless $\phi$, which is dual to a dimension one operator. The left panel shows the result for $h(t)=h \theta\left(t-t_{0}\right)$, while the right panel shows the result for $h(t)=h \delta\left(t-t_{0}\right)$.
where we have considered that both fields $\phi_{L}$ and $\phi_{L}$ have dimension $\Delta$. Repeating the same calculation for slightly more general type II perturbations of the form $\delta H_{I I}=h \bar{\phi}<em L="L">{L}\left(t</em>}\right) \bar{\phi<em R="R">{R}\left(t</em>\right)$, it is easy to see that}\right)=$ $h \partial_{t_{L}} \partial_{t_{R}} \phi_{L}\left(t_{L}\right) \phi_{R}\left(t_{R</p>
<p>$$
\Delta v_{I I}\left(t_{L}, t_{R}\right)=\partial_{t_{L}} \partial_{t_{R}} \Delta v_{I}\left(t_{L}, t_{R}, \Delta\right)
$$</p>
<p>Similarly, we can check that (3.64) can be obtained as $\left.\partial_{t_{L}} \partial_{t_{R}} \Delta v_{I}\left(t_{L}, t_{R}, \Delta\right)\right|<em R="R">{t</em>$.}=t_{0}, t_{L}=-t_{0}}$ and using that $u_{0}=e^{r_{0} t_{0}</p>
<p>In Fig. 5, we set $\Delta=1$ and plot $\Delta v$ as a function of $u_{0}$ for type I and type II deformations. The left panel shows the result for a deformation that is turned on at $t_{0}$ and remains turned on forever. The right panel shows the result for an instantaneous perturbation. While in case I $\Delta v$ is negative for any $u_{0}$, in case II $\Delta v$ is only negative inside some interval $u_{0} \in\left(u_{1}, u_{2}\right)$. In both cases, traversability for an instantaneous perturbation is optimal for $u_{0}=1$, which corresponds to $t_{0}=0$.</p>
<h1>3.4 Two-sided commutator</h1>
<p>In this section, we will diagnose traversability by sending a signal through the wormhole. The signal is produced by some generic boundary operator $W$, which is dual to a bulk field $\phi_{W}$. Under certain conditions, the $W$-quanta traverses the wormhole, producing a non-zero two-sided correlator of the form</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle\left[W_{L}\left(t_{L}\right), e^{-i \mathcal{V}} W_{R}\left(t_{R}\right) e^{i \mathcal{V}}\right]\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>where, for the two cases we consider, the double trace deformation is given by</p>
<p>$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{V}<em i="1">{\mathrm{I}} &amp; =\frac{1}{K} \sum</em>(t) \

\end{aligned}
$$}^{i</p>
<p>and $V^{i}$ are boundary operators. We use $K$ different fields because the large- $K$ limit leads to simplifications, e.g., it suppresses particle creation in the worldsheet and enhances the effects of the coupling. ${ }^{9}$ The function $h(t)$ specifies the profile of the deformation. For example, for an instantaneous perturbation that is turned on at time $t=t_{0}$, we use $h(t)=h \delta\left(t-t_{0}\right)$. The Gao-Jafferis-Wall setup is obtained when we use a Heaviside step function, i.e., $h(t)=h \theta\left(t-t_{0}\right)$.</p>
<p>Taking $W$ and $V^{i}$ as Hermitian operators, we can write</p>
<p>$$
\left\langle\left[W_{L}\left(t_{L}\right), e^{-i \mathcal{V}} W_{R}\left(t_{R}\right) e^{i \mathcal{V}}\right]\right\rangle=-2 i \operatorname{Im} C
$$</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>$$
C=\left\langle e^{-i \mathcal{V}} W_{R}\left(t_{R}\right) e^{i \mathcal{V}} W_{L}\left(t_{L}\right)\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>In the large- $K$ and small- $\ell_{s}$ limit, we can write [23]</p>
<p>$$
C=e^{-i\langle\mathcal{V}\rangle} \tilde{C}, \quad \tilde{C}=\left\langle W_{R}\left(t_{R}\right) e^{-i \mathcal{V}} W_{L}\left(t_{L}\right)\right\rangle
$$</p>
<p>In the following, we will consider the two cases separately.</p>
<h1>Case I:</h1>
<p>Let us start by considering a deformation of case I. Using the eikonal approximation, we can write $\tilde{C}$ as</p>
<p>$$
\tilde{C}=\alpha \int d p^{u} p^{u} \psi_{2}^{*}\left(p^{u}\right) \psi_{3}\left(p^{u}\right) e^{i D}

<p>${ }^{9}$ A concrete suggestion was given in [23] (see Appendix C.2. for details). In detail, the idea was to put $K$ strings at the north pole of the $S^{3}$ and $K$ oppositely oriented strings at the south pole of $S^{3}$. This is a BPS configuration, related to $1 / 2$ BPS Wilson loops, so it is stable. In general, it is actually rather non-trivial to find microscopic realizations of large $K$ as these typically involve multiple objects with an emergent $U(K)$ gauge symmetry while the non-local deformation is not gauge invariant under this $U(K)$ gauge group.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref2:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref3:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref4:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref5:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref6:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref7:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref8:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a><a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref9:0" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
