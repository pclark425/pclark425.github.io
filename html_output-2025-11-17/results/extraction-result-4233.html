                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi‐Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Abstract A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large‐scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi‐agent systems with in‐situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up‐to‐date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a “swarm of intelligence” similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy‐efficient production is shown.</p>

Prompting strategies include role-based system messages, iterative expansion prompts per JSON field, adversarial critic prompts, and memory-sharing vs. filtered-history modes across agents.

Prompting strategies include role-based system messages, iterative expansion prompts per JSON field, adversarial critic prompts, and memory-sharing vs. filtered-history modes across agents.

A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data.In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities.Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods.The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties.By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations.This is achieved by harnessing a "swarm of intelligence" similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery.How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy-efficient production is shown.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>One of the grand challenges in the evolving landscape of scientific discovery is finding ways to model, understand, and utilize information mined from diverse sources as a foundation for further research progress and new science discovery.Traditionally, this has been the domain of human researchers who review background knowledge, draft hypotheses, assess and test these hypotheses through various methods (in silico or in vitro), and refine them based on their findings.While these conventional approaches have led to breakthroughs throughout the history of science, they are constrained by the researcher's ingenuity and background knowledge, potentially limiting discovery to the bounds of human imagination.Additionally, conventional human-driven methods are inadequate for exploring the vast amount of existing scientific data to extrapolate knowledge toward entirely novel ideas specially for multi-disciplinary areas like bio-inspired materials design where a common goal is to extract principles from Nature's toolbox and bring it to bear towards engineering applications.</p>
<p>22][23][24][25][26][27] Despite their successes, significant challenges persist regarding their ability to achieve the level of expertise possessed by domain specialists without extensive specialized training.Common issues include their tendency to produce inaccurate responses when dealing with questions that fall outside their initial training scope, and broader concerns about accountability, explainability, and transparency.These problems underscore the potential risks associated with the generation of misleading or even harmful content, requiring us to think about strategies that increase their problem-solving and reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>In response to these challenges, in-context learning emerges as a compelling strategy to enhance the performance of LLMs without the need for costly and time-intensive fine-tuning.This approach exploits the model's inherent ability to adapt its responses based on the context embedded within the prompt, which can be derived from a variety of sources.30] The potential to construct powerful generative AI models that integrate external knowledge to provide context and elicit more precise responses during generation is substantial. [31]The central challenge is to develop robust mechanisms for the accurate retrieval and integration of relevant knowledge that enables LLMs to interpret and synthesize information pertinent to specific tasks, particularly in the realm of scientific discovery.</p>
<p>The construction of knowledge bases and the strategic retrieval of information from them are gaining traction as effective methods to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs.][34][35] These knowledge graphs not only provide a mechanistic breakdown of information but also offer an ontological framework that elucidates the interconnectedness of different concepts, delineated as nodes and edges within the graph.</p>
<p>While single-LLM-based agents can generate more accurate responses when enhanced with well-designed prompts and context, they often fall short for the complex demands of scientific discovery.Creating new scientific insights involves a series of steps, deep thinking, and the integration of diverse, sometimes conflicting information, making it a challenging task for a single agent.To overcome these limitations and fully leverage AI in automating scientific discovery, it's essential to employ a team of specialized agents.][38][39] This collaborative approach allows the system to handle the intricacies of scientific discovery more effectively, potentially leading to breakthroughs that are difficult to achieve by single agents alone.</p>
<p>Building on these insights, our study introduces a method that synergizes the strengths of ontological knowledge graphs [40,41] with the dynamic capabilities of LLM-based multi-agent systems, setting a robust foundation for enhancing graph reasoning and automating the scientific discovery process.Within this generative framework, the discovery workflow is systematically broken down into more manageable subtasks.Each agent in the system is assigned a distinct role, optimized through complex prompting strategies to ensure that every subtask is tackled with targeted expertise and precision.This strategic division of labor allows the AI system to proficiently manage the complexities of scientific research, fostering effective collaboration among agents.This collaboration is crucial for generating, refining, and crit-ically evaluating new hypotheses against essential criteria like novelty and feasibility.</p>
<p>Central to our hypothesis generation is the utilization of a large ontological knowledge graph, focusing on biological materials, and developed from around 1000 scientific papers in this domain. [6]We implemented a novel sampling strategy to extract relevant sub-graphs from this comprehensive knowledge graph, allowing us to identify and understand the key concepts and their interrelationships.This rich, contextually informed backdrop is crucial for guiding the agents in generating well-informed and innovative hypotheses.Such a method not only improves the accuracy of hypothesis generation but also ensures that these hypotheses are solidly rooted in a comprehensive knowledge framework.This structured approach promises to enhance the impact and relevance of scientific discoveries by ensuring they are wellinformed and methodologically sound.</p>
<p>The plan of the paper is as follows.In Section 2, we discuss our proposed LLM-powered multi-agent system for automated scientific discovery, outlining its main components and constitutive agents.Two approaches are discussed and compared: One based on pre-programmed AI-AI interactions, and another one utilizing a fully automated framework in which a set of agents self-organize to solve problems.Several examples are provided to illustrate the different aspects of our approach, from path generation to research hypothesis generation and critique, demonstrating the system's potential to explore novel scientific concepts and produce innovative ideas by synthesizing an iterative prompting strategy during which multiple LLMs work together.Section 3 then presents the key findings and discussing the implications of our multi-agent system for future research in scientific discovery.</p>
<p>Results and Discussion</p>
<p>LLMs have demonstrated a relatively high level of proficiency across a wide range of tasks, including question answering, hypothesis development, summarizing and contrasting ideas, processing complex information, executing tasks, and even writing code.However, conventional inference strategies often fail to produce sophisticated reasoning and detail in the generated data.By using a set of interacting models, and assigning distinct roles to LLM-based agents, effective multi-agent AI systems can be constructed.When combined with carefully crafted prompts and incontext learning from graph representation of data, these systems are capable of generating scientific ideas and hypotheses.We now present results from a several experiments we conducted with our proposed framework (details about implementation, see Experimental Section).</p>
<p>Multi-Agent System for Graph Reasoning and Scientific Discovery</p>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates the outline of our proposed multi-agent model designed to automate the scientific discovery process based on the key concepts and relationships retrieved from a comprehensive knowledge graph developed from scientific papers (Figure 1a).This figure further showcases two distinct strategies Each agent plays a specialized role: The Ontologist defines key concepts and relationships, Scientist 1 crafts a detailed research proposal, Scientist 2 expands and refines the proposal, and the Critic agent conducts a thorough review and suggests improvements.The Planner in the second approach develops a detailed plan and the assistant is instructed to check the novelty of the generated research hypotheses.This collaborative framework enables the generation of innovative and well-rounded scientific hypotheses that extend beyond conventional human-driven methods.</p>
<p>deployed in this study for generating novel scientific hypotheses, both of which harness the collective intelligence of a team of agents.These strategies integrate the specialized capabilities of each agent, systematically exploring uncharted research territories to produce innovative and high-impact scientific hypotheses.The full description of the agents incorporated in SciAgents is listed in Figures S1-S4 (Supporting Information).</p>
<p>The key difference between these approaches lies in the nature of the interaction between the agents.In the first approach (Figure 1b), the interactions between agents are pre-programmed and follow a predefined sequence of tasks that ensure consistency and reliability in hypothesis generation.In contrast, the second approach features fully automated agent interactions without any predetermined order of how interactions between agents unfold, providing a more flexible and adaptive framework that can dynamically respond to the evolving context of the research process.This second strategy (Figure 1c) also incorporates humanin-the-loop interactions, enabling human intervention at various stages of research development.Such interventions allow for ex-pert feedback, refinement of hypotheses, or strategic guidance, specification about certain materials, types or features, ultimately enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated scientific ideas.Moreover, the second approach provides a more robust framework where additional tools could be readily incorporated.For instance, we have empowered our automated multi-agent model with the Semantic Scholar API as a tool that provides it with an ability to check the novelty of the generated hypothesis against the existing literature.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows an overview of the entire process from initial keyword selection to the final document.We employ a hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data, critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling, simulation and experimental tasks and adversarial prompting.The process begins with initial keyword identification or random exploration within a graph, followed by path sampling to create a subgraph of relevant concepts and relationships.This subgraph forms the basis for generating structured output in JSON following a specific Overview of the entire process from initial keyword selection to the final document, following a hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data, critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling, simulation and experimental tasks.The process begins with initial keyword identification or random exploration within a graph, followed by path sampling to create a subgraph of relevant concepts and relationships (see, Figure S1, Supporting Information, for an illustration of how the path can be sampled).This subgraph forms the basis for generating structured output in JSON, including the hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty.Each component is subsequently expanded on with individual prompting, to yield significant amount of additional detail, forming a comprehensive draft.This draft then undergoes a critical review process, including amendments for modeling and simulation priorities (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimental priorities (e.g., synthetic biology).The final integrated draft, along with critical analyses, results in a document that guides further scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>set of aspects that the model is tasked to develop.These include the hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty.The details of each component can be found in Figure S5 (Supporting Information).For instance, the "outcome" describes the expected findings or impact of the research, the "mechanisms" field discusses predicted chemical, biological, or physical interactions, while "unexpected properties" anticipates emergent behaviors from novel combinations of concepts in the graph.Each component is subsequently expanded on with individual prompting, to yield significant amount of additional detail, forming a comprehensive draft.This draft then undergoes a critical review process, including amendments for modeling and simulation priorities (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimental priorities (e.g., synthetic biology).The final integrated draft, along with critical analyses, results in a document that can guide further scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>In the following, we explore the primary components of our multi-agent strategy.For better clarity and understanding, each section is accompanied by practical examples from a sample hypothesis.This hypothesis was generated using "silk" and "energyintensive" as the starting nodes.The outcomes of this experiment are presented in Figure 3.For a more detailed illustration, see the Supplementary Information.</p>
<p>1-Path Generation: At the core of our model is an expansive knowledge graph, first introduced in Ref. [6], that encompasses the fields of bio-inspired materials and mechanics.This knowledge graph integrates a variety of concepts and knowledge domains, enabling the exploration of hypotheses that once seemed disconnected.To augment the capabilities of our underlying large language model (LLM), we provide it with a subgraph derived from this more extensive knowledge graph.This sub-graph depicts a pathway that connects two crucial concepts or nodes within the comprehensive graph.The construction of this path is crucial; Unlike in earlier work [6] where the shortest path was utilized, our study employs a random path approach.As illustrated in Figure 4, the random approach infuses the path with a richer array of concepts and relationships, enabling our agents to explore a broader spectrum of domains, as opposed to the shortest path where only a few concepts are included.This expanded exploration not only enhances the depth and breadth of insights gained but also fosters the novelty of the hypotheses generated.Initially, the two concepts can be either specified by the user or selected randomly by the model from the knowledge graph.For instance, the example below demonstrates the path generated by the model between the concepts "silk" and "energyintensive".Figure 8 shows additional knowledge graphs derived from random sampling for randomly chosen concepts to provide additional examples.We refer the reader to Figure S1 (Supporting Information) for a visualization of how path sampling can be conducted between two predetermined nodes, or randomly selected pairs of nodes.</p>

<p>The generated path provides an analytical representation of various concepts and their interconnections, which were previously unrelated.By delineating these relationships, the model gains the ability to perceive and analyze connections between concepts that have not been explicitly linked before.This innovative mapping approach enables the model to extrapolate and generate ideas that are both novel and potentially transformative, paving the way for breakthroughs in understanding and application.</p>
<p>2-Deep Insights with LLM-Based Analysis: Utilizing our LLMpowered ontologist agent, we move deeper into the intricacies of the relationships that have been mapped out in the earlier path generation stage.By examining the connections and nuances among the identified concepts, the agent helps transition from static knowledge retrieval to dynamic knowledge generation.This crucial shift is what enables the model to identify gaps in existing research and propose new angles of inquiry, thereby laying the groundwork for novel ideas and hypotheses.In this context, the role of the ontologist agent is instrumental.It applies advanced reasoning and inference techniques to synthesize and interpret the complex web of data.This capability allows it to extract significant insights that might not be obvious at first glance, offering a richer, more detailed understanding of the relationships.</p>
<p>As an example, here are some of the insights into the relationships as identified by the ontologist for the aforementioned path, demonstrating how our approach not only maps out but also meaningfully interprets complex datasets to generate scientific hypotheses.</p>
<p>-<strong>Silk -possess -biopolymers</strong>: Silk is a type of biopolymer, a natural polymer produced by living organisms.</p>
<p>-<strong>Biopolymers -possess -silk</strong>: This reiterates that silk is a biopolymer.-<strong>Silk -can be spun into -membranes</strong>: Silk can be processed and spun into thin layers or sheets known as membranes.</p>
<p>-<strong>Membranes -can be spun into -silk</strong>: This indicates the reverse process, where membranes can be derived from silk.</p>
<p>-<strong>Silk -broad applicability in biomaterial design -multifunctionality</strong>: Silk's multifunctional properties make it highly applicable in the design of biomaterials.</p>
<p>-<strong>High adhesion -include -multifunctionality</strong>: This indicates that high adhesion is part of the multifunctional nature of silk.</p>
<p>-<strong>Structural coloration -exhibited by -insects</strong>: Insects, such as those that produce silk, often exhibit structural coloration.</p>
<p>-<strong>Insects -are -energy-intensive</strong>: The processes involving insects, including silk production, can be energyintensive.</p>
<p>The results demonstrate that the model has developed a reasonably refined understanding of relationships between seemingly unrelated concepts.This capability enables the model to support reasoning in scientific research and propose new research hypotheses, which will be further explored in the subsequent stage.</p>
<p>3-Research Hypothesis Generation and Expansion:</p>
<p>This stage is where the effects of our multi-agent system emerges.The scientist agent harnesses the extensive knowledge parsed from the knowledge graph and further refined by the ontologist to propose novel research ideas.Through complex prompting, as shown in Figure 5, the agent is assigned specific roles and is tasked with synthesizing a novel research proposal that integrates all key concepts from the knowledge graph.The designated agent, Scien-tist_1, is configured to deliver a detailed hypothesis that is both innovative and logically grounded, aiming to advance the understanding or application of the provided concepts.The agent creates a proposal that carefully addresses the following seven key aspects: hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty.This approach ensures a thorough exploration and evaluation of the new scientific idea, allowing for a detailed assessment of its feasibility, potential impact, and areas of innovation.</p>
<p>The proficiency of the Scientist_1 LLM agent in generating novel research hypotheses is demonstrated in Figure 3.The concept involves integrating silk with dandelion-based pigments to create biomaterials with enhanced optical and mechanical properties.The proposed enhancement in mechanical properties stems from a hierarchical organization of silk combined with the reinforcing effects of the pigments.According to the model, this proposed composite material could exhibit significantly improved mechanical strength, reaching up to 1.5 GPa compared to traditional silk materials, which range from 0.5 to 1.0 GPa.Additionally, the use of low-temperature processing and dandelion pigments is projected to reduce energy consumption by approximately 30%.This example underscores the potential of translating knowledge graphs into unprecedented material designs, facilitating a seamless transition from theoretical data to practical applications in materials science.</p>

<p>The expanded research idea provided by Scientist_2 is showcased in the Supplementary Information, revealing a thorough rationale and sequential reasoning for various aspects of the research proposal.Here are selected key points to exemplify the model's contributions:</p>

<p>At the final stage of our research development process is the Critic agent, responsible for thoroughly reviewing the research proposal, summarizing its key points, and recommending improvements.This agent delivers a comprehensive scientific critique, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of the research idea while suggesting areas for refinement.Additionally, the Critic agent is tasked to identify the most impactful scientific question that can be addressed through molecular modeling (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimentation (e.g., synthetic biology), and to outline the critical steps for setting up and conducting these molecular and experimental priorities.</p>
<p>For our model example involving the silk-pigment composite material, the full response from the Critic is detailed in the Supporting Information.It provides a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed research methodology and its potential impact.The critic agent commends the integration of silk-derived biological materials with dandelion-based pigments for creating energyefficient, structurally colored biomaterials, noting the project's interdisciplinary approach and innovative use of natural hierarchical structures to enhance mechanical and optical properties.The agent also recognizes the robustness added by the combined use of modeling techniques and experimental methods.</p>
<p>Moreover, the critic identifies areas needing improvement, including challenges with nanoscale integration, scalability, envi-ronmental impacts of solvent use, and a lack of quantitative data.Concerns about the long-term stability of the material under realworld conditions are also raised.To address these issues, the critic suggests conducting pilot studies for process validation, exploring green chemistry for pigment extraction, developing detailed scalability plans, and performing rigorous analyses of energy consumption and material durability.These suggestions aim to refine the research direction, making the hypotheses generated by the AI system not only innovative but also practical, thereby enhancing the potential for significant scientific advancements.</p>
<p>Lastly, the critic proposes the most impactful scientific questions related to molecular modeling, simulation, and synthetic biology experiments as shown in in Figure 6.</p>
<p>For each aspect, the critic agent provides detailed responses, outlining the key steps for setting up and conducting atomistic simulations and experimental work.To perform the molecular modeling and simulation, the critic describes the process of simulating the interaction and self-assembly of silk fibroin and dandelion-derived pigments using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.This begins by defining the molecular structures of silk fibroin, rich in glycine and alanine, and key pigments like luteolin and taraxanthin, sourced from protein and chemical databases.Appropriate force fields, such as CHARMM or AMBER, are selected, with parameters defined using tools like CGenFF.The system is then prepared by placing the molecules in a solvated environment, adding ions for neutralization, and using VMD or GROMACS for setup.After energy minimization and equilibration under constant temperature and pressure, MD  simulations are run for 100-500 ns, using periodic boundary conditions.Post-simulation analysis includes calculating interaction energies, identifying binding sites, and performing cluster analysis of self-assembled structures, focusing on nanoscale formations like -sheets in silk fibroin using tools like PyMOL, Chimera, and GROMACS.</p>
<p>We find that the critic agent plays a crucial role in guiding these efforts by posing probing scientific questions that challenge the assumptions and focus of the research, ensuring that the simulations and experiments target key mechanisms and outcomes.By doing so, the critic not only helps refine the research direction but also enhances the potential for discovering novel biomaterials with optimized mechanical and optical properties.This iterative feedback loop between hypothesis generation and critical evaluation strengthens the overall scientific process.</p>
<p>Autonomous Agentic Modeling</p>
<p>The experiments so far were conducted using the non-automated multi-agent system (see Figure 1), whereas the second approach described in this section uses an automated way to generate a research hypothesis from a knowledge graph that facilitates dynamic interactions.</p>
<p>The automated multi-agent system consists of a team of AI agents, each powered by a state-of-the-art general purpose large language model from the GPT-4 family, [11] accessed via the Ope-nAI API. [45]Each agent has a specific role and focus in the system which is described by a unique profile.Our team of agents with the following entities collaborate in a dynamic environment to create a research proposal:</p>
<p>• "Human": human user that poses the task and can intervene at various stages of the problem solving process.• "Planner": suggests a detailed plan to solve the task.</p>
<p>• "Ontologist": who is responsible to define the relationships and concepts within the knowledge graph.</p>
<p>• "Scientist 1": crafts the initial draft of a detailed research hypothesis with seven key items based on the definitions provided by Ontologist.• "Scientist 2": who expands and refines the different key aspects of the research proposal created by Scientist 1.</p>
<p>• "Critic": conducts a thorough review and suggests improvements.</p>
<p>• "Assistant": has access to external tools including a function to generate a knowledge path from two keywords and a function to assess the novelty and feasibility of the research idea.• "Group chat manager": chooses the next speaker based on the context and agent profiles and broadcasts the message to the whole group.</p>
<p>Despite the varied dynamics in agentic AI-AI interactions, the overall pipeline of the two proposed agent-based systems to generate research hypotheses from concepts and relationships derived from a knowledge graph is similar.As illustrated in Figure 7 the automated multi-agent collaboration starts with a plan from the planner detailing the steps required to accomplish the task posed by the human which involves creating a research hypothesis from given keywords or randomly selected by the model.Next, the assistant agent calls the appropriate function to establish a pathway which serves as the foundational knowledge graph for subsequent analysis.The ontologist agent then discusses definitions and relationships.This sets the stage for scientist_1 to generate a research idea, which is then expanded by scientist_2.The sequence concludes with a summary, critical review, and suggestions for improvement by the critic agent.Finally, the assistant agent executes another tool to analyze and score the novelty and feasibility of the proposed research idea.</p>
<p>Despite the similarity in the steps followed by the agents in each approach, the results show that while the generated hypotheses share overall concepts and methodologies, they differ in the details.For example, in the analysis of the research hypothesis highlighted earlier, both models emphasize integrating silk Figure 8. Knowledge graphs derived from random sampling for randomly chosen concepts from the global knowledge graph.Panel a: "heat transfer performance" connecting "rhamphotheca," panel b: "theoretically reversible or partially reversible" connecting "mechanical stiffness", panel c: "tunable processability" connecting "vanadium(v)," and panel d: "hexagonally packed" connecting "self-cleaning coating," and panel e: "graphene" connecting "proteins".</p>
<p>with dandelion pigments, but they differ in specifics such as their scope of application and the depth of technical aspects regarding material fabrication and potential uses.For comparison, the full document created by the automated multi-agent model using the same knowledge graph between "silk" and "energy-intensive" is provided in Section S2 (Supporting Information).</p>
<p>The difference stems from the subtle differences in how the data is propagated between the agents in the two approaches.In the first approach, during the generation process, the agents receive only a filtered subset of information from previous interactions (see Section 4.3 for more details).In contrast, the second approach allows agents to share memory, giving them access to all the content generated in previous interactions.This means they operate with full visibility of the history of their collaboration.Another difference between the two models is that the second approach benefits from the integration of a tool that assesses the novelty of the proposed research ideas against current literature, using Semantic Scholar API.This feature enables us to effectively measure the novelty of the research and proactively eliminate any ideas that are too similar to existing work.</p>
<p>To demonstrate the efficacy of the automated multi-agent model in generating novel research ideas and evaluating their novelty and feasibility, we conducted five experiments, tasking the automated multi-agent model with constructing research ideas.We summarized these hypotheses in Table 4, which includes details about each research idea, the proposed hypotheses, expected outcomes, and assessments of novelty and feasibility.These research ideas are generated based on randomly selected concepts from the knowledge graph.Figure 8 displays the generated knowledge graphs, showcasing a diverse array of concepts and relationships.Some nodes like "biomaterials," "hierarchical structure," and "mechanical properties" show high node degree and serve as central hubs, indicating their pivotal roles in interconnecting various scientific disciplines within the graph.The results highlight the diversity of the research hypotheses, which stems from both the random selection of endpoint nodes and the paths between them.Moreover, the results showcase varying levels of novelty and feasibility, as assessed against current literature, underscoring the critical role of comparing with existing knowledge.The process of exploring a variety of paths, scoring the results, and identifying the most promising directions could easily be scaled over thousands of iterations, yielding a very large ideation database.</p>
<p>Below, we provide additional details on the various aspects of the research hypotheses for a selected sample.The complete documents for the five hypotheses can be found in Sections S3-S7 (Supporting Information).</p>

<p>Figure 9.The developed by the planner agent in response to the query from the user to generate research hypothesis from random keywords, as developed by the autonomous system.The process begins with the selection of random keywords, followed by the generation of a knowledge path that links the selected terms.Each term along the path is defined by an ontologist, who also elaborates on the relationships between them.Based on these definitions, a research proposal is crafted by a designated scientist.Subsequently, various specialized agents (hypothesis, outcome, mechanism, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty agents) each expand upon their respective components of the proposal.The proposal is then critiqued by the critic_agent, who also suggests potential improvements.As the final step, the novelty and feasibility of the research proposal are assessed using a dedicated function, ensuring that the proposed ideas are both innovative and actionable.</p>
<p>(Supporting Information).The process demonstrates dynamic collaboration between the AI agents in constructing the research hypothesis.Initially, the planner proposes a comprehensive plan to accomplish the task, as shown in Figure 9.Following this, various agents execute the plan, starting with the generation of a knowledge graph, followed by the definition of key concepts and relationships by Ontologist agent.Scientist 1 then drafts the initial research proposal, which is further expanded by Scientist 2. Finally, the critic conducts a review, and the process concludes with an assessment of novelty and feasibility.The randomly selected nodes for this experiment were "heat transfer performance" and "rhamphotheca" and the generated graph consists of concepts such as "lamellar structure," "biomaterials," "microfluidic chips," "keratin scales," and "biomimetic materials."The proposed idea involves engineering the lamellar structure of biomaterials, inspired by keratin scales, into microfluidic chips using soft lithography techniques to improve their mechanical behavior and heat transfer efficiency under cyclic loading conditions.Expected outcomes of the resulting biomimetic microfluidic chips include a 20-30% increase in heat transfer efficiency compared to conventional microfluidic chips (the lamellar structure of the biomimetic materials will facilitate efficient heat dissipation), enhanced mechanical stability under cyclic loading conditions (the layered lamellar structure will provide enhanced mechanical strength and flexibility), with a failure rate reduced by 15%, and superior biocompatibility (due to the use of biocompatible materials), making them suitable for prolonged use in biomedical applications.</p>
<p>The design principles for biomimetic microfluidic chips focus on material selection, fabrication, integration, testing, biocompatibility, modeling, and optimization.Materials such as PDMS and hydrogels, which mimic the lamellar structure of keratin scales, are chosen for their biocompatibility and mechanical properties, with targeted thermal conductivity and Young's modulus ranges.Soft lithography is employed for fabrication, opti-mizing curing conditions and structural characterization.Integration with microfluidic technology enhances heat transfer and mechanical stability, with design optimization via CAD and simulations.Testing includes mechanical and heat transfer assessments, while biocompatibility is evaluated through in vitro and in vivo tests.Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations help model heat transfer and fluid flow, guiding iterative design optimization based on performance metrics like heat transfer efficiency, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility.</p>
<p>Moreover, the model predicts that the biomimetic microfluidic chips may exhibit unexpected properties, such as self-healing capabilities, adaptive heat transfer, enhanced fluid dynamics, and improved chemical resistance.These properties are primarily attributed to the lamellar structure of the material, and the rationale behind them is summarized in Table 5.</p>
<p>For the proposed research idea, the critic agent summarizes the overall research hypothesis covering the key features and highlights strengths such as the innovative integration of biomimetic materials with microfluidic technology, detailed mechanisms for performance, and potential biomedical applications.It also acknowledges the exploration of self-healing and adaptive heat transfer.However, weaknesses include the complexity of the fabrication process, a lack of preliminary data, and concerns about long-term biocompatibility.To improve, the agent recommends conducting pilot studies, assessing scalability, and performing long-term biocompatibility testing.Moreover, the critic agent suggests the most impactful scientific questions with molecular modeling (How does the lamellar structure of biomimetic materials influence the heat transfer efficiency in microfluidic chips?) and synthetic biology and provides the pertinent key steps (Can biomimetic materials with a lamellar structure be engineered to exhibit self-healing properties under mechanical stress?).These specific directions can be used as Table 5. Predicted unexpected properties for biomimetic microfluidic chips.The data summarizes the property, mechanism, and rationale.</p>
<p>Unexpected Property Mechanism Rationale</p>

<p>springboard for additional in-situ data collection; in the case of the modeling context, this can be implemented by incorporating a simulation engine, similar to what was done in recent work. [38]n the end, the assistant agent executes the tool to assess the novelty and feasibility of the proposed research idea against the literature.It then returns a detailed analysis as depicted in Figure 10 suggesting that the proposed research hypothesis has a high degree of novelty and a reasonable level of feasibility.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We introduced a multi-agent AI framework designed to autonomously generate and refine research hypotheses by leveraging LLMs and a comprehensive ontological knowledge graph 1, applied here in the context of biologically inspired materials.Our results demonstrate the significant potential of integrating AI agents with specialized roles to tackle the complex and interdisciplinary nature of scientific discovery, particularly in the domain of bio-inspired materials.The automated system effectively navigated the intricate web of relationships within the knowledge graph, generating diverse and novel hypotheses that align with unmet research needs.The proposed approach, harnessing a modular, hierarchically organized (Figure 2) swarm of intelligence (Figure 1) similar to biological systems with multiple iterations to model the process of negotiation a solution during the process of thinking and reflecting about a problem, offers a much more nuanced reasoning approach than conventional zero-shot answers generated by AI systems, as shown in Figure 11.</p>
<p>The ontological knowledge graph representation of data plays a crucial role in our approach, as it serves as the foundational Figure 10.The results of the novelty and feasibility analysis as performed by the assistant agent for the "Biomimetic Microfluidic Chips" hypothesis, based on data collected using the Semantic Scholar API.As the analysis shows, the approach is considered unique due to its lack of direct matches in existing literature.Feasibility is evaluated based on the plausibility of implementing these structures using soft lithography, though challenges in mechanical behavior and heat transfer efficiency under cyclic loading were identified as potential hurdles requiring experimental validation.structure that guides the research idea generation, ensuring that the hypotheses proposed by the AI agents are both informed by and rooted in a vast network of interconnected scientific concepts.By systematically navigating this graph, our multi-agent system identifies and capitalizes on previously unrecognized relationships, aiming towards the creation of highly-rated innovative ideas that are as feasible as they are groundbreaking.The incorporation of assessment strategies is an important strategic aspect that reflects adversarial relationships commonly identified in conventional research strategies, such as team-based efforts or peer-review.A notable feature was the finding that the autonomous multi-agent system can develop sophisticated problem solving strategies (see, Figure 7) on its own.These types of results are expected to improve as more powerful foundation models become available, especially with better long-term planning and reasoning capabilities.</p>
<p>The multi-agent approach proved particularly effective in decomposing the scientific discovery process into manageable subtasks, enabling a more systematic exploration of the knowledge landscape.By assigning distinct roles to each agent-ranging from path generation and deep analysis to hypothesis formulation and critical review, we achieved a thorough and rigorous development of research ideas.Our experiments showed that the system could consistently produce hypotheses with high novelty and feasibility, supported by contextually enriched data and iterative feedback mechanisms that mirrored traditional scientific methodologies.The incorporation of specific priority modeling and simulation tasks, for instance, offers direct pathways to incorporate additional mechanisms to solicit new physics-based data (e.g., by running Density Functional Theory models, molecular dynamics, finite element/difference solvers, etc.). [38,39]As such, the approach presented here offers significant potential in not only developing research questions but also expanding the set of first-principles sourced data.If deployed at scale, this can aid our quest to generate large materials-focused datasets strategically expanding beyond what is currently know.Based on the execution efficacy, it is possible to generate thousands or tens of thousands of individual results within days, which if filtered by a set of criteria (e.g., novelty, feasibility, or how well it meets a target) can gener-ate a high-efficacy innovation framework for generative materials informatics.</p>
<p>One of the key contributions of this study is the demonstration of how AI-driven agents can autonomously generate, critique, and refine scientific hypotheses, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional research approaches.The integration of tools to assess novelty against existing literature further strengthens the validity of the generated hypotheses, ensuring that the system not only produces innovative ideas but also eliminates redundancies with prior research.This capability positions the system as a powerful tool for accelerating discovery and fostering cross-disciplinary innovation.</p>
<p>In fields such as biological materials analysis, identifying common mechanisms that hold for a variety of systems and that can be applied to solve challenging engineering problems, remains a major challenge.This work underscores the potential of generative AI in potentially scaling the scientific process, opening new avenues for exploration and discovery across various fields of study.As we can automate, and hence accelerate the generation of research ideas, this multi-agent system paves the way for a future where AI could then contribute as an integral player in shaping the direction and pace of scientific advancement.</p>
<p>While SciAgents demonstrates substantial promise in generating novel research ideas, questions remain regarding the feasibility of certain proposals.In this study, we have taken initial steps to address these limitations by incorporating additional layers of support.Specifically, AI agents refined proposals through iterative feedback loops, enriching the context to better align with established methodologies.Additionally, we evaluated the novelty of research ideas by using Semantic Scholar API calls to compare generated concepts against existing knowledge, providing an initial metric for assessing uniqueness and relevance.However, ensuring the robustness of these ideas will require further exploration.The flexibility of the multi-agent system supports continuous refinement and adaptation, which can improve both feasibility and applicability over time.For instance, integrating dynamic collaboration between AI and human experts-particularly experimentalists-could significantly strengthen the feasibility of research ideas.Though not fully explored in this work, this AIhuman collaboration remains an exciting avenue for future research.Additionally, ongoing advancements in large language models are anticipated to enhance both the novelty and feasibility of generated ideas, and these improvements can be seamlessly integrated into the SciAgents framework to keep pace with technological progress.For instance, we have included an example of a research idea developed by SciAgents using the o1-preview model in Section S8 (Supporting Information), demonstrating higher reasoning capabilities and more impactful results compared to GPT-4.</p>
<p>SciAgents, in its current form, excels at generating innovative research ideas in biologically inspired materials, offering valuable starting points for materials scientists, experimentalists, and biologists to explore further.These ideas provide promising directions for interdisciplinary research, serving as a foundation for new scientific insights and collaborations.To further expand the system's impact, future work could focus on implementing mechanisms for validating research hypotheses.One direction could involve adding agents capable of performing computational simulations or extracting insights from experimental data, directly addressing the need for robust hypothesis validation.Furthermore, establishing clear metrics-such as efficiency and accuracy-alongside a collaborative evaluation framework involving human experts would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of SciAgents' effectiveness and applicability (similar to Ref. [27], where human experts were involved in evaluating NLP-related research ideas).The system's modular, human-in-the-loop design provides the flexibility to incorporate these enhancements, allowing for the seamless integration of validation processes and expert feedback.Through these advancements, SciAgents could evolve into an increasingly robust tool that not only generates but rigorously evaluates ideas, driving research toward impactful real-world applications.We leave these exciting developments as directions for future work.</p>
<p>With the integration of pertinent contextual data and domainspecific knowledge graphs, SciAgents has the potential to be adapted for a range of scientific domains and subfields, including chemistry, metallic alloys, semiconductors, and physics.A possible future development could involve a universal knowledge graph, connecting concepts across all scientific domains.Such an integration would allow SciAgents to bridge ideas between fields, fostering interdisciplinary research and accelerating innovation by uncovering insights that span multiple scientific disciplines.This could be further strengthened by integrating fine-tuned LLMs for different fields or newly developed models (e.g., o1-preview), enabling more specialized reasoning across diverse areas and enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated insights.Additionally, collaboration with human experts would provide critical oversight, ensuring that AI-generated ideas are grounded in real-world applicability and guiding the research toward practical solutions.Hence, we believe that the framework presented here offers a blueprint for next-generation of AI-driven research tools, capable of synthesizing vast amounts of data into actionable insights, ultimately leading to breakthroughs that might otherwise remain undiscovered.</p>
<p>Experimental Section</p>
<p>Ontological Knowledge Graph: A large graph generated as part of earlier work [6] was used in this research.The graph utilized here includes 33 159 nodes and 48 753 edges and represents the giant component of the graph generated from around 1000 papers with 92 communities.The BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 embedding model was used.</p>
<p>Heuristic Pathfinding Algorithm with Random Waypoints: The algorithm presented in this work combines heuristic-based pathfinding with node embeddings and randomized waypoints to discover diverse paths in a graph.The primary goal is to find a path between a source and a target node by estimating distances using node embeddings.The embeddings are generated using a pre-trained model and are crucial for the heuristic function, which estimates the distance between the current node and the target node.By relying on these embeddings, the algorithm adapts to the topological structure of the graph, allowing it to effectively traverse complex networks.Additionally, the algorithm uses a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that introduces a randomness factor to the priority queue, creating paths that are not strictly deterministic. [46]The randomness factor was chosen to be 0.2 in the experiments.</p>
<p>An additional feature of the algorithm is the introduction of random waypoints to diversify the pathfinding process.These waypoints are selected from neighboring nodes that are not part of the initial path, enabling the algorithm to explore alternative routes.The randomization factor controls the balance between heuristic-driven search and stochastic exploration, making it flexible for different use cases.After the path is found, a subgraph consisting of the path nodes and their second-hop neighbors is generated, providing a broader context for the discovered route.The resulting paths are then used as substrate for graph reasoning.</p>
<p>The overall approach is as follows:</p>
<p>Heuristic Pathfinding with Randomization and Waypoints Input: (a) Use Dijkstra's algorithm, adding a random factor  to prioritize exploration over purely heuristic pathfinding.(b) While Q is not empty:
• Graph G • Embedding
• Pop node u with the lowest cost from Q
• If u = target: Return path P • Mark u as visited • For each neighbor v of u: -Calculate heuristic distance h(v, target) using embed- dings -Compute cost of visiting v as cost(v) = h(v, target) + 𝛼 × random() -If v not in V: Add (cost(v), v) to Q 5.</p>
<p>Add random waypoints:</p>
<p>• Randomly select waypoints from neighbors of nodes in P, ensuring they are not already in the path.</p>
<p>• For each waypoint, compute shortest path to the next waypoint and extend P. 6.Return path: After waypoints, compute the final leg from the last waypoint to target.7. Build subgraph: Create a subgraph G′ containing all nodes and edges along the path.8. Save results: If enabled, save the path visualization and subgraph to HTML and GraphML files.9. Return: Path P, subgraph G′, shortest path length.</p>
<p>Graph Reasoning-Initial Ideation: The initial step in the approach develops a scientific hypothesis based on a knowledge graph derived from a heuristic path in a given graph G as described in Section 4.2.Here the graph G represents a set of interconnected nodes, where each node can represent an entity or concept, and edges represent relationships between these nodes.The algorithm begins by identifying two key nodes, keyword_1 and keyword_2, which can either be explicitly specified or randomly selected from G. If the shortest_path flag is set to True, the function computes the shortest path between these nodes by using embeddings to estimate the best-fitting nodes, leveraging a pre-existing function called find_path.If shortest_path is set to False, a heuristic pathfinding approach is employed, which incorporates randomization and potentially random waypoints to explore more diverse paths.The graph structure is used not only for identifying the connectivity between the nodes but also for guiding the algorithm's search for the most relevant or exploratory paths based on the node embeddings.</p>
<p>Once a path between keyword_1 and keyword_2 is established, the function constructs a knowledge graph from the path and its relationships.This knowledge graph consists of the nodes traversed and the relationships (edges) between them.The graph's structure is vital as it is used to form the input for a generative model, which expands on the graph's nodes and relationships by providing definitions and explanations.The function also generates a novel research hypothesis by analyzing the graph, synthesizing a hypothesis based on the relationships and concepts discovered along the path.The structure of the graph helps to frame the scientific inquiry, with the hypothesis leveraging the graph's connections to predict outcomes, explore mechanisms, and propose innovative ideas.This output is formatted as a JSON object with fields like ''hypothesis,'' ''outcome,'' and ''design_principles,'' each reflecting different aspects of the potential research grounded in the graph's topology.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the process is the use of natural language generation to dynamically expand on the concepts represented by the nodes and edges of the knowledge graph.For each node, the generative model provides detailed definitions and explanations of the scientific concepts it represents.The relationships between the nodes, represented by the edges, are also expanded to give context to how these concepts are interconnected.This approach not only builds a deeper understanding of individual components of the graph but also enhances the user's ability to interpret the complex interrelations between them, thereby setting the foundation for novel scientific inquiry.The response generated by the model includes comprehensive descriptions of these relationships, ensuring that the resulting graph becomes a robust substrate for knowledge synthesis.</p>
<p>After the knowledge graph is expanded, the algorithm generates a structured scientific hypothesis that leverages each of the nodes and relationships in the graph.The output, in JSON format, provides key fields such as ''mechanisms,'' ''unexpected_properties,'' and ''comparison,'' offering a highly detailed analysis.The ''mechanisms'' field discusses predicted chemical, biological, or physical interactions, while ''unexpected_properties'' anticipates emergent behaviors from novel combinations of concepts in the graph.This comprehensive hypothesis formulation process allows for the exploration of unexplored areas of study, providing an innovative and grounded approach to scientific discovery based on the structure of the graph and its conceptual relationships.</p>
<p>Expansion of the Initial Concepts:</p>
<p>The final phase of the methodology focuses on leveraging the expanded research concept to identify key scientific questions and prioritize actionable research directions, particularly in the domains of molecular modeling and synthetic biology.This phase employs a generative model to analyze the complete research document, which includes the knowledge graph, expanded concepts, and critical reviews, with the goal of extracting the most impactful scientific questions.These questions are then further expanded into detailed experimental and simulation plans, or other specific aspects that a user wants to explore in detail.</p>
<p>Using the JSON developed as described in Section 4.3.1 several systematic steps are conducted.</p>
<p>Step 1: Prompt-Driven Expansion of Key Research Aspects The next phase involves systematically expanding specific aspects of the hypothesis using a series of targeted prompts.For each aspect of the research, a detailed prompt is constructed to critically assess and improve the scientific content of that aspect.The primary aspects are drawn from the JSON dictionary, where all elements were iterated in that data structure.</p>
<p>The following steps summarize how the model expands each research aspect:</p>
<p>• A prompt is created for each field in the JSON data structure, asking the model to expand upon the original content by adding quantitative details such as chemical formulas, material properties, or specific experimental methods.</p>
<p>The model is also instructed to provide a step-by-step rationale for the proposed scientific improvements.• For example, the prompt format includes:</p>
<p>Expand on the following aspect: field.Critically assess the original content, add specifics, such as chemical formulas,sequences, microstructures, and rational improvements: JSON_dictionary[field]</p>
<p>• The model generates expanded content under a heading such as ### Expanded Mechanisms or ### Expanded Outcomes.Each response is added to res_data_expanded to track the expanded fields.• The iterative process is repeated for each of the first seven fields in res_data, ensuring that every major aspect of the research concept is thoroughly evaluated and improved upon.</p>
<p>Step 2: Compilation and Summary of Expanded Content After the expansion phase, the system compiles the results into a structured document, starting with the original knowledge graph and hypothesis, followed by the expanded research aspects.This forms a cohesive research narrative.The complete document includes sections such as: Step 3: Scientific Critique and Review Following the expansion, a prompt is issued to the model to critically review the entire document.The review is designed to evaluate both the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed research and to suggest improvements.This step is crucial in ensuring that the expanded content is scientifically rigorous and logical.The prompt asks for: Provide a thorough critical scientific review with strengths, weaknesses, and suggested improvements.The result is a critical review that is appended to the final document as ''SUMMARY, CRITICAL REVIEW, AND IMPROVEMENTS''.</p>
<p>Step 4: Identification of Modeling and Experimental Priorities Finally, the model is prompted to identify the most impactful scientific questions related to molecular modeling and synthetic biology.</p>
<p>Separate prompts are issued for each domain, asking the model to:</p>
<p>• Identify a key research question that can be tackled using molecular modeling, and outline steps to conduct such modeling, including any specific tools or techniques.• Similarly, for synthetic biology, the model is prompted to outline an experimental plan, detailing unique aspects such as gene-editing protocols, biological sequences, or organism-specific techniques.</p>
<p>Examples of these prompts:</p>
<p>Identify the single most impactful scientific question that can be tackled with molecular modeling.Outline key steps for conducting such modeling.</p>
<p>Identify the most impactful question for synthetic biology and provide an experimental setup.</p>
<p>The responses are appended to the final document under ''MODELING AND SIMULATION PRIORITIES'' and ''SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY EXPER-IMENTAL PRIORITIES''.</p>
<p>Final Document and Output</p>
<p>The entire research concept, expanded and reviewed, is then compiled into a final document which is saved as both a PDF and CSV file for further analysis.The final document contains:</p>
<p>• The original knowledge graph and proposed research hypothesis.</p>
<p>• Expanded descriptions of key research aspects.</p>
<p>• A critical review of the proposal.</p>
<p>• Research priorities for molecular modeling and synthetic biology.This provides a comprehensive output that transitions the generated hypothesis into a detailed, actionable research plan.</p>
<p>Agentic Modeling: AI agents were designed using the general-purpose LLM GPT-4 family models.The automated multi-agent collaboration is implemented in the AutoGen framework, [47] an open-source ecosystem for agent-based AI modeling.</p>
<p>In our multi-agent system, the human agent is constructed using User-ProxyAgent class from Autogen, and Assistant, Planner, Ontologist, Scientist 1, Scientist 2, and Critic agents are created via AssistantAgent class from Autogen; and the group chat manager is created using GroupChat-Manager class.Each agent is assigned a role through a profile description included as system_message at their creation.The full profile of the agents is provided in Figure S2 for the planner, Figure S3 for the assistant, Function and Tool Design: All the tools implemented in this work are defined as python functions.Each function is characterized by a name, a description, and input properties which have a proper description.</p>
<p>Semantic Scholar Analysis: The Semantic Scholar API was used, an AIpowered search engine for academic resources, to search for related publications using a set of keywords.To ensure a thorough assessment of the research idea, a tool featuring an AI agent named the "novelty assistant" was implemented, which calls the Semantic Scholar API three times using different combinations of keywords selected based on the research hypothesis.The profile of this agent is shown in Figure 12.For each function call, the ten most relevant publications are returned, including their titles and abstracts.The novelty assistant agent then thoroughly analyzes the abstracts and provides a review describing the novelty of the research idea.</p>
<p>Audio Representation: Several examples of files created using the PDF2Audio tool (https://github.com/lamm-mit/PDF2Audio).The audio simulates a podcast-style discussion between two people about SciAgents, based on the content of the manuscript and a material design developed by the algorithm.</p>
<p>This tool facilitates the transformation of PDF files into audio outputs, designed to cater to diverse presentation formats such as podcasts, lectures, and summaries.The process begins with PDF file upload, from which text is extracted using a PDF reader.Users can customize text generation through instruction templates tailored for specific use cases, such as podcasts or summaries, which guide content style, structure, and tone.Text is generated using OpenAI's o1-preview model, selected for their capacity to handle large language tasks with nuanced control over tone and style.</p>
<p>The generated text undergoes a natural language synthesis phase using text-to-speech (TTS) models, here tts-1, which deliver high-definition audio output in voices specified by the user.Voice selection is further enhanced through predefined voice options to match different stylistic needs.The algorithm allows for iterative text refinement through a feedback loop, integrating user comments and transcript edits in subsequent runs.The final audio file is delivered as an MP3 format, with transcripts and the original text provided for reference.</p>
<p>In addition to podcasts and lecture-style formats, the tool supports a variety of audio content styles including scientific summaries, conversational panels, and multilingual outputs.Each format employs customized instruction templates, defining tone, structure, and detail level based on the desired style.For example, the SciAgents material discovery summary format creates an engaging dialogue between an expert and a student to explain scientific concepts, while the lecture format generates structured monologues for educational content.Templates are further customizable for language-specific instructions, enabling formats in French, German, Spanish, and other languages, with specialized directives to ensure accessible explanations and cultural relevance.This flexibility allows users to tailor outputs for diverse audiences and applications, from academic discussions to general public outreach.</p>

Figure 2. Overview of the entire process from initial keyword selection to the final document, following a hierarchical expansion strategy where answers are successively refined and improved, enriched with retrieved data, critiqued and amended by identification or critical modeling, simulation and experimental tasks.The process begins with initial keyword identification or random exploration within a graph, followed by path sampling to create a subgraph of relevant concepts and relationships (see, FigureS1, Supporting Information, for an illustration of how the path can be sampled).This subgraph forms the basis for generating structured output in JSON, including the hypothesis, outcome, mechanisms, design principles, unexpected properties, comparison, and novelty.Each component is subsequently expanded on with individual prompting, to yield significant amount of additional detail, forming a comprehensive draft.This draft then undergoes a critical review process, including amendments for modeling and simulation priorities (e.g., molecular dynamics) and experimental priorities (e.g., synthetic biology).The final integrated draft, along with critical analyses, results in a document that guides further scientific inquiry.</p>
