                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> The exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research pose significant challenges for researchers, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas. The advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown great potential in enhancing idea proposals, but how to effectively utilize large models for reasonable idea proposal has not been thoroughly explored. This paper proposes a scientific paper idea proposer (SciPIP). Based on a user-provided research background, SciPIP retrieves helpful papers from a literature database while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate more novel and feasible ideas. To this end, 1) we construct a literature retrieval database, extracting lots of papers' multi-dimension information for fast access. Then, a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entity, and citation co-occurrences is proposed to search relevant literature from multiple aspects based on the user-provided background. 2) After literature retrieval, we introduce dual-path idea proposal strategies, where one path infers solutions from the retrieved literature and the other path generates original ideas through model brainstorming. We then combine the two to achieve a good balance between feasibility and originality. Through extensive experiments on the natural language processing (NLP) field, we demonstrate that SciPIP can retrieve citations similar to those of existing top conference papers and generate many ideas consistent with them. Additionally, we evaluate the originality of other ideas generated by SciPIP using large language models, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code and the database are released at https://github.com/cheerss/SciPIP.</p>

Backgrounds and summaries are embedded with Sentence-BERT; semantic retrieval picks Top-K (K=55) papers by cosine similarity on background embeddings (N1). Entities are extracted from the user background and retrieved papers via GLM-4, expanded with synonyms and neighborhood filtering (co-occurrence threshold m=2 and TF-IDF-like pruning selecting n=5 least frequent neighbors) to form E(u); papers containing E(u) form entity-based set (N2). Citation co-occurrence adds papers frequently co-cited with already retrieved papers (selecting top-2 co-cited neighbors per paper) to form N3. Retrieved set N = N1 ∪ N2 ∪ N3 is clustered using combined summary/main-idea embeddings e(p)=0.5*e_s + 0.5*e_i and one representative per cluster is chosen. Idea generation: (A) direct proposal uses retrieved papers + background to prompt GPT-4o for initial ideas, filtering and refinement via further LLM prompts; (B,C) dual-path variants combine literature-inspired generation with independent LLM brainstorming, with SciPIP-C also using brainstormed entities to augment retrieval. The pipeline is driven by GLM-4 for extraction, Sentence-BERT for embeddings, and GPT-4o for idea generation/evaluation; prompt engineering is central to all extraction/generation stages.</td>

Backgrounds and summaries are embedded with Sentence-BERT; semantic retrieval picks Top-K (K=55) papers by cosine similarity on background embeddings (N1). Entities are extracted from the user background and retrieved papers via GLM-4, expanded with synonyms and neighborhood filtering (co-occurrence threshold m=2 and TF-IDF-like pruning selecting n=5 least frequent neighbors) to form E(u); papers containing E(u) form entity-based set (N2). Citation co-occurrence adds papers frequently co-cited with already retrieved papers (selecting top-2 co-cited neighbors per paper) to form N3. Retrieved set N = N1 ∪ N2 ∪ N3 is clustered using combined summary/main-idea embeddings e(p)=0.5*e_s + 0.5*e_i and one representative per cluster is chosen. Idea generation: (A) direct proposal uses retrieved papers + background to prompt GPT-4o for initial ideas, filtering and refinement via further LLM prompts; (B,C) dual-path variants combine literature-inspired generation with independent LLM brainstorming, with SciPIP-C also using brainstormed entities to augment retrieval. The pipeline is driven by GLM-4 for extraction, Sentence-BERT for embeddings, and GPT-4o for idea generation/evaluation; prompt engineering is central to all extraction/generation stages.",

The exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research pose significant challenges for researchers, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas.The advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown great potential in enhancing idea proposals, but how to effectively utilize large models for reasonable idea proposal has not been thoroughly explored.This paper proposes a scientific paper idea proposer (SciPIP).Based on a user-provided research background, SciPIP retrieves helpful papers from a literature database while leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to generate more novel and feasible ideas.To this end, 1) we construct a literature retrieval database, extracting lots of papers' multi-dimension information for fast access.Then, a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entity, and citation co-occurrences is proposed to search relevant literature from multiple aspects based on the user-provided background.2) After literature retrieval, we introduce dual-path idea proposal strategies, where one path infers solutions from the retrieved literature and the other path generates original ideas through model brainstorming.We then combine the two to achieve a good balance between feasibility and originality.Through extensive experiments on the natural language processing (NLP) field, we demonstrate that SciPIP can retrieve citations similar to those of existing top conference papers and generate many ideas consistent with them.Additionally, we evaluate the originality of other ideas generated by SciPIP using large language models, further validating the effectiveness of our proposed method 1 .</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>With the exponential growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of interdisciplinary research, machine learning researchers face significant challenges, including information overload and difficulties in exploring novel ideas.Against this backdrop, generating new ideas and innovative concepts efficiently has become a pressing need.Recent advancements in large language models (e.g., GPT-4 (Ouyang et al., 2022), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Qwen (Bai et al., 2023;Yang et al., 2024), GLM-4 (Zeng et al., 2024), and etc), have demonstrated immense potential in enhancing innovation generation.These models are not only capable of understanding and generating complex academic content but also excel in aligning multimodal information, constructing implicit chains of thought, and uncovering non-obvious connections.Leveraging LLMs to assist researchers in generating new ideas holds significant implications for improving research productivity and offers a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the design of future intelligent research assistants.</p>
<p>Large language model (LLM)-based idea proposers should have the ability to understand the userprovided research background, autonomously retrieve relevant literature, and generate novel and feasible ideas aimed at addressing problems within the given background.Some previous works have proposed their methods (Wang et al., 2024;Baek et al., 2024;Lu et al., 2024).However, existing LLM-based idea proposers still face two challenges: 1) Similar to human researchers, literature retrieval is essential to inspire new ideas and avoid repetitive ideas.Nevertheless, online literature searches are limited to simple keyword matching and cannot fully leverage the user-provided information or the existing literature, leading to incomplete and inaccurate retrieval results.2) Scientific paper ideas require both novelty and feasibility.However, it is still under-explored about how to enable LLMs to generate entirely new ideas while ensuring their feasibility.</p>
<p>To address the above challenges, we propose our Scientific Paper Idea Proposer (SciPIP).In terms of challenge 1), SciPIP first constructs a literature retrieval database.Specifically, we collect a large body of literature from the natural language processing (NLP) field and extract multiple dimensions of information for each paper using techniques such as entity extraction, semantic encoding, summarization, and citation analysis.The information is stored in the database, enabling rapid access to various aspects of the literature during retrieval.Building on this database, we propose a literature retrieval method based on semantics, entities, and citation co-occurrence (SEC-based retrieval).In this framework, "semantics" captures the global information of a paper, "entities" focus on local details, and "citation co-occurrence" reflects the hidden relationships uncovered by previous researchers.By matching at these three different levels of granularity, SciPIP offers more comprehensive literature retrieval.</p>
<p>To address the challenge 2), SciPIP introduces a new method for idea proposal.It first organizes the retrieved literature and generates ideas inspired by the retrieved works.Subsequently, SciPIP uses a brainstorming approach to generate new ideas without reference to the literature.Depending on the combination of literature-based and brainstorming-based idea generation, we derive three variants of SciPIP.The ideas generated by our method are further filtered and refined to enhance both their novelty and feasibility.</p>
<p>Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate both idea proposal and literature retrieval on the NLP field.In the retrospective experiments, we use the backgrounds of ACL 2024 papers as inputs to test whether the models could generate the same ideas as those in the published papers, or whether SciPIP could retrieve the same references as the actual citations.Additionally, we conduct innovation experiments, in which the models are prompted to freely propose ideas based on a given background, and the quality of the proposed ideas are assessed by an LLM in terms of novelty, feasibility, and etc.The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, SciPIP can match more existing ideas and generate ideas with significantly greater novelty and potential.</p>
<p>RELATED WORKS</p>
<p>Around 60 years ago, scientists began exploring scientific discoveries based on literature retrieval, known as Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) (Swanson, 1986).This approach concentrated on a specific, narrow type of hypothesis: the connections between pairs of concepts, often involving drugs and diseases.LBD introduced the "ABC" model, positing that two concepts A and C are hypothesized to be linked if they appear in conjunction with an intermediate concept B in the literature.</p>
<p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields, and one of the most intriguing applications is their ability to generate scientific hypotheses (Wang et al., 2024;Baek et al., 2024;Lu et al., 2024).LLMs, trained on extensive datasets encompassing a vast array of scientific literature, possess an impressive capacity to recognize patterns and synthesize information across disciplines.By leveraging their advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, these models can propose novel hypotheses that might not be immediately apparent to researchers.The process begins with the model receiving a prompt, typically related to a specific scientific domain, which guides it to generate hypotheses grounded in existing knowledge while also incorporating innovative perspectives.For example, SCIMON (Wang et al., 2024) uses retrieval of "inspirations" from past scientific papers to generate ideas.It explicitly optimizes for novelty by iteratively comparing generated ideas with prior papers and updating them until sufficient novelty is achieved.In contrast, Research Agent (Baek et al., 2024) starts with a core paper as the primary focus and expands its knowledge by connecting information over an academic graph and retrieving entities from an entity-centric knowledge store based on their underlying concepts.It also leverages multiple Reviewing Agents to provide iterative reviews and feedback for refining the generated ideas.AI Scientist leverages large language models (LLMs) to autonomously generate research ideas, implement and execute experiments, search for related works, and produce comprehensive research papers in machine learning.The AI Scientist is designed to automate the entire scientific process, from ideation to experimentation and iterative refinement.</p>
<p>METHODS</p>
<p>We propose a Scientific Paper Idea Proposer (SciPIP) that takes the user-provided background of a specific research field as input, retrieves relevant literature from the database, and generates novel and feasible ideas.To achieve this, we will first construct a literature database in Section 3.1 for literature retrieval during the idea proposal process.Then, in Section 3.2, we detail how to retrieve literature related to the user-provided background.Finally, in Section 3.3, we outline the process of idea proposal.</p>
<p>LITERATURE DATABASE CONSTRUCTION</p>
<p>Just like human researchers, reading other literature and drawing inspirations from them is an important process for LLMs to generate valuable ideas.However, online literature reading is a very time-consuming process, so we collect a literature database in advance for the following literature retrieval and idea proposal process.</p>
<p>To be specific, we collect papers published in ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, NAACL, and EMNLP in past ten years, yielding a database with 48,895 papers.For each paper, we parse the PDF file and extract its title, abstract, introduction, method, and references sections.Then, as shown in Figure 1 , given an LLM f , we prompt it to read and summarize the paper as:
E (p) = f (τ 1 , T (p) a ), (T (p) b , T (p) s , T (p) i ) = f (τ 2 , T (p) t , T (p) a , T (p) n ), T (p) d = f (τ 3 , T (p) m , T (p) i ),(1)
where
T (p) t , T (p) a , T (p) n , T(p)
m are the paper p's title, abstract, introduction, and method sections.
E (p) , T (p) b , T (p) s , T (p) i , T (p) d , T (p) r
are extracted entities, background, summary, main ideas, detailed ideas, and core references, as shwon in Figure 1.τ i , i ∈ {1, 2, 3} represent our designed prompt templates, and specific prompts are shown in the Appendix A.1.In practice, we use GLM-42 (Zeng et al., 2024) as f .Besides, "Core References" in Figure 1 means extracting papers referenced in introduction and method sections, because we believe these references have the greatest impact on paper p among all references.</p>
<p>User-provided Background</p>
<p>The need to reduce the memory footprint and training time in finetuning large language models, as existing methods still require considerable memory and do not simultaneously address all three contributors to the memory demand: model weights, optimizer states, and intermediate activations.Additionally, the background, summary, and main ideas are also encoded with Sentence-BERT (Reimers &amp; Gurevych, 2019) for their embeddings e</p>
<p>Semantics</p>
<p>s and e (p) i , respectively.All extracted information are recorded into our literature database.</p>
<p>To retrieve literature faster, we also construct a paper-entity graph in the database.we also store all occurrence relationships of papers and entities in the database.As shown in Figure 1, if an entity T e1 appears in the paper p1, there will be an edge between the two paper nodes.</p>
<p>LITERATURE RETRIEVAL AND FILTERING</p>
<p>Literature retrieval is an essential process for idea proposal.It should follow the rule of comprehensiveness and low-redundancy.On the one hand, a comprehensive retrieval can provide researchers with instructive inspirations and avoid repetitive idea proposal.On the other hand, more retrieved papers are not necessarily better because redundant papers may also introduce noise and disperse a researcher's attention.To this end, we first propose a SEC-based (Semantics, Entities, and Citation co-occurrence) literature retrieval.Then, we propose a clustering-based literature filtering to pick out the most helpful papers.The process is shown in Figure 2.</p>
<p>SEC-BASED LITERATURE RETRIEVAL</p>
<p>Semantics-based retrieval.As shown in Figure 2, given a user-provided background T (u) b , we encode it as an embedding with Sentence-BERT (Reimers &amp; Gurevych, 2019), marked as e is compared with e b of all papers' backgrounds in the literature database to identify a subset of papers with the maximum cosine similarity as the semantic-based retrieval results.Assume the retrieved papers as N 1 ,
N 1 = {p|e (p) b ∈ TopK(cosine(e (u) b , e (i) b )) for i ∈ D},(2)
where p or i represents a paper in the literature database.In practice, we take K = 55 for the TopK operation.</p>
<p>Entity-based retrieval.As we can see in Figure 2, after semantic literature retrieval, we take the user-provided background T as input and prompt GLM-4 to extract all entities in the background.Then, the abstract section of semantics-based retrieved papers (i.e., p ∈ N 1 ) are also given to the GLM-4 to extract their entities.The exact prompt we use is provided in the Appendix A.1.After entity extraction, we also expand the entity set by giving these entities back to GLM-4 and let it generate some synonyms.The motivation behind entity expansion is that the same concept may express in different ways, and entity expansion can help us retrieve papers that use synonyms in the following process.We notate the entity set after synonym expansion as E 1 .</p>
<p>Additionally, we further expand the entity set through an entity-neighborhood-based approach.In simple terms, for an entity T e in the current entity set E 1 , any paper p that includes entity T e should also have its other entities included in the candidate entity set.However, we find that this will induce many redundant or even noisy entities, and the reasons are twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two entities with low relevance may appear together in a paper due to the specific content requirements of that paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High-frequency words do not effectively characterize a paper or its background.For instance, the user-provided background might include the term "Transformer", but this does not imply that all entities co-occurring with "Transformer" in other papers are significant to us.This is because "Transformer" is a high-frequency term that may appear in many recent publications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To this end, we propose two filtering mechanisms for neighborhood-based entity expansion:</p>
<p>1.An entity will only be supplemented if it has appeared together with another entity in at least m papers.In practice, we take m = 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Inspired by the TF-IDF (Jones, 2004) algorithm, we believe that if an entity appears frequently across the entire paper database, it indicates that the entity is less representative.Therefore, we only select the n entities that appear the least in all literature as the final entity set.In practice, we take n = 5.</li>
</ol>
<p>The entity set after a second expansion is represented as E (u) .Entities are key words that are most relevant with a paper's topic.A paper is likely to be helpful to us if it contains entities that match those in our entity set E (u) .Thus, for any entity T e in set E (u) , we search for papers that also contain T e in our database.Marking all searched papers as a set N 2 ,
N 2 = {p|∃T e ∈ E (u) ∧ T e ∈ T (p) b , p ∈ D}.(3)
Co-occurrence-based retrieval.In the above, we retrieve literature relevant to the user-provided background through entities and semantics.Wherein, entities represent specific details of a paper, while semantics represent the broader, overall meaning within the background.However, in actual research, we often encounter two papers, p 1 and p 2 , which are neither similar in details nor in semantics, yet are cited together.This indicates that researchers have discovered a latent relationship between p 1 and p 2 in past studies.To capture and fully utilize these insights, we propose a literature retrieval method based on citation co-occurrence.Specifically, as shown in Figure 2, for any paper p 1 we have already retrieved, if p 2 is frequently cited alongside p 1 in other papers, we will include p 2 in our literature retrieval set:
N 3 = {p 2 |p 1 ∈ (N 1 ∪ N 2 ) ∧ co-cite(p 1 , p 2 )},(4)
where co-cite means p 1 and p 2 are often simultaneously cited by other papers.In practice, we select the 2 papers that are most frequently co-cited with each paper.</p>
<p>Finally, the whole retrieved papers can be represented as
N = N 1 ∪ N 2 ∪ N 3 .</p>
<p>LITERATURE CLUSTERING</p>
<p>After SEC-based literature retrieval, we may get over 500 papers, so further filtering is essential to pick out the most significant ones.Since we have observed that the retrieved papers often present similar ideas, we hope to retain only one paper among those with similar content during the generation of new ideas.To achieve this, we propose clustering the papers based on cosine similarity measures.Specifically, we first define the embedding of a retrieved paper as:
e (p) = w s e (p) s + w i e (p) i ,(5) where e (p)
s and e (p)</p>
<p>i are embeddings for summary and main ideas of an idea, as illustrated in Figure 1.We choose w s = w i = 0.5 in practice.Then, we apply clustering to group papers according to their cosine similarity.In practice, since the semantic embeddings of all papers are pre-recorded in a database, we only need to perform the similarity comparison and clustering processes.Finally, we select one paper from each cluster, respectively, and make up the retrieved papers.</p>
<p>IDEA PROPOSAL</p>
<p>Upon completion of the literature retrieval, we propose three approaches for generating research paper ideas.In essence, the idea generation process can leverage two types of information: the first is derived from the content of the retrieved papers, which inspires the LLM to generate ideas; the second involves the LLM freely brainstorming to produce new ideas.Based on this principle, we delineate three methods of idea generation that vary in their application of brainstorming.</p>
<p>As illustrated in Figure 3(a), the direct proposal method (SciPIP-A), does not use brainstorm.While the first dual-path proposal method (SciPIP-B), as Figure 3(b) shows, utilizes the user-provided background into two branches.The first branch employs this background for literature retrieval, problem summarization, and idea generation based on the retrieved literature, while the second branch engages in brainstorming solutions directly from the user-provided background.Following the independent generation of ideas in both branches, the outputs are merged and subsequently filtered and refined to yield the final ideas.Similarly, as shown in Figure 3(c), the second dual-path proposal method (SciPIP-C) follows a process analogous to SciPIP-B, with the key distinction being that the content generated through the LLM's brainstorming is utilized not only for idea generation but also integrated with the user-provided background for entity extraction and other literature retrieval processes.We will provide a detailed exposition of these three methods of idea proposal in the following sections.We use GPT-4o3 by default in this section.</p>
<p>DIRECT IDEA PROPOSAL METHOD</p>
<p>As depicted in Figure 3(a), in the direct proposal method, we first retrieve papers following the pipeline described in Section 3.2.Then, the user-provided background along with the retrieved papers are utilized to prompt the LLM to summarize the core problem we aim to address and provide justifications.The specific prompts can be found in the Appendix A.1.</p>
<p>With the summarized problem and justifications, the LLM is prompted to generate around 10 initial ideas.In the prompt, both the problem, the justification and the retrieved papers are provided.The LLM is encouraged to generate clear, innovative, valid, and comprehensive ideas.The specific prompts for this step can be also found in the Appendix A.1.</p>
<p>Though the prompt has declared, the initially generated ideas may still have shortcomings in terms of novelty or relevance to the problem.To address this, we filter the initial ideas using prompt engineering (prompts are illustrated in the Appendix A.1), with the primary criterion being that the ideas are generated in response to the given problem.Additionally, the ideas must exhibit a high degree of novelty and feasibility.During this process, each generated idea is evaluated independently, and about half of them will be filtered.</p>
<p>Then, the LLM is encouraged to further improve the filtered ideas by considering their interrelationships.That is, the LLM is tasked with considering the compatibility of the ideas, ensuring that it does not generate conflicting or repetitive ideas.Moreover, the LLM is required to gen- erate formulas or algorithms to better elaborate the ideas if needed.The prompt is shown in the Appendix A.1.Finally, about 3 to 4 refined ideas will be proposed.</p>
<p>DUAL-PATH IDEA PROPOSAL METHODS</p>
<p>We find that the directly generated ideas often rely heavily on the retrieved literature, sometimes closely resembling the methods presented in those papers.They frequently involve transferring approaches from other fields or making minor improvements to existing methods within the same field, resulting in relatively ordinary novelty and rarely yielding breakthrough thinking.</p>
<p>Therefore, we further propose idea proposers that incorporates brainstorming, encouraging the LLM to produce more novel thoughts.Specifically, brainstorming can play a role in both processes of idea generation.As shown in Figure 3(b), the SciPIP-B has two paths, where one path follows the direct proposal approach, while the other path uses the LLM to brainstorm possible solutions based on the user-input background, outputting these as ideas.Ultimately, these ideas will be merged with those generated based on the retrieved papers, filtered and refined to produce the final ideas.In this model, the results of brainstorming are independent of the generation based on retrieved papers.</p>
<p>In another approach, as shown in Figure 3(c), brainstorming generates ideas independently while also being utilized in literature retrieval.Specifically, we extract entities from the brainstorming results and incorporate them as part of the entity set in the literature retrieval process.With this method, some keywords arising from the brainstorming will also help enhance the effectiveness of literature retrieval.The ideas generated through brainstorming will also be merged with those produced after literature retrieval.</p>
<p>EXPERIMENTS</p>
<p>EVALUATION DATASET</p>
<p>We collect all papers accepted by ACL 2024, including long papers, short papers, findings, and workshop papers.After excluding a few PDFs that could not be correctly parsed, 1,968 papers are remained for analysis.The remaining papers are processed similarly to those in the literature database in Section 3.1, with their entities, backgrounds, summaries, main ideas, detailed ideas, and references extracted in advance.</p>
<p>The experiments in this study are divided into two parts: retrospective experiments and innovation experiments.Retrospective experiments refer to testing whether different algorithms can generate the same ideas and literature retrieval results as the original papers on the evaluation dataset (i.e., ACL 2024 papers) with providing the background of the papers as input.In contrast, innovation experiments allow the models to freely propose new ideas, which are then evaluated from multiple perspectives, including novelty and feasibility.</p>
<p>RETROSPECTIVE EXPERIMENTS FOR IDEA PROPOSAL.</p>
<p>Compared algorithms.AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024), when given an existing idea, iteratively refines the idea through multiple rounds of LLM inference.Afterward, the AI Scientist will expand the Idea into a full paper.Since our algorithm only focuses on proposing ideas, we only compare  b , we first retrieve a paper from the literature database with a similar background.The idea from this paper serves as the initial idea for refinement by the AI Scientist.In contrast, our algorithm directly uses the user-provided background T (u) b as input for idea proposal.We then compare the similarity of generated ideas by two algorithms to the ideas from ACL 2024 papers.</p>
<p>Evaluation Protocol.To evaluate the matching rate between the generated ideas and those from ACL 2024, we first preprocess all ACL papers following the method in Section 3.1 and store them in a database.The generated ideas are then compared based on cosine distance to retrieve the 10 most similar ideas from the database.Next, using prompt engineering, GPT-4o selects the most similar idea and assigns a similarity score between 0 and 5, where a higher score indicates greater similarity.From our observations, a score of 4 indicates that the two ideas are almost identical, differing only in minor details, while a score of 3 or lower suggests more significant differences.Wherein, SciPIP-C is tested on all ACL 2024 papers, while other methods are tested with 100 backgrounds randomly sampled from the whole test set.</p>
<p>However, we believe that low-scoring ideas in the retrospective experiments do not necessarily lack value.On the contrary, some of these ideas exhibit strong novelty and feasibility, though they do not ideas published at ACL 2024.To further assess the novelty and feasibility of all ideas generated by SciPIP, we employ the LLMs for evaluation.For each round of comparison, we sample one idea from each of 5 similarity scores and ask the LLM to rank them based on their novelty and feasibility.We then record the win rate (i.e., the probability of ranking first) of ideas across different similarity scores in all rounds.</p>
<p>Results and analyses.As we can see in Table 1, our proposed three idea proposal strategies can, on average, generate 4 to 5 ideas that highly match ACL 2024 conference papers out of every 100 input backgrounds.This indicates that SciPIP is capable of generating ideas consistent with human thought, whereas the highest similarity score for all ideas generated by the AI Scientist is only 3. Additionally, the three methods we propose exhibit similar performance.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results in Table 2 illustrates that ideas with lower similarities to published ideas even show higher novelty, while the reasons still need more explorations.Further, ideas do not show much difference in terms of their feasibility.</p>
<p>Besides, we also provide two examples of SciPIP proposed ideas in Figure 4.The two examples both get a similarity score of 4 to an existing paper in ACL 2024, and the generated idea is indeed very similar to the matched idea.For example, in the second example (with the yellow background), the background points out the drawback of existing code generation algorithms.Both our generated and 1.The limitations of existing methods in leveraging nonverbal information for discerning complex semantics in unsupervised scenarios.2. The recognition that non-verbal modalities (video and audio) play a critical role in performing unsupervised clustering and can provide useful cues for semantics discovery."</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>SciPIP generated idea</p>
<p>Contrastive Multimodal Clustering (CMC) -The Contrastive Multimodal Clustering (CMC) model adapts multimodal contrastive learning for clustering by aligning embeddings of video, audio, and text data in a joint embedding space.It minimizes a contrastive loss function to bring similar instances from different modalities closer together, optimizing cosine similarity for positive pairs and minimizing it for negative pairs.This approach captures semantically rich representations without label supervision, effectively incorporating nonverbal cues into the clustering task.</p>
<p>Matched groundtruth idea</p>
<p>An unsupervised multimodal clustering method constructs augmentation views for multimodal data to perform pre-training by initializing representations for clustering with positive augmentation views, retaining text modality as core and masking either video or audio for data augmentation, utilizing a multimodal unsupervised contrastive learning loss for learning implicit similarities in shared modalities.</p>
<p>LLM-based similarity score: 4</p>
<p>1.The current challenge of large language models (LLMs) in code generation, where the correct solution is not always generated in a single attempt.2. The need to move beyond traditional verification properties from software engineering that are assumed to be superior to generated code solutions, but are often produced by the same model.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>SciPIP generated idea</p>
<p>Persistent Error-Guided Code Refinement Loop: Introduce a continuous feedback mechanism where the LLM-generated code undergoes iterative cycles of execution and refinement.Each cycle utilizes error messages and runtime exceptions to make corrections.A dynamic reinforcement learning (RL) model is incorporated to reward sequences of effective corrective actions that lead to successful code execution.Specifically, a reward function R(s, a) evaluates the efficacy of a correction action a in a state s, based on error resolution and code performance improvement metrics.This loop ensures persistent reduction of errors and refinement of generated code.</p>
<p>Matched groundtruth idea</p>
<p>Adoption of a reward model that acts as a critic to provide feedback for the fine-tuned language model's actions, using reinforcement learning to optimize the model's repair policies.The reward model serves as a virtual tool that assesses the quality of the program outputs.It is trained using pairwise ranking based on the severity of program errors, providing feedback to the language model.This approach uses reinforcement learning, specifically the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, to fine-tune the language model.The model iteratively refines programs based on the feedback from the reward model, aiming to maximize the rewards received.The process continues until no further improvement is detected or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.</p>
<p>LLM-based similarity score: 4 the matched idea propose to iteratively refine the generated code, and reinforcement learning based reward model should be used to evaluate the generated code.The reward should be decided by the error resolution, the severity of errors, and so on.More examples can be seen in the Appendix A.2.</p>
<p>NOVELTY EXPERIMENTS FOR IDEA PROPOSAL</p>
<p>Compared algorithms and evaluation protocol.We also compare with AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024) for novelty verification.The verification way is drawn from the official source code of AI Scientist with some modifications.To be specific, a proposed idea will give some key words that being used to search similar papers in Semantic Scholar4 .Through comparison with several similar papers drawn from Semantic Scholar, GPT-4o judges the novelty of the generated idea.The novelty score is from 0 to 10, higher score means smaller similarity with existing papers or higher novelty.</p>
<p>Results and analyses.The results are in Table 3.It can be seen that both SciPIP and AI Scientist can generate very novel ideas with score 9.While our proposed ideas with 9 score are much more than AI Scientist (92 vs. 12).Unexpectedly, SciPIP with brainstorm perform worse than the direct proposal.It may be because brainstorm utilizes the knowledge from the GPT-4o itself in essence.Therefore, it is hard for the model to generate brand new ideas that are totally different with existing literature.However, we believe brainstorming will be a significant supplement to retrieval-based generation, so we still preserve the results of SciPIP-B/C, hoping attract the community's attention.</p>
<p>At least, all versions of SciPIP generate over 270 high-scoring (score &gt; 7) ideas even though they only match 4 to 5 ideas in ACL 2024.The results indicate that non-matching ideas may be more valuable because SciPIP generate novel ideas that do not appear (or even do not put forward by human).</p>
<p>RETROSPECTIVE EXPERIMENTS FOR PAPER RETRIEVAL</p>
<p>Compared algorithms.Since AI Scientist does not perform a literature retrieval when generating ideas, the results primarily on SCIMON (Wang et al., 2024) and ResearchAgent (Baek et al., 2024).However, the experimental setups and literature database of SCIMON and ResearchAgent for generating scientific paper ideas differ from those in this study.Additionally, ResearchAgent is not open source, making it challenging to fully replicate the exact algorithm.Therefore, based on the descriptions in the original papers, we implement similar literature search algorithms, namely SCIMON-like and ResearchAgent-like in Table 4.</p>
<p>Evaluation protocol.Only a few reference papers are crucial for generating a paper's idea; using all citations as ground truth may introduce significant noise.Among contemporaneous papers, there may be similar ideas, and researchers might only cite one of them.To address this, we propose two strategies: We believe that the most important citations for a paper typically appear in the introduction and method sections; thus, we extract only these sections' citations as ground truth during PDF parsing.Additionally, as mentioned earlier, our method clusters the retrieved literature after searching, treating all papers in the same cluster as similar.In the retrospective experiment, we evaluate the distance between ground truth citations and cluster centers.If a ground truth citation falls within a cluster retrieved by SciPIP, we consider the retrieval result correct.</p>
<p>Results and analyses.The results are shown in Table 4, where Recall 10 represents the proportion of correctly retrieved papers when the algorithm is restricted to returning only 10 papers.For example, if the ground truth for a paper's literature search includes 20 references, a recall rate of 0.684 indicates that approximately 13 relevant papers were correctly retrieved.From the data in the table, it can be observed that our algorithm successfully retrieves more relevant papers compared to SCIMON and ResearchAgent.We also provide some ablation studies about literature retrieval in Table 5.As we can see, SE performs better than using only semantics or entities for retrieval.Moreover, citation co-occurrence and clustering also help improve the retrieval results.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose a method for generating scientific paper ideas and demonstrate its effectiveness on natural language processing datasets.The experimental results show that SciPIP is capable of proposing numerous novel ideas through the capabilities of LLMs.These ideas not only match papers published at recent academic conferences but also exhibit significant potential in terms of novelty, feasibility, and other key aspects.Despite these positive results, we gain more questions than conclusions in this work.For example, why do the ideas with lower similarity score looks more novel (refereed as to Table 2).We need more explorations to answer these questions.</p>

<p>1.The need to reduce hallucinated content in responses from LLM-based chatbots, which limits their reliability in sensitive domains like healthcare and education.2. The requirement for a training-free and easy-to-use method that can improve the credibility of chatbot responses without additional data annotation or extensive retraining.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>SciPIP generated idea</p>
<p>Idea 1: LIME-Based Post-Processing Filter with Reinforced Logical Verification Details: Enhance the basic LIME-based post-processing filter by integrating a reinforcement mechanism that goes beyond mere flagging of suspect segments.After LIME evaluates which parts of the response are grounded in factual data and which may be hallucinated, an additional logical verification step is applied using a lightweight, training-free logical consistency checker.This checker could employ principles from SATNet to ensure the logical coherence of the flagged segments.If logical inconsistencies are detected, the response can either be discarded, revised, or accompanied by a disclaimer highlighting the possibly unreliable segments.</p>
<p>Matched groundtruth idea</p>
<p>Step-by-step verification protocol for reasoning chains.This protocol formalizes the process of verifying the correctness of each step in a reasoning chain, including the relevance of each step, the attribution of each step to external sources, and the logical correctness of each step, enabling finegrained evaluation of reasoning verifiers..</p>
<p>LLM-based similarity score: 4</p>
<p>1.The need to improve the effectiveness of large language models in utilizing retrieved information for enhanced text generation in retrieval-augmented generation frameworks.2. The absence of a clear training mechanism that teaches LLMs to refine and integrate knowledge from retrieved texts of varying quality.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>SciPIP generated idea</p>
<p>Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Knowledge Integration: Employ contrastive learning techniques to train the LLM using pairs of relevant and irrelevant retrieval instances, with a contrastive loss function \( L_{\text{contrastive}} = d_{\text{pos}} -d_{\text{neg}} \).This approach helps the model distinguish between high-quality and low-quality information, improving the integration of the most informative and pertinent knowledge for text generation.</p>
<p>Matched groundtruth idea</p>
<p>A method for generating training data using Large Language Models (LLMs) that incorporates both positive and negative examples and employs a contrastive loss objective.This method leverages LLMs to generate a diverse set of training examples, which includes both positive utterances related to an intent and negative utterances that are unrelated or express a negation of the intent.By using a contrastive loss term, the model is encouraged to encode similar semantic meanings closer together in the embedding space, while pushing apart embeddings of differing or opposite meanings.This approach aims to enhance the model's semantic encoding capabilities, particularly for understanding negations and implicatures.</p>
<p>LLM-based similarity score: 4</p>
<p>1.The need to bridge the gap between the capabilities of current benchmarks and the real-world visually grounded tasks that require agents to process both visual and textual information.2. The desire to advance the development of autonomous agents by providing a rigorous assessment that simulates human interaction with modern computing interfaces.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>SciPIP generated idea</p>
<p>Interactive Contextual Scenario Emulation -Details: Design advanced contextual scenarios that require agents to interact dynamically with both text and visual content.These scenarios should emulate real-world tasks such as web browsing, multimedia interpretation, and virtual assistants navigating through user instructions.Implement a simulation environment where these tasks evolve based on the agent's interactions, measuring adaptability and decision-making in context-rich environments.The evaluation metrics should include task completion accuracy, adaptability to new information, and responsiveness to real-time changes, simulating human-computer interaction dynamics more rigorously.</p>
<p>Matched groundtruth idea</p>
<p>Contribution 1: Introduction of VisualWebArena, a Multimodal Benchmark for Web-based Tasks Details: This method introduces a novel benchmark suite called VisualWebArena, which is specifically designed to evaluate the performance of autonomous multimodal agents on visually grounded web tasks.It comprises a diverse set of web environments including Classifieds, Shopping, and Reddit.These environments contain realistic tasks that demand agents to process and understand image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to achieve predefined objectives.</p>
