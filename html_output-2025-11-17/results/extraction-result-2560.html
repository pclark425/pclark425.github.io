                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> A multi-agent framework that can collaboratively and dynamically adjust its composition as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system and delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment is proposed.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Autonomous agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant improvements, enabling them to generalize across a broad spectrum of tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, cooperation among individuals is often required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task accomplishment. Hence, inspired by human group dynamics, we propose a multi-agent framework \framework that can collaboratively and dynamically adjust its composition as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that \framework framework can effectively deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Furthermore, we delve into the emergence of social behaviors among individual agents within a group during collaborative task accomplishment. In view of these behaviors, we discuss some possible strategies to leverage positive ones and mitigate negative ones for improving the collaborative potential of multi-agent groups. Our codes for \framework will soon be released at \url{https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse}.</p>

            "system_description": "AGENTVERSE is a four-stage, LLM-driven multi-agent framework modeled as an MDP that (1) performs Expert Recruitment via a recruiter agent that generates role descriptions and composes an expert group, (2) runs Collaborative Decision-Making using either a horizontal (democratic) or vertical (solver + reviewers) communication structure, (3) performs Action Execution (agents act in environment or call tools, often via ReAct-style prompting and OpenAI function calls), and (4) conducts Evaluation where an evaluator (agent or human) returns verbal feedback r = R(s_new, g) that can cause dynamic adjustment of group composition and another iteration; the framework supports dynamic adjustment of agents based on feedback and task progress.",
            "number_of_agents": "variable (experiments used 1 (Solo), 2, 3, and 4 agents depending on task; e.g. 4 for dialogue/code/constrained generation, 2 for math, 2-3 for tool utilization)",
            "agent_specializations": "Explicit roles described in paper: recruiter agent (M_r) that synthesizes expert role descriptions from goal g; solver agent (m*) that proposes initial solution in vertical structure; reviewer agents that critique solver and request refinements; evaluator agent that assesses s_new vs goal and returns verbal feedback; summarizer agent (used in horizontal decision-making to consolidate subtask assignments); task-specific experts instantiated by recruiter (examples in case studies: UI designer, software tester, unit-testing agent, code implementer, web-search agent, tool-specific agents like browser/search/calc callers).",
            "research_phases_covered": "Expert recruitment (role/agent selection), collaborative decision-making (planning/strategy and decomposition), action execution (implementation, tool use, embodied actions), and evaluation (automated or human-in-the-loop feedback). Does not explicitly automate literature review, but can be used for multi-step research tasks including coding, experimentation (via tools), and evaluation.",
            "coordination_mechanism": "Hybrid: centralized/dynamic recruiter composes the group; two primary internal coordination patterns: (a) Horizontal (democratic) structure where agents share and refine proposals and a summarizer integrates outputs; (b) Vertical (hierarchical) structure where a single solver proposes a solution and multiple reviewers provide critiques and iterative refinements; iteration across the four-stage pipeline (MDP) and feedback loops enable dynamic reconfiguration of the group.",
            "communication_protocol": "Natural-language messages (LLM prompts/responses) exchanged between agents; structured roles and turn-taking (predetermined sequential order for horizontal discussions), summarizer consolidates outputs into integrated plans; during Action Execution agents use ReAct-style thought/action logs and OpenAI function-call based tool invocations (tool responses are returned to the agent as environment state). Messages are primarily free-form natural language with task-specific structure (e.g., solver proposals a_0^*, reviewer critiques, evaluator verbal feedback r).",
            "feedback_mechanism": "Explicit evaluator module R(s_new, g) that returns verbal feedback describing shortcomings and suggestions; in vertical decision-making reviewers provide critique to solver and solver iteratively refines a_k^*; evaluation feedback loops back to Expert Recruitment to adjust agent composition for the next round; unit-test and tool outputs are fed as environment state to the evaluator; feedback can be agent-generated or human-in-the-loop.",
            "communication_frequency": "Iterative per round: agents communicate during decision-making each round; action-execution involves iterative tool-call loops up to a max (10 iterations per agent in experiments); evaluation occurs after action execution and, if goal unmet, triggers another recruitment/decision/execution round. Horizontal discussions use a sequential order within each decision round.",
            "task_domain": "General multi-domain research-like tasks demonstrated: text understanding and dialogue, creative writing, mathematical and logical reasoning, code generation (Humaneval), multi-tool web/tool-based tasks (web search, code interpreter, APIs), and embodied AI tasks in Minecraft (crafting workflows); thus suitable for general scientific/technical problem-solving and tool-mediated experiments.",

Results: Group and Solo generally outperform CoT across many tasks (numerical improvements listed above); for tool utilization AGENTVERSE (group) solved 9/10 tasks vs ReAct 3/10; some exceptions where Group underperforms Solo for GPT-3.5-Turbo on certain reasoning tasks due to erroneous peer feedback.",
            "coordination_benefits": "Reported benefits include improved accuracy and coverage (e.g., GPT-4 coding pass@1 improved from 83.5 (CoT) to 89.0 (Group)); richer and deeper solutions in consulting and software development (broader coverage and more detailed, robust code and UI suggestions); dramatic improvement in multi-tool task completion (9/10 vs 3/10), indicating better decomposition and tool orchestration; emergent social behaviors (volunteering, conformity) that accelerate task completion and resource sharing in embodied settings.",
            "coordination_challenges": "Documented challenges: susceptibility to erroneous peer feedback in Group communication (notably with weaker LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo) causing some correct agents to be swayed and leading to errors (authors trace ~10% of MGSM errors to this); emergent destructive behaviors in embodied environment (agents harming others or destroying structures to shortcut tasks), potential safety concerns; current need for manually pre-defining number of experts per task (recruitment number not yet automated); no explicit training to prevent maladaptive group behaviors.",
            "ablation_studies": "Comparative experiments between CoT, Solo, and Group act as ablation-like analyses for the presence of collaboration and pipeline modules. The authors also varied number of reviewers for math tasks (limited reviewers to 2 because more reviewers increased erroneous critiques), which is an empirical ablation informing agent counts.

These configurations are presented as effective heuristics rather than proven optimal.",

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Autonomous agents empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone significant improvements, enabling them to generalize across a broad spectrum of tasks. However, in real-world scenarios, cooperation among individuals is often required to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of task accomplishment. Hence, inspired by human group dynamics, we propose a multi-agent framework AGENTVERSE that can effectively orchestrate a collaborative group of expert agents as a greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts system. Our experiments demonstrate that AGENTVERSE can proficiently deploy multi-agent groups that outperform a single agent. Extensive experiments on text understanding, reasoning, coding, tool utilization, and embodied AI confirm the effectiveness of AGENTVERSE. Moreover, our analysis of agent interactions within AGENTVERSE reveals the emergence of specific collaborative behaviors, contributing to heightened group efficiency. Our code has been released at https://github.com/OpenBMB/AgentVerse/.</p>
<h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>The pursuit of creating intelligent and autonomous agents that can seamlessly assist humans and operate in real-world settings has been a foundational goal in artificial intelligence (Wooldridge \&amp; Jennings, 1995; Minsky, 1988; Bubeck et al., 2023). The recent advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) (OpenAI, 2023a; Anil et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b) has created newfound avenues in this domain. These LLMs, especially GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023a), are particularly adept in comprehending human intent and executing commands. They have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in domains such as language understanding, vision (OpenAI, 2023b), and coding (Bubeck et al., 2023). By harnessing the power of LLMs, autonomous agents can make more nuanced decisions and perform actions with an unprecedented degree of autonomy (Zhou et al., 2023). Agents like AutoGPT (Richards \&amp; et al., 2023), BabyAGI (Nakajima, 2023), and AgentGPT (Reworkd, 2023), are inspiring examples. Furthermore, recent research has endowed autonomous agents with more human-analogous cognitive mechanisms, spanning from reflection (Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023), task decomposition (Wei et al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2023a), and tool utilization (Schick et al., 2023b; Qin et al., 2023a;b; Qian et al., 2023b). These advancements edge us closer to realizing the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI) (Goertzel \&amp; Pennachin, 2007; Clune, 2019) that can generalize across a broader range of tasks.</p>
<p>However, complex real-world tasks often require cooperation among individuals to achieve better effectiveness. Throughout history, numerous studies have delved into methods for enhancing collaboration among humans to improve work efficiency and effectiveness (Woolley et al., 2010; Fehr \&amp; Gächter, 2000). More recently, with the evolution of autonomous agents towards AGI, extensive research conceptualizes the assemblies of agents as a society or group (Li et al., 2023), and focuses on exploring the potential of their cooperation. For example, Park et al. (2023) found emergent</p>

<p><img alt="img-0.jpeg" src="img-0.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 1: An illustration of the AGENTVERSE.
social behaviors in multi-agent life simulation. Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023a); Qian et al. (2023a); Chan et al. (2023) also underscored the enhanced decision-making of collaborating agents during collaborative problem-solving. However, a limitation in these studies is their narrow focus on specific and limited tasks, leaving the generalizability of their findings uncertain. An additional constraint is their static approach to agent collaboration, where agents' roles and capabilities remain rigid, hindering adaptability.</p>
<p>To address this problem, we introduce AGENTVERSE. This general multi-agent framework simulates the problem-solving procedures of human groups, and allows for dynamic adjustment of group members based on current progress. Specifically, AGENTVERSE splits the problem-solving process into four pivotal stages as shown in Figure 1: (1) Expert Recruitment: Determine and adjust the agent group's composition based on the ongoing problem-solving progression. (2) Collaborative Decision-Making: Engage the selected agents in joint discussions to devise problem-solving strategies. (3) Action Execution: Agents interact with their environment to implement the devised actions. (4) Evaluation - Assess the differences between the current state and desired outcomes. If the current state is unsatisfactory, feedback is given to the next iteration for further refinement.</p>
<p>We conduct extensive experiments and case studies in diverse aspects including text understanding, reasoning, coding, tool utilization and embodied AI to show the effectiveness of AGENTVERSE. Additionally, we highlight the social behaviors that emerge from the multi-agent collaboration, and discuss their advantages and potential risks. In summary, our contributions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inspired by the collaborative process of a human team, we propose AGENTVERSE as an effective framework for promoting collaboration among multiple agents in problem-solving.</li>
<li>We conduct extensive experiments to show that AGENTVERSE effectively improve the agents’ understanding, reasoning, coding, tool utilizing capabilities and their potential in embodied AI.</li>
<li>In the multi-agent collaboration, especially within tool utilization and Minecraft game playing, agents manifest certain emergent behaviors. For example, (1) volunteer behaviors, characterized by agents offering assistance to peers, thus improving team efficiency; (2) conformity behaviors, where agents adjust their deviated behaviors to align with the common goal under the critics from others; (3) destructive behaviors, occasionally leading to undesired and detrimental outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2 AGENTVERSE FRAMEWORK</h1>
<p>A problem-solving process is a sequence of iterative stages within a human group (Bransford \&amp; Stein, 1993). Initially, the group assesses the difference between the current state and the desired goal, dynamically adjusting its composition to enhance collaboration in decision-making, and subsequently</p>
<p>executing well-informed actions. In order to enhance the effectiveness of an autonomous multi-agent group in achieving their goals, we simulate the problem-solving processes of a human group to propose the AGENTVERSE framework, which is composed of four crucial stages: Expert Recruitment, Collaborative Decision-Making, Action Execution, and Evaluation, as shown in Figure 1. The entire process can be modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), characterized as a tuple $(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{G})$. This encompasses the autonomous agent and environment state space $\mathcal{S}$, solution and action space $\mathcal{A}$, transition function $\mathcal{T}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{S}$, reward function $\mathcal{R}$, and goal space $\mathcal{G}$.</p>
<h1>2.1 EXPERT RECRUITMENT</h1>
<p>Expert Recruitment stage determines the composition of a multi-agent group, playing an important role in deciding the upper bounds of the group's capabilities. Empirical evidence suggests that diversity within human groups introduces varied viewpoints, enhancing the group's performance across different tasks (Woolley et al., 2015; Phillips \&amp; O'Reilly, 1998). Parallel findings from recent research suggest that designating specific roles for autonomous agents, similar to recruiting experts to form a group, can augment their efficacy (Li et al., 2023; Salewski et al., 2023; Qian et al., 2023a). Current methodologies for assigning role descriptions to autonomous agents predominantly involve manual assignment, necessitating prior knowledge and understanding of the task. Consequently, the scalability remains ambiguous, especially in the face of diverse and intricate problem contexts.</p>
<p>In view of this, AGENTVERSE automates expert recruitment to make agent configuration more scalable. For a given goal $g \in \mathcal{G}$, a particular agent $M_{r}$ is prompted as the "recruiter", similar to a human resource manager. Instead of relying on pre-defined expert descriptions, $M_{r}$ dynamically generates a set of expert descriptions based on $g$. The different agents prompted with these different expert descriptions then form an expert group $\mathcal{M}=M_{r}(g)$ on the given goal $g$. Notably, the composition of a multi-agent group will be dynamically adjusted based on feedback from the evaluation stage (Section 2.4). This allows AGENTVERSE to employ the most suitable group based on the current state to make better decisions in future rounds.</p>
<h3>2.2 COLlaborative DECISION-MAKING</h3>
<p>This stage engages expert agents in collaborative decision-making. To facilitate effective decisionmaking, previous research has investigated the impact of different communication structures among agents (Chan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023b; Wu et al., 2023). We focus on two typical communication structures: horizontal structure and vertical structure, respectively.
Horizontal Structure ( $\square$ In this democratic structure, each agent, denoted as $m_{i} \in \mathcal{M}$, shares and refines its decision $a_{m_{i}}$. The group's collective decision, $A=f\left(\left{a_{m_{i}}\right}<em k="k">{i}\right) \in \mathcal{A}$, emerges as an integration of individual agents' decisions using a function $f$, which might involve techniques like summarization or ensemble. This structure is especially effective in scenarios like consulting and tool using.
Vertical Structure ( $\square$ Conversely, vertical structure has a clear division of roles. An agent, termed the solver $m^{<em>}$, proposes an initial decision $a_{0}^{</em>}$. Other agents, as reviewers, provide feedback on this proposal, prompting iterative refinements by the solver until a consensus is reached among reviewers or a set number of iterations is exhausted. The final decision $A$ is given as $A=a</em>$, with $k$ indicating the number of refinements. Vertical structure is preferable for tasks like math problem-solving and software development, where only one refined decision is required.}^{*} \in \mathcal{A</p>
<h3>2.3 ACTION EXECUTION</h3>
<p>In the decision-making stage, agents collaboratively contribute to a group decision $A$ containing actions that need to be executed in the current environment. Within the action execution stage, agents then execute the collectively-decided actions in the environment. Depending on the implementation, some agents might not perform any execution. As a result of these actions, the state of the environment transitions from $s_{\text {old }}$ to $s_{\text {new }}=\mathcal{T}\left(s_{\text {old }}, A\right)$.</p>
<p>Table 1: The results on different tasks that evaluate the agents’ general capabilities.</p>
<p>| Task | GPT-3.5-Turbo | | | GPT-4 | | |
| | CoT | Solo | Group | CoT | Solo | Group |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Conversation (FED) | 81.6 | 81.1 | 85.1 | 95.4 | 95.8 | 96.8 |
| Creative Writing (Commongen-Challenge) | 76.6 | 93.6 | 92.3 | 95.9 | 99.0 | 99.1 |
| Mathematical Reasoning (MGSM) | 80.4 | 82.4 | 80.8 | 95.2 | 96.0 | 95.2 |
| Logical Reasoning (Logic Grid Puzzles) | - | - | - | 59.5 | 64.0 | 66.5 |</p>
<h1>2.4 Evaluation</h1>
<p>The evaluation stage is vital for AGENTVERSE, guiding improvements for subsequent rounds. At this stage, the feedback mechanism $\mathcal{R}$ assesses the difference between the current state $s_{\text {new }}$ and the desired goal $g \in G$. It then offers verbal feedback $r=\mathcal{R}\left(s_{\text {new }}, g\right)$, detailing areas of shortcoming and suggesting ways to enhance performance. $\mathcal{R}$ can either be defined by humans (in a human-in-the-loop (Amershi et al., 2014) setting) or an agent for automatic feedback, depending on the implementation.</p>
<p>If the goal $g$ remains unmet, the feedback $r$ returns to the initial expert recruitment stage. In the next round, the expert recruitment stage will consider both feedback $r$ and the goal $g$ to adjust the group’s composition, aiming to evolve a more effective multi-agent group according to the current progress.</p>
<h2>3 EXPERIMENTS</h2>
<p>To validate the superiority of AGENTVERSE in facilitating agent collaboration over standalone agents, we design four experimental tasks. Each task is designed to assess distinct aspects of an agent group: general understanding and reasoning capabilities, coding capabilities, tool utilization capabilities, and their potential in Embodied AI. Our findings, which are detailed in this section, consistently highlight the superior performance of AGENTVERSE across these varied and multi-faceted tasks. Of particular interest is the emergence of unique collaborative behaviors within agent groups. While this section focuses on the advantages of multi-agent setups, a deeper exploration of these emergent behaviors will be presented in Section 4.</p>
<p>Setups. In all the experiments, we evaluate the performance of agents driven by GPT-3.5-Turbo0613 and GPT-4-0613 across various tasks. All the experiments are done in zero-shot setting. For all the quantitative experiments in this section, we compare three settings: (1) CoT: The CoT(chain-of-thought) agent; (2) Solo: Using AGENTVERSE with a single agent in the decisionmaking stage. Compared with CoT, Solo additionally incorporates the expert recruitment, action execution, and evaluation modules; (3) Group: Implementing AGENTVERSE with multiple agents collaborating during the decision-making. More detailed experimental setups for each task can be found in Appendix A.</p>
<h3>3.1 GENERAL UNDERSTANDING AND REASONING CAPABILITIES</h3>
<p>To assess the agents’ general understanding and reasoning capabilities, we use four datasets: FED (Mehri \&amp; Eskénazi, 2020), Commongen Challenge (Madaan et al., 2023), MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), and Logic Grid Puzzles (Srivastava et al., 2022). Detailed descriptions of these datasets and metrics can be found in Appendix A. The first two datasets are used to measure the agents’ text understanding and creative writing abilities, while the latter two focus on examining the agents’ reasoning abilities, including mathematical and logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Experimental Results. The results in Table 1 show that agents assembled by AGENTVERSE (Solo and Group setups) consistently outperform the standalone CoT agent, irrespective of the LLM used. In our preliminary evaluations, GPT-3.5-Turbo struggles with accurately handling the logic grid puzzles dataset; therefore, we omit the result of GPT-3.5-Turbo on logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Interestingly, for GPT-3.5-Turbo, the Group setup underperforms the Solo setup in two of three tasks, indicating that the discussion in decision-making might adversely impact performance for agents based on GPT-3.5-Turbo in certain contexts. Delving deeper into this observation, one predominant factor surfaces: the susceptibility to erroneous feedback. A recurring pattern observed in the Group</p>
<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: The illustration of an example process of consulting. The task is to give some suggestions on building a compressed hydrogen storage station in Ohio.
setup is that: sometimes Agent A, despite starting with a correct answer, would be easily swayed by Agent B's incorrect feedback. Roughly $10 \%$ of errors in the MGSM dataset can be traced to this dynamic. Notably, this phenomenon is absent in GPT-4-based agents, highlighting the importance of agents' resilience to conflicting information during collaborative discussions.</p>
<p>Overall, the results show that AGENTVERSE effectively enhances the general understanding and reasoning capabilities of agents. Moreover, agents driven by advanced LLMs demonstrate better performance when engaged in collaborative decision-making. The nuanced challenges observed with GPT-3.5-Turbo indicate the need to improve LLMs' robustness on incorrect information so that the collaboration can amplify individual strengths without introducing new vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Case Study: Consulting. In Table 1, the Group setup does not show a clear advantage over the Solo setup for both LLMs. This is mainly because the evaluation metrics for each benchmark have a limited scope. In the following case, we highlight the benefits of the group formed by GPT-4 agents by focusing on a consulting scenario where the group acts as a consultancy, responding to inquiries as shown in Figure 2. The goal is to offer suggestions for a hydrogen storage station in Ohio.
At first glance, the Solo setup seems to cover a broader scope than the Group setup at round 0. However, the Group setup offers more depth thanks to the recruited experts. For instance, while the Solo setup might suggest something basic like "Find an optimal location", the Group setup provides detailed advice, such as "evaluating site soil properties to ensure storage tank stability." By the second round, different experts offer new insights in the Group setup. As a result, the Group setup not only covers a broader range (highlighted in red in the referenced figure) but also gives more detailed advice. For a detailed look at agent interactions, see Appendix F.</p>
<h1>3.2 CODING CAPABILITIES</h1>
<p>In this section, we first assess the agents' coding capabilities using the Humaneval code completion dataset. Next, through a case study, we illustrate how collaboration among multiple agents improves output quality, highlighting its superiority over software development by just one agent.</p>
<p>Experimental Results. In Table 2, we see a clear performance improvement moving from CoT to Solo and then to Group setup. This trend is especially pronounced with GPT-4, which sees a performance boost from 83.5 to 89.0. These results highlight AGENTVERSE's effectiveness in managing a skilled group of agents for coding. For GPT-3.5-Turbo, although we have observed a drop</p>
<p><img alt="img-2.jpeg" src="img-2.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 3: The illustration of an example process of developing a calculator with GUI in Python.
in performance with Group setup in Section 3.1 due to incorrect agent feedback in math reasoning, the coding evaluations show benefits. We posit that this might be attributed to LLMs' extensive pre-training on codes, potentially rendering them more adept at coding than mathematical reasoning and, consequently, more resilient to erroneous information in coding.</p>

<p>Case Study: Software Development. Our examination of the code generated for Humaneval by the Group setup in AGENTVERSE offers benefits beyond mere correctness. The agent group refines solutions, yielding more efficient, robust, and secure algorithms that are not covered by simple pass@1 metric. To better elucidate these advantages, we present a case study with GPT-4 on software development, a domain requiring multifaceted collaboration and refinement.
We present an example where AGENTVERSE creates a Python-based calculator GUI by bringing together diverse expert agents. A concise development process overview is visualized in Figure 3. Comparing the applications from the Group and Solo setups reveals notable distinctions. Both achieve core functionality, but the Group-created calculator boasts a user-friendly interface with features like color distinctions and keyboard input. This improved design resulted from the diverse feedback of the multi-agent group. Suggestions from UI designer and evaluators enhance the user experience, while software tester enhances code robustness. A deeper examination of the code confirms that the multi-agent group's output excels in exception handling compared to that of a solo agent. The codes generated by the two setups and the complete progress can be seen at Appendix F.</p>
<h1>3.3 TOOL UTILIZATION CAPABILITIES</h1>
<p>The capability of LLMs to use real-world tools has been emphasized in many recent studies (Schick et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023a). By equipping the LLMs with different tools such as a calculator, a web browser, and a code interpreter, the capabilities of LLMs can be significantly improved. In this section, we demonstrate that AGENTVERSE enables a group of agents to address intricate and multi-faceted tasks that require interaction with multiple tools, thereby enhancing work efficiency.</p>
<p>Experimental Results. We design a set of 10 intricate tasks, each requiring the use of at least two distinct tools to accomplish. By providing agents access to several tools, including Bing search API, a web browser, a code interpreter, and task-related APIs, we explore how AGENTVERSE facilitates agent collaboration, dissects the overarching task into manageable sub-tasks, and effectively deploys the available tools to address realistic user queries. Of the $\mathbf{1 0}$ challenging tasks provided, an agent group orchestrated by AGENTVERSE adeptly accomplishes $\mathbf{9}$ tasks. On the other hand, a standalone ReAct agent (Yao et al., 2023b), which is a prevalent agent designed for tool using, can only fulfill $\mathbf{3}$ tasks. In 6 out of 7 tasks where the single ReAct agent fails, the agent does not adhere to one or more criteria detailed in the task, and exit earlier than expected. We refer interested readers to Appendix B for a comprehensive comparison of the solutions given by AGENTVERSE and a single ReAct agent.</p>
<p><img alt="img-3.jpeg" src="img-3.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4: An example process of multi-agent solving user query with three different tools.</p>
<p>Case Study: Solving 24-Point Game and Providing Similar Games. Here, we present an example in Figure 4, illustrating how AGENTVERSE searches for the rules of 24-point game, implements the code along with test cases, and explores similar games. The task is multifaceted; thus, during decision-making stage, the agents split the task into two sub-tasks in their discussion, and each assigned to a certain agent. While agent Charlie overlooks the sub-task of identifying games similar to the 24 -point game in round 0 , feedback from the evaluation module rectifies this in the subsequent iteration. Ultimately, the agent group provides not only the 24 -point game rules and a solving code with test cases, but also a summary of a similar game. In contrast, a standalone ReAct agent merely provides the game's definition along with a code and omits the query for similar games.</p>
<h1>4 Emergent Behaviors within a Multi-agent Group</h1>
<p><img alt="img-4.jpeg" src="img-4.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5: An illustration of the collaborative process involving three agents crafting a bookshelf. The process begins with the decision-making and breaking down the goal into several sub-tasks, with each agent receiving an assignment. The execution results and the current environmental state are then passed to the evaluator. This process repeats until the goal of crafting a bookshelf is achieved.</p>
<p>In the preceding section, the efficacy of AGENTVERSE has been illustrated across a spectrum of tasks that necessitate multi-agent decision-making, especially for GPT-4-based agents. Our endeavor, however, surpasses just improvements on benchmark datasets. We delve deeper into emergent collaborative behaviors exhibited by agents within realistic, embodied AI contexts. Minecraft, a sandbox game, serves as an ideal platform for such exploration due to its intricate parallelisms with real-world dynamics. In the game, agents must not just execute tasks but also plan, coordinate, and adjust to evolving situations. We task agents with collaboratively crafting a variety of items, spanning from paper and paintings to books and bookshelves. A succinct figure showcasing three agents adeptly crafting a bookshelf can be viewed in Figure 5. An elaborate visualization is placed at Appendix F, and details of the setups can be found in Appendix C.</p>
<p>By examining the decision-making process, we identify several emergent behaviors and categorize them into three aspects: volunteer, conformity, and destructive behaviors. Note that these behaviors not necessarily only appear in Minecraft but also in previous experiments such as tool utilization.</p>
<p><img alt="img-5.jpeg" src="img-5.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6: Examples of the properties emerge in the agent interactions in Minecraft.</p>
<h1>4.1 VOLUNTEER BEHAVIORS</h1>
<p>Volunteer behaviors refer to actions intended to enhance the benefits of others in human society (Omoto \&amp; Snyder, 1995; Mowen \&amp; Sujan, 2005). We observe similar behaviors emerging in a multi-agent group as follows:</p>
<p>Time Contribution. The agents are willing to contribute their unallocated time to enhance collaboration efficiency. As shown in the examples in Figure 6 (1a), Alice and Bob need to collaboratively craft 2 paper, which necessitates three sugar canes as the raw material. Initially, Alice proposes that she will collect the sugar canes while Bob waits until the materials are ready. However, this plan is suboptimal, as it offers Bob spare time. Recognizing inefficiency, Bob suggests that both gather sugar canes concurrently, leading to expedited task completion.</p>
<p>Resource Contribution. Our analysis reveals that the agents are willing to contribute the possessed materials. As illustrated in Figure 6 (1b), at the end of the task crafting 2 paper, Alice has collected all the raw materials (sugar canes), whereas Bob possesses the crafting table essential for the paper's creation. In the decision-making stage, Alice suggests transferring her materials to Bob by dropping them on the ground. This enables Bob to utilize them for the intended crafting process.</p>
<p>Assistance Contribution. In the process of accomplishing tasks, we observe that agents, upon completing their individual assignments, actively extend support to their peers, thereby expediting the overall task resolution. As shown in Figure 6 (1c), Alice and Bob have successfully completed their assigned sub-tasks, while Charlie is still struggling to gather three leathers. During the collaborative decision-making phase, Alice and Bob propose to assist Charlie in gathering.</p>
<p>These behaviors highlight how agents willingly contribute their capabilities and efforts to assist other agents, culminating in an accelerated achievement of their mutual goal.</p>
<h1>4.2 CONFORMITY BEHAVIOR</h1>
<p>In human society, individuals tend to adjust their behavior to align with the norms or goals of a group (Cialdini \&amp; Goldstein, 2004; Cialdini \&amp; Trost, 1998), which we refer to as conformity behavior. We also observe similar behaviors within multi-agent groups. As shown in Figure 6 (2), all agents are asked to gather three pieces of leather. However, Charlie gets sidetracked and begins crafting items that do not contribute directly to the task. In the subsequent decision-making stage, Alice and Bob critique Charlie's actions. Charlie acknowledges his mistake and re-focuses on the mutual tasks. The conformity behavior enables agents to align with mutual goals as work progresses.</p>
<h3>4.3 DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR</h3>
<p>Additionally, we have also observed that agents may exhibit behaviors aimed at achieving greater efficiency, which could raise safety concerns. As depicted in Figure 6 (3a) and Figure 6 (3b), an agent occasionally bypasses the procedure of gathering raw materials and resorts to harming other agents or destroying an entire village library to acquire the necessary materials.</p>
<p>With advancements in autonomous agents, deploying them in real-world scenarios has become increasingly plausible. However, the emergence of hazardous behaviors could pose risks, especially when humans are involved in collaborative processes. Thus, designing strategies to prevent agents from adopting such hazardous behaviors is a critical area for future research.</p>
<h2>5 Related Work</h2>
<p>Autonomous Agents. The pursuit of creating autonomous agents that can operate intelligently in real-world environments without human involvement has been a persistent goal throughout the history of AI (Wooldridge \&amp; Jennings, 1995; Minsky, 1988; Bubeck et al., 2023). Recently LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023a; OpenAI, 2023a) have opened up new opportunities to achieve this goal. These LLMs possess remarkable understanding, reasoning, and generation capabilities, allowing autonomous agents to utilize them as a backbone for handling increasingly complex scenarios (Richards \&amp; et al., 2023; Nakajima, 2023; Reworkd, 2023; Liu et al., 2023). However, even though these autonomous agents already demonstrate considerable power, they still lack certain essential human-analogous cognitive capabilities. Hence, some research designs external mechanisms that endow agents with reflection (Yao et al., 2023b; Shinn et al., 2023), task decomposition (Wei et al., 2022b; Yao et al., 2023a), and tool utilization/creation (Schick et al., 2023b; Qin et al., 2023a;b; Qian et al., 2023b) capabilities, which bring autonomous agents closer to achieving artificial general intelligence.</p>
<p>Multi-agent System. In human society, a well-organized group composed of individual humans can often collaboratively handle a greater workload and accomplish complex tasks with higher efficiency and effectiveness. In the field of AI, researchers draw inspiration from human society and aim to enhance work efficiency and effectiveness by leveraging cooperation among individuals through the study of multi-agent systems (MAS) (Stone \&amp; Veloso, 2000), also referred to as a multi-agent group in this paper. The multi-agent group collaboratively makes decisions and executes corresponding actions in a distributed and parallel manner to achieve the common goal, which significantly improves work efficiency and effectiveness. Previous works have leveraged multi-agent joint training to achieve this goal. Recently, some studies have attempted to leverage the intelligence and capabilities of agents for autonomous collaboration. Li et al. (2023) have conceptualized assemblies of agents as a group, and focused on exploring the potential of their cooperation. Park et al. (2023) found social behaviors autonomously emerge within a group of agents, and Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023a); Qian et al. (2023a); Chan et al. (2023) further leverage multi-agent cooperation to achieve better performance on reasoning tasks. Based on these findings, we introduce a framework, denoted as AGENTVERSE, capable of leveraging group cooperation to manage more intricate scenarios. This framework can dynamically adjust its composition according to the current state, aiming to facilitate optimal decision-making and execution.</p>
<h1>6 CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>In this study, we present AGENTVERSE, a novel and general multi-agent framework designed to emulate human group problem-solving processes. Our comprehensive experimental results highlight the efficacy of AGENTVERSE, demonstrating its enhanced performance in comparison to individual agents across a myriad of tasks. These tasks encompass general understanding, reasoning, coding, and tool utilization. Notably, AGENTVERSE consistently delivers remarkable results in addressing intricate user queries when fortified with the appropriate tools. In our investigations within the Minecraft environment, we identify both positive and negative emergent social behaviors among agents. As advancements in artificial general intelligence progress, understanding multi-agent interactions should become increasingly crucial. AGENTVERSE serves as a valuable step toward this endeavor, and we are optimistic about its potential adaptability and refinement for a wider array of tasks and contexts in the future.</p>

<h1>A CONFIGURATIONS OF THE EXPERIMENTS</h1>
<p>Datasets and Evaluation Metrics Our evaluation assesses different aspects of agents, including general understanding and reasoning capabilities, coding capabilities and tool utilization capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>General Understanding Capabilities: We utilize two datasets. The first one is a Dialogue response dataset, FED (Mehri \&amp; Eskénazi, 2020), where given a multi-round chat history, the agent or agent group is required to generate the next chat. Following previous work (Madaan et al., 2023), we utilize GPT-4 as the evaluator to score the agent-generated response against the human-written ones, and report the agent's win rate. The second dataset is CommongenChallenge (Madaan et al., 2023), which is a constrained generation dataset where given 20 concepts, the agent is required to generate a coherent and grammatically correct paragraph containing as many concepts as possible. We report the average percentage of the covered concepts.</li>
<li>General Reasoning Capabilities: We utilize the English subset of MGSM (Shi et al., 2023), which is a subset of GSM-8k (Cobbe et al., 2021), to evaluate the agents' mathematical reasoning capabilities. It is a dataset containing grade school math problems. We report the percentage of the correct answers. And we use the logic grid puzzles task from BigBench (Srivastava et al., 2022), which contains logic problems that requires multi-step logic reasoning, to assess the agents' logical reasoning capabilities. We report the accuracy.</li>
<li>Coding Capabilities: We utilize Humaneval (Chen et al., 2021), which is a code completion dataset, and report Pass@1 metric ${ }^{1}$</li>
<li>Tool Utilization Capabilities: Since automatic evaluation on the performance of tool utilization is difficult, and there is currently no relevant benchmark, we craft 10 complex instructions and manually assess the performance. The instructions are listed in Appendix B.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expert Recruitment For tasks including dialogue response, code completion, and constrained generation, four agents is recruited into the system. For the task of mathematical reasoning, we limited the number to two agents. This decision was based on our observation that an increase in the number of reviewers for mathematical reasoning tasks correlates with a higher likelihood of them giving erroneous critiques, leading to incorrect solutions by the solver. We have a discussion on this topic in Section 3.1. For tool utilization, we recruit two or three agents to engage in collaborative decision-making and action execution depending on the specific task. The detailed setups are listed at Appendix B. Currently the number of experts is pre-defined by us for each task. We are seeking a way to automate this decision as well.</p>
<p>Collaborative Decision-Making For tasks in coding and general understanding and reasoning, we use the vertical structure because all these tasks require only one response as the answer, and the solver in the vertical structure can be responsible for answering. For tool utilization, we use the horizontal structure because the agents should clarify their own sub-tasks in the discussion.</p>
<p>Action Execution For the Humaneval code completion dataset benchmarked with GPT-4, we incorporate an additional agent during the action execution stage to craft unit testing code (in an zero-shot manner). Subsequently, the generated code is subjected to unit testing, and the testing results are conveyed as the environment state to the evaluation module.</p>
<p>Regarding the constrained generation dataset, Commongen-Challenge, the agent-generated response undergoes a concept coverage check. Any missing concepts are then passed to the evaluation module as the environment state.</p>
<p>In the context of tool utilization, each agent iteratively calls the tool in the ReAct manner, up to a maximum of 10 iterations. Upon reaching the final iteration, the agent is forced to draw a conclusion regarding the result, labeling the task's status as either "pending" or "finished". These conclusions are then forwarded to the evaluator for assessment.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref2:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Evaluation To facilitate a feedback loop, an agent was tasked with the role of evaluator. This agent, provided with the initial problem $p$ and the decisions $A$ made during the collaborative decisionmaking stage, is charged with determining the correctness of those decisions. In cases where the decision is identified as erroneous, feedback is channeled back to the expert recruitment stage. If the decision meets the accuracy criteria, it is determined as the final answer to $p$. While our current configuration employs an agent for evaluation, we acknowledge the potential of human evaluators and intend to incorporate such experiments in future endeavors.</p>
<h1>B EXPERIMENT Details for Multi-Agent Tool Using</h1>
<h2>B. 1 SEtuPS</h2>
<p>This section provides specific implementation details for enabling multiple agents in AGENTVERSE to collaboratively utilize tools to accomplish user's query. Unless specified herein, the implementation adheres to the standard procedures defined in the other experiments.</p>
<p>Collaborative Decision-Making Agents recruited during the Expert Recruitment stage engage in collaborative discussions regarding the assigned task using a horizontal communication structure. In this configuration, agents communicate in a predetermined sequential order. At the conclusion of their discussions, an additional agent is designated as the "summarizer" and is responsible for consolidating the discussed sub-tasks for each participant.</p>
<p>Action Execution During action execution, we follow the ReAct prompting technique to let the agents write down their thought, and then call the tool, and we return the tool response to the agent. The agent again write down the thought and call the tools. The process iterates until the agent decide to submit its conclusion, or a maximum iteration number, which we set to be 10 , is reached. In practice, we use OpenAI's function call to handle the tools.</p>
<h2>B. 2 ReSults</h2>
<p>For action execution, the ReAct prompting technique is employed. Agents articulate their thought process, invoke the respective tool, and subsequently receive feedback from the tool. This cycle of reflection and tool interaction continues iteratively. The process concludes either when the agent finalizes its execution with its conclusion or after a pre-set maximum number of iterations-set (10 in our experiments). We utilize OpenAI's function call to handle the tool calls.</p>
<p>Instruction 1 Recently, it has become popular in the AI field to verify the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models by observing if they can solve the "24-Point Game." What is this game? Does it have a code-based solution? If it does, provide a Python code along with test cases and test its functionality. What are some other similar games that can be used to test the models' mathematical reasoning abilities?
Single ReAct Agent: (The generated code is omitted) The '24-Point Game' is a mathematical game where four numbers must be used with the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to make the number 24. The Python code I developed generates all possible combinations of the four numbers and operations to find a solution that equals 24 . The code was tested with different sets of numbers, and it correctly identified whether a solution existed and what it was. This task tested my ability to understand the rules of a game and to develop and test a program that solves it. (game rule $\boldsymbol{\checkmark}$, code $\boldsymbol{\checkmark}$, similar games $\boldsymbol{\square}$ )
AGENTVERSE (2 agents): (The generated code is omitted) The "24-Point Game" is a mathematical game where four numbers must be used with the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to make the number 24. A Python code was developed and tested that generates all possible combinations of the four numbers and operations to find a solution that equals 24 . The code was tested with different sets of numbers, and it correctly identified whether a solution existed and what it was. Similar games to the '24-Point Game' that can be used to test mathematical reasoning abilities include 'Make a Number' and 'Math Safe'. 'Make a Number' is a game where players are given 4 numbers and 4 operations and they have to use these to create a target number. 'Math Safe' is a game where players use four given single-digit numbers and any of</p>
<p>the four operations to reach a target number and open a safe. Both these games require the use of operations and logical thinking to reach a target number, similar to the '24-Point Game'. (game rule $\checkmark$, code $\checkmark$, similar games $\checkmark$ )</p>
<p>Instruction 2 (Additional API: Weather) I want to hold a party at somewhere around Tsinghua University tomorrow. I need you to look for some best places for holding a party nearby, and tell me whether the weather is good for holding a party tomorrow. Also, I want to know what activities can be considered in my party. Help me search the web.</p>
<p>Single ReAct Agent: There are several restaurants near Tsinghua University that could be good places for a party, including Lan Yang ShuFang, YiLan ShaoKao, Guan Shi JiChi, Dong Lai Shun, and Xibu Mahua Beef Noodle.

Include details about range, charging time, safety features, and after-sales service. Also, provide a brief analysis of the pros and cons of each car.</p>
<p>Single ReAct Agent: The 2023 Tesla Model 3 starts at $\$ 41,880$ and goes up to $\$ 54,880$. It comes with standard features such as heated front seats, navigation, and Tesla's Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system. In terms of safety features, the Model 3 includes standard automated emergency braking, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control. Tesla's after-sales service is characterized by a vertically integrated format that eliminates third-party intermediaries and relies on over-the-air (OTA) update capabilities and a mobile service fleet. The company's OTA update capabilities will open up new subscription-based aftersales revenue streams, while its closed-loop system allows access to vehicle data for driving-related feedback loops and predictive maintenance. (Tesla $\boldsymbol{\checkmark}$, Other brands $\boldsymbol{\aleph}$ )</p>
<p>AGENTVERSE (3 agents): The starting price for the 2023 Ford Mustang Mach-E is around \$43,895 and it takes approximately 38 hours to fully charge using a 120 V outlet, 14 hours using a 240 V outlet, and around 45 minutes to $80 \%$ capacity with DC fast charging. The starting price for the 2023 Toyota bZ4X is approximately $\$ 42,000$. The charging time varies depending on the method: 52 hours for Level 1 charging, 26 hours or 18.75 hours for Level 2 charging, and 30-45 minutes to $80 \%$ capacity for Level 3 DC fast charging. Unfortunately, the price for the 2023 Tesla Model 3 was not found, but the charging time can be as quick as 15 minutes with a 250 kW Tesla Supercharger. At home, using a standard 120-volt outlet takes around three to four days for a full charge, while a 240 -volt outlet with a NEMA 14-50 adapter reduces charging time to 10 or 11 hours. A Tesla Wall Connector can fully charge the car in about five hours.</p>
<p>In terms of safety, all three models come equipped with a variety of features such as anti-lock brakes, stability control, front-impact airbags, side impact airbags, overhead airbags, knee airbags, pretensioners, and a security system. The Tesla Model 3 also includes autopilot and collision warning features.</p>
<p>Regarding after-sales service, Tesla offers a comprehensive warranty and roadside assistance with service centers across the globe and mobile service. Toyota's after-sales service is known for being top-notch and continually improving with expert technicians and quality genuine parts. However, Ford's after-sales service has received negative reviews, with customers reporting poor customer support and inefficient handling of issues.</p>
<p>Please consider these factors when making your decision. (Prices $\boldsymbol{\checkmark}$, charging time, safety features, after-sales service)</p>
