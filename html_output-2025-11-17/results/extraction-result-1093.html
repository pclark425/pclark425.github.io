                <p><strong>Paper Title:</strong> AIR FORCE OFFICE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This report summarizes three areas of research investigated under the Air Force grant: (i) balancing exploration and exploitation when performing reinforcement learning in POMDPs; (ii) proper sharing of information when performing POMDP-based reinforcement learning on a network; and (Hi) topic modeling for time-evolving systems, with the latter now being transitioned to cybersecurity. For research thrust (i), a fundamental objective in reinforcement learning is the maintenance of a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. This problem becomes more challenging when the agent can only partially observe the states of its environment. In this project we propose a dual-policy method for jointly learning the agent behavior and the balance between exploration exploitation, in partially observable environments. The method subsumes traditional exploration, in which the agent takes actions to gather information about the environment, and active learning, in which the agent queries an oracle for optimal actions (with an associated cost for employing the oracle). The form of the employed exploration is dictated by the specific problem. Theoretical guarantees are provided concerning the optimality of the balancing of exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by experimental results on benchmark problems. For research thrust [ii), the Dirichlet process (DP) has proven a powerful nonparametric prior in multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL). A drawback of the DP prior is that it either encourages global clustering based on all parameters, or it encourages independent local clustering based on subsets of parameters. In this report we generalize the MTRL framework by employing the nonparametric dependent local partition process (LPP) as a prior to promote simultaneous local and global clustering. We provide theoretical analysis of the correlated local clustering structure induced by the LPP and show the structure facilitates information-sharing between partially similar RL tasks. We develop the LPP-based MTRL framework assuming the environment in each RL task is an unknown partially observable Markov decision process, and we provide experimental results to demonstrate the advantage of the LPP-based MTRL. For research thrust (ii), we consider the problem of inferring and modeling topics in a sequence of documents with known publication dates. The documents at a given time are each characterized by a topic, and the topics are drawn from a mixture model. The proposed model infers the change in the topic mixture weights as a function of time. The details of this general framework may take different forms, depending on the specifics of the model. For the examples considered here we examine base measures based on independent multinomial-Dirichlet measures for representation of topic-dependent word counts. The form of the hierarchical model allows efficient variational Bayesian (VB) inference, of interest for large-scale problems. We demonstrate results and make comparisons to the model when the dynamic character is removed, and also compare to latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and topics over time (TOT). We consider a database of NIPS papers as well as the United States presidential State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2008. This is a demonstration of the technology, which is now being transitioned to time-evolving data from a computer network. I. EXPLORING AND EXPLOITING IN POMDPS A fundamental challenge facing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms is to maintain a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. The policy designed based on previous experiences is by construction constrained, and may not be optimal as a result of inexperience. Therefore, it is desirable to take actions with the goal of enhancing experience. Although these actions may not necessarily yield optimal near-term reward toward the ultimate goal, they could, over a long horizon, yield improved long-term reward. The fundamental challenge is to achieve an optimal balance between exploration and exploitation; the former is performed with the goal of enhancing experience and preventing premature convergence to suboptimal behavior, and the latter is performed with the goal of employing available experience to define perceived optimal actions. For a Markov decision process (MDP), the problem of balancing exploration and exploitation has been addressed successfully by the E [1], [2] and R-max [3] algorithms. Many important applications, however, have environments whose states are not completely observed, leading to partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). Reinforcement learning in POMDPs is challenging, particularly in the context of balancing exploration and exploitation. Recent work targeted on solving the exploration vs. exploitation problem is based on an augmented POMDP, with a product state space over the environment states and the unknown POMDP parameters [4]. This, however, entails solving a complicated planning problem, which has a state space that grows exponentially with the number of unknown parameters, making the problem quickly intractable in practice. To mitigate this complexity, active learning methods have been proposed for POMDPs, which borrow similar ideas from supervised learning, and apply them to selectively query an oracle (domain expert) for the optimal action [5]. Active learning has found success in many collaborative human-machine tasks where expert advice is available. In this report we propose a dual-policy approach to balance exploration and exploitation in POMDPs, by simultaneously learning two policies with partially shared internal structure. The first policy, termed the primary policy, defines actions based on previous experience; the second policy, termed the auxiliary policy, is a meta-level policy maintaining a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. We employ the regionalized policy representation (RPR) [6] to parameterize both policies, and perform Bayesian learning to update the policy posteriors. The approach applies in either of two cases: (/) the agent explores by randomly taking the actions that have been insufficiently tried before (traditional exploration), or (//') the agent explores by querying an oracle for the optimal action (active learning). In the latter case, the agent is assessed a query cost from the oracle, in addition to the reward received from the environment. Either (/) or (/';') is employed as an exploration vehicle, depending upon the application. The dual-policy approach possesses interesting convergence properties, similar to those of E [2] and Rmax [3]. However, our approach assumes the environment is a POMDP while E and Rmax both assume an MDP environment. Another distinction is that our approach learns the agent policy directly from episodes, without estimating the POMDP model. This is in contrast to E and Rmax (both learn MDP models) and the active-learning method in [5] (which learns POMDP models). II. REGIONALIZED POLICY REPRESENTATION We first provide a brief review of the regionalized policy representation, which is used to parameterize the primary policy and the auxiliary policy as discussed above. The material in this section is taken from [6], with the proofs omitted here. Definition 2.1: A regionalized policy representation is a tuple (A.O.Z.W, p.ir). The A and O are respectively a finite set of actions and observations. The 2 is a finite set of belief regions. The W is the belief-region transition function with W(z.a.o'.z') denoting the probability of transiting from z to z' when taking action a in z results in observing d. The p. is the initial distribution of belief regions with fi(z) denoting the probability of initially being in z. The n are the region-dependent stochastic policies with n(z,a) denoting the probability of taking action a in z. We denote A = {1,2 \A\}, where |.4| is the cardinality of A. Similarly, O = {1,2 \0\} and Z = {1,2 \Z\}. We abbreviate (ao,Oi ,aj) as a^j and similarly, (oi.o2 ar) as O\-T and (ZQ, Z\ zj) as ZQ-T, where the subscripts indexes discrete time steps. The history ht = {ao:f-i. Oi-t} is defined as a sequence of actions performed and observations received up to t. Let 0 = {IT, //. W} denote the RPR parameters. Given ht, the RPR yields a joint probability distribution of z0:t and a0.t as follows By marginalizing c0:/ out in (11), we obtain p(aO:t|oi:t.0). Furthermore, the history-dependent distribution of action choices is obtained as follows: p(aT\hT.Q) =p(aO;T|oi:r.0)[p(aO:T_i|o1:T_1.0)] -l which gives a stochastic policy for choosing the action aT. The action choice depends solely on the historical actions and observations, with the unobservable belief regions marginalized out. A. Learning Criterion Bayesian learning of the RPR is based on the experiences collected from the agent-environment interaction. Assuming the interaction is episodic, i.e., it breaks into subsequences called episodes [7], we represent the experiences by a set of episodes. Definition 2.2: An episode is a sequence of agent-environment interactions terminated in an absorbing state that transits to itself with zero reward. An episode is denoted by (aQr^o^a^ • • • Oja^ rj ), where the subscripts are discrete times, k indexes the episodes, and o, a, and r are respectively observations, actions, and immediate rewards. Definition 2.3: (The RPR Optimality Criterion) Let V = {{alr%o ar • • • o^a^4j}^=1 be a set of episodes obtained by an agent interacting with the environment by following policy fl to select actions, where n is an arbitrary stochastic policy with action-selecting distributions p(at\ht) > 0, V action au V history ht. The RPR optimality criterion is defined as where h = aQo\a ''' °t * me history of actions and observations up to time f in the k-th episode, 0 < 7 < 1 is the discount, and 0 denotes the RPR parameters. Throughout the report, we call V(V^:Q) the empirical value function of ©. It is proven </p>
