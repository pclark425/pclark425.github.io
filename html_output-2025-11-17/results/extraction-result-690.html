                <p><strong>Paper Venue:</strong> IEEE Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories</p>
                <p><strong>Paper TL;DR:</strong> Google search is used to investigate the alignment ofusability and the natural language annotations around code snippets, and explore how to make snippets in Stack Overflow an adequate base for future automatic program generation.</p>
                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Enriched by natural language texts, Stack Overflow code snippets arean invaluable code-centric knowledge base of small units ofsource code. Besides being useful for software developers, theseannotated snippets can potentially serve as the basis for automatedtools that provide working code solutions to specific natural languagequeries. With the goal of developing automated tools with the Stack Overflowsnippets and surrounding text, this paper investigates the followingquestions: (1) How usable are the Stack Overflow code snippets? and(2) When using text search engines for matching on the naturallanguage questions and answers around the snippets, what percentage ofthe top results contain usable code snippets?A total of 3M code snippets are analyzed across four languages: C\#,Java, JavaScript, and Python. Python and JavaScript proved to be thelanguages for which the most code snippets are usable. Conversely,Java and C\# proved to be the languages with the lowest usabilityrate. Further qualitative analysis on usable Python snippets showsthe characteristics of the answers that solve the original question. Finally,we use Google search to investigate the alignment ofusability and the natural language annotations around code snippets, andexplore how to make snippets in Stack Overflow anadequate base for future automatic program generation.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Enriched by natural language texts, Stack Overflow code snippets are an invaluable code-centric knowledge base of small units of source code. Besides being useful for software developers, these annotated snippets can potentially serve as the basis for automated tools that provide working code solutions to specific natural language queries.</p>
<p>With the goal of developing automated tools with the Stack Overflow snippets and surrounding text, this paper investigates the following questions: (1) How usable are the Stack Overflow code snippets? and (2) When using text search engines for matching on the natural language questions and answers around the snippets, what percentage of the top results contain usable code snippets?</p>
<p>A total of 3 M code snippets are analyzed across four languages: C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. Python and JavaScript proved to be the languages for which the most code snippets are usable. Conversely, Java and C# proved to be the languages with the lowest usability rate. Further qualitative analysis on usable Python snippets shows the characteristics of the answers that solve the original question. Finally, we use Google search to investigate the alignment of usability and the natural language annotations around code snippets, and explore how to make snippets in Stack Overflow an adequate base for future automatic program generation.</p>

adapt to their needs [13, 4, 9]. Among the many good sites for this purpose, Stack Overflow (SO, from here onwards) is one of the most popular destinations in Google search results. Over the years, SO has accumulated an impressive amount of programming knowledge consisting of snippets of code together with relevant natural language explanations. Besides being useful for developers, SO can potentially be used as a knowledge base for tools that automatically combine snippets of code in order to obtain more complex behavior. Moreover those more complex snippets could be retrieved by matches on the natural language (i.e. non-coding information) that enriches the small snippets in SO.</p>
<p>As an illustrative example, consider searching for "java parse words in string" using Google Web search. This yields several results in SO, one of which is shown in Figure 1. The snippet of code provided with the answer that was accepted is almost executable as-is by copy-paste. The job of</p>
<p>programmers becomes, to a large extent, to glue together these snippets of code that do some generic functionality by themselves. The fact that a Web search engine returned this SO page as one of the top hits for our query closes in on one of the hardest parts of program synthesis, namely the expression of complex program specifications. Hence, it is conceivable that tools might be developed that would do that gluing job automatically given a high-level specification in natural language.</p>
<p>In pursuing this goal, the first challenge one faces is whether, and to what extent, the existing snippets of code that are suggested by Web search results are usable as-is. If there are not enough usable snippets of code, the process of repairing them automatically for further composition may be out of reach. This paper presents research in this direction, by showing the results of our investigation of the following questions:
(1) How usable are the SO code snippets?
(2) When using Web search engines for matching on the natural language questions and answers around the snippets, what percentage of the top results contain usable code snippets?</p>
<p>In order to compare the usability of different pieces of code, we need to define what usability is in the first place. We classified snippets of code based on the effort that would (potentially) be required by a program generation tool to use the snippet as-is. Usability is therefore defined based on the standard steps of parsing, compiling and running source code. For each of these steps, if the source code passes, the more likely it is that the tool can use it with minimum effort.</p>
<p>Given this definition of usability, there are situations where a snippet that does not parse is more useful than the one that runs, but passing these steps assures us of important characteristics of the snippet, such as the code being syntactically and structurally correct, or all the dependencies being readily available, which are of surmount importance for automation.</p>
<p>We first study the percentages of parsable, compilable and runnable (where these steps apply) snippets for each of the four most popular programming languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python). ${ }^{1}$ From the results, we saw a significant difference in repair effort (usability) between the statically-typed the dynamically-typed languages, the latter being far less effort. Next, we focused on the best performing language (Python) and conducted a 3 -step qualitative analysis to see if the runnable snippets can actually answer questions correctly and completely. Finally, in order to close the circle, we use Google Search in order to find out the extent to which the SO snippets suggested by the top Google results are usable. Being able to find a large percentage of usable snippets among the top search results for informal queries, the idea of automating snippet repair and composition, and finding those synthetic pieces of code via informal Web queries becomes within the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the overall research methodology and</p>
<p><sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>environment of our work. The results of qualitative analysis are explained in Section 3. In Section 4 we investigate the usability and quality of top results from Google Web search. In Section 5, we present the related work in the areas of SO analyses, enhancing coding environments, and automated code generation. Section 6 concludes the paper.</p>
<h2>2. USABILITY RATES</h2>
<p>This section describes our usability study of SO snippets. In 2.1, we elaborate upon our goal. In 2.2, we describe the characteristics of the extracted snippets. In 2.3, we present the operations that were carried out on the snippets of each language. We also describe the libraries that were used to process the snippets for each of the languages, and highlight the limitations found ${ }^{2}$. In 2.4 and 2.6 , we present the usability rates and error messages for each language. ÆŠ</p>
<h3>2.1 Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal is to compare the usability rates for the snippets of four programming languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python) as they exist in SO, i.e., in small snippets of code. We also want compare the languages regarding their static or dynamic nature, and target the most usable language. In our study, snippets in Java and C#, which are statically-typed, are parsed and compiled in order to assess their usability level. JavaScript does not have the process of compilation, so we investigate only the parsing and running levels for it. Python is also a dynamic language but it can be compiled. However, this step is not as important as it is for Java and C#, as important errors (such as name bindings) are not checked at compile time. As such, for Python, like for JavaScript, we assess usability only by parsing and running the snippets.</p>
<h3>2.2 Snippets Extraction</h3>
<p>All snippets were extracted from the dump available at the Stack Exchange data dump site ${ }^{3}$.</p>
<p>In SO both questions and answers are considered as posts, which are stored with unique ids in a table called Posts. In this table, posts that represent questions and answers are distinguished by the field PostTypeId. Information about posts can be obtained by accessing the field Body.</p>
<p>There are two types of answers in SO, accepted answer and best answer. An accepted answer is the answer chosen by the original poster of the question to be the most suitable. All question posts have an AcceptedAnswerId field from which we can identify accepted answers when these exist. The best answer is the one which has the most number of votes from other SO users. The vote count is stored in the field ViewCount of the table Posts. Thus, an accepted answer may not always be the best answer.</p>
<p>Finally, in SO, questions are tagged with their subject areas, which include relevant information such as the language or the domain where the question is relevant (networking, text processing, etc.). We get the language information for each accepted answer from these tags, one example on how the social nature of SO helps categorizing and selecting pieces of code.</p>

<p><img alt="img-1.jpeg" src="img-1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Figure 2: Sequence of operations</p>
<p>In this work, we only include snippets found in all accepted answers. We choose accepted these as we value the agreement from the original poster, accepting the fact that it is very likely this answer resolved the original problem. For all posts for a language we were interested in, we used the the markdown <code> to extract the code snippets from the field Body.</p>
<h3>2.3 Snippets Processing</h3>
<p>In Table 1 we present the operations we performed to analyze and rate each of language. All the snippets from all languages were parsed, but depending on the static or dynamic nature of the language we either compiled it and analyzed the (possible) errors, or ran the language (below we detail these processes).</p>

<p>Figure 2 shows the order in which these operations are performed. We compile (or run) only those snippets which passed parsing, since snippets which are unparsable have syntactic errors and therefore are also non-compilable/nonrunnable.</p>
<p>We used a set of tools and APIs to process the snippets in the various languages, which we present next:</p>
<h3>2.3.1 C</h3>
<p>For parsing we utilize a tool called Roslyn by Microsoft to obtain the parsable snippets. Roslyn provides for the Visual Studio languages rich APIs for different phases of compilation. In particular, Roslyn provides us with the API for getting the abstract syntax tree, which is the landmark of parsing process. Syntax errors will be detected in this step.</p>
<p>Compiling C# programmatically can be easily done by using a functionality provided by the .NET Framework and found in the Microsoft .CSharp and System. CodeDom. Compiler namespaces. We need to call the function that compiles the code, and results of whether a snippet compiles or not are returned together with errors if applicable.</p>
<h3>2.3.2 Java</h3>
<p>Eclipse's JDT (Java Development Tools) Parser (ASTParser) and the Javax.Tools were used for the parsing and compiling processes, respectively. We use JDT1.7 in our experiments since it's the latest version for our data dump.
Using the JDT's ASTParser we generated abstract syntax trees of the snippets, and any parse errors found during the process were extracted via the IProblems interface.</p>
<p>Javax.Tools compilation functionality first creates a dynamic source code file object of the Java snippet, from which it generates a list of compilation units, which are passed as parameters to the CompilationTask object for compilation. Issues during compilation are stored in a Diagnostics object. Issues could be of the following kinds: ERROR, MANDATORY_WARNING, NOTE, OTHER, WARNING. We only look for issues which are of kind ERROR, as they are the ones more likely prevent the normal completion of compilation.</p>
<h3>2.3.3 JavaScript</h3>
<p>A reflection of the SpiderMonkey parser is included in the SpiderMonkey JavaScript Shell and is made available as a JavaScript API. It parses a string as a JavaScript program and returns a Program object representing the parsed abstract syntax tree. Syntax errors are thrown if parsing fails. JavaScript Shell has also a built-in function eval() to execute JavaScript code, which we used if parsing succeed.</p>
<p>A limitation of the SpiderMonkey parser is that it terminates the processing of a snippet right when it encounters the first error. Therefore, it does not identify all the errors in a snippet, only the first one, but this suffices to detect problems in the code.</p>
<h3>2.3.4 Python</h3>
<p>Python's built-in AST module and compile() method can help us parse code strings. Python is a special language among dynamic languages: it has the process of building abstract syntax tree into Python code objects, so it has the compile function. But when we specify one of the function parameters to be AST only, it only parse the code by building the AST. exec statement provides functionality to run code strings.</p>
<p>One problem we encountered in processing Python snippets was that Python2 and Python3 have some incompatible language features. To deal with snippets written in different versions of Python, and to avoid being biased when rating these pieces of code, we first examined all Python snippets under Python2 engine, and examined the unparsable ones again under the Python3 engine and combine the results. The Python libraries share the same limitation as JavaScript's SpiderMonkey; they do not catch all the errors in a snippet, only the first one.</p>
<h3>2.4 Findings</h3>
<p>We present the results that were obtained after the initial parsing and compiling (or running) of the snippets.</p>
<p>Table 2 and Figure 3 shows the summary of usability results of all the snippets. A total of 3 M code snippets were analyzed. Python and JavaScript proved to be the languages for which the most code snippets are usable: 537,767 (65.88\%) JavaScript snippets are parsable and 163,247 (20.00\%) of them are runnable; for Python, 402,249 (76.22\%) are parsable and 135,147 (25.61\%) are runnable. Conversely, Java and C# proved to be the languages with the lowest usability rate: 129,727 (16.00\%) C# snippets are parsable but only 986 ( $0.12 \%$ ) of them are compilable; for Java, only 35,619 (3.89\%) are parsable and 9,177 (1.00\%) compile.</p>
<p>As a result of finding such low parsable and compilable rates for Java and C#, we removed Java and C# snippets</p>

<p>that only contained single words (i.e. tokens without non-alphabetical characters). The rationale behind this step was to that a single word in C# or Java is too insignificant a candidate for composability; by ignoring those snippets we might improve the usability rates for these two languages. We then parsed and compiled the remaining snippets, the results of which are shown in Table 3. We see that the rates of usability improve for both languages, and for both parsing and compilation. For Java, the parsable rate increases from 3.89% to 6.22%, and the compilable rate increases from 1.00% to 1.60%. For C#, the parsable rate increases from 16.00% to 25.18%, and the compilable rate increases from 0.12% to 0.19%.</p>

<h3>2.5 Snippet Examples</h3>
<p>Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show examples of SO snippets that passed and failed for each language. For those that failed, we also show the generated error messages. The examples are representative of the most common error messages.</p>
<p>The unparsable Python snippet in Figure 7 also illustrates a common occurrence in SO posts, where the example code is given more or less as pseudo-code that mixes the syntax of several languages.</p>

<p>Figure 14: Example of Google Search Result
selected, 85 original ones were returned as the first hit by Google. Although 15 original links were not ranked as Top 1,12 of them were in Top 10. The reason for them not being the first one is that Google seems to have a special heuristic to dealing with "daterange" restrictions. If we remove the "daterange" restriction in our search query, the original ones will appear in Top 1. However, 3 out of 100 queries were not in Top 10 list by Google. We looked at these three cases: one is because of the date range restriction, the second one is because it is a new query out of our date range, and the last one seems to genuinely be because of Google ranking algorithms.</p>
<p>The very high hit rate and, in particular, the top 1 results, confirm Google's efficiency in retrieving relevant information from the Web, something that our work leverages, by design. However, the usability rates on the top hits were encouragingly high, and that is orthogonal to Google's efficiency in finding the most relevant results. These higher-than-average usability rates may be because we used the most popular queries; users of SO value complete answers that have good code snippets, so it is not surprising that the most popular queries have snippets that are better than average.</p>
<p>In general, users search using words that are not exactly the same as the words in the SO questions, so the best snippet of code for their needs may not be in the first position; but, as it is usually the case with Google, it is likely in the top 10 positions. The usability of the snippets in the top 10 positions were not as high, but they were still very high ( $78 \%$ parsable, $29 \%$ runnable), and above average of the entire set of Python snippets.</p>
<p>The Google search results over SO snippets are very encouraging. They show that it is possible to go from informal queries in natural language to relatively usable, and correct, code in a large percentage of cases, opening the door to the old idea of programming environments that "do what I mean" [12]. This is possible now due to the emergence of very large mixed-language knowledge bases such as SO.</p>
<h2>5. RELATED WORK</h2>
<p>Various studies have been done on SO, but focus primarily on user behavior and their interactions with one another. These works made attempts at identifying correlations between different traits of SO users. For example [5] showed a correlation between the age and reputation of a user by exploring hypotheses such as the fact that older users having a</p>
<p>bigger knowledge of more technologies and services. Shaowei et al. [14] provided an empirical study on the interactions of developers in SO, revealing statistics on developers' questioning and answering habits. For instance, they found that a few developers ask and answer many questions. This social research might be important for our prioritization of snippets of code.</p>
<p>Among the works that utilize code available in the public domain for enhancing development is that of Wong et al. [15]. They devised a tool that automatically generates comments for software projects by searching for accompanying comments to SO code that are similar to the project code. They did so by relying on clone detection, but never tried to actually use the snippets of code. This work is very similar to Ponzanelli et al. [10] in terms of the approach adopted. Both mine for SO code snippets that are clones to a snippet in the client system, but Ponzanelli et al.'s goal was to integrate SO into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and seamlessly obtain code prompts from SO when coding.</p>
<p>Ponzanelli was involved in another work [1], where they presented an Eclipse plugin, Seahawk, that also integrates SO within the IDE. It can add support to code by linking files to SO discussions, and can also generate comments to IDE code. Similarly, Thummalapenta et al. [11] present a tool called PARSEWeb that assists in reusing open source frameworks or libraries by providing an efficient means for retrieving them from open source code.</p>
<p>With regards to assessing the usability of code, our central motivation, our study comes close to Nasehi et al.'s work [6]. They also analyzed SO code with the motivation of finding out how easy it is to reuse it. In particular, they delved into finding the characteristics of a good example. The difference for our approach was their criteria for assessing the usability of the code. They adopted a holistic approach and analyzed the characteristics of high voted answers and low voted answers. They enlisted traits related to a wide range of attributes of the answers by analyzing both the code and the contextual information. They looked into the overall organization of the answer - the number of code blocks used in the answer, the conciseness of the code, the presence of links to other resources, the presence of alternate solutions, code comments, etc. The execution behavior of the code was not among their usability criteria.</p>
<p>Semi-automatic or automatic programming, a development realm towards which this work takes an initial step, has also been explored in different ways by software practitioners. For instance, Budinskey et al. [2] and Frederick et al. [3], analyze how design patterns could assist in automatically generating software code. Other similar works include [7], [16], and [8]. The similarity in these works is that structured abstractions of code provide a good indicator about the actual implementation. They built tools that exploit this narrative and generate implementations from design patterns. Such a strategy would be highly challenging to use when trying to reproduce usable SO code (with respect to compilation), as those codes are usually small snippets that do not follow familiar patterns.</p>
<h2>6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Some of our experiment choices deserve an explanation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In SO, the concepts of accepted answer and best an-
swer are different. Accepted answer is the one approved by the questioner, while best answer is voted by all viewers. We chose accepted answer in this work because we believe that in a Question\&amp;Answer forum as SO, the questioner the one who has the best judgement of whether the answer solves the problem. However, it is possible that the questioner makes mistakes and that the answer voted the best by other viewers is most usable. In the future we will evaluate the usability of best answers and compare the results with those of presented here.</li>
<li>Our definition of usability is purely technical, and does not include the concept of usefulness other than indirectly, by the fact that the analyzed snippets are in the accepted answers. It is possible that a snippet that does not parse is more useful than the one that runs; or that a snippet that does not parse or run is still useful to the answer the question. For example, if the question asked in SO is not a specific programming query, people may answer with pseudo code, which is not usable in our case, but may also answer the original question. Those cases, however, will always be out of reach of automatic tools, as they will require many more repairs or even translation from pseudo-code to actual code. As such, this study focused conservatively on those snippets that are part of accepted answers and that show good potential to being used as-is or with little repairs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this paper, we examined the usability of code snippets in Stack Overflow. The purpose of our usability analysis is to understand the extent to which human-written snippets of code in sites like SO could be used as basic blocks for automatic program generation. We analyzed code snippets from all the accepted answers for four popular programming languages. For the two statically-typed, compiled languages, C# and Java, we performed parsing and compilation, and for the two dynamic languages, Python and JavaScript, we performed parsing and running experiments. The results show that usability rates for the two dynamic languages is substantially higher than that of the two statically-typed, compiled languages. Heuristic repairs improved the results for Java, but not for C#. Even after the repairs, the compi-
lable rates for both Java and C# are very low. The results lead us to believe that Python and JavaScript are the best choices for program synthesis explorations.</p>
<p>Usability as-is, however, is not enough to ensure that the snippets have high information quality. Our qualitative analysis on the most usable snippets showed that multiple line snippets have the highest potential to answer the questions. We found $40 \mathrm{~K}+$ of these for Python, meaning that there is a good potential for processing them automatically.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to close the circle on our original vision, we investigated the extent to which the top results of queries on SO using Google Web search contain these usable snippets. The results are very encouraging, and show a viable path from informal queries to usable code.</p>
