                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> This study introduces a new long-form database question answering dataset designed to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with a SQL interpreter. The task necessitates LLMs to strategically generate multiple SQL queries to retrieve sufficient data from a database, to reason with the acquired context, and to synthesize them into a comprehensive analytical narrative. Our findings highlight that this task poses great challenges even for the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model. We propose and evaluate two interaction strategies, and provide a fine-grained analysis of the individual stages within the interaction. A key discovery is the identification of two primary bottlenecks hindering effective interaction: the capacity for planning and the ability to generate multiple SQL queries. To address the challenge of accurately assessing answer quality, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates the academic peer-review process, enhancing the precision and reliability of our evaluations. This framework allows for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in complex retrieval and reasoning tasks.</p>

This study introduces a new long-form database question answering dataset designed to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with a SQL interpreter.The task necessitates LLMs to strategically generate multiple SQL queries to retrieve sufficient data from a database, to reason with the acquired context, and to synthesize them into a comprehensive analytical narrative.Our findings highlight that this task poses great challenges even for the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model.We propose and evaluate two interaction strategies, and provide a fine-grained analysis of the individual stages within the interaction.A key discovery is the identification of two primary bottlenecks hindering effective interaction: the capacity for planning and the ability to generate multiple SQL queries.To address the challenge of accurately assessing answer quality, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation framework that simulates the academic peer-review process, enhancing the precision and reliability of our evaluations.This framework allows for a more nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in complex retrieval and reasoning tasks.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Significant advancements in natural language processing have been driven by the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) (Devlin et al., 2019;Radford et al., 2019;Brown et al., 2020;Chowdhery et al., 2022;OpenAI, 2023), which have become fundamental components of numerous products used by millions, reshaping people's habits on accessing information.Despite their widespread adoption and impact, LLMs face intrinsic limitations due to their design, including limited context window, stochastic nature which makes them less suited for tasks requiring high standards of precision, and extensive computations (Mialon et al., 2023;Ji et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023a).Many studies have explored ways to mitigate these constraints by augmenting LLMs with modules/tools of complementary features (Nakano et al., 2022;Lewis et al., 2020;Lazaridou et al., 2022;Gao et al., 2023a;Parisi et al., 2022;Schick et al., 2023).In our study, we focus on augmenting LLMs with a symbolic module -a SQL code interpreter -and assess their performance using the long-form database question-answering task that we introduce, illustrated in Figure 1.Such augmentation is inevitable for tasks involving databases, as they often far exceed the size of LLMs' context windows 1 , making information retrieval through any means other than SQL inefficient.Additionally, the use of SQL queries brings transparency to the reasoning process of LLM agents, providing a means to validate the accuracy of their generated responses.</p>
<p>LLMs augmented with external modules/tools possess two primary abilities: the capacity to act, which involves the use of tools, and the capability to reason, which encompasses planning and analyzing the outcomes of actions (Mialon et al., 2023;Madaan et al., 2023;Paul et al., 2023;Yao et al., 2023;Yoran et al., 2023;Shinn et al., 2023).While numerous studies have evaluated these abilities in different contexts, we contend that some of them focus more on evaluating tool selection and tool employment with less focus on evaluating how LLM agents reflect or synthesize the action results (Parisi et al., 2022;Schick et al., 2023;Zhuang et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023).Other research (Shuster et al., 2022;Yao et al., 2023;BehnamGhader et al., 2023) does examine both the action and reasoning capacities of LLM agents, yet the actions' complexity is not as demanding as in studies with a stronger focus on the action aspect.Our goals are twofold: firstly, to introduce a task that places 1 Enterprise databases can easily store hundreds of millions of records for real-world applications.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Illustration of our long-form database question answering task.The LLM agent is expected to perform a series of tasks requiring reasoning and actions to interact with the database module.</p>
<p>equal emphasis on the complexities of both action and reasoning, requiring a concerted interaction between them, and secondly, to assess the proficiency of various LLM agents merging these dual aspects into a cohesive performance.Here are our main contributions:</p>
<p>• We introduce a new long-form database question answering task, requiring retrieval, reasoning and synthesis of diverse information from database.We develop a systematic approach for collecting questions, databases, and corresponding answers in a way that ensures the answers are definitive and indisputable, lending greater validity to the evaluation process.The task is challenging in retrieval: on average, it requires the formulation of three SQL queries to gather sufficient information to answer the questions.</p>
<p>• We explore the benefits of augmenting LLMs with the SQL code interpreter for our task, by comparing the performance of baseline LLMs given the complete database records but without SQL capabilities against LLM agents that are given database schema and SQL generation capacity.</p>
<p>• In evaluating the performance of agents across all sub-tasks, we identify that planning and tool utilization are the critical challenges in achieving effective coordination.We also delve into the reasons behind their shortcomings.We extend our examination to the generalizability of our results across various LLMs, measuring the disparity in performance between agents using proprietary and open-source LLMs as their foundation.</p>
<p>• Finally, we introduced a multi-agent evaluation framework aimed at enhancing the precision and consistency of the output assessments using GPT-4 evaluators.</p>
<p>Data Collection</p>
<p>In constructing our evaluation dataset, we prioritize a robust set of desiderata.These include the intensive retrieval of diverse information from the database, the application of rigorous reasoning over the information retrieved, and the synthesis of facts and inferences into a coherent and comprehensive long-form answer.Our methodology employs a hybrid annotation framework: we leverage the capabilities of GPT-4 to generate preliminary annotations, then these annotations are selected and refined through manual intervention to ensure quality and relevance.The specifics and quantitative details of our evaluation dataset are presented in Table 1.We detail the collection of questions in Section 2.1 and the acquisition of answers in Section 2.2.</p>
<p>Question Generation</p>
<p>Our starting point is the databases from the Spider dataset (Yu et al., 2018).We introduce a question generation pipeline designed to generate questions and iteratively refine them, addressing common issues encountered during preliminary experiments with GPT-4 generated queries.This pipeline can be described as Control-Condense-Confirm, it begins by exerting control over the question generation.We direct GPT-4 to generate questions that pertain to specific entities or keywords by using the original questions from the Spider dataset as the basis.These questions are instrumental as they concentrate on distinct column sets from various tables, providing a targeted focus that counters the LLM's propensity to formulate overly broad and indistinct questions.Following the initial control, we often find the questions to be exceedingly detailed.</p>
<p>To address this, we condense the content, removing superfluous information.This pruning process not only ensures the questions remain challenging but also leaves room for the model to demonstrate its inferential capabilities.The final phase is the manual review of questions to confirm they are unambiguous and meet all predefined criteria for the task.This step guarantees that the questions are of high quality and align with the specified desiderata of our dataset.</p>
<p>Answer Annotation</p>
<p>Building upon the question generation strategy outlined in the previous section, the task of annotating answers to questions is generally an effort-intensive task as it requires the formulation of multiple SQL queries.This task is further complicated by the fact that many databases, such as those in the Spider collection, often contain an insufficient number of data records for a comprehensive answer.We propose a method that employs a Conjecture-Construct-Conclude strategy to circumvent these issues.</p>
<p>The process begins by prompting GPT-4 with the question alongside the database schema to conjecture an answer.Subsequently, we construct database records that corroborate this conjectured answer, formatted as INSERT statements.These statements are integrated with the original database's CREATE statements, resulting in a bespoke synthetic database aligned with the question.To ensure the integrity of the synthetic database, we execute the merged statements to confirm the absence of errors and manually inspect the data records' alignment with the conjectured answer.As the final step of our method, we task GPT-4 to conclude with a substantiated answer, ensuring that it aligns with the evidences we injected to the synthetic database.This procedure ensures that each question is matched with a definitive answer, backed by verifiable evidence from the database records.</p>
<p>Finally, we examine the question and its corresponding answer.We noticed that a substantial number of questions allow for multiple plausible answers, each subject to interpretation of certain ab-stract word in the question. 2To refine the fairness of evaluations against a reference answer, we categorize all questions as either "Interpretive" or "Conclusive".This classification is based on whether the question demands a clear-cut outcome or allows various valid responses.We provide demonstrative examples in Figure 6 of the appendix to illustrate the distinction between these categories.The distribution of questions across these categories is detailed in Table 1.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>We aim to evaluate how effective LLMs are at performing a complex task that necessitate working with external modules.We explore five main aspects: (1) the proficiency of LLMs in completing our proposed task through interaction with external modules; (2) the extent of improvement LLMs gain from engaging with external modules; (3) the impact of various interaction strategies on LLM performance and the identification of the most effective one; (4) the challenges that hinder effective interaction; (5) the generalizability of our findings across diverse LLMs and the performance disparities attributed to the usage of different LLMs.We can address the first, second and last aspects by directly evaluating the quality of the final answer generated by LLMs.To delve into the third and fourth aspects, we need to first dissect the "interaction" process within our task into its constituent components.</p>
<p>We propose to decompose the LLMs' expected workflow for our task into three distinct sub-tasks: interaction planning, tool employment, and information synthesis.Interaction planning involves the LLM determining its interaction strategy with the external module, considering the question and past interactions.Tool employment is the phase where the LLM generates module-specific commands for the actual interaction.Information synthesis requires the LLM to review the interaction history and any newly acquired context to compile the key information for the final answer.This framework allows us to refine our second objective into assessing how different compositions of these sub-tasks affect the quality of the final answer, and also to define the most effective composition.The third objective can be addressed by evaluating LLM's execution within each sub-task.</p>
<p>While the potential configurations of these sub-tasks are vast, this study will narrow its focus to two primary interaction strategies for feasibility:</p>
<p>• Sequential: The LLM agent systematically tackles the sub-tasks in a linear, step-by-step fashion, with predetermined sequence: interaction planning, tool employment, and information synthesis.The agent's focus should be on prioritizing both precision and comprehensiveness throughout each juncture.</p>
<p>• Iterative: The LLM agent cyclically alternates between interaction planning and tool employment, similar to the self-ask prompting (Press et al., 2023).The key aspect of interaction planning in this context is to identify the most crucial information to extract from the database given the previous interactions.The strategy calls for the agent to ensure precision in every single interaction and to achieve comprehensiveness by deciding when to terminate the interaction cycle.</p>
<p>Equipped with these strategies, we proceed to empirically explore our central questions.</p>
<p>Experiments 4.1 Design</p>
<p>To prove the key areas identified in Section 3, we designed two sets of experiments.The first set evaluates three different types of LLM agents:</p>
<p>• No-Interaction: This LLM is tasked with</p>
<p>deriving the final answer with a chain-ofthoughts prompting without engaging with the SQL module, i.e. generating SQL queries.</p>
<p>To ensure fairness, we supply the complete database records within the prompt for context.</p>
<p>• Sequential-Interaction: We implement an LLM agent that utilizes the sequential strategy when working with the SQL module.It begins by devising a plan in natural language to identify the needed information and its sources, proceeds to generate SQL queries to retrieve this information, and concludes by integrating the data into the final answer.</p>
<p>• Iterative-Interaction: This strategy employs an LLM agent that iteratively determines the most crucial information to retrieve given the interaction history.The agent articulates this in natural language, crafts the corresponding SQL query, and repeats this process until it elects to stop.The final step involves consolidating the gathered information into a conclusive answer.</p>
<p>The second set of experiment focuses on evaluating the generalizability of our findings across various LLMs, as well as comparing their performance.We tested two proprietary LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo, and six open-source LLMs of different sizes and capabilities: Llama-2-[7, 13]b, Code-Llama-[7, 13, 34]b, and Mistral-7b.The Llama-2 models were tested using their chat versions, while the Code-llama and Mistral models were evaluated using versions fine-tuned for instruction-following.</p>
<p>Evaluation</p>
<p>To rigorously assess the performance, we implemented two distinct evaluation methods.Both involve using an LLM for the evaluation process, yet they differ in terms of their reliance on a reference answer.Throughout both evaluation methods, we use GPT-4 to ensure consistency.</p>
<p>Reference-based Evaluation</p>
<p>In this method, we utilize an LLM to compare the system-generated answer against a reference answer, whose acquirement is detailed in Section 2.2.The evaluation protocol is adapted to suit the nature of the question: for conclusive questions that demand a specific answer, the LLM evaluator provides a straightforward verdict of either "match" or "not match" and offers a rationale for its decision.For interpretive questions, which permit a spectrum of answers, the LLM assigns a nuanced score ranging from 1 (no match) to 5 (exact match), reflecting the degree of information overlap with the reference.The scoring rubric for this nuanced evaluation is outlined in Figure 7 of the appendix.</p>
<p>Reference-free Evaluation</p>
<p>Assessing LLM performance on individual subtasks is essential, yet the multitude of potential answer pathways complicates the annotation process, making reference-based evaluation impractical.To navigate this challenge, we devised a referencefree evaluation using a multi-agent framework modeled after the academic peer-review system, as illustrated in Figure 2.This framework enlists a group of reviewers and meta-reviewers to evaluate the system outputs.Each reviewer receives the question, database schema, and the LLM agent's output for individual sub-tasks.Their role is to critically assess each output across various dimensions and determine if it is "perfect" or "not perfect".Meta-reviewers are then presented with the reviewers' assessments and verdicts.Their task is to discern consensus or discrepancies among the reviewers' opinions, evaluate the validity of their critiques, and render a final decision of "perfect" or "not perfect".The ultimate evaluation outcome is derived from the majority ruling among the metareviewers.To ensure a diversity of perspectives and avoid uniformity in judgment, we configured each GPT-4 evaluator with a temperature of 0.7.The specific guidelines used to direct reviewers and meta-reviewers are detailed in Figures 8, 9, 10 in the appendix.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The experimental outcomes are presented in Figures 3, 4, 5 and Tables 2, 3, 4, addressing the main research questions posed by our study.</p>
<p>LLM Agent Performance on Proposed Task</p>
<p>Examining Figures 3, 5, and Tables 2, 4, it becomes evident that even the state-of-the-art GPT-4, when utilizing a better interaction strategy, correctly answers only 30% of conclusive questions and achieves an average score of 2.34 on a 1-5 scale.The multi-agent evaluation echoes this, with approximately 30% of instances deemed perfect, indicating considerable room for improvement.</p>
<p>Improvement from SQL Module Interaction</p>
<p>Table 3 compares LLM agents' performances with and without SQL module interaction.A significant improvement is observed in LLMs' performance on conclusive questions when augmented with SQL modules.However, this is not the case for interpretive questions.It is important to note that this result applies to instances with small databases where complete records fit within the context window provided to non-interactive LLMs.This suggests that direct interaction with external modules is particularly beneficial for tasks that demand high precision in retrieval, reinforcing our arguments of LLM limitations in Section 1.</p>
<p>The Impact of Interaction Strategies Figure 3 reveals that, generally, a sequential strategy yields better results across most LLMs, with iterative strategies favoring Llama-2-13b and Mistral-7b.</p>
<p>We investigate this trend by analyzing the length of plans, the number of generated SQL queries, and their validity.Notably, when employing iterative strategies, both Llama-2-13b and Mistral-7b engage minimally with the SQL module, with the Mistral-7b agent does not engage with the database at all (empty plan), indicating that it essentially guesses the answers.We set the performance of Mistral-7b with iterative strategy as a reference point for guess-based answers, marked by vertical lines in the figures, and make a note that performances close to this baseline likely result from guesswork.Additionally, we can also notice that agents using iterative strategies tend to plan less and interact minimally with SQL modules, contributing to their underperformance compared to sequential strategies.Generalizability Across Different LLMs The conclusions regarding interaction strategy appear consistent across various LLMs.However, our hypothesis of interaction barriers primarily holds for the more capable proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo, and to a lesser extent, Code-llama-34b.The remaining LLMs did not engage in any meaningful interaction, thus no discernible patterns were noted.</p>
<p>Barriers to Effective Interaction Figures 5 and</p>
<p>Interaction Depth and Answer Quality Figure 4 suggests a weak correlation between the number of valid interactions (i.e., agent-generated SQL queries that yield non-empty results) and performance, hinting that more successful retrieval aids in generating more precise and comprehensive answers.</p>
<p>Diversity and Consensus in Multi-agent Evaluation Aggregating multiple diverse evaluations and meta-evaluations from LLMs appears to decrease result variance, as evidenced by the increased consensus among meta-reviewer LLMs compared to reviewer LLMs shown in Table 4.</p>
<p>The scores from meta-reviewers are consistently lower than those from reviewers, indicating that the meta-review process critically considers the issues highlighted by reviewers.This multi-tiered review mechanism ensures that our evaluation framework effectively balances both precision and recall.</p>
<p>5 Related Work</p>
<p>Augmented Language Models</p>
<p>The use of external tools to augment language model outputs and mitigate model hallucination has been previously studied in other domains and tasks (Mialon et al., 2023).Models augmented with tools like internet search (Lazaridou et al., 2022), Python interpreters (Gao et al., 2023b), math equation-generating models (Imani et al., 2023), and question-answering models (Guu et al., 2020) have empirically shown improvements in accuracy in comparison to their counterpart baseline models.Other models like TALM (Parisi et al., 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al., 2023) for question answering and ToolWriter (Gemmell and Dalton, 2023) for tabular question answering have built on top of these to limit reliance on humans to select tools for question answering models by fine-tuning the models to learn how and when to use tools.</p>
<p>Our work differs from these previous works in that we augment language models to use tools in the data-to-text generation domain specifically where the model is expected to not only query from a database with the use of external tools, but also aggregate these results and interpret the data to produce a paragraph-length response to a not necessarily close-ended question.</p>
<p>Reasoning and Action</p>
<p>Our work also draws on elements of frameworks that either prompt the model to repeatedly reason, act upon the reasoning, and update the action plan until the answer is found (Yao et al., 2023) or plan out the different components needed to answer a question before retrieving and generating the answer (Su et al., 2021).Other frameworks have used additional language models as the planner to aggregate information retrieved by a diverse inventory Figure 4: Correlation between answer quality and number of valid interaction (SQL queries that returned nonempty results)</p>
<p>of tools (Lu et al., 2023).Our work builds upon some of these frameworks and investigates these in context of the task of long-form data-to-text generation.</p>
<p>Text-to-SQL</p>
<p>The field of Text-to-SQL has been extensively studied as the standard method for database question answering, with significant contributions from a range of studies (Berant et al., 2013;Zhong et al., 2017;Yu et al., 2018;Yin and Neubig, 2018;Yu et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2020;Yin et al., 2020;Scholak et al., 2021;Ren et al., 2021;Xie et al., 2022;Cheng et al., 2023;Nan et al., 2023, inter alia).Despite this, our study innovates by introducing a question-answering task over databases that demands the generation of multiple SQL queries to formulate a single answer.</p>
<p>Figure 5: Reference-free multi-agent evaluation results for different sub-tasks and LLMs, all employing sequential interaction strategy.</p>
<p>Text Generation Evaluation</p>
<p>Development in automatic evaluation metrics have emerged, utilizing LLMs to evaluate the quality of generated texts (Fu et al., 2023;Liu et al., 2023).These methods have also been adapted for evaluating text pertaining to tabular data (Rebuffel et al., 2021) and hallucination detection (Manakul et al., 2023).(Wang et al., 2023b) introduced self-consistency sampling, which has been shown to improve the reasoning performance of the system.This approach involves generating a set of diverse answers and selecting the most common one through majority vote.In our study, we propose a reference-free multi-agent evaluation framework that synthesizes these ideas.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, our investigation reveals the current limitations of LLMs in complex retrieval and reasoning tasks.Augmentation with a SQL module proved beneficial, particularly for conclusive questions, and pointed to the necessity of strategic interaction planning and proficient tool employment.</p>
<p>Our findings stress the need for improvement in these areas to enhance LLM effectiveness.Despite the challenge of varying performance across different models, our multi-agent evaluation framework provides a scalable and rigorous method for assessing agent capabilities.We hope that our proposed task and findings will encourage further investigations in LLMs' capabilities of interacting with external modules, inching towards LLMs capable of handling complex tasks with enhanced precision.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>This study acknowledges several constraints that much be considered when interpreting the results.First, our evaluation dataset is relatively small, a limitation primarily due to budget constraints.We plan to expand our dataset to enhance the statistical significance of our findings.Second, our current method does not include a rigorous human evaluation to ascertain the alignment between our automatic evaluation methods and human judgment.</p>
<p>We recognize this as a pivotal area for further research and intend to incorporate human evaluation in future.Third, while this study concentrated on tasks that require intensive action and reasoning capabilities, there is room to explore how LLM agents would perform with external modules on similar tasks with less stringent requirements.Fourth, this study's investigation is limited to specific modules, leaving the examination of a broader spectrum of modules unaddressed.Expanding our research to include a more diverse set of modules is a direction we plan to explore in our future work.Lastly, it is important to acknowledge a potential bias in our evaluation methodology stemming from the exclusive use of GPT-4 for generating reference answers as well as for evaluating system-generated responses.This reliance could skew the evaluation in favor of GPT-4 agent's answers.</p>
