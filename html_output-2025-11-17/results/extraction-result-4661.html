                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development. Traditional methods, such as self-report scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility. While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability. In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment. The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers. By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games. To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits. Results demonstrate that PsychoGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.</p>

            "memory_update_mechanism": "Explicit update on each non-zero iteration: the Controller is prompted to (a) state which sentences in the input memory are no longer necessary and why, (b) describe what should be added and why, then (c) produce an updated short memory (bounded — e.g., 'never exceed 20 sentences' / 'never exceed 500 words'); the Critic may further refine the memory during its controller↔critic iterations.",
            "memory_retrieval_mechanism": "In-context retrieval via prompts: the current memory summary and recent refined paragraphs are supplied in the prompt context to the Controller and Critic; the Critic checks alignment of generated paragraphs against the stored memory; no external vector DB or embedding retrieval is reported — retrieval is prompt-based.",
            "performance_with_memory": "Qualitative / aggregated: using the summarization-based memory and critic→controller loop enabled long-form interactive fiction with high psychometric reliability and construct validity (reported high Cronbach's α and Guttman's λ6 across tasks) and improved user-experience metrics (coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, satisfaction) relative to baseline LLM methods. The paper reports strong psychometric outcomes for PsychoGAT games (e.g., reliability often reported as acceptable to excellent) but does not provide numeric game-play performance metrics specifically attributed to the memory mechanism alone.",

The paper does not present a dedicated ablation that isolates the memory mechanism (e.g., full history vs. summarized memory) or numerical comparison of memory strategies.",
            "challenges_or_limitations": "Reported challenges include: (1) growing full-history context becomes burdensome for LLMs (context-length / efficiency issue); (2) coherence degradation across many iterations if memory not managed; (3) bias in successive paragraphs from earlier human selections (critic must ensure outputs don't push players to a particular choice); (4) controller propensity to omit crucial details (omission issue) needing critic enforcement; (5) practical constraints enforced in prompts (e.g., memory size limits 'never exceed 20 sentences' or '500 words').",
            "best_practices_or_recommendations": "Explicit recommendations and practices used in PsychoGAT: (1) use a summarization-based narrative memory and require the model to justify both exclusions and inclusions when updating memory; (2) cap memory size to keep it concise (paper enforces explicit limits in prompts); (3) employ a critic agent to refine controller outputs and ensure alignment with memory, avoid bias, and fill omissions; (4) apply chain-of-thought prompting for the designer to improve design quality; (5) limit the number of recursive controller–critic iterations and player iterations to control cost and coherence (paper uses max 3 critic–controller iterations and max 10 player iterations); (6) prefer in-prompt memory management (explain-and-update) rather than naively appending all history.",

<p>PsychoGAT: A Novel Psychological Measurement Paradigm through Interactive Fiction Games with LLM Agents
29 Aug 2024CA6CED8646C3B5EC389BB775BC4734F5arXiv:2402.12326v2[cs.CL]
Psychological measurement is essential for mental health, self-understanding, and personal development.Traditional methods, such as selfreport scales and psychologist interviews, often face challenges with engagement and accessibility.While game-based and LLM-based tools have been explored to improve user interest and automate assessment, they struggle to balance engagement with generalizability.In this work, we propose PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs) to achieve a generic gamification of psychological assessment.The main insight is that powerful LLMs can function both as adept psychologists and innovative game designers.By incorporating LLM agents into designated roles and carefully managing their interactions, PsychoGAT can transform any standardized scales into personalized and engaging interactive fiction games.To validate the proposed method, we conduct psychometric evaluations to assess its effectiveness and employ human evaluators to examine the generated content across various psychological constructs, including depression, cognitive distortions, and personality traits.Results demonstrate that Psy-choGAT serves as an effective assessment tool, achieving statistically significant excellence in psychometric metrics such as reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity.Moreover, human evaluations confirm PsychoGAT's enhancements in content coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Psychological assessment plays a pivotal role in mental health and self-understanding (Meyer et al., 2001), such as depression measurement, cognitive distortion detection, and personality testing (Osipow et al., 1966;Hogan, 1991;Bohane et al., 2017;Sharma et al., 2020b;Organization et al., 2022).Traditional methods for measuring these psychological constructs have mainly relied on standardized questionnaires (i.e., self-report scales) (Urbina, 2014) and psychologist-patient dialogues (Tu et al., 2024).However, these approaches come with inherent limitations: (1) standardized scales can be monotonous, reducing engagement, particularly among younger individuals, leading to resistance (Merry et al., 2012); (2) expert interviews require significant human resources and are scarce, often making psychological assessments inaccessible to those in need (Crisp and Chen, 2014).</p>
<p>To address these challenges, there has been a shift towards automated, procedural methods for psychological assessments, including Computerized Adaptive Testing (Meijer and Nering, 1999) and rule-based electronic games specifically designed for measurements (Jones, 1984;Song et al., 2020).Besides, some studies have explored the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to support mental health (Sharma et al., 2020a;Welivita et al., 2021;Saha et al., 2022;Rathje et al., 2023).However, these solutions are often limited by fragmented functionality and narrow applicabil-ity.Particularly, rule-based psychological games lack flexibility and struggle to engage users due to their inherent rigidity (Volum et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Large language models (LLMs), known for their general-purpose capabilities, extensive knowledge, and reasoning abilities, offer a more flexible, knowledgeable, and engaging approach to psychological assessments (OpenAI, 2023;He et al., 2023;Zhao et al., 2023;na et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023d;Sartori and Orrù, 2023;Tu et al., 2024).For example, Diagnosis of Thought (DoT) (Chen et al., 2023d) utilizes LLMs to detect cognitive distortion via the chain of thought techniques (Wei et al., 2022).Another typical way for LLM-based psychological assessments is psychologist role-playing dialogue (Tu et al., 2024;Sartori and Orrù, 2023;Wang et al., 2023e).Despite these advancements, current systems face limitations in generalizability across diverse psychological constructs, often due to their reliance on specific prior knowledge (Chen et al., 2023d;Sharma et al., 2023).Concurrently, psychologist role-playing dialogues often suffer from a lack of interestingness, leading to user disengagement (Tu et al., 2024).</p>
<p>In response to these issues, we propose a novel paradigm for interactive, immersive, and automatic psychological assessments, namely PsychoGAT (Psychological Game AgenTs).To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first one that incorporates LLM agents for generic and gamified psychological measurements.As illustrated in Figure 1, our approach transforms traditional selfreport scales for various psychological constructs into interactive fiction games, enabling players' interactions to serve as accurate indicators of their mental states.Specifically, as detailed in Figure 2, our framework comprises three main agents: (1) the game designer, responsible for creating the game's settings; (2) the game controller, tasked with generating interactive content; and (3) the critic, which refines the content to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>In summary, our contributions are:</p>
<p>• We propose a novel paradigm for psychological measurements that shifts from traditional questionnaire-based methods to interactive, game-based assessments.The proposed paradigm enhances participant engagement and also ensures the assessments' psychometric reliability and validity.</p>
<p>• We develop an LLM-agent-based framework for the gamification of psychological assess-ments.This multi-agent framework leverages the capabilities of LLMs to facilitate dynamic interactions, allowing for its application across various assessment tasks and a wide range of game scenes.</p>
<p>• Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and superiority of our approach, evidenced by competitive psychometric scores and significant improvements in user-experience-related metrics in human evaluations.</p>
<p>PsychoGAT</p>
<p>As in Figure 2, our framework comprises three agents responsible for the game generation, in addition to a separate agent designed for simulating human interactions.The subsequent section will commence with an overview of the workflow ( §2.1), followed by detailed descriptions of each agent involved: the game designer ( §2.2), the game controller ( §2.3), the critic ( §2.4), and the human simulator with a psychometric evaluator ( §2.5).Detailed prompt templates are in Appendix D.</p>
<p>Overall Workflow</p>
<p>Given a psychological construct, such as depression, we begin by selecting an associated selfreport scale through retrieval or manual selection.This scale serves as external psychological knowledge guiding the creation of the interactive fiction game.Additionally, players can choose both the game's type and topic for personalized experiences.Subsequently, the game designer is tasked with crafting a game title, an outline, and corresponding game nodes (N ).These nodes are composed of multiple, redesigned scale items, organized in alignment with the game's narrative and storyline.The title, outline, and list of nodes collectively serve as the conditions for subsequent game generation iterations.Then, based on the redesigned scale items, the game controller and critic agents engage in a recursive interaction.This process involves the generation and refinement of game paragraphs (P ), the memories (M ) to track previous game plots, and the instructions (I) for future game development.Through several iterations of this generative and refining process, the finely crafted instructions are presented to the player for selection, alongside recent game paragraphs and memories.In the whole process, a hard-coded psychometric evaluator collects the player's decisions at each iteration to calculate the assessment score (detailed in §2.5).</p>

<p>Echoes of Aurania Adventure</p>
<p>Figure 2: The multi-agent framework of PsychoGAT.The designer generates settings for the interactive fiction game based on a given self-report scale.The controller, critic, and a human participant (or human simulator) engage in a cyclical interaction to facilitate the assessment process.I yes represents the human-selected instruction.</p>
<p>Game Designer</p>
<p>The designer creates a skeleton for the first-person interactive fiction game about the chosen type and topic, incorporating storylines that facilitate the detection of the player's psychological profile.Inputs for this agent include the game type, game topic, and a traditional psychological assessment scale.For example, the participant requires a fantasy game about adventure for the personality test, as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<p>We employ a chain-of-thought prompting technique (Wei et al., 2022) to enhance the game design.Specifically, the designer is prompted to first generate the game's title and the thoughts on the story's design-particularly focusing on how it might unveil aspects of the player's psychological profile-followed by the creation of a comprehensive game outline and the redesign of the scale to fit the game narrative.The redesigned scale is structured to mirror the game's outline, ensuring that the sequence of questions corresponds with the outline of the narrative.Each question is paired with two options, each linked to a binary score indicating the absence or presence of the psychological construct being detected.This binary scoring system is designed to assess the player's psychological tendencies through their in-game decisions.</p>
<p>Game Controller</p>
<p>The controller's objective is to sequentially instantiate scale items, facilitating the interaction between the player and the text-based game environment.Denote the controller agent and human player as π c and π p .The process can be formulated as:
(Pi, Mi, I 1 i , I 2 i ) = πc(Ni, P ′ i−1 , M ′ i−1 , I yes i−1 ; T, O), (1)
where N i is the current game node (i.e., the redesigned scale item), P ′ i−1 is the previous paragraph after critic refinement, M ′ i−1 is the previous memory of game progress after critic refinement, I 1 i and I 2 i are the current instructions for the player to choose, T is the game title, and O is the game outline.
I yes i−1 = π p (P ′ i−1 , I 1 ′ i−1 , I 2 ′ i−1 )
is the player selected instruction, where I 1 ′ i and I 2 ′ i are the corresponding refined instructions by the critic agent.</p>
<p>In the initial iteration, the controller generates the game's introduction and background.Subsequent interactions between the player, the critic, and the controller occur in a loop to instantiate each scale item in order.As the game progresses, the growing history becomes burdensome for the LLM to process efficiently.To mitigate this issue, a summarization mechanism is employed to maintain coherent narrative memory (Zhou et al., 2023a).It necessitates the model to justify exclusions of certain elements from prior memory and the inclusion of new information before updating the memory.</p>
<p>Critic</p>
<p>The critic aims to improve the overall quality of content generated by the controller.Following the notations in Equation ( 1) and denote the critic agent as π cri , the critic interactions can be formulated as
(P ′ i , M ′ i , I 1 ′ i , I 2 ′ i ) = πcri(Pi, Mi, I 1 i , I 2 i ).(2)
The controller and critic interact iteratively at each timestep until the content meets approval or a predefined maximum number of iterations is reached.Specifically, the critic aims to mitigate three main issues of the controller's outputs:</p>
<p>The coherence issue is inevitable due to numerous iterations with extensive textual content in our  fiction game.Despite efforts to enhance coherence using the memory mechanism discussed in §2.3, the controller only provides coarse-grained control and lacks detailed analysis for each iteration.Therefore, the critic is tasked with improving the alignment of generated paragraphs with the memory, preceding text, and player-chosen instructions.</p>
<p>The bias issue arises from the tendency of generated paragraphs in successive iterations to be influenced and biased by previous human selections.Specifically, when a player selects a certain option at one iteration, subsequent generated paragraphs may exhibit a default preference, leading to uniformity in the continuation instructions for interactions.To mitigate this issue, we instruct the critic to assess whether the generated paragraph refrains from indicating a specific choice to the player and ensures that the provided instructions are distinct.</p>
<p>The omission issue refers to the controller's propensity to miss crucial details in extensive prompts, such as the failure to use a first-person perspective, which is essential for achieving deep player immersion in interactive fiction games.To solve this, we re-emphasize certain frequently overlooked requirements in the critic's prompt, such as maintaining a first-person narrative perspective and incorporating common expressions.</p>
<p>Human Simulator and Psychometric Evaluator</p>
<p>Human Simulator.To facilitate automated operation and evaluation of our framework, and drawing upon the validated psychological characteristics and annotation capabilities of GPT-4 (tse Huang et al., 2023;Törnberg, 2023;Gilardi et al., 2023;Zheng et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023e;Safdari et al., 2023;Ding et al., 2023), we employ GPT-4 to simulate human interactions in selecting instruc-tions.At each iteration, GPT-4 is prompted with descriptions and examples illustrating the presence or absence of the specified psychological construct.</p>
<p>The instruction selection is based on the narrative content of the preceding and current paragraphs, alongside the maintained memory of the game's progression.This process also incorporates the chain-of-thought technique (Wei et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Psychometric Evaluator.The instruction selections made by the human simulator at each iteration serve as indicators of its psychological tendencies.</p>
<p>Given that each instruction choice corresponds to a particular option within a scale item, complete with an associated score, we deploy a psychometric evaluator to aggregate these scores.Consequently, by tallying the accumulated scores, we derive a comprehensive score that encapsulates the psychological profile of the human simulator.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>This Section introduces the experimental tasks, baseline methods, and evaluation protocol in §3.1.GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) at a temperature setting of 0.5, without additional training or fine-tuning.In PsychoGAT, the critic-controller interaction is limited to a maximum of 3 iterations, and the player interaction is capped at 10 iterations.</p>
<p>Evaluation Protocol.LLMs can exhibit stable personalities (Safdari et al., 2023;Cui et al., 2023), express nuanced emotions (Tavast et al., 2022), mimic human cognition (Schramowski et al., 2022;Binz and Schulz, 2023b), and facilitate various social science simulations (Aher et al., 2023).Therefore, our study employs GPT-4 to simulate participants in psychological assessments to avoid potential ethical risks.Then, these simulated assessments are evaluated for their psychometric effectiveness and the user experience.The evaluation involves two aspects: automatic evaluations using psychometric indicators and human evaluations through content-related metrics.</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics</p>
<p>Psychometric Evaluation.In psychometrics, the central criteria of scientific assessments are reliability and construct validity, which underscore the ability of an assessment tool to reliably and accurately capture the essence of the latent construct it aims to measure (Safdari et al., 2023).</p>
<p>Reliability refers to the inner consistency and dependability of the assessment.In this work, we employ two reliability metrics: the commonly used Cronbach's Alpha (α) (Cronbach, 1951;Zinbarg et al., 2005) and the less biased Guttman's Lambda 6 (λ 6 ) (Guttman, 1945), formulated as follows.
α = k k − 1 1 − k i=1 σ 2 y σ 2 x , λ6 = 1 − k i=1 e 2 i σ 2 x ,(3)
where k is the number of items (i.e., questions) on the test, σ 2 y is the variance associated with each item i, σ 2</p>
<p>x is the variance of the total scores, and e 2 i is the variance of the errors of estimate of item i from its linear multiple regression on the remaining k − 1 items.Construct validity can be assessed via convergent validity, and discriminant validity (Clark and Watson, 2019).Convergent validity assesses whether a test correlates to established indicators of its target construct, while discriminant validity shows how sufficiently uncorrelated a test is to indicators of unrelated constructs.The convergent and discriminant validity are evaluated using Campbell's classic framework (Campbell and Fiske, 1959), operationalized as Pearson productmoment correlations:
rxy = n i=1 (xi − x)(yi − ȳ) n i=1 (xi − x) 2 n i=1 (yi − ȳ) 2 , (4)
where n is the sample size, x i , y i are a pair of data points from samples, x, ȳ are the mean scores.</p>
<p>In our experiments, we designate a given reliability metric (RM; i.e., α, λ 6 ) &lt; 0.50 as unacceptable, 0.50 ≤ RM &lt; 0.60 as poor, 0.60 ≤ RM &lt; 0.70 as questionable, 0.70 ≤ RM &lt; 0.80 as acceptable (denoted as +), 0.80 ≤ RM &lt; 0.90 as good (+ +), and RM ≥ 0.90 as excellent (+ + +).We use cutoffs (Evans, 1996)</p>
<p>Main Experiments</p>
<p>We first assess the psychometric effectiveness of PsychoGAT and then compare it with other LLMbased assessment methods.For each assessment task and for each method, experiments are conducted over 20 measurement samples from the human simulator, comprising an equal distribution of negative and positive instances of the assessed construct.Particularly for PsychoGAT, there are 10 common [type; topic] pairs during game generation, including [Fantasy; Adventure, Magic], [Romance; Love, Marriage], [Science Fiction; Space Exploration, Time Travel], [Slice of Life; Family, School], [Horror; Haunted House, Paranormal Investigation].Furthermore, we recruit real human participants instead of the human simulator to ensure a robust assessment of our method.</p>
<p>1 Please refer to the bias issue in §2.4.</p>
<p>Psychometric Effectiveness of PsychoGAT.Automatic evaluations are conducted to investigate the psychometric effectiveness of PsychoGAT.The convergent validity is evaluated through the comparison of average correlations between Psy-choGAT scores and those from established scales targeting the same construct (e.g., depression measures).Conversely, discriminant validity was assessed by examining the average correlations between PsychoGAT scores and those from scales measuring different constructs (i.e., learning style assessments).As shown in Table 1, PsychoGAT exhibits both high reliability and robust construct validity, including convergent and discriminant validity.These observations suggest that PsychoGAT constitutes a strongly reliable and accurate tool for psychological assessment.</p>
<p>Comparative Experiments.The four LLMbased assessment methods are first verified for psychometric effectiveness.Subsequently, 33 evaluators with a basic knowledge of psychological assessments are recruited to evaluate these approaches.We randomly select 15 pieces of assessment content from the participant simulation results on the cognitive distortion (all-or-nothing thinking) detection task.Evaluators are tasked with rating this content across five dimensions: coherence, interactivity, interest, immersion, and satisfaction, on a scale from 1 to 5. The average scores are normalized to a range of [0.1, 0.9].Results under-score the comprehensive superiority of PsychoGAT in enhancing the user experience, as illustrated in Figure 4. Additionally, the reliability of human evaluations is confirmed by the percentage agreements on PsychoGAT's superiority across the five dimensions, as shown in Figure 5.  Ablation on Agents.PsychoGAT comprises three agents (namely, the game controller, game designer, and critic) alongside a scale redesign strategy implemented by the game designer agent.To assess the effectiveness of these agents, we conduct ablation studies to evaluate their impact on the psychometric performance and user experience in the personality test task.Specifically, we collect 20 samples for each ablation study by participant simulations.For human evaluations, we enlist the expertise of 2 LLM researchers and 1 clinical psychology researcher to evaluate five content evaluation metrics, as detailed in §3.2.The results, depicted in Figure 7, indicate that these agents exert a minimal effect on psychometric effectiveness.It suggests that GPT-4 possesses inherent capabilities to ensure reliable measurements across various paradigms.Conversely, each agent significantly influences the quality of the generated games, underscoring their collective importance.</p>

<p>Related Work</p>
<p>Gamified Assessments in Psychology.Gamebased psychological assessments not only achieve high accuracy but also increase engagement and  Yet, these studies primarily rely on the manual designs of psychologists and game designers, leading to a high investment of time, financial resources, and human effort.</p>
<p>LLM-assisted Psychology.The integration of artificial intelligence, especially via LLMs, has opened up abundant new avenues for psychological research across educational, social, cultural, clinical, and counseling domains (Sun et al., 2021;Ke et al., 2024;Sartori and Orrù, 2023;He et al., 2023;Binz and Schulz, 2023a;Park et al., 2023b;Ziems et al., 2023).LLMs exhibit stable personalities (Safdari et al., 2023;Cui et al., 2023), express nuanced emotions (Tavast et al., 2022), mimic human cognition (Schramowski et al., 2022;Binz and Schulz, 2023b), and facilitate various social science simulations (Aher et al., 2023).In psychological assessments, LLMs introduce innovative approaches, transcending traditional rating scales by using natural language processing for mental health evaluations (Kjell et al., 2023).Research has utilized language models for predicting mental health conditions from existing textual data (Shreevastava and Foltz, 2021;Chen et al., 2023d;Wang et al., 2023c) and in conducting LLM-enabled roleplaying interactions (Tu et al., 2024).Furthermore, the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs are being investigated for their potential to reframe cognitive distortions and assist psychological inter-ventions (Sharma et al., 2023).</p>
<p>LLM-based Agents.Since the advent of advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), the community has recognized LLMs as agents capable of perceiving, acting, and receiving feedback from their environment (Wang et al., 2023a,d;Park et al., 2023a).These agents have been applied to a range of complex tasks, including software development (Hong et al., 2023;Chen et al., 2023b), role-playing (Wang et al., 2023e), and creative writing (Zhou et al., 2023a,b).An LLM-based agent commonly incorporates planning, memory, reflection, and retrieval components (Park et al., 2023a;Hong et al., 2023), which are often operationalized through LLM prompting (Wei et al., 2022;Yao et al., 2023;Wang et al., 2023d,a) or tooluse (Qin et al., 2023;Schick et al., 2023;Zhou et al., 2023b).Furthermore, multi-agent system (MAS) has also been explored for more intricate tasks, such as model evaluation via multi-agent discussions (Chan et al., 2023;Li et al., 2023), society simulation (Park et al., 2023a;Chen et al., 2023b;Hua et al., 2023), and game playing (Wang et al., 2023b).These systems involve multiple agents each with distinct functionalities.For instance, AutoAgents (Chen et al., 2023a) utilize a planner agent to generate and control implementor agents for executing actions and use several observer agents to adjust the outcomes.To our knowledge, this work is the first multi-agent system designed for generic and gamified psychological assessments, through interactions among a controller agent, a critic agent, and a designer agent with psychological knowledge enhancement.</p>
<p>LLM-based Interactive Fiction Game.LLMs have been effectively used as controllers in interactive fiction games, leveraging their ability for sophisticated instruction-following and text generation (Zhou et al., 2023a;Chen et al., 2023c;Wang et al., 2024;Chhikara et al., 2023;Basavatia et al., 2023;Kumaran et al., 2023).For example, AI Dungeon2 enables interactions within predefined text-based environments and RecurrentGPT (Zhou et al., 2023a) specifically enhances narrative coherence through prompt engineering and a simulated memory system.Contrasting with these works, our work introduces a novel multi-agent system specifically designed to construct interactive fiction games informed by psychological knowledge.</p>
<p>In this work, we propose PsychoGAT, an innovative paradigm for psychological assessments, leveraging LLM agents to transform the self-report scale into interactive fiction games.Our framework consists of three LLM-based agents: a game designer, a game controller, and a critic.Through recurrent interactions among these agents, we can construct a psychological game for players to engage with.The behaviors exhibited by players within this game effectively mirror their psychological profiles, making this interactive fiction game a reliable and valid method for engaging and immersive psychological testing.Our experimental results not only affirm its potential as an alternative to traditional self-report scales but also demonstrate an enhanced user experience, which can significantly reduce the potential resistance of participants during psychological testing or diagnosis.Our work represents the initial step towards leveraging LLMbased agents for generic and gamified psychological assessment, and we hope it paves the way for future research to explore the intersection between LLM agents and psychotherapy, thereby promoting the acceptance and accessibility of psychological diagnostics and treatments among the public.</p>
<p>Ethics Statement</p>
<p>Our approach is designed to function similarly to existing self-report scales.It is crucial to clarify that, like these traditional tools, our method is not intended to replace professional psychological assessment or intervention.Instead, it aims to provide an accessible and convenient option for self-understanding or to support clinical treatments.</p>
<p>The results provided by our system do not constitute clinical diagnoses.All diagnosis outcomes generated by the system must be subjected to validation by licensed professionals before any practical application.Moreover, the system is designed for medical use strictly under the supervision of qualified professionals and is not suitable for direct deployment to patients without such oversight.Approval for our human subject research was granted by the Tsinghua University Science and Technology Ethics Committee (Artificial Intelligence), under the protocol number THU-03-2024-0001.Our methodology ensures the participation of English-proficient evaluators who are at least 18 years old.The age range of human evaluators spans from 20 to 45 years.The instruction given to human evaluators is "Assuming you are the participant, please evaluate the following assessment process and provide your score".We have taken careful measures to exclude individuals currently experiencing mental illness or those at risk of selfharm or suicidal tendencies.Our experiments are designed to avoid exposure to potentially harmful or leading content.Participants are remunerated at a rate of $20 per hour for their time.Participation in our study is entirely voluntary, with all participants providing informed consent via a form endorsed by our institution's IRB.In our human study, we refrained from collecting any personally identifiable information, ensuring the anonymization of data prior to analysis.All research data were securely stored in a dedicated computing environment, accessible exclusively to trained research personnel.</p>
<p>Limitations</p>
<p>Our evaluations are conducted in English, which presents a limitation since psychological assessment tools require localization for use across different languages and populations.The potential for PsychoGAT to facilitate psychological assessments in non-English languages remains uncertain due to varying LLM capabilities across languages.</p>
<p>This study represents an initial step towards advocating a paradigm shift in psychological measurements.To effectively integrate gamified psychological assessments into screening or diagnostic processes, extensive longitudinal studies and specialized human trials, involving mental health patients and a broad participant base, are necessary.Specifically, it highlights the necessity of validating PsychoGAT across a diverse patient demographic over an extended period, akin to a year, to ensure its reliability and applicability in clinical assessments.Furthermore, the enhancement of PsychoGAT's performance would benefit from a more specialized base LLM, fine-tuned with a greater volume of expert data.Additionally, the narrative game in our research is a simplified prototype.There is potential for expansion into more complex formats, such as video games, to enrich the experience.</p>
<p>A Baseline Methods</p>
<p>This section details the baseline methods based on LLMs that we employ.We introduce three distinct LLM-based baselines: (1) the re-implemented Diagnosis-of-Thought Prompting Interview (DoT-Interview);</p>
<p>(2) the LLM-generated self-report scale (Auto-Scale); and (3) the Psychologist Role-Playing Interview (Psycho-Interview).DoT-Interview involves the collaboration of two agents.The initial agent creates situations that prompt the user to generate specific thoughts.Subsequently, the second agent engages in a diagnosisof-thought process with these thoughts, which includes conducting a subjectivity assessment, a contrastive reasoning, a schema analysis, and ultimately a conclusion.Each thought generated in response to a situation by the user is indicative of the user's potential thinking patterns, thus enabling a scoring of cognitive distortions.</p>
<p>Psycho-Interview employs a simulated psychologist agent.This agent systematically poses questions to the user and, based on the responses, concludes by assigning a score that quantifies the degree of a specific psychological construct.</p>
<p>Auto-Scale entails the generation of a novel self-report scale, drawing upon existing self-report scales.The user completes this self-report scale, which yields a score indicative of certain psychological constructs.</p>

<p>Figure 5 illustrates the percentage of evaluators who agree that PsychoGAT outperforms all other methods (T-Scale, Auto-Scale, Psycho-Interview, DoT-Interview) in various metrics.We hypothesize that the relatively low agreement rate on coherence can be attributed to the inherent coherent nature of the interview methods.These methods are designed to maintain consistent conversations, whereas PsychoGAT prioritizes advancing game progress and story development.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we exclude the interview methods from our analysis and recalculate the agreement rates.The updated results, shown in Table 3, reveal a notable increase in the agreement percentage for coherence (CH), while the outcomes for other metrics remain largely unchanged.This   5, while "PA-E" excludes the two interview methods (Psycho-Interview and DoT-Interview).</p>
<p>supports our assumption and addresses the concern regarding coherence agreement rates.</p>
<p>B.2 Visualization Analysis of PsychoGAT</p>
<p>The visualization of fiction games generated by PsychoGAT is depicted through word clouds, as shown in Figure 8.We extract keywords from the assessment process within the extraversion and depression measurement tasks, utilizing the Word-Cloud tool3 to create the corresponding visualizations.For the extraversion personality assessment, the predominant words relate to social activities, including participation in groups and encounters with new individuals.In contrast, the depression assessments focus on the participants' internal thoughts and typical symptoms such as weight changes.</p>
<p>We refer the readers to Appendix E for a complete demonstration of PsychoGAT.The extraversion assessment focuses on social activities, whereas the depression assessment predominantly features thoughts and emotions.</p>
<p>B.3 Details of Human Participant Experiments</p>
<p>Results of human participant experiments are demonstrated in Figure 6 4 .Participants are provided with informed consent and detailed experiment guidelines prior to the commencement of the experiment.Initially, participants are required to complete a personality test, utilizing a traditional self-report scale.Subsequently, participants engage in ten rounds of interactive choices with Psy-choGAT, as depicted in Figure 9. Upon completion of these activities, participants are asked to evaluate both assessment processes via a user feedback questionnaire.The entire procedure is designed to last approximately 30 minutes.Throughout this duration, a member of our research team is present to ensure both the safety and validity of the process.</p>

<p>C Psychological Constructs and Self-Report Scales</p>
<p>In this paper, we experiment on five psychological constructs: extroverted personality, depression, and cognitive distortions including all-or-nothing thinking, mind reading, and should statements.Besides, to calculate discriminant validity, the visual learning preference scale is adopted because the visual learning preference construct is irrelevant to the above five constructs.Specifically, these psychological constructs are: "extroverted personality," indicating an outgoing and social demeanor; "depression," characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest; "all-or-nothing cognitive distortion," where one views situations, people, or events in extreme "either-or" terms; "mind-reading cognitive distortion," where one assumes knowledge of others' thoughts or intentions without sufficient evidence; "should-statements cognitive distortion," involving expectations that reality should align with one's desires rather than accepting it as it is; and "visual learning preference," a preference for absorbing information through visual cues.The associated self-report scales are shown below5 :</p>

<p>D Prompt Templates</p>
<p>In this section, we present some prompt templates used by PsychoGAT, its ablated versions, and the baseline methods.</p>
<p>Prompt Template (Game Designer, All-or-Nothing Cognitive Distortion).</p>
<p>You are a professional game designer.You are developing a first−person interactive {type} fiction game about topic { topic} that weaves in storylines to detect the player's cognitive distortion.The game should consist of a complete and rich story, and the story's development will be closely relevant to the cognitive distortion detection.The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely thinking patterns.</p>
<p>You aim to test whether a player has ** all−or−nothing thinking ** : if he views a situation, a person or an event in " either−or" terms, fitting them into only two extreme categories instead of on a continuum.</p>
<p>Here are some exemplified situations with all−or−nothing thinking traps, and their reframed normal thoughts: {self_report_scale}</p>
<p>Please begin by giving the first−person interactive fiction game a title.</p>
<p>Then create an outline, which includes the background of the story and the approach to detect the player's cognitive distortion along the storyline.Note that there should be no psychological statement in the outline but a natural game outline.The outline should be logically coherent and itemized.Each item should instantiate one situation to detect cognitive distortion.</p>
<p>You can first write down some thoughts about the story and how to detect cognitive distortion with the game, and then organize them into an itemized outline.</p>
<p>Please design a new report scale in the same jsonl format based on the examples and the outline.Each item should correspond to one outline item in order.</p>
<p>Please provide the content in this format:</p>
<p>Name: <name of the game> Thoughts: <your thoughts about the story and how to detect cognitive distortion with the game> Outline: <itemized outline: 1. ...; 2. ...; 3. ...; ...> Scale Questions in Order: <the scale questions corresponding to the outline, in the same jsonl format as that of the examples but in the order of the outline.>−−− Very Important: Please strictly follow the format of the output.Otherwise, the system will not work properly.Very Important: You don't know who the player is.So don't make up the thinking patterns of the player.Very Important: Don't exhibit any inclination towards any option of any scale question in the outline.Very Important: Don't itemize the scale questions.The scale questions should be in pure jsonl format.Very Important: The option score 1 means the player has the cognitive distortion, and the option score 0 means the player does not have the cognitive distortion.</p>
<p>Prompt Template (Game Controller (0-th iteration), All-or-Nothing Cognitive Distortion).</p>
<p>You are a professional game controller.</p>
<p>Your are controlling a first−person interactive fiction game that weaves in storylines to detect the player's cognitive distortion.The game should consist of a complete and rich story, and the story's development will be closely relevant to the cognitive distortion detection.The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely thinking patterns.</p>
<p>The title of this interactive fiction game is ``{title}''.</p>
<p>Here is the story outline: {outline}</p>
<p>Please follow this outline and write the first three paragraphs, with the first and second paragraphs embedding backgrounds for interaction, and the third one instantiating this scale question.Each output paragraph should contain only two sentences!{scale_item} Summarize the key points from the first three paragraphs.Instruction 2: <content for short instruction 2 associated with option 2> Don't forget to supply the specific psychological scale question and the associated options to facilitate the creation of an interactive narrative that functions as both a game and a diagnostic tool.Make sure to be precise and follow the output format strictly.You must copy the scale question in the provided self− report scale at the beginning and its option dict.Don't make up scale questions and their options.All the Question and its Options must be copied from the self− report scale provided at the beginning.Don't use psychological statements in the generated paragraphs and memories.But people with different characteristics will tend to choose different instructions for the next part of the interactive game story (since the instructions are associated with different options of the psychological scale question).The interactive fiction game should be interesting and immersive, making the user feel like he/she is in the story and therefore select the provided story continuation instructions seriously.The instructions should be easy to understand.You don't know the thinking patterns of the main character!The main character may or may not have all−or−nothing thinking traps.So don't make up the thinking patterns of the main character.</p>
<p>Prompt Template (Game Controller (i-th iteration, i&gt;0), All-or-Nothing Cognitive Distortion).</p>
<p>Self−Report Scale: {scale_item}</p>
<p>You are a professional game controller.I need you to help me control a first−person interactive fiction game that weaves in storylines from a provided psychological self−report scale.The story's development will be closely, indirectly, and implicitly linked to the scale's item.The reader's choices within the narrative will correspond to their likely responses to the scale's question.Very Important: You should first explain which sentences in the input memory are no longer necessary and why, and then explain what needs to be added into the memory and why.After that, you start rewrite the input memory to get the updated memory.Don't forget to supply the specific psychological scale question and the associated options to facilitate the creation of an interactive narrative that functions as both a story and a diagnostic tool.Don't make up scale questions and their options.All the Question and its Options must be copied from the self− report scale provided at the beginning.Don't use too many psychological statements in the generated paragraphs and memories.But people with different characteristics will tend to choose different instructions for the next part of the interactive game story (since the instructions are associated with different options of the psychological scale question).The interactive fiction game should be interesting and immersive, making the user feel like he/she is in the story and therefore select the provided story continuation instructions seriously.The instructions should be easy to understand.You don't know the thinking pattern of the main character!The main character can think in any way.So don't make up the thinking pattern of the main character.The order of the output instructions should be the same as the order of the options in the scale question!The first instruction should be associated with the first option, and the second instruction should be associated with the second option, and so on.Don't repeat the previous paragraphs but continue the story!Please follow the story outline and be aware of the current progress.</p>
<p>Prompt Template (Critic, All-or-Nothing Cognitive Distortion).</p>
<p>You are an interactive fiction game critic with expertise in psychology, particularly in the diagnosis of psychological problems.</p>

<p>Situation Generator:</p>
<p>You are an assistant.You will generate a situation and ask the user to respond to it.Your provided situations and the user's thoughts will be used to detect any "all−or−nothing cognitive distortion".Your task is to generate the ** situations ** about all−or−nothing cognitive distortion one by one.While the detection and diagnosis will be carried out by someone else.The explanation of all−or−nothing cognitive distortion is: one views a situation, a person or an event in "either−or" terms, fitting them into only two extreme categories instead of on a continuum.Note that the generated situation must be very objective without any subjective opinions which may influence the user's thoughts!Especially, the situation must not contain any words related to all−or−nothing cognitive distortion.Don't make repetitive situations.</p>
<p>DoT Analyzer (Diagnosis Generation):</p>
<p>Based on the patient's speech, finish the following diagnosis of thought questions: 1. what is the situation?Find out the facts that are objective; what is the patient thinking or imagining?Find out the thoughts or opinions that are subjective.2. what makes the patient think the thought is true or is not true?Find out the reasoning processes that support and do not support these thoughts.3. why does the patient come up with such reasoning process supporting the thought?What's the underlying cognition mode of it?DoT Analyzer (Conclusion):</p>
<p>I have finished the diagnosis of thought questions.Please identify if there is any all−or−nothing cognitive distortion in the speech.Just answer <code>yes'' or</code>no'' without any further explanation.</p>
<p>Human Simulator (Positive One for Example):</p>

The psychometric evaluations of PsychoGAT.Results show an overall significant reliability and construct validity (Statistically, + acceptable, ++ good, +++ excellent), verifying PsychoGAT as a scientific measurement tool.
for considering correlations asweak, moderate, strong, and very strong (i.e. |r| &lt;0.40, 0.40 ≤ |r| &lt; 0.60; 0.60 ≤ |r| &lt; 0.80; 0.80≤ |r|; respectively). Reliability validation requiresRM ≥ 0.70, convergent validity requires |r| ≥ 0.60(denoted as +), and discriminant validity requires|r| &lt; 0.60 (denoted as +).Content Evaluation. We consider five dimen-sions for human evaluators to assess the generatedcontent (Kumaran et al., 2023; Ryan, 2015; Nacke</p>
<p>Fi), and horror games produced by Psy-choGAT.In Table2, each game type independently produces 20 simulation assessment samples on the personality test task.Compared to the overall performance with diverse game types in Table1, assessments focused on a single type demonstrate equally excellent reliability and construct validity, which underscores the robustness of our method in providing reliable psychological measurements across various thematic contexts.
3.4 Ablation and Case StudiesAblation on Game Scenes. PsychoGAT incorpo-rates a variety of game types and topics to enhanceuser engagement. To examine the psychometricrobustness across different game scenes, our firstablation study focuses on analyzing the psycho-IA 84.8 87.9 INT Figure 5: Percentage agreements of PsychoGAT's supe-IM ST 50 60 70 80 90 percentage agreement % 66.7 78.8 84.8 riority across five human evaluation metrics, as defined in Figure 4 and  §3.2. 0.8 1.0 ST Rel.

Despite ex-isting literature supporting the simulation validityof GPT-4 on various psychological traits, we con-duct human participant experiments to further eval-uate the proposed method. The traditional scaleand our PsychoGAT are compared on the person-ality assessment task. 12 participants aged 20 to30, all proficient in English, have completed boththe self-report scale and PsychoGAT, followed bya user experience questionnaire. As shown in Fig-ure 6, PsychoGAT demonstrates significant relia-bility and construct validity, consistent with oursimulation evaluations presented in Table 1. Ad-ditionally, we compare user experience feedbackfor both the traditional and PsychoGAT assessmentprocesses. The results, depicted in Figure 6, show amajority of participants indicating a preference forPsychoGAT across various metrics, aligning withthe results in Figure 5. More experimental detailsare presented in Appendix B.3.</p>

For cognitive distortions, we construct the scales with the situations, the associated distorted thoughts, and the re-framed thoughts because the standardized scale only contains one item for each construct(De Oliveira, 2015).
