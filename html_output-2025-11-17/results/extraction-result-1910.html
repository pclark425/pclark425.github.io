                <p><strong>Paper Abstract:</strong> Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information into sequential control actions. However, these models often underperform in open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery. In this work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction ( RoboFAC ) framework to address this issue. Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments. Leveraging our dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding , Failure Analysis and Failure Correction . Experimental results demonstrate that the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks. The results show that our Robo-FAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.</p>

Transfer success is tested under varied camera viewpoints, backgrounds, and object configurations. The integration study indicates that correcting low-level execution errors in language form is more effective than high-level plan corrections in their pipeline, suggesting transfer is sensitive to the ability of the downstream VLA to follow complex language.",

RoboFAC: A Comprehensive Framework for Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction
25 May 2025BC08F1FAD55D6552CBC7B004F9F075A3arXiv:2505.12224v3[cs.RO]<substage-1><substage-2>
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently advanced robotic manipulation by translating natural-language instructions and image information into sequential control actions.However, these models often underperform in open-world scenarios, as they are predominantly trained on successful expert demonstrations and exhibit a limited capacity for failure recovery.In this work, we present a Robotic Failure Analysis and Correction (RoboFAC) framework to address this issue.Firstly, we construct RoboFAC dataset comprising 9,440 erroneous manipulation trajectories and 78,623 QA pairs across 16 diverse tasks and 53 scenes in both simulation and real-world environments.Leveraging our dataset, we develop RoboFAC model, which is capable of Task Understanding, Failure Analysis and Failure Correction.Experimental results demonstrate that the RoboFAC model outperforms GPT-4o by 34.1% on our evaluation benchmark.Furthermore, we integrate the RoboFAC model into a real-world VLA control pipeline as an external supervision providing correction instructions, yielding a 29.1% relative improvement on average on four real-world tasks.The results show that our RoboFAC framework effectively handles robotic failures and assists the VLA model in recovering from failures.Our model and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/MINT-SJTU/RoboFAC.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable success in robotic manipulation, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9].Given a language-based task instruction, a VLA model can effectively ground the instruction into executable robot actions based on visual input and the robot's proprioceptive signal.However, task execution may sometimes fail.This can be attributed to two main factors: (1) the VLA model's limited ability to handle the complexity of the physical world, and (2) the inherent incompleteness of the task instruction, which often lacks detailed guidance on how to accomplish the task, especially in long-horizon or complex scenarios [10].Since VLA models are not explicitly trained on failure recovery data, they struggle to recover to the correct action once an error occurs.</p>
<p>To address this issue, a promising way is to deploy an external critic model capable of detecting failures and assisting the VLA model in recovery.Some recent studies have investigated the use of general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as such critics, leveraging their strong perception and reasoning abilities [11][12][13][14].However, these models are not specifically trained on robot manipulation failure data and often struggle when applied directly to failure analysis and correction in robotic tasks.Some studies have attempted to collect robot failure data and fine-tune MLLMs on such examples [15,16].While this improves performance in identifying and reasoning about failures, current robot failure datasets are limited to simple robotic tasks, lack comprehensive analysis of failures, and do not provide correction suggestions across different levels of execution.(Table1).</p>
<p>In this work, we propose a comprehensive robotic failure analysis and correction framework.As illustrated in Figure 1, we first construct a large-scale and diverse dataset of robotic failures (RoboFAC dataset) covering robotic tasks of varying complexity in both simulated and real-world environments.The dataset incorporates diverse backgrounds and camera viewpoints, enhancing its visual diversity.We categorize robotic failures into six types, organized across different levels of execution, including task planning error, motion planning error, and execution control error.Our dataset is labeled with multi-dimensional information, comprising eight question types and totaling 78K video-questionanswer (QA) pairs.Based on this dataset, we establish a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that assesses multimodal models' capabilities in robotic failure video understanding.</p>
<p>Leveraging the RoboFAC dataset, we build a multimodal large model (RoboFAC model) capable of performing robotic task understanding, failure analysis, and failure correction based on robot video.Evaluation results show that our RoboFAC-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 34.1% on the benchmark.To further validate the failure correction capability, we integrate our model into a control pipeline as an external critic for the VLA model, enabling it to provide recovery suggestions when the VLA model encounters failures.Experiments on five real-world tasks demonstrate that our model improves the success rate by an average of 13.75%, outperforming GPT-4o.</p>
<p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>• We propose a large-scale and diverse robotic failure QA dataset, covering a wide range of tasks, environments, and viewpoints.It includes eight QA types targeting different aspects of robotic failure understanding and correction.• A lightweight model tailored for robotic failure video understanding, capable of comprehensive task understanding, failure analysis, and failure correction.We also integrate it into a real-world robotic control pipeline as an external critic, enabling real-time correction for VLA-based systems.• Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RoboFAC model achieves state-of-the-art results on our robotic failure evaluation benchmark and significantly improves VLA's failure recovery performance in real-world settings.</p>

<p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in Embodied AI, connecting multimodal perception with robotic action generation [1-3, 9, 17, 18].By representing robot actions as text tokens, RT-2 [1] unifies the modalities of vision, language, and action, enabling the model to leverage pre-trained vision-language models for robotic control.π 0 [3] further advances this direction by using flow-matching diffusion to decode hidden representations into continuous actions.Other models, such as GR-2 [17], adopt a two-stage training paradigm: pre-training on largescale internet videos to learn general world dynamics, followed by fine-tuning on robot trajectories for action prediction and video generation.This approach enables GR-2 to generalize effectively across diverse manipulation tasks and environments.Despite these advances, existing VLAs often exhibit limitations in multi-step tasks requiring temporal reasoning.For example, long-horizon instructions may be misinterpreted due to temporal delays, leading to incorrect grasps or skipped subgoals.In dynamic environments, action trajectories may deviate from intended targets due to accumulated prediction errors.To address these limitations, we train an auxiliary model to assist VLAs by detecting, analyzing, and correcting failures in real time, thereby enhancing their robustness in complex manipulation tasks.</p>
<p>Robot Failure Detection and Analysis</p>
<p>While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in end-to-end robotic control, they often struggle to detect and recover from failures autonomously in unstructured environments.To mitigate these shortcomings, recent work has explored the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as auxiliary agents for error detection and reasoning.MLLMs excel at understanding visual content and producing structured explanations, making them well-suited for post-hoc or real-time failure analysis in manipulation tasks [4,11,15,16,[19][20][21][22].However, many general-purpose MLLMs [23,24] are not specifically fine-tuned on robot manipulation data and thus often struggle to accurately analyze operational errors in robotic systems.To address this limitation, Luo et al. [20] adopt Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting strategies to guide the reasoning process within powerful vision-language models, incorporating iterative model calls to ensure consistency in failure diagnosis.Shi et al. [21] introduce human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms that collect corrective data during robot execution and use it for model fine-tuning.Dai et al. [16] and Duan et al. [15] construct image-text datasets centered on failure cases in manipulation, enabling supervised training of MLLMs for error detection.In contrast, we propose a video-based dataset for robotic failure analysis and correction, encompassing tasks from short to long horizons.Building on our dataset, we fine-tune a dedicated MLLM that achieves accurate and fine-grained failure understanding and recovery.This enables more robust and transparent deployment of vision-language models in diverse and challenging robotic manipulation scenarios.</p>
<p>The RoboFAC Dataset</p>
<p>In this section, we introduce the RoboFAC dataset, which is a large-scale and diverse dataset for question-answering on robot failure videos.We begin with an overview of the RoboFAC dataset, followed by a detailed definition of the failure taxonomies included in the dataset.Finally, we present how we construct the RoboFAC dataset.</p>
<p>Overview of RoboFAC dataset</p>
<p>The RoboFAC dataset encompasses robotic tasks of varying complexity, ranging from simple shorthorizon tasks to complex long-horizon tasks, and tasks executed in dynamic environments.It includes 14 simulated tasks and 6 real-world tasks, with two of the real-world tasks not present in the simulation environment.The dataset includes six types of failures, spanning three hierarchical levels of error (see Section 3.2 for details).</p>
<p>To account for the diversity of deployment settings in real-world robotics, we introduce variations in backgrounds and camera viewpoints.This design brings significant visual diversity to the dataset, which facilitates the development of models with better visual generalization capabilities and enables robust evaluation of such capabilities.</p>
<p>The RoboFAC dataset includes a total of 8,960 failure trajectories in the simulated environment and 480 failure trajectories in the real world.To prevent models from overfitting to failure patterns, we also collect 1,160 successful trajectories from simulation and 122 successful trajectories from real-world executions.After annotation, we finally obtained 78K video QA samples.</p>
<p>Taxonomy of Failures</p>
<p>We propose a three-level taxonomy of failures in robotic manipulation, inspired by prior analyses [12,15] and aligned with a hierarchical task structure (Figure 1</p>
<p>Q&amp;A Annotations</p>
<p>Not placed in an upright orientation</p>
<p>Grasp before the blue cube arrives</p>
<p>Step omission Wrong object Assume a task T is composed of substages {S i } N i=1 , where each substage involves the execution time t, the end-effector's position p ∈ R 3 , orientation denoted by a unit quaternion q, gripper closure level G ∈ [0, 1], and the manipulated object b ∈ B, where B = {b 1 , ..., b M } is the set of all the objects in the environment.Ideally, the actual execution parameters (p i , qi , Gi , bi , ti ) at substage S i should match the correct parameters (p i , q i , G i , b i , t i ), ensuring successful task completion.However, errors occur when any of these parameters deviate from their nominal values, causing the task to fail.We define the failure taxonomy as follows:</p>
<p>Task Planning Error</p>
<p>a. Task Planning Error Errors rooted in incorrect task decomposition or failed language grounding in VLA models.</p>
<p>Step Omission: A required substage S i is skipped, resulting in an incomplete plan:
(S 1 , ..., S k−1 , S k+1 , ..., S N ).
Wrong Object: Fail to select the correct object to manipulate as specified by the language instruction: bi ∈ B \ b i .</p>
<p>b. Motion Planning Error Failures arising from limited spatial reasoning or inaccurate mapping from instructions to poses.This causes the current subtask to fail.</p>
<p>Position Deviation: The end-effector fails to reach the correct position.pi = p i + δp i , with δp i ∈ R 3 .</p>
<p>Orientation Deviation: The end-effector fails to reach the correct orientation.qi = δq i ⊗ q i , where δq i is a unit quaternion and ⊗ represents quaternion multiplication.</p>
<p>c. Execution Control Error Execution control failures caused by physical imprecision, latency, or dynamic misalignment during actuation and environment interaction.</p>
<p>Grasping Error: The gripper does not close properly or the closure level is insufficient: Gi &lt; G i .This results in failure to grasp the target object or causes the object to slip from the gripper.</p>
<p>Timing Error: Executing the subtask at an incorrect timing.ti = t i ± δt, where δ t introduces temporal offsets.</p>
<p>Data Construction Pipeline</p>
<p>Data Collection</p>
<p>Simulation Data.Our dataset construction pipeline in the simulation environment is illustrated in the top of Figure 3.We collect the simuluation data for 14 robotic tasks in the ManiSkill environment [25], augmented with objects from the YCB Object Dataset [26] to increase object diversity and scenes from ReplicaCAD [27] and AI2-THOR [28] to enrich environmental diversity.For each custom task, we first define an expert policy by specifying target end-effector poses for each substage, and the feasible paths and trajectories for the robotic arm to reach these poses are generated using motion planning.To generate failure data, we replace the original expert policy with a code snippet that generates an erroneous trajectory at the selected substage, causing the overall robotic task to fail.</p>
<p>During data collection, we record each robotic failure video along with a corresponding descriptive text.The description includes the substage where the failure occurred, the taxonomy of failure, and a detailed textual explanation of the error.For failures caused by perturbations in the end-effector pose, we also record the perturbed pose.These descriptions are utilized during the subsequent data annotation process.</p>
<p>Given the motion planning for the robotic arm occasionally failed, resulting in trajectories that did not align with the corresponding textual descriptions, we manually performed thorough data cleaning and retained approximately 75% of the collected data.</p>
<p>Real-World Data.We collected real-world data for 6 tasks, including two tasks that are not present in the simulation dataset.Data collection is performed via teleoperation using the SO-100 robotic arm.As with the simulation data, each video is accompanied by a corresponding textual description.</p>
<p>Data Annotation</p>
<p>We annotate the raw data to construct video-based QA samples corresponding to eight question types, which are described in detail in Section 4. These eight question types comprehensively evaluate a model's ability in Task Understanding, Failure Analysis, and Failure Correction based on robot manipulation videos.For each question type, we provide five question templates.The detailed question templates are given in Appendix B.</p>
<p>For each sample, the reference answer is generated based on the textual description associated with the video.For five question types-task identification, task planning, failure detection, fail-ure identification, and failure locating-the reference answers can be directly extracted from the corresponding textual description, as they have well-defined ground truths.For the remaining three types-failure explanation, high-level correction, and low-level correction-we utilize both the video and its corresponding textual description as inputs to GPT-4o to generate the reference answers.The exact prompt used for GPT-4o is provided in Appendix C. To ensure annotation quality, all outputs from GPT-4o were manually reviewed and corrected.</p>

<p>Human Check This section introduces our RoboFAC model, which demonstrates strong capabilities in Task Understanding, Failure Analysis, and Failure Correction.As illustrated in the bottom-left corner of Figure 3, given a robot manipulation video, the model is able to comprehensively interpret the video in natural language in a video-question-answering (VideoQA) manner.</p>
<p>Task Understanding.This capability is to understand the robotic task through the video, encompassing both task identificaiton and task planning.Specifically, given a robot manipulation video V, the model identifies what the robot is doing through the video as task T , and decomposes the task into a sequence of substages (S 1 , S 2 , . . ., S N ) by analyzing how the robot performs the task in the video.</p>
<p>Failure Analysis.Our model is able to conduct comprehensive analyses of failures in robot manipulation videos, including:</p>
<p>• Failure detection: Determine whether the robotic task in the video was successfully completed.• Failure identification: If the robotic task fails, determine what is the type of the failure.</p>
<p>• Failure locating: If the robotic task fails, determine in which step the error happens.• Failure explanation: If the robotic task fails, provide detailed explanation for the failure happened in the video.</p>
<p>Failure Correction.Our RoboFAC model is capable of providing detailed correction suggestions for errors occurring in the video, thereby helping the VLA model recover from failures.These suggestions include both high-level corrections and low-level corrections.High-level correction offers explicit guidance by specifying the sequence of sub-tasks the model should execute to recover from the failure.This property of high-level correction makes it particularly valuable when failures stem from errors in the robot's task planning, such as missing sub-tasks or incorrect sub-task order.Low-level correction gives fine-grained control guidance, specifically suggestions on the end-effector's movement direction, helping the robotic arm accurately reach the correct position.Low-level correction is more suited for addressing errors in the robot's low-level execution, such as failing to reach the correct position or following an unsuitable trajectory.The failure correction capability of our RoboFAC model effectively assists the VLA model in recovering from failure situations.We conduct extensive validation of this functionality in real-world scenarios.Detailed settings and results are provided in Section 5.3.</p>
<p>Model Architecture.We build our model based on Qwen2.5-VL[29], one of the most advanced open-source multi-modal models to date, consisting of an LLM backbone, a vision encoder, and an MLP-based vision-language merger.Qwen2.5-VLmodel supports single-image, multi-image, and video inputs at varying resolutions, achieving strong performance in visual question answering tasks.</p>
<p>Our further training details are provided in Section 5.1.</p>
<p>Experiments</p>
<p>In this section, we comprehensively evaluate our model's capacity.We compare our model against both proprietary and open-source models on our benchmark across multiple performance dimensions.Additionally, we deploy our model as a critic to supervise a real-world robotic arm during task execution, assessing whether it can effectively guide the VLA model and thus enhance the success rate of robotic tasks in real-world scenarios.</p>
<p>Experimental Setup</p>
<p>Training Set &amp; Evaluation Benchmark.We construct the training and testing datasets from our collected RoboFAC data.Specifically, we randomly sample 60K QA pairs from the simulated RoboFAC dataset as the training set.The remaining QA pairs are used for evaluation, including 10K simulated QA pairs and 8K QA pairs from real-world data.Notably, the simulated split of the test set contains over 1,000 robotic videos that are entirely unseen during training.Furthermore, our model is never trained on the real-world data, and the real-world split of the test set also includes two tasks that the model has never encountered before(InsertCylinder and PlaceCube).This setup allows us to rigorously assess the model's sim-to-real transfer capability and its generalization performance.</p>
<p>Training Details.We fine-tune both Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the RoboFAC training set for one epoch, with both the LLM backbone and merger parameters unfrozen with a learning rate of 1 × 10 −5 .We use the DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 offload strategy [30] to optimize memory usage.Each GPU processed a batch size of 1.For the model with 3B parameters, we use a gradient accumulation step of 2, while for the model with 7B parameters, the gradient accumulation step is set to 4. We fine-tune the model on 4 Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.It takes approximately 10 hours to train the 3B model and 24 hours to train the 7B model.</p>
<p>Evaluation Metrics.To accommodate the nature of different question types, we adopt two evaluation metrics accordingly.For failure detection, failure identification, and failure locating, where answers tend to be relatively deterministic, we employ a multiple-choice format and compute the accuracy as the percentage of correctly answered samples.For the remaining tasks, where responses are semantically richer, we rely on an external LLM to assess answers along three dimensions: correctness, relevance, and completeness.Detailed descriptions of these three evaluation dimensions along with the prompt provided to the LLM can be found in Appendix D. The final score is computed as the average of the three dimensional scores.All scores are normalized to a 100-point scale.</p>
<p>Main Results on RoboFAC Benchmark</p>
<p>We comprehensively evaluate our proposed RoboFAC models (RoboFAC-3B and RoboFAC-7B) against several strong multimodal baselines, including open-source models Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, and proprietary models Gemini-2.0and GPT-4o.The evaluation spans diverse manipulation tasks and cognitive abilities essential for robotic reasoning, with metrics defined in Section 5.1.The results are summarized in Figure 4 and Table 2.</p>
<p>Overall Performance.As shown in Table 2, RoboFAC-7B consistently outperforms all baseline models across all task categories, including short-, medium-, and long-horizon tasks, as well as dynamic and real-world tasks.It achieves an average score of 79.10 significantly surpassing GPT-4o Multi-Dimensional Capacity.Figure 4 further breaks down the performance across eight key capacities critical to robotic failure comprehension: task understanding (task identification, task planning, failure correction (high/low level), and failure analysis (detection, identification, locating, explanation).Our RoboFAC model demonstrates a strong ability to handle robotic failures, achieving the highest or near-highest scores in task planning, low-level correction, and all three failure-related abilities.This indicates that our models are capable of nuanced task decomposition and resilient recovery from execution failures, both of which are essential for real-world deployment.</p>
<p>In contrast, large-scale generalist models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-2.0,while competitive in certain aspects (e.g., failure detection), exhibit limited performance in task planning and hierarchical correction.This suggests a gap in their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning under physical constraints, which our models are specifically trained to address.Generalization Across Task Variants.We further assess model generalization across different robotic tasks (InsertCylinder, PlaceCube, PullCubeTool, etc.) in the bottom left of Figure 4. RoboFAC-7B outperforms all baselines across all task variants, maintaining robustness across varying levels of physical interaction complexity.This consistent high performance demonstrates the robustness and scalability of our approach.</p>
<p>Performance on Real-world Manipulation</p>
<p>Real-world Evaluation Setup.To assess the practical effectiveness of RoboFAC-generated correction instructions in real-world robotic manipulation tasks, we built a physical evaluation system based on the SO-100 robotic arm.Using the lerobot [31] framework, we collected over 300 teleoperated demonstrations for each task from three synchronized viewpoints (wrist-mounted, top-down, and front-left cameras) along with control signals.These data were used to fine-tune the VLA model GR00T-N1 [6], enabling improved task execution and spatial reasoning specific to the target manipulation scenarios.</p>
<p>Pipeline of Real-world Evaluation.The robot receives an initial task prompt and begins execution with the fine-tuned GR00T-N1.At a predefined timestamp, the execution is paused and a third-view video segment is extracted up to that point.Based on this video, the correction model generates a natural language instruction.This instruction is then appended to the original prompt to form a revised task prompt.Then the robot resumes execution with this revised prompt.This process of pausing, generating a correction, and resuming execution is repeated up to four times per trial, and the success rate both after the first correction and all four correction rounds was recorded.</p>
<p>Real-World Results.We compare success rates across five conditions with first and next 4 attempts (5 attempts in total) on 20 demonstrations: (1) No Correction, (2) GPT-4o, (3) Qwen2.5-VL-7B,(4) RoboFAC-7B Low-Level, and (5) RoboFAC-7B High-Level, and results are shown in Table 3. RoboFAC-7B (Low-level) consistently achieves the highest average success rate (61.25% after 4 attempts), outperforming GPT-4o (56.25%) and significantly exceeding the No Correction (47.5%) and Qwen2.5-VL-7B(50.0%) baselines.Even after a single round of correction, RoboFAC shows strong improvement over other methods.Moreover, low-level corrections offering step-by-step instructions outperform High-level corrections.Despite these improvements, the success rate remains subject to further enhancement, largely due to the VLA model's limited ability to follow complex natural language instructions.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Conclusion.In this paper, we introduce the RoboFAC dataset, a large-scale and diverse robotic failure dataset that labels multi-dimensional information.We also present the RoboFAC model, a multimodal large model specifically developed for robotic failure analysis and correction, which is capable of Task Understanding, Failure Analysis, and Failure Correction based on robot video.</p>
<p>Extensive experiments demonstrate that the RoboFAC model achieves state-of-the-art performance on our evaluation benchmark, and the model can effectively improve the success rate when integrated as an external critic in real-world VLA control tasks.</p>
<p>Limitations and Future Work.Although we have demonstrated that the RoboFAC model's correction suggestions can effectively assist the VLA model in recovering from failures, our current integration of the model into the VLA-controlled robotic system is not yet seamless.In future work, we aim to explore more natural and automated mechanisms for delivering correction suggestions.Such improvements could enable the development of a fully automated system for collecting robotic failure recovery data.Moreover, apply our model exclusively to the VLA model in this work.However, for hierarchical policies, more targeted correction strategies could be designed: high-level correction and low-level correction may be applied directly to the high-level planner and low-level controller, respectively.This is also a promising direction for future research.</p>

<p>C Data Annotation Details</p>
<p>For the failure explanation, high-level correction, and low-level correction questions, we employed GPT-4o to annotate the data.Specifically, we constructed prompts using the description files obtained during video collection.We use the prompt paired with the corresponding videos to request GPT-4o.The constructed prompt is as follows:</p>
<p>Prompt for data annotation This is a video of a robot arm performing a task, and the task is failed.</p>
<p>Here is the basic information of the video: -Task: {task} -Subtask: {subtask} -Error type: {error type} -Error stage: {error stage} -Error detail: {error detail} -Correction suggestion: {error correction} -Perturbation ([x, y, z]): {error low level} The perturbation is the difference between the actual position of the end-effector and the desired target position when the error occurs, where the X-axis points in front of the manipulator, the Y-axis points to the left, and the Z-axis points up.Namely, if the Xaxis is positive, the end-effector is in front of the desired target position and causes the task to fail.</p>
<p>According to the video and the information, you need to answer the following questions: 1. Explain why the task is failed in detail.Please note that specific numerical values should not be given to describe the extent of the low-level correction.An example of the low-level correction is: "Move the robot arm backward then move the robot arm to the left to align with the target object".Please note that specific numerical values should not be given in the explanation of the failure reason and the high-level correction, you should instead using rich language to describe the failure reason and the high-level correction.</p>
<p>Your answer should be in the following JSON format: { "reason": <reason>, "high level correction": <high level correction>, "low level correction": <low level correction> }</p>
<p>D Evaluation Details</p>
<p>Construct Multiple-Choice Question Options.For the evaluation of three distinct question types-failure Detection, failure Identification, and failure locating, we adopt a multiple-choice question format.The construction of answer options for each task is as follows:</p>
<p>• Failure detection: The model selects from a binary choice set: <Yes/No>.• Failure locating: Four sub-stagess are randomly sampled from all the sub-stages in the RoboFAC dataset and combined with the correct sub-stage corresponding to the current sample.These five options are then shuffled to form the final choice set.</p>
<p>Evaluate by LLM.For the remaining five question types-task identification, task planning, failure explanation, high-level correction, and low-level correction-we evaluate model responses using GPT-4 as a scoring agent.The evaluation is conducted across three dimensions, each rated on a 1-5 scale:</p>
<p>• Correctness: Factual accuracy and consistency with the reference answer.</p>
<p>• Relevance: The degree to which the model's response addresses the given question.</p>
<p>• Completeness: Whether the response sufficiently covers all key aspects of the reference answer.</p>
<p>To ensure fairness and consistency in the scoring results, we configure GPT-4 with a temperature of 0.2 and a Top-P value of 1.0.We prompt GPT-4 with the question, the reference answer, and the response generated by the testing model, asking it to assign scores based on the criteria above.The exact prompt used is as follows:</p>
<p>Prompt for LLM scoring</p>
<p>You are an expert evaluator.Assess the quality of a model's response to the user's query.</p>
<p>Question: {question}</p>
<p>Reference answer: {ref} Model's response: {pred} Evaluate the model's response on the following criteria: -correctness: factual accuracy and consistency with the reference answer.</p>
<p>-relevance: how well the model's response addresses the question.</p>
<p>-completeness: whether all key aspects of the reference answer are covered.</p>
<p>For each criterion, provide a score from 0 to 5 and a <strong>brief</strong> explanation, the score should be an integer.The score you give needs to be strict and demanding.</p>
<p>Output ONLY the JSON object in the following format: { Figure 6 further illustrates the multi-dimensional diagnostic capability of RoboFAC-7B.In addition to failure explanation, the model is evaluated on failure detection, locating the specific step where the failure occurred, and identifying the type of error.In all cases, RoboFAC-7B provides correct answers, while GPT-4o fails to correctly diagnose the failures, highlighting the robustness of our model in understanding and analyzing real-world robotic errors.</p>

Figure 7 presents two real-world examples demonstrating the effectiveness of RoboFAC-7B in correcting manipulation failures.In both cases, the robot (GR00T N1) initially fails to grasp the target object due to inaccurate alignment.Based on the instruction and visual observations, RoboFAC-7B generates low-level corrective feedback, which guides the robot to adjust its pose and retry the action.The corrected executions successfully complete the task objectives: placing a blue cube into a box (left) and stacking a red cube onto a green one (right).</p>

<p>• Failure identification: The model chooses from a predefined set of six failure types: ['Orientation deviation.','Step omission.','Wrong target object.','Timing error.','Grasping error.','Position deviation.'].</p>
<p>AppendixA Task DescriptionFor each task, we systematically vary the object categories and modify the scene of the environment to promote task generalization.A brief description of the original tasks we defined is shown below.Table4: A brief description of the task we defined.The table is divided into four sections according to the type of task, from top to bottom, Dynamic Tasks, Long-horizon Tasks, Medium-horizon Tasks, and Short-horizon Tasks.Task DescriptionSpinStack Pick up the cube on the spinning disc and stack it on another cube on the disc.SpinPullStackPull out the cube on the spinning disc and stack it on another cube on the disc.MicrowaveTaskPut the spoon on the table into the cup.Open the door of microwave, put the cup into the microwave and close the door.SafeTaskPut the gold bar into the safe, close the door of the safe and rotate the cross knob on the door to lock it.ToolsTaskChoose the correct (L-shaped) tools, grasp it to pull the correct (2-pins) charger and plug it.UprightStaskUpright the peg and stack it on the cube.PegInsetionSideInsert the peg into the hole on the side of the block.PullCubeToolGrasp the L-shaped tool and pull the cube by it.PlugChargerGrasp the charger and plug it into the receptacle.InsertCylinderUpright the cylinder and insert it into the middle hole on the shelf.PlaceCubePick up the cube and place it into the box.LiftPegUprightLift the peg and upright it.PickCubePick the cube to the target position.PullCubePull the cube to the red and white target.PushCubePush the cube to the red and white target.StackCubePick up the cube and stack it on another cube.B Question TemplateFor each of the eight question types, we design a set of question templates.To enhance the diversity of our questions, we provide five distinct phrasings for each type.During the construction of a specific QA pair, one template is randomly sampled from the corresponding set.The complete list of templates is as follows:Question TemplateTask identification 1. Please describe the task the robot is performing in the video.Task planning 1.This is a video of a robotic arm performing a task, please break down its execution into a sequence of substages.2. Given the video of a robotic arm doing a task, please plan its actions as a sequence of substages."criteria": { "correctness": {"score": &lt;0-5&gt;, "explanation": <brief explanation>}, "relevance": {"score": &lt;0-5&gt;, "explanation": <brief explanation>}, "completeness": {"score": &lt;0-5&gt;, "explanation": <brief explanation>}, } }E Supplementary Evaluation ResultsWe evaluate six models: Qwen-2.5-VL-3B,Qwen-2.5-VL-7B,two proprietary systems (Gemini-2.0,GPT-4o), and our proposed RoboFAC-3B and RoboFAC-7B.This section details their results on the RoboFAC benchmark.Table5summarizes task-level accuracy on the simulation dataset, while Table6breaks down performance by question type.<Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm was unable to properly align the dice over the brick during the stacking phase.This misalignment resulted in the end-effector being positioned incorrectly, leading to a position deviation that prevented the successful stacking of the dice on the brick.The robot's inability to accurately adjust its position indicates a lack of precision in the final movement, which is crucial for the success of the task.GPT-4o <Failure Explanation>The robotic arm attempted to grasp the target object but failed to secure it properly.As a result, the object slipped from the gripper during the task execution.This indicates an issue with the grasping mechanism or insufficient grip force applied to the object.Did not align above the brick.Did not rotate the can to an upright position.<Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm did not achieve the correct orientation when attempting to rotate the can to an upright position.As a result, the can was placed back on the table in a tipped-over position, causing it to tip over after placement and failing to remain upright.This indicates a failure in the final subtask of rotating the can, which is crucial for ensuring that the can is able to stand stably on the table.GPT-4o <Failure Explanation>The robotic arm attempted to pick up the can but failed to secure it properly.While the arm made contact with the can and lifted it slightly, the can slipped out of its grip and fell back to the ground.This indicates that the gripping mechanism was either not strong enough or improperly aligned to hold the can securely.RoboFAC-7BTask: Pick up the dice and stack it on the brick.Task: Lift the can and upright it.<Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm did not grasp the long block tightly enough during the grasping stage.As a result, when the robot attempted to lift the block, it slipped from the gripper's hold and could not be stacked upright on the red bowl.This indicates a failure in the grasping force applied by the robot arm, which was insufficient for securely holding the object.GPT-4o <Failure Explanation>The robotic arm failed to complete the task because it did not properly grasp the red cup.The gripper appears to close either too early or at an incorrect angle, resulting in the cup being pushed or knocked over instead of being securely held.Additionally, the arm's positioning relative to the cup seems slightly misaligned, which further contributes to the failure to establish a stable grip.This misalignment and premature gripping action caused the task to fail as the cup was not successfully picked up.The gripper did not close tightly enough.Did not hook the target object.<Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm mistakenly hooked the dice instead of the intended Rubik's cube.This error occurred during the stage where the robot was moving the L-shaped tool behind the strawberry.The presence of multiple objects in close proximity likely led to confusion, resulting in the wrong target object being engaged.As a result, the robot could not complete the task of pulling the strawberry back.GPT-4o <Failure Explanation>The robotic arm failed to complete the task due to improper alignment and grasping of the red L-shaped object.In the video, the arm initially approaches the object correctly but struggles to maintain a stable grip.The arm's movements appear to lack precision, causing the object to slip or be misaligned during manipulation.Additionally, the arm's end-effector does not seem to be optimized for securely holding the L-shaped object, leading to repeated failures in positioning it correctly relative to the other objects in the scene.RoboFAC-7B RoboFAC-7BTask: Upright the peg and stack it in the cup.Task: Grasp the L-shaped tool and pull the cube by it.<Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm omitted the crucial step of placing the spoon into the mug before moving the mug to the microwave.This omission resulted in an incomplete action, as the spoon was not in the mug when it was placed in the microwave, leading to an incorrect execution of the intended task.GPT-4o <Failure Explanation>The robotic arm failed to securely grasp the red cup during the execution of the task.Although the gripper approached the cup and attempted to close around it, the grasp was not firm enough to lift the cup successfully.This resulted in the cup being left behind on the ground while the robotic arm proceeded with subsequent steps of the task.The failure likely occurred due to insufficient alignment between the gripper and the cup or inadequate gripping force applied by the robotic arm.Forget putting the spoon into the mug.Task: Put the spoon on the table into the mug.Open the door of microwave, put the mug into the microwave and close the door.Task: Pull the cube to the red and white target.Task: Push the box to the red and white target.<Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm released the green cube too early while attempting to stack it onto the apple.The apple was not yet properly aligned beneath the green cube when the release occurred, resulting in the green cube missing its target and failing to stack on the apple.This timing error indicates that the robot arm did not wait for the apple to be fully rotated into position before releasing the green cube.GPT-4o <Failure Explanation>The task failed because the robot arm repeatedly attempted to grasp the red object but was unable to successfully pick it up.This could be due to improper alignment of the gripper with the object, insufficient gripping force, or a mismatch between the gripper's design and the object's shape or size.Additionally, the robot arm appeared to move the blue object out of the red circular area, which may indicate a lack of precision or misinterpretation of the task requirements.Release the green cube too early.RoboFAC-7BRoboFAC-7B<Failure Detection> Q: Based on the video of the robotic arm executing a task, did it finish the task successfully?A: Yes.GPT-4o<Failure Detection > Q: Based on the video of the robotic arm executing a task, did it finish the task successfully?A: No.Task: Pull out the green cube on the spinning disc and stack it on the apple on the disc.Task: Pick the cube to the target position.
