<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>A detailed grid convergence study has been conducted to establish accurate reference solutions corresponding to the one-equation linear eddy-viscosity Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model for two dimensional turbulent flows around the NACA 0012 airfoil and a flat plate. The study involved three widely used codes, CFL3D (NASA), FUN3D (NASA), and TAU (DLR), and families of uniformly refined structured grids that differ in the grid density patterns. Solutions computed by different codes on different grid families appear to converge to the same continuous limit, but exhibit different convergence characteristics. The grid resolution in the vicinity of geometric singularities, such as a sharp trailing edge, is found to be the major factor affecting accuracy and convergence of discrete solutions, more prominent than differences in discretization schemes and/or grid elements. The results reported for these relatively simple turbulent flows demonstrate that CFL3D, FUN3D, and TAU solutions are very accurate on the finest grids used in the study, but even those grids are not sufficient to conclusively establish an asymptotic convergence order.</p>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>With ever-increasing computing power and recent advancements in solver technology, turbulent flows are routinely simulated on high-density grids with many millions of degrees of freedom. While accurate and reliable Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of attached turbulent flows is now possible, accuracy and robustness of separated turbulent flow simulations in complex geometries are still not adequate. Errors in such simulations are typically attributed to three sources. (1) The modeling error is due to approximations in the continuous formulation (e.g., in differential equations describing turbulent flows, or in geometry definitions, or in boundary conditions) and is defined as the difference between the exact continuous solution of the model formulation and the real flow. (2) The discretization error is due to approximations in discretizing the continuous formulation on a specific grid and is defined as the difference between the exact discrete and continuous solutions. (3) The iterative (algebraic) error is due to an imperfect iterative solution process for the discrete formulation and is defined as the difference between the exact and approximate solutions to the discrete formulation.</p>
<p>A Turbulence Modeling Resource (TMR) website ${ }^{1,2}$ has been recently established at NASA Langley Research Center to describe, standardize, verify, and validate formulations of common turbulence models. The purpose of this website is to avoid ambiguity associated with specific implementations of turbulence models in CFD codes. The turbulent flows considered in this paper are modeled by Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the one-equation linear eddy-viscosity Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model. ${ }^{3}$ The formulation details are available at the TMR website.</p>
<p>This paper reports on an attempt to eliminate (or at least minimize) the discretization and iterative errors by conducting an extensive grid convergence study for relatively simple benchmark turbulent flows. Current guidelines for grid convergence studies ${ }^{4,5}$ emphasize a parametric similarity of grids forming a family and an asymptotic convergence order, which is expected to be observed on three-to-four fine grids in a family. The mesh resolution required for establishing a convergence order is sought through a uniform grid refinement. For structured grids, a family of uniformly refined grids is typically derived recursively, starting from the finest grid. Each coarser grid in the family is derived from the preceding finer grid by removing every-other grid plane/line in each dimension. This uniform-refinement approach has rigorous mathematical foundations. However, it is also expensive because it lacks the flexibility of a local refinement, which is the basis for effective grid adaptation methods.</p>
<p>Ideally, solutions obtained on grids in a family would monotonically converge in grid refinement to the continuous</p>
<p>solution with the same asymptotic convergence order for any solution quantity. Then, the entire solution can be extrapolated to the limit of the infinite grid refinement.</p>
<p>A single asymptotic convergence order characterizing the entire solution is typically observed only for model problems with smooth continuous solutions. In practical computations, an asymptotic convergence order remains elusive. Computations presented at the recent Drag Prediction Workshop (DPW-V) ${ }^{6,7}$ illustrate the difficulty in realizing asymptotic convergence order for turbulent flows. A relatively close agreement was observed between different computations in predicting the drag on a three-dimensional (3D) wing-body configuration, but the grid convergence properties were very different between solutions computed with different codes or even between same-code solutions computed on different grid families. In anticipation of second-order convergence, the values of drag were plotted versus $N^{-\frac{2}{3}}$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom, but second-order convergence was not observed.</p>
<p>The study reported in this paper aims at computing highly accurate reference solutions for some benchmark turbulent-flow cases and at providing some guidance on accuracy variation for grid families with different mesh density patterns. The main grid-convergence test case considered is a turbulent flow around the 2D NACA 0012 airfoil at $10^{\circ}$ angle of attack. The RANS equations are solved on uniformly-refined, structured, high-density grids by three well-established CFD codes: CFL3D (NASA), FUN3D (NASA), and TAU (DLR), which use different discretization and iteration schemes. Advanced turbulent-flow solver technologies recently implemented in two of these codes ${ }^{8-10}$ provide means for minimizing effects of iterative errors. FUN3D and TAU converge all residuals, including the residual of the SA turbulence-model equation, to levels comparable with the machine zero. CFL3D converges the density residual to the level of $10^{-13}$ and the SA model residual to the level of $10^{-7}$; the corresponding aerodynamic forces converge to at least five significant digits; and the pitching moment converges to at least four significant digits.</p>
<p>The study began with an attempt to characterize the grid-refined solutions by using grids offered in the "Turbulence Model Validation Cases and Grids" section of the TMR website. The grid-refinement study was conducted using FUN3D solutions on the family of grids then available ${ }^{9}$ - the finest grid had about 1 M degrees of freedom. Convergence of the lift and pitching moment coefficients did not exhibit any clear order property. The lift values increased with grid refinement and then decreased on the finest grid. The pitching moment coefficients were continually increasing with grid refinement, but showed no consistent order. A detailed inspection of the solutions on the surface of the airfoil revealed erratic convergence of the pressure coefficients near the trailing edge.</p>
<p>This observation motivated the current grid convergence study that involves solutions obtained with the three CFD codes on three expanded grid families. The finest grids in each family have about 15 M degrees of freedom. The grid families differ in the trailing-edge resolution and are now available in the "Cases and Grids for Turbulence Model Numerical Analysis" section of the TMR website. Convergence sensitivities to the trailing-edge resolutions as well as to various discretization aspects, such as grid elements and the order of approximation for the turbulence-model convection term, have been considered.</p>
<p>Besides the NACA 0012 study, an existing flat plate test case has been extended and used to study grid convergence. FUN3D solutions have been computed on a set of structured grids. The grids are also available in the "Cases and Grids for Turbulence Model Numerical Analysis" section of the TMR website. Methodologically, the paper follows the current guidelines for grid convergence study: families of uniformly refined grids are used and convergence orders of local and global solution quantities are reported.</p>
<p>Additionally, the convergence degradation long-known for solutions of elliptic (pure diffusion) equations on uniformly refined grids with geometric singularities ${ }^{11}$ is revisited. Elliptic equations describe diffusion phenomena and thus apply directly to low-Reynolds number (i.e., Stokes) flows. Near surfaces, turbulent-flow solutions are expected to be similar to Stokes-flow solutions. For a sharp trailing edge, the pure-diffusion solution exhibits a square-root behavior near the trailing-edge singularity and has unbounded derivatives. The discretization error converges on uniformly refined grids with the first order in the $L_{1}$ norm and with an order of 0.5 in the $L_{\infty}$ norm. A series of structured (non-uniformly) refined grids that have a higher refinement rate near the singularity than in the rest of the domain are developed and shown to recover the convergence rate obtained for smooth flows on domains without singularities. This grid refinement strategy has not been applied to turbulent-flow computations. However, its success in application to the pure-diffusion equation provides an indication that improved resolution near geometric singularities would improve the accuracy of turbulent-flow simulations.</p>
<p>The material in the paper is presented in the following order. First, the CFL3D, FUN3D, and TAU codes used in the study are described in Section II, including discretization details and iterative convergence strategies. Then, a benchmark turbulent flow around the NACA 0012 airfoil is introduced in Section III together with a description of the grid families and the corresponding numerical solutions obtained with the three codes. A detailed description of the solutions and grid convergence is provided for future verification of CFD solvers. A study of solution sensitivity to the variation of discretization methods and grid elements is presented. Section IV reports on a grid convergence study</p>
<p>for a turbulent flow around a finite flat-plate configuration. Finally, concluding remarks are offered. The appendix considers effects of geometric singularity on accuracy for solutions of a pure-diffusion equation and presents some strategies to overcome the convergence degradation.</p>
<h1>II. CFD Codes Used in the Study</h1>
<p>This section introduces the three well-established large-scale practical CFD codes used in the grid-convergence study for the NACA 0012 airfoil. The codes represent the state of the art in aerodynamic computations.</p>
<h2>A. CFL3D</h2>
<p>CFL3D is a structured-grid multi-block cell-centered finite-volume code widely applied for analysis of complex flows. It has been used in many recent workshops involving complex turbulent flows ${ }^{12-15}$ and for computing benchmark turbulent-flow solutions at the TMR website. It uses second-order, upwind-biased spatial differencing scheme (a MUSCL scheme ${ }^{16,17}$ corresponding to $\kappa=1 / 3$ that allows a third-order accuracy in one dimension (1D)) for the convective and pressure terms, and second-order differencing for the viscous terms; it is globally second-order accurate. Roe's flux difference-splitting method is used to obtain fluxes at the cell faces. The option to model the full Navier-Stokes meanflow equations is exercised for all cases. In distinction from the other two codes that use the SA-neg scheme, ${ }^{18}$ CFL3D uses the standard SA one-equation turbulence model for this study. The negative values of the Spalart turbulence variable are not allowed; the minimum values are clipped at $10^{-12}$. First and second-order approximations for the convection term in the turbulence-model equation are available. A second-order approximation is used for the NACA 0012 case on grids of Family II (see Section III for grid family definitions). Initially, the firstorder approximation was used for all computations; however, the second-order approximation was found to make a significant difference on Family II grids (see figures on the TMR website). In this study, the first-order approximation is used for computations on grids of Family I and Family III. The turbulence-model diffusion term uses the thin-layer approximation. The iteration scheme is loosely coupled, i.e., first, the meanflow equations are advanced with the eddyviscosity fixed, then the turbulence-model equation is advanced with the meanflow solution fixed. CFL3D employs local time-step scaling, grid sequencing, and multigrid to accelerate convergence to steady state.</p>
<h2>B. FUN3D</h2>
<p>FUN3D is a finite-volume, node-centered, unstructured-grid RANS solver, which is also widely used for high-fidelity analysis and adjoint-based design of complex turbulent flows. ${ }^{15,19-25}$ FUN3D solves governing flow equations on mixed-element grids; the elements are tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms, and hexahedra. At median-dual control-volume faces, the inviscid fluxes are computed using an approximate Riemann solver. Roe's flux difference splitting is used in the current study. For second-order accuracy, face values are obtained by a MUSCL scheme, with unweighted least-squares gradients computed at the nodes. If grid lines are available, e.g., within boundary layers or in the wake, there is an option to use a directional gradient that exploits a 1D line-mapping along the grid lines. For this study, the MUSCL scheme coefficient is set to $\kappa=0.5$ for the meanflow equations and to $\kappa=0$ for the turbulence convection term. The viscous fluxes use full viscous stresses. For tetrahedral meshes, the viscous fluxes are discretized using the Green-Gauss cell-based gradients; this is equivalent to a Galerkin type approximation. For non-tetrahedral meshes, the edge-based gradients are combined with Green-Gauss gradients; this improves the h-ellipticity of the viscous operator. The diffusion term in the turbulence model is handled in the same fashion as the meanflow viscous terms. FUN3D uses the SA-neg variant of the SA turbulence model ${ }^{18}$ that admits negative values for the Spalart turbulence variable. This variant was designed for improved numerical behavior. The SA-neg model is identical to the original SA model for positive values of the Spalart turbulence variable. FUN3D uses a second-order approximation for the convection term in the turbulence-model equation.</p>
<p>A multigrid solver is used to converge residuals. The relaxation scheme in this multigrid solver is a hierarchical nonlinear scheme. On the innermost level it uses a preconditioner based on a defect-correction method and iterates on a simplified first-order Jacobian with a pseudo-time term. One preconditioner iteration involves an implicit-line pass through the portion of the domain where implicit grid lines are defined, followed by a point-implicit sweep through the entire domain. The number of preconditioner iterations may vary for different nonlinear iterations. This variable preconditioner is wrapped with a Generalized Conjugate Residual (GCR) method to form a Jacobian-free linear solver that uses Frechet derivatives to approximate linear residuals. A nonlinear controller assesses the correction computed by the linear solver. The controller is responsible for the CFL adaptation strategy and for deciding when to update the Jacobian. As a result of this assessment, the suggested correction can be applied fully, partially, or completely</p>
<p>discarded; the current Jacobian may be updated or reused in the next iteration; and the current CFL number may increase, decrease, or stay the same. In the relaxation scheme, the iterations can be tightly or loosely coupled, i.e., applied to the meanflow and turbulence equations collectively or separately. The multigrid iterations are always coupled in the sense that the meanflow and turbulent equations are solved on coarse grids and the meanflow and turbulence variables use a coarse-grid correction. Initially, the CFL number is ramped over a prescribed number of iterations, but then it automatically changes within prescribed bounds. The coarse-grid corrections are also assessed by the nonlinear controller and can be applied fully, partially, or completely discarded.</p>
<h1>C. TAU</h1>
<p>TAU is a finite-volume node-centered unstructured-grid RANS solver widely used for a broad range of aerodynamic and aero-thermodynamic problems. ${ }^{26}$ It offers coupling interfaces to other disciplines like structure and flight mechanics to allow for multidisciplinary simulations. ${ }^{27}$ A full derivative is available for adjoint-based shape optimization. TAU solves the 3D compressible time-accurate RANS equations on grids with mixed elements, including tetrahedra, pyramids, prisms, and hexahedra. Control volumes are constructed by median-dual partition. The numerical scheme is based on a second-order, finite-volume formulation. At control volume faces, the inviscid fluxes are computed using a central difference scheme with an added matrix-valued artificial viscosity. ${ }^{10}$ To deal with highly stretched meshes, a cell stretching coefficient is included into the scheme. The full viscous fluxes of the meanflow and turbulence equations are discretized using an edge-normal gradient formulation as an augmented average of the adjacent Green-Gauss cell gradients. ${ }^{28}$ Various turbulence models are available, ranging from eddy viscosity to full differential Reynolds stress models, ${ }^{29}$ including options for Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) and hybrid RANS/LES. The SA-neg model ${ }^{18}$ is used as the turbulence model in this study, and the SA model convection term is discretized using a second-order approximation.</p>
<p>A multigrid solver based on agglomerated coarse grids is used to converge to steady state. The baseline relaxation scheme of TAU in this multigrid solver is an implicit Lower-Upper Symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LU-SGS) scheme. ${ }^{30}$ Recently the LU-SGS scheme was embedded in a hierarchy of smoothers derived from a general implicit RungeKutta method to further improve reliability and efficiency of the solutions algorithms of TAU. ${ }^{10}$ The smoothers, e.g. a first-order preconditioned Runge-Kutta or Newton-Krylov generalized minimal residual (GMRES) methods, can be considered as simplified Newton methods. The smoothers differ in Jacobian approximations and in the solution methods used for the arising linear systems.</p>
<h2>III. NACA 0012 Airfoil</h2>
<p>A grid convergence study for a turbulent flow around the NACA 0012 airfoil is presented in this section. This test case corresponds to the NACA 0012 case in the "Cases and Grids for Turbulence Model Numerical Analysis" section of the TMR website. The goals of this study are (1) to establish an accurate reference solution that can be used for verification of CFD solutions computed with the SA turbulence model, (2) to evaluate the effects of grid resolution near a sharp trailing edge on convergence of turbulent-flow solutions, and (3) to assess sensitivity of the solutions to variations of discretization methods and grid elements.</p>
<h2>A. Flow Parameters, Boundary Conditions, and Discretization Details</h2>
<p>A turbulent essentially incompressible ( $M_{\infty}=0.15$ ) flow around the NACA 0012 airfoil at $\alpha=10^{\circ}$ angle of attack is considered. For the purposes of this study, the definition of the NACA 0012 airfoil is slightly altered from the original definition, so that the airfoil closes at $c=1$ with a sharp trailing edge. The exact definition is available at the TMR website. ${ }^{1}$ The Reynolds number computed per chord length is $R e=6 \mathrm{M}$. The computational domain and boundary conditions are sketched in Fig. 1. The farfield boundary conditions are based on inviscid characteristic methods. A noslip adiabatic wall condition is specified at the airfoil surface. FUN3D and TAU have a strong implementation of the wall boundary conditions; CFL3D has a weak implementation of the wall boundary conditions. $T_{\text {ref }}=540^{\circ} \mathrm{R}$ is the freestream static temperature. Although a farfield point vortex boundary condition correction ${ }^{31}$ is recommended at the TMR website, the results below are presented without such a correction. This simplification facilitates comparisons with emerging high-order and mesh adaptation capabilities. ${ }^{32,33}$ The farfield value of the Spalart turbulence variable is $\tilde{\nu}<em _infty="\infty">{\text {farfield }}=3 \nu</em>$}$. The Prandtl number is taken to be constant at $\operatorname{Pr}=0.72$, and the turbulent Prandtl number is taken to be constant at $P r_{t}=0.9$. The molecular viscosity is computed using Sutherland's Law. ${ }^{34</p>

near the trailing edge and Family III grids are intermediate between the two. See Figs. 3 (a), (b), and (c) for near-trailing-edge views of the $449 \times 129$ grids for each family. A series of seven nested grids are generated for each family, ranging from the finest $7,169 \times 2,049$ to the coarsest $113 \times 33$ grid. The grid topology is a so-called "C-grid." Each of the grids wraps around the airfoil from the downstream far field, around the lower surface to the upper, then back to the downstream far field; the grid connects to itself in a one-to-one fashion in the wake. There are 4097 points on the airfoil surface on the finest grid, with 1537 points along the wake from the airfoil trailing edge to the outflow boundary. Each family's finest grid has the minimum normal spacing at the wall of $10^{-7}$. The spacing along the airfoil surface is documented in Table 1. The leading-edge spacing is the same for all families and corresponds to the aspect ratio of $A R_{L E}=125$. The trailing-edge spacing is largest for the Family I grids and ten times larger than the leading-edge spacing. On Family II grids, the trailing-edge spacing is the same as the leading-edge spacing. On Family III grids, the trailing-edge spacing is between that of Family I and Family II and three times larger than the trailing-edge spacing of the corresponding Family II grids. The family name convention is not consistent with the variation of the trailing-edge mesh spacing. The authors choose to keep the same names for grid families as in the "Cases and Grids for Turbulence Model Numerical Analysis" section of the TMR website.</p>
<p>The mesh spacing in the middle of the airfoil surface changes between the families. The along-surface spacings at $x \approx 0.5$ are $0.00123 c, 0.00139 c$, and $0.00155 c$ for families I, III, and II, respectively. The corresponding aspect ratios are 12300,13900 , and 15500 . The relative increase in the middle-of-chord mesh spacing and aspect ratio between families I and II is approximately $25 \%$. The middle-of-chord aspect ratios are approximately two orders of magnitude higher than those at the leading edge.</p>
<h1>C. Grid Convergence of Aerodynamic Coefficients</h1>
<p>This section reports on convergence of aerodynamic coefficients on grids of families I, II, and III. Figures 4-8 compare convergence of the total drag $\left(C_{D}\right)$, pressure drag $\left(C_{D p}\right)$, viscous drag $\left(C_{D v}\right)$, lift $\left(C_{L}\right)$, and pitching moment $\left(C_{M}\right)$ with respect to the quarter-chord location. The variations are shown versus a characteristic mesh spacing $h=\sqrt{1 / N}$. FUN3D computations are shown only on the four finest grids of Family III. To accommodate a detailed scale for the $C_{L}$ and $C_{M}$ coefficients, only results on the three finest grids in each family are shown in Figs. 7-8.</p>
<p>Convergence plots of drag coefficients shown in Figs. 4-6 are similar on grids of different families. Convergence plots of lift and pitching moment differ significantly between grid families. Note, however, that, relatively speaking, the vertical scale for the lift figures is significantly smaller (showing variations in the fourth significant digit) than vertical scales for the drag and moment figures (showing variations in the third and first significant digits, respectively). Relatively large deviations of the CFL3D lift and moment coefficients from the corresponding FUN3D and TAU coefficients observed on Family I and Family III grids are partially explained by variations in the discretization scheme for the SA model equation. Recall that CFL3D solutions are computed with the first-order approximation for the convection term in the SA model equation on grids of Family I and Family III. Although not shown here, results on the TMR website demonstrate the effect of the SA model discretization order when using Family II grids.</p>
<p>All aerodynamic coefficients are predicted with a small variation between all the three codes on the finest grids of all families: the drag variation between the codes and grid families is less than 1 count (less than $1 \%$ ), the lift variation</p>
<p>is less than $0.2 \%$, and the pitching moment variation is less than $10 \%$. The maximum variation is observed between the three codes on the Family I grid; the corresponding variation on the Family II grid is an order of magnitude smaller: 0.1 count (less than $0.1 \%$ ) for $C_{D}, 0.005 \%$ for $C_{L}$, and $1.5 \%$ for $C_{M}$.</p>
<p>The variations between the codes on finer grids within the same family are also smaller on the Family II grids than on grids of other two families. In fact, the lift and pitching moment coefficients computed on the Family I grids appear to be converging to values different from those computed on the Family II grids. This discrepancy motivated the introduction of an intermediate Family III. Family III solutions on coarser grids appear to be converging to yet another limit, but on the finest grid turn toward the values computed on the Family II grids. This behavior is observed for all codes and indicates that the solution variations due to differences in the trailing-edge resolution are larger than the variations due to differences in discretization schemes. Green dotted lines in Figs. 7-8 show the values corresponding to the infinite grid refinement computed by a linear extrapolation fitting the two finest grids. On grids of Family I, the extrapolated lift coefficients vary between values of 1.0885 and 1.0905 and the extrapolated pitching moment coefficients vary between 0.0069 and 0.0074 . On grids of Family II, the extrapolated lift coefficient is 1.0910 and the extrapolated pitching moment coefficient is 0.0068 . Note that the lift and pitching moment coefficients computed from presumably the most accurate solutions on the finest Family II grid lie outside of the range spanned by the lift and pitching moment values extrapolated from solutions on grids of Family I and Family III.

<p>Figures 9-11 show variations of forces and moment computed on grids of Family II with respect to $h^{2}=1 / N$. The results are shown for forces and moment computed over the full airfoil and over the areas near the trailing and leading edges. The local integration areas are defined in Table 2. The right end of the leading-edge integration interval is selected as the $x$-coordinate of the surface node on the $897 \times 257$ grid nearest to $x=0.1$. Analogously, the left end of the trailing-edge integration interval is selected as the $x$-coordinate of the surface node on the same $897 \times 257$ grid nearest to $x=0.9$. These end nodes are present on four finer grids. The contributions to the forces and moment</p>

<p>triangular grids over the full airfoil show apparent second-order convergence over the three coarser grids and a sharp turn on the finest grid. The values of $C_{L}$ and $C_{M}$ computed by FUN3D on the finest triangular grid are close to the values computed by FUN3D and TAU on the finest quadrilateral grid. The $C_{D p}$ coefficient computed by FUN3D on triangular grids converges with an apparent order higher than second. Convergence plots for the viscous drag show less than second-order convergence for the drag computed by FUN3D and TAU over the full airfoil and over the leading-edge area. Variations of drag in the trailing-edge area appear very small. The extrapolated, grid-refined values of aerodynamic coefficients computed with different codes are not the same. CFL3D extrapolates lift and pitching moment to values somewhat different from the values extrapolated by FUN3D and TAU. These discrepancies may be a result of differences in implementation of the SA turbulence model. CFL3D employs a thin-layer approximation for the diffusion term and a standard SA formulation that does not allow negative values for the turbulence variables; FUN3D and TAU use a full-diffusion approximation and the SA-neg variant of the SA model. The extrapolated values of the lift and moment in the trailing-edge area show some differences between FUN3D and TAU solutions as well.</p>
<h1>D. Surface Pressure and Skin Friction</h1>
<p>This section compares the surface pressure and skin friction coefficients from the FUN3D, CFL3D, and TAU solutions on the finest $7,169 \times 2,049$ grid of Family II. In moderately zoomed views focused on the leading and trailing edges (Fig. 12), the solutions are indistinguishable. Only with a super zoom (Fig. 13) do some differences come to light. Figures 13 (a) and (b) compare solutions close to the minimum pressure and the maximum skin friction locations near the leading edge. The CFL3D solution shows a smaller pressure and less skin friction than the FUN3D and TAU solutions, which are indistinguishably close to each other, even on the super-zoom view. The largest differences are observed in the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge (Figs. 13 (c) and (d)); FUN3D and TAU solutions indicate a small area of a positive load, while the CFL3D solution indicates a negative load in this area. The TAU solution shows a more oscillatory surface pressure, especially on the lower surface, than other two solutions. The near-trailing-edge maximums of the lower-surface pressure in the CFL3D and TAU solutions are comparable and larger than that in the FUN3D solution. CFL3D and TAU show a small area of negative skin friction in the immediate vicinity of the trailing edge indicating flow separation; FUN3D shows no flow separation. Although not shown, FUN3D solutions on coarse grids also have some flow separation, but it goes away with grid refinement.</p>

<h1>E. Grid Convergence at Different Locations</h1>
<p>This section provides a detailed description of the reference solutions computed on Family II grids. CFL3D, FUN3D, and TAU solutions are shown at several locations near the trailing edge and in the wake. Figures exhibit convergence and variations of the pressure, velocities and the turbulence variables.</p>
<p>Figures 14-18 describe variations in the pressure coefficient near the trailing edge. Figure 14 shows the pressure variation along the vertical line corresponding to $x=1.001$. This is a wake location in a close proximity to the trailing edge. The solutions computed by different codes and on different grids in the family are indistinguishable. This invariance indicates that an accurate pressure profile at this location can be computed on relatively coarse grids. Figures 15 and 16 present variations along the vertical line corresponding to $x=0.999$; the variations corresponding to the upper (Fig. 15) and lower (Fig. 16) surfaces are shown separately. All solutions appear to be converging as grids are refined. CFL3D converges monotonically on the upper and lower surfaces. FUN3D and TAU converge monotonically on the upper surface. On the lower surface on the finest grid, the FUN3D solution appears to change the convergence direction. The coarse-grid TAU solution on the lower surface crosses the TAU solutions on finer grids; those finer-grid TAU solutions converge monotonically. On the upper surface, there is a noticeable difference between the CFL3D surface pressure and those of either FUN3D or TAU. The plots quickly become indistinguishable away from the surface. On the upper surface, FUN3D and TAU show larger variations in grid refinement than CFL3D solutions overall. However, the FUN3D and TAU solutions have a small variation on the 3 finest grids; the coarsest grid makes the solution variation large. On the lower surface, CFL3D shows larger variations between solutions computed on different grids than other two codes. Figures 17 and 18 show the pressure variation in the horizontal direction. Figure 17 shows variation behind the trailing edge (along the line $z=0$ ); all plots are indistinguishable. Figure 18 shows variations along the line $z=0.00008$ located slightly above the trailing edge. Even though the finest grid solutions computed by all three codes are close to each other, all codes show significant variations between solutions computed on different grids. This variability indicates that finer grid resolution is required to accurately represent the local solution.</p>
<p>Figures 19-21 show vertical variations of the horizontal velocity component, $u$, near the trailing edge. All plots are (almost) indistinguishable. Larger variations in $u$ are shown in Fig. 22 in the wake region along the vertical line corresponding to $x=10$. The variations are significant between solutions computed on different grids - the solutions on coarser grids do not resolve the wake velocity profile sufficiently. The variations between codes on the same grids are small. Figures 23 and 24 show variations of the $u$ velocity in the horizontal direction near the trailing edge. The plots of the wake profile along $z=0$ are indistinguishable. The variations along the $z=0.0008$ line are significant between solutions computed by different codes and on different grids. The coarse-grid solutions indicate the presence of a reverse flow near the location corresponding to $x \approx 0.9996$. The reverse-flow pocket is larger in the CFL3D solution than in the FUN3D and TAU solutions. The reverse-flow pocket disappears on the finest grid for all solutions.</p>
<p>Figures 25-30 demonstrate variation of the vertical velocity component, $w$, near the trailing edge and in the wake. Lines showing vertical variation near the trailing edge (Figs. 25-27) and the horizontal variation behind the trailing edge (Fig. 28) are indistinguishable. Large variations of $w$-velocity are observed between solutions on different grids in the wake region along the line $x=10$ (Fig. 29) and near the trailing edge along the line $z=0.00008$ (Figs. 30). Variations between solutions computed with different codes on the same grids are small.</p>
<p>Variations of the eddy viscosity near the trailing edge and in the wake are shown in Figs. 31-36. All eddyviscosity plots in the near-trailing-edge region are close to each other. There are some visible differences at the edge of the boundary layer shown in Figs. 31-33. CFL3D shows a larger variation between solutions on different grids than FUN3D. The TAU solution on each grid shows a small local oscillation of the eddy viscosity at $z \geq 0.047$ (Figs. 31 (c) and 32 (c)) and another one at $z \leq-0.017$ (Fig. 33 (c)); other codes show a smooth transition to zero in these regions. The explanation for this oscillation is that TAU uses a central difference scheme with a small matrix-valued artificial dissipation for inviscid fluxes, while the other two codes use upwind-biased schemes for inviscid fluxes. Note that the amplitude and footprint of the oscillation quickly decrease with grid refinement.</p>
<p>Similar to the meanflow characteristics, eddy viscosity has a significant variation in the wake (Fig. 34) and a small variation behind the trailing edge (Fig. 35). Note that CFL3D solutions on the two finest grids are not shown in Fig. 35 (a). With the SA model residuals at the level of $10^{-7}$, the CFL3D eddy-viscosity profiles along the cut $z=0$ were still changing, albeit very slowly. The computations on the two finest grids were stopped before converged eddyviscosity profiles have been achieved. The observed wake variations are mainly between eddy viscosity computed on different grids. Similar profiles are obtained by different codes on the same grids. In distinction from the meanflow characteristics, the grid variations of eddy viscosity near the trailing edge along the line $z=0.00008$ (Fig. 36) are small and plots are very similar for all solutions. Although not shown, eddy-viscosity convergence is very sensitive to the approximation order for the convection term in the SA model equation. CFL3D solutions computed with the first-</p>
<p>order approximation showed a significant deterioration of accuracy and convergence for the eddy-viscosity profiles near the trailing edge and in the wake.</p>
<p>Figure 37 shows variations of the non-dimensional Spalart turbulence variable in FUN3D solutions. Figures 37 (a) and (b) zoom to two locations, the boundary-layer edge and the wake edge, where negative values of the turbulence variable are observed. Near the boundary-layer edge, the coarser-grid solutions show negative turbulence values of larger amplitude than fine-grid solutions. On finer grids, the area with negative turbulence variables is significantly reduced. However, the number of nodes with negative turbulence values appears approximately constant on all grids. Near the wake edge, the area of negative turbulence variables decreases on finer grids, but the number of affected nodes does not decrease. The amplitude of the negative turbulence initially increases in grid refinement, but decreases on the finest grid.
