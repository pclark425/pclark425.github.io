                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Refinement and Consensus Formation in LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when guided by iterative querying, feedback, and correction, can refine and converge on robust, consensus-driven scientific theories. The process involves reconciling conflicting evidence, integrating diverse perspectives, and updating theoretical frameworks in response to new information or contradictions, mimicking aspects of the scientific method.</p>
