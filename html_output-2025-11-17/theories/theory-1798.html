                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1798</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Temporal-Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when equipped with retrieval modules that provide temporally and contextually relevant scientific evidence, can dynamically update their probability estimates for future discoveries. The model's probabilistic reasoning is sensitive to temporal trends, research momentum, and contextual signals (e.g., funding, collaboration networks), enabling more accurate and adaptive forecasting of scientific breakthroughs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to anticipate sudden accelerations in scientific progress (e.g., due to policy changes or major funding infusions) before they are widely recognized.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent contextual signals (e.g., emerging interdisciplinary collaborations) that precede major discoveries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If temporally and contextually enriched retrieval does not improve LLM forecasting accuracy, the theory's core mechanism is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to adjust probability estimates in response to major contextual shifts (e.g., funding booms), the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of non-public or proprietary contextual signals (e.g., private funding, confidential collaborations) is not addressed. </li>
