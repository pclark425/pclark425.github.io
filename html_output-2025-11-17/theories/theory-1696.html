                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1696</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Distributional Expectation Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models detect anomalies in lists by learning the expected distributional properties (e.g., frequency, co-occurrence, order) of list elements. Anomalies are identified as items whose probability, as estimated by the LM, is significantly lower than expected given the context of the list. This approach generalizes traditional statistical anomaly detection by leveraging the LM's ability to model complex, high-dimensional distributions over sequences.</p>
