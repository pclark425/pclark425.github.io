                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1329</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Externalization and Error Surface Traversal Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, through iterative generate-then-reflect cycles, traverse a hierarchical error surface by externalizing increasingly abstract representations of their reasoning and errors. Each cycle enables the model to move from surface-level corrections to deeper, structural improvements, effectively climbing a hierarchy of error abstraction and solution quality.</p>

                <li>If LLMs are prompted to reflect at increasing levels of abstraction, answer quality will improve more than with flat, repeated surface-level reflection.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If the hierarchy of abstraction is made explicit in the prompt, LLMs may reach even higher levels of answer quality.</li>
                <li>There may be diminishing returns or even regressions if the abstraction hierarchy is too steep or misaligned with the task.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show a shift from local to global error correction over iterations, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If explicit abstraction-level prompts do not improve or change the nature of corrections, the hierarchical aspect is questionable.</li>
