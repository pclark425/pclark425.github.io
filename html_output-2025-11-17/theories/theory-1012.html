                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic Memory Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by constructing and maintaining a hierarchical episodic memory structure, where experiences are organized into episodes, sub-episodes, and atomic events. This structure enables efficient retrieval, abstraction, and transfer of knowledge across similar contexts, supporting both local (short-term) and global (long-term) reasoning and planning.</p>
