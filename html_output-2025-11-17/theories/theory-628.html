                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A concept is functionally individuated as a single, integrated entity if and only if its heterogeneous representational components (e.g., prototype, exemplar, theory-like, symbolic) are stably coactivated within an empirically relevant time window, contribute functionally to task processing (even if not selected), and this coactivation pattern is stable across related tasks. This criterion distinguishes hybrid concepts from pluralist collections and provides an operational test for concept unity in the presence of representational heterogeneity.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Functional stable coactivation criterion is proposed as an operational test for hybrid concept individuation, supported by empirical evidence of coactivation and facilitation effects. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.6" class="evidence-link">[e5481.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.14" class="evidence-link">[e5481.14]</a> </li>
    <li>Empirical findings show that non-selected features or senses can facilitate processing, indicating functional contribution of coactivated but unselected parts (e.g., Moss et al. 2007; Azuma & van Orden 1997; Klepousniotou & Baum 2007). <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.14" class="evidence-link">[e5481.14]</a> </li>
    <li>The criterion is explicitly contrasted with Machery's connection and coordination criteria, arguing that stable coactivation and functional contribution are more empirically adequate for individuation of hybrid concepts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.6" class="evidence-link">[e5481.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.11" class="evidence-link">[e5481.11]</a> </li>
    <li>Hybridism and coactivation package accounts posit that multiple representational formats (prototype, exemplar, theory-like) are functionally integrated and stably coactivated, rather than merely linked or chained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.3" class="evidence-link">[e5481.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5162.html#e5162.4" class="evidence-link">[e5162.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Empirical evidence from category learning and semantic processing shows that both prototype and exemplar effects can be observed in the same tasks and that non-selected representations can influence processing (e.g., old-item advantage, typicality effects, knowledge-based overrides). <a href="../results/extraction-result-5428.html#e5428.1" class="evidence-link">[e5428.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5173.html#e5173.11" class="evidence-link">[e5173.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5162.html#e5162.0" class="evidence-link">[e5162.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5162.html#e5162.1" class="evidence-link">[e5162.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5173.html#e5173.1" class="evidence-link">[e5173.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5173.html#e5173.2" class="evidence-link">[e5173.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The functional stable coactivation criterion is proposed as a principled alternative to pluralism and referential chaining, which treat different representational formats as separate concepts or merely linked by identity chains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.4" class="evidence-link">[e5481.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.12" class="evidence-link">[e5481.12]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the idea of hybrid concepts and coactivation has been discussed, the explicit operationalization of functional stable coactivation as an empirical criterion for concept individuation is novel and provides a testable framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The coactivation package and hybridism are discussed in recent literature as theoretical proposals for concept individuation, and empirical evidence exists for coactivation and facilitation effects.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the operational test for concept unity in the presence of representational heterogeneity, providing explicit empirical criteria (coactivation, functional contribution, stability) for distinguishing hybrid from pluralist accounts.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neuroimaging studies will show concurrent activation of multiple representational components (e.g., prototype and exemplar regions) during concept use, even when only one is behaviorally selected.</li>
                <li>Tasks that require switching between categorization strategies (e.g., from prototype to exemplar-based) will show stable coactivation patterns across related tasks for the same concept.</li>
                <li>Behavioral facilitation (e.g., faster response times) will be observed when non-selected features or senses are present, indicating functional contribution of coactivated but unselected parts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In cases where coactivation is unstable or absent (e.g., in certain neurological conditions or after targeted disruption), concepts may fragment into pluralist collections, leading to novel patterns of conceptual errors or dissociations.</li>
                <li>Artificial cognitive systems implementing this criterion will show improved generalization and flexibility in concept use compared to systems with strict modular or pluralist representations.</li>
                <li>Developmental studies will reveal that the emergence of stable coactivation patterns predicts the integration of heterogeneous conceptual knowledge in children.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If empirical studies fail to find stable coactivation of heterogeneous components for concepts that show hybrid behavioral effects, the criterion would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If non-selected components never contribute functionally to task processing (e.g., no facilitation or interference effects), the functional contribution requirement would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If coactivation patterns are not stable across related tasks (e.g., prototype and exemplar components are only coactivated in specific tasks but not others), the stability requirement would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical specification of relevant time windows and measures of functional contribution remains to be determined; the criterion requires further operationalization for different tasks and modalities. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.6" class="evidence-link">[e5481.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Boundary conditions for highly context-dependent or polysemous concepts, where coactivation patterns may vary across contexts, are not fully specified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5481.html#e5481.6" class="evidence-link">[e5481.6]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory provides a new, empirically testable criterion for distinguishing hybrid from pluralist concept representations, moving beyond previous theoretical proposals by specifying operational requirements (coactivation, functional contribution, stability) and linking them to empirical evidence.</p>
