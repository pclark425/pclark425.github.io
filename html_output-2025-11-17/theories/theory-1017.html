                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Structured Memory Enables Overcoming Partial Observability in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that explicit, structured memory modules—such as entity-centric, event-based, or spatially-organized memory—are essential for LLM agents to overcome the inherent partial observability of text games. By maintaining and updating a structured representation of the game world, agents can infer hidden state, track objectives, and make informed decisions, leading to more efficient and robust planning.</p>

    <li>Agents with entity-based or spatial memory outperform vanilla LLMs in text games with hidden state (e.g., remembering locations of objects, NPCs, or prior events). </li>
    <li>Partial observability is a core challenge in text games, as the agent only receives a local textual description per step. </li>
    <li>Memory-augmented agents can recall previously seen but currently unobservable information, such as the location of keys or the state of doors. </li>
