                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory Distillation by LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can distill scientific theories from large corpora by iteratively abstracting common patterns and refining them through targeted re-examination of exceptions, outliers, and edge cases. The process alternates between generalization (abstraction) and specialization (refinement), leveraging the LLM's ability to synthesize, cluster, and contrast diverse findings, ultimately yielding robust, multi-level theory statements.</p>

            <ol>

            <ol>
