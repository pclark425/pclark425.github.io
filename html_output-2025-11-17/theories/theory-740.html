                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Statistical Pattern Matching Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by matching input patterns to output patterns observed in their training data, rather than by executing explicit algorithmic computation. This process relies on the statistical co-occurrence of arithmetic expressions and their results, leading to high accuracy for frequently seen problems and systematic errors for rare or out-of-distribution cases.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Language models often fail on large-number arithmetic or novel formats, producing plausible but incorrect answers. </li>
    <li>Performance on arithmetic tasks degrades as the problem diverges from training distribution. </li>
    <li>Studies show that LMs hallucinate arithmetic results for expressions not seen during training. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general OOD error phenomenon is known, but its explicit application to arithmetic in LMs is a novel, focused statement.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LMs' struggles with out-of-distribution data are documented in general NLP tasks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the connection between OOD errors and arithmetic specifically.</p>

</ul>
            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained on a dataset with a high frequency of a specific arithmetic format (e.g., '12 + 34 = 46'), it will perform well on that format but poorly on a novel format (e.g., 'twelve plus thirty-four equals?').</li>
                <li>Increasing the frequency of certain arithmetic expressions in fine-tuning will improve model accuracy on those expressions, but not on structurally different or larger-number problems.</li>
                <li>If a model is exposed to a new arithmetic format during fine-tuning, its performance on that format will increase, but generalization to other formats will remain limited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is exposed to a synthetic dataset with entirely novel arithmetic formats, it may develop new pattern-matching strategies or fail completely, depending on the model's size and architecture.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on arithmetic expressions with systematic errors (e.g., '2+2=5'), it may reproduce those errors, suggesting a lack of true algorithmic understanding.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on a dataset with adversarially perturbed arithmetic results, it may learn to output those perturbed results, indicating a lack of underlying arithmetic reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model can solve arithmetic problems it has never seen in any form, this would contradict the theory that performance is based solely on pattern matching.</li>
                <li>If a model can generalize to arbitrary arithmetic expressions with high accuracy after seeing only a few examples, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If a model can perform arithmetic in formats or number ranges that are provably absent from its training data, this would falsify the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some large language models show partial generalization to novel arithmetic problems, suggesting possible emergent algorithmic reasoning. </li>
