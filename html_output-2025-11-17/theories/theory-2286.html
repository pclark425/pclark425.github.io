                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that actionable feedback is not only necessary for improvement, but also for the convergence of evaluation protocols towards consensus and reliability in the assessment of LLM-generated scientific theories. Without actionable feedback, evaluators' criteria and judgments will diverge or remain inconsistent, preventing the establishment of robust, shared standards.</p>
