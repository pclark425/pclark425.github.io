                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Reflective Selective Forecasting Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can further enhance the accuracy of scientific discovery probability estimates by engaging in meta-reflection: iteratively evaluating and revising their own forecasting processes, selectively updating beliefs in light of new evidence, and explicitly modeling their own uncertainty and potential biases. The theory asserts that meta-reflection enables LLMs to dynamically adjust their selective forecasting and hedging strategies, leading to self-improving, context-sensitive probability estimates.</p>
