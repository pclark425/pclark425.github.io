                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative, Human-in-the-Loop, and Self-Refining Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is achieved through an iterative process that combines automated assessment, human expert feedback, and self-refinement of evaluation criteria. The process is cyclical: LLM outputs are first evaluated by automated systems, then by human experts, and the results of both are used to refine the evaluation criteria and algorithms, leading to progressively more accurate and robust assessments.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>The process may reach a plateau where further iterations yield diminishing improvements.</li>
                <li>Over-refinement of criteria may lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability to novel theory types.</li>
