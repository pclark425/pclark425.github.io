                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented and Ensemble Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can more accurately estimate the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries when their internal knowledge is augmented with contemporaneous, external information via retrieval, and when their outputs are aggregated in ensembles. Retrieval provides up-to-date evidence that compensates for knowledge cutoffs, while ensembling mitigates individual model biases and calibration errors, leading to improved accuracy and calibration that can approach or match human crowd performance in some settings.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adding high-quality, contemporaneous retrieval to an LLM with a knowledge cutoff will improve its forecasting accuracy for future scientific discoveries compared to the same model without retrieval.</li>
                <li>Aggregating forecasts from a diverse set of LLMs will yield better calibration and accuracy than most individual models, especially on out-of-domain or ambiguous scientific discovery questions.</li>
                <li>Ensembling LLMs with different architectures and training histories will outperform synthetic persona ensembles from a single model.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combining retrieval-augmented LLM ensembles with human crowd forecasts could surpass both LLM-only and human-only aggregates in forecasting future scientific discoveries.</li>
                <li>There exists an optimal ensemble size and diversity that maximizes forecasting accuracy and calibration for scientific discovery prediction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If retrieval-augmented LLMs do not outperform non-retrieval baselines on forecasting future scientific discoveries, the retrieval augmentation law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLM ensembles do not outperform most individual models or do not approach human crowd performance, the ensemble aggregation law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If knowledge cutoff cannot be compensated by retrieval, the knowledge cutoff compensation law would be called into question.</li>
