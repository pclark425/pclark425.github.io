                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory: General Framework</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the pathogenesis and detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are governed by the dynamic bidirectional flux of molecular biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-beta, tau, neurofilament light chain) between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral compartments (blood, CSF, lymph). The rates and patterns of this flux, rather than static concentrations, determine both disease risk and the sensitivity/specificity of peripheral biomarker-based diagnostics. Disruptions in transporters, clearance pathways, or peripheral sinks alter this flux, leading to CNS accumulation of pathogenic proteins and decoupling of peripheral biomarker levels from CNS pathology.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Novel imaging or kinetic assays that directly measure biomarker flux will outperform static concentration-based tests for early AD detection.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If peripheral biomarker levels always correlate with CNS pathology regardless of flux impairment, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If enhancing flux does not improve peripheral biomarker detectability or CNS clearance, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where peripheral biomarker levels are elevated without CNS pathology, possibly due to peripheral production or non-AD processes. </li>
