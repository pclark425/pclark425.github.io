                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Learned Operator Hypothesis Space Theory (Revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how crossover and mutation operations over literature and codeblocks govern the novelty-executability frontier in genetic ideation and discovery diversity, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The effectiveness of evolutionary operators in discovering novel, executable solutions depends on three interacting factors: (1) solution representation/structure (trees, types, grammars, constraints), (2) the hypothesis space of variations operators can generate, and (3) alignment with viable solutions in the target domain. Representation often provides equal or greater benefits than operator sophistication alone. Learned operators—particularly those based on large pre-trained models—can access richer hypothesis spaces by leveraging statistical patterns from large corpora, but simultaneously narrow search trajectories through training priors. They implicitly encode domain-specific heuristics that improve both novelty and executability when the target domain aligns with training distribution. However, they exhibit systematic bias toward training patterns that can cause catastrophic failure on out-of-distribution problems, require higher computational cost (manageable through ensemble strategies, selective invocation, early stopping), and necessitate robust validation infrastructure (hallucination checks, oracle evaluators, fallback mechanisms). Adaptation occurs primarily through prompt engineering and in-context learning rather than online fine-tuning. Traditional operators remain competitive in many domains, especially with appropriate representations and constraints. Learned operators' benefits are most pronounced when: (1) target domain has strong statistical regularities present in training data, (2) evaluation is expensive relative to operator cost, (3) search space is large and poorly structured, and (4) robust validation can be implemented. Hybrid approaches combining learned, traditional, and formal operators can achieve better novelty-executability trade-offs, but optimal mixing is highly problem-dependent. Evidence for discovering fundamentally novel solutions that break learned patterns remains limited.</p>

            <p><strong>Derived From:</strong> <a href="theory-181.html">[theory-181]</a></p>
            <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Elevated representation/structure importance to equal or greater than operator sophistication, making this a core theory component rather than supporting evidence.</li>
                <li>Strengthened training bias limitation with concrete catastrophic failure cases (End2end, ODEFormer), emphasizing this causes performance degradation worse than traditional baselines, not just reduced performance.</li>
                <li>Revised computational cost from limitation to manageable challenge, emphasizing cost management strategies (ensemble mixing, selective invocation, early stopping) as essential components of practical systems.</li>
                <li>Clarified that prompt-based adaptation and in-context learning are primary adaptation mechanisms, with online fine-tuning being rare and less important than initially suggested.</li>
                <li>Elevated validation infrastructure requirement from limitation to essential component, emphasizing learned operators cannot be trusted blindly especially for evaluation functions.</li>
                <li>Strengthened problem-dependent operator utility claim, noting different operators excel on different problem types with no universal dominance.</li>
                <li>Modified domain-specific pretraining claim to note general LLMs with proper prompting can sometimes match domain-specific models, though specialization helps on demanding benchmarks.</li>
                <li>Revised necessity claim to clarify traditional operators remain competitive in many domains, with learned operators most beneficial under specific conditions (expensive evaluation, large poorly-structured search space, strong statistical regularities, robust validation possible).</li>
                <li>Expanded hybrid approach discussion to emphasize optimal mixing is problem-dependent and requires careful design, with some problems benefiting from certain operators while others are hurt.</li>
                <li>Added caveat that evidence for truly novel out-of-distribution discovery remains limited, with most successes on problems with training-distribution patterns.</li>
                <li>Condensed theory description from extremely long paragraph to more concise version while preserving key insights.</li>
                <li>Reorganized supporting evidence to map more clearly to specific theory statements.</li>
                <li>Added theory statement explicitly noting learned operators both expand and narrow search space through training priors.</li>
                <li>Added new predictions about validation infrastructure necessity, representation vs operator importance, and prompt-based adaptation benefits.</li>
                <li>Added negative experiments testing whether representation matters more than operators, whether validation overhead eliminates benefits, and whether cost management reduces benefits to insignificance.</li>
                <li>Made change log more specific about what was changed and why, focusing on substantive revisions rather than just listing additions/removals.</li>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Solution representation/structure (trees, types, grammars, constraints) often provides equal or greater performance benefits than operator sophistication alone, with representation changes yielding 2-4× larger gains than operator changes in some domains.</li>
                <li>Learned operators access richer hypothesis spaces by leveraging training data patterns, but simultaneously narrow effective search trajectories through training priors, creating both benefits (informed exploration) and limitations (training bias).</li>
                <li>LLM-based operators improve executability rates by implicitly encoding domain-specific constraints, conventions, and idioms, but only when target domain aligns with training distribution.</li>
                <li>Learned operators exhibit systematic training bias that can cause catastrophic performance degradation (worse than traditional baselines) on out-of-distribution problems where relevant patterns are absent from training data.</li>
                <li>Adaptation in successful learned operator systems occurs primarily through prompt engineering and in-context learning (meta-prompting, dynamic baselines, reflection, stage-aware weighting) rather than online fine-tuning of model weights.</li>
                <li>Computational cost of learned operators is orders of magnitude higher than traditional operators, but can be effectively managed through ensemble strategies (mixing cheap/expensive models), selective invocation (stagnation-triggered), early stopping, and token reduction, making these strategies essential for practical deployment.</li>
                <li>Learned operators require robust validation infrastructure (hallucination checks, multi-objective test selection, oracle evaluators, fallback mechanisms) and cannot be trusted blindly, especially when used as evaluation or fitness functions.</li>
                <li>Different learned operators excel on different problem types (analytic vs geometric, small vs large datasets, different noise levels), with no single operator approach dominating universally across all problem characteristics.</li>
                <li>Traditional operators remain competitive in many domains, especially with appropriate representations and constraints (grammar-guided GP, type systems, simple mutation with constrained spaces).</li>
                <li>Learned operators' benefits are most pronounced when: (1) target domain has strong statistical regularities present in training data, (2) evaluation is expensive relative to operator cost, (3) search space is large and poorly structured, and (4) robust validation mechanisms can be implemented.</li>
                <li>Hybrid approaches combining learned operators (informed exploration), formal constraints (guaranteed validity), and traditional operators (unbiased variation) can achieve better novelty-executability trade-offs than any single approach, but optimal mixing is highly problem-dependent and requires careful design.</li>
                <li>Evidence for learned operators discovering fundamentally novel solutions that break learned patterns remains limited, with most successes on problems whose patterns likely exist in training distributions.</li>

    <li>Validation infrastructure necessity: VEO requires hallucination checks, Lyria shows LLM evaluators weak vs Oracle (84 vs ~50), CoCoEvo needs multi-objective test selection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1994.html#e1994.0" class="evidence-link">[e1994.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1991.html#e1991.0" class="evidence-link">[e1991.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1993.html#e1993.0" class="evidence-link">[e1993.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Problem-dependent operator utility: CODEEVOLVE meta-prompting excels on analytic tasks while inspiration helps geometric problems; Lyria external operators help some problems (+6%) but hurt others (-6%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1989.html#e1989.0" class="evidence-link">[e1989.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1991.html#e1991.0" class="evidence-link">[e1991.0]</a> </li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems combining tree-structured or type-constrained representations with learned operators will consistently outperform systems using either component alone, with representation providing 2-4× larger performance gains than operator sophistication alone.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems using ensemble strategies (80% cheap model, 20% expensive model) with selective invocation will achieve similar solution quality to always-on expensive LLM operators while reducing computational cost by 50-80%.</li>
                <li>LLM-based operators incorporating per-instance semantic feedback (score vectors, residual-based complementarity) will produce higher-quality offspring than operators conditioning on aggregate fitness alone, with benefits increasing as problem diversity increases.</li>
                <li>Learned operators will require validation infrastructure that catches >20% of invalid outputs without such checks, especially when used as evaluation functions, with validation overhead being necessary for reliable deployment.</li>
                <li>Domain-specific fine-tuning combined with formal type constraints will outperform general-purpose LLM-based operators on demanding domain-specific tasks, with performance gap increasing with domain specificity and constraint strength.</li>
                <li>Prompt-based adaptation mechanisms (meta-prompting, dynamic baselines, reflection) will provide 10-30% performance improvements over fixed prompts when properly designed, without requiring online fine-tuning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learned operators can discover fundamentally novel algorithmic patterns absent from training data through emergent recombination, or if they are fundamentally limited to interpolating known patterns. This has critical implications for scientific discovery and mathematical innovation.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-modal learned operators (combining code LLMs with formal verification models, or multiple specialized models with different training distributions) can achieve better novelty-executability trade-offs than single-modal operators while avoiding individual model training biases.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial training or explicit diversity objectives during operator training can reduce bias toward training patterns while maintaining learned prior benefits, enabling better out-of-distribution exploration without catastrophic failures.</li>
                <li>Whether computational cost of learned operators can be reduced to within 2-5× of traditional operators through model distillation, caching, or architectural improvements while maintaining >80% of performance benefits.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist universal principles for determining when learned operators will outperform traditional operators for a given problem, or if this determination requires empirical testing for each new domain.</li>
                <li>Whether representation/structure design can be automated through learned meta-operators that discover effective encodings, or if representation design will remain a manual human-expert task.</li>
                <li>Whether learned operators can be designed to provide interpretable explanations for proposed variations that enable human understanding and trust in safety-critical domains where black-box operators are unacceptable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that learned operators do not outperform traditional operators on tasks with abundant representative training data when controlling for computational cost would challenge the hypothesis space expansion claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that representation/structure design provides >90% of performance benefits with learned operators providing <10% additional gain would challenge the emphasis on operator sophistication.</li>
                <li>Showing that hybrid learned+traditional operator systems perform no better than traditional operators alone when computational budgets are equalized would challenge the complementarity hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Finding that learned operators consistently fail to discover solutions deviating significantly from training patterns, even when such solutions are optimal and traditional operators can find them, would confirm training bias is fundamental rather than addressable.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that validation infrastructure overhead (checks, fallbacks, oracle evaluators) eliminates >80% of learned operator performance benefits would question their practical applicability.</li>
                <li>Finding that prompt-based adaptation provides no benefit over fixed prompts when controlling for prompt quality would question the value of adaptive mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Showing that cost management strategies (ensemble mixing, selective invocation) reduce learned operator benefits to statistical insignificance would challenge their practical viability.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that learned operators produce no more novel solutions than random generation when controlling for validity would question their value for exploration beyond constraint satisfaction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to quantify the hypothesis space accessible to different operators and compare them systematically, particularly for learned operators where space is implicitly defined by model parameters and training distribution. </li>
    <li>The relationship between training data diversity, domain coverage, and the novelty-executability frontier achievable by learned operators, including how to measure and optimize this to avoid catastrophic out-of-distribution failures. </li>
    <li>How to design learned operators that explicitly balance exploitation of learned patterns with exploration of novel combinations through multi-objective training, explicit diversity mechanisms, or adversarial training. </li>
    <li>Whether more complex learned operators (larger models, more parameters) always improve performance or if there are diminishing returns, overfitting effects, or optimal complexity levels for different problem types. </li>
    <li>How learned operators interact with different selection mechanisms (lexicase, tournament, Pareto-based) and whether certain selection methods are more compatible with learned operators or can compensate for their limitations. </li>
    <li>Whether learned operators can be made interpretable or explainable, whether interpretability trades off with performance, and whether interpretability is necessary for safety-critical applications. </li>
    <li>How to effectively combine multiple learned operators (different LLMs, neural models for different aspects) and whether ensemble approaches provide benefits beyond single-model approaches or primarily serve cost management. </li>
    <li>Whether there exist universal principles for determining when learned operators will outperform traditional operators, or if this requires empirical testing for each domain. </li>
    <li>How to design validation infrastructure that catches learned operator failures without eliminating performance benefits, and what the optimal trade-off is between validation overhead and reliability. </li>
    <li>Whether representation/structure design can be automated or requires human expertise, and how representation choice interacts with the choice of learned vs traditional operators. </li>
