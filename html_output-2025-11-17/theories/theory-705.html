                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-705</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Fourier-Modular Composition Theory of LLM Arithmetic</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs perform arithmetic by hierarchically composing local Fourier-modular operations at each digit position, with global consistency enforced through attention and residual connections. Each digit is processed as a local phase-modular unit, and the LLM's architecture enables the propagation and resolution of carries and overflows through hierarchical, multi-layered transformations. This allows LLMs to generalize arithmetic rules across number lengths and to handle complex arithmetic tasks by recursive composition.</p>
