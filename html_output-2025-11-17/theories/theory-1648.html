                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1648</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck and Contextualization Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is fundamentally constrained by two interacting factors: (1) the information bottleneck imposed by the model's context window and parameterization, and (2) the model's ability to dynamically contextualize and retrieve relevant domain knowledge during simulation. The interplay between these factors determines the upper bound of simulation accuracy for any given scientific subdomain.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is given a context window much larger than the information span required for a task, will simulation accuracy plateau or continue to increase?</li>
                <li>If an LLM is trained to dynamically contextualize across multiple, potentially conflicting scientific subdomains, will it develop meta-contextualization strategies, and how will this affect accuracy?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with small context windows or no retrieval capabilities achieve high simulation accuracy on tasks requiring long-range dependencies, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If increasing context window or retrieval capabilities does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs use implicit knowledge or heuristics to bypass the need for explicit long-range context. </li>
