                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Locality and Operator Scale Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how crossover and mutation operations over literature and codeblocks govern the novelty-executability frontier in genetic ideation and discovery diversity.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the effectiveness of genetic operators (crossover and mutation) in navigating the novelty-executability frontier is fundamentally governed by the interaction between semantic locality (the semantic distance between parent and offspring solutions) and operator scale (the magnitude of structural changes introduced). The theory proposes that there exists an optimal probabilistic relationship between these two dimensions that maximizes discovery diversity while maintaining executability. Specifically, small-scale operators applied to semantically local regions tend to preserve executability but limit novelty, while large-scale operators applied across semantically distant regions maximize novelty but risk executability. The theory posits that the optimal operator scale is inversely proportional to semantic distance, following a power-law relationship with domain-specific parameters. This relationship differs systematically between literature (natural language) and code (formal language) domains due to their differing syntactic constraints, semantic density, and error tolerance. The theory further proposes that semantic distance should be measured in learned embedding spaces that capture both syntactic and functional semantics, and that the relationship holds within specific boundary conditions related to minimum executability thresholds and maximum novelty saturation points.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The probability of maintaining executability after a genetic operation follows a power-law relationship with the product of semantic distance and operator scale: P(executable) ∝ 1/(semantic_distance × operator_scale)^α, where α is a domain-specific exponent (α_code > α_literature, indicating code is more sensitive to the interaction).</li>
                <li>The expected novelty of offspring is directly proportional to both semantic distance and operator scale up to a saturation point: E(novelty) ∝ min(semantic_distance × operator_scale, novelty_max), where novelty_max represents the maximum achievable novelty in the domain.</li>
                <li>There exists an optimal operator scale S* for any given semantic distance D such that S* = k/D^β, where k is a domain-specific constant (k_code < k_literature) and β is a scaling exponent (typically β ≈ 1 for most domains).</li>
                <li>For code domains, k_code is approximately 2-5x smaller than k_literature, meaning code requires proportionally smaller operator scales at equivalent semantic distances to maintain comparable executability rates.</li>
                <li>The novelty-executability frontier can be efficiently explored by adaptively adjusting operator scale inversely to semantic distance, with the optimal strategy being to sample from a distribution of operator scales centered on S* = k/D.</li>
                <li>Crossover operations between semantically distant parents (D > D_threshold) should use smaller-scale exchanges (e.g., single tokens, expressions, or small blocks) to maintain executability above a minimum threshold (typically P(executable) > 0.5).</li>
                <li>Mutation operations should scale their magnitude based on the semantic density of the target region, with semantically dense regions (high local curvature in embedding space) requiring smaller mutations to avoid large semantic jumps.</li>
                <li>The diversity of discovered solutions is maximized when the distribution of operator scales in the population matches the inverse distribution of semantic distances, following the principle of exploration-exploitation balance.</li>
                <li>Literature-based genetic operations can tolerate 2-5x larger operator scales than code-based operations at equivalent semantic distances while maintaining executability above 50%, due to natural language's greater tolerance for syntactic variation and semantic ambiguity.</li>
                <li>The semantic locality principle states that genetic operators should preferentially operate within semantically coherent regions (regions with low semantic gradient) to maximize the probability of generating executable and meaningful offspring.</li>
                <li>Semantic distance should be measured in learned embedding spaces that capture both syntactic structure and functional/behavioral semantics, with the choice of embedding space affecting the quantitative parameters but not the qualitative relationships of the theory.</li>
                <li>There exists a minimum executability threshold (P_min, typically 0.1-0.3) below which genetic operations fail to contribute to evolutionary progress, and operator scales should be constrained to maintain P(executable) > P_min.</li>
                <li>The relationship between operator scale and semantic distance exhibits phase transitions at critical points: below a minimum semantic distance D_min, operator scale has minimal effect on executability; above a maximum semantic distance D_max, no operator scale can maintain executability above threshold.</li>
                <li>Multi-step genetic operations that traverse semantic space through intermediate points can achieve larger total semantic distances while maintaining executability compared to single-step operations, following a 'semantic path' principle where the sum of intermediate semantic distances can exceed the direct semantic distance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Genetic programming systems that use semantic-aware crossover operators show improved performance over purely syntactic operators, demonstrating that semantic information about the relationship between parent solutions improves offspring quality and executability. </li>
    <li>Large-scale mutations in code often result in non-executable programs due to syntactic and semantic violations, while small-scale mutations (single token or line changes) tend to produce executable but less novel variants, suggesting a trade-off between operator scale and executability. </li>
    <li>Novelty search algorithms that ignore fitness and focus purely on behavioral novelty can discover diverse solutions, but often at the cost of solution quality or executability, indicating that novelty and executability exist on a frontier that must be balanced. </li>
    <li>Code has stricter syntactic constraints than natural language, making it more fragile to large-scale genetic operations, with even small syntactic errors rendering programs non-executable. </li>
    <li>Semantic similarity metrics in natural language processing, particularly those based on distributed representations, show that semantically similar texts can have very different surface structures, suggesting that semantic distance is a more meaningful metric than syntactic distance for predicting the effects of genetic operations. </li>
    <li>Automated program repair systems that use small, localized mutations show higher success rates than those using large-scale changes, supporting the principle that operator scale should be constrained to maintain executability. </li>
    <li>Grammatical evolution and other constrained genetic programming approaches that preserve syntactic structure show improved executability rates, suggesting that syntactic constraints interact with semantic locality to determine executability. </li>
    <li>Quality diversity algorithms that explicitly balance novelty and quality demonstrate that maintaining diverse populations requires managing the trade-off between exploration (novelty) and exploitation (executability/quality). </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A genetic programming system that dynamically adjusts crossover point selection based on semantic similarity between parent regions (using embedding-based similarity) will produce 20-40% more executable offspring than random crossover while maintaining comparable or higher novelty levels.</li>
                <li>Mutation operators that scale their magnitude inversely with local semantic density (measured by embedding space curvature or local variance) will outperform fixed-magnitude mutations by 15-30% on combined executability-novelty metrics.</li>
                <li>In literature generation tasks, crossover operations can successfully exchange paragraph-sized blocks (50-200 tokens) between semantically similar documents (cosine similarity > 0.7) while maintaining coherence >80% of the time, whereas code generation requires function-level or smaller exchanges (<50 tokens) to achieve similar executability rates.</li>
                <li>A hybrid operator that uses large-scale operations (>100 tokens) for literature components and small-scale operations (<20 tokens) for code components in mixed literature-code documents (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, literate programming) will achieve 30-50% better novelty-executability balance than uniform operators.</li>
                <li>Populations that maintain a diversity of semantic distances (measured by pairwise distance variance) will benefit from a corresponding diversity of operator scales, with performance degrading by 20-40% when operator scale distribution is uniform across all semantic distance ranges.</li>
                <li>Implementing an adaptive operator selection mechanism that chooses operator scale S = k/D for each operation will converge to solutions on the Pareto frontier of novelty-executability 2-3x faster than fixed operator scale approaches.</li>
                <li>In domains with strong modularity (e.g., object-oriented code), applying the semantic locality principle at the module level (treating modules as atomic units for semantic distance calculation) will improve executability by 25-40% compared to token-level semantic distance.</li>
                <li>Measuring semantic distance using task-specific embeddings (e.g., CodeBERT for code, domain-specific BERT for literature) will yield 15-25% better prediction of executability outcomes compared to generic embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, generic BERT).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist 'semantic bridges' - specific intermediate semantic regions or archetypal patterns that allow large-scale operators to traverse large semantic distances (D > 2×D_threshold) while maintaining executability >50%, potentially enabling discontinuous jumps in the solution space that could accelerate discovery of novel solutions by orders of magnitude.</li>
                <li>The optimal ratio k_code/k_literature may be universal across different programming languages and natural languages (ranging from 0.2 to 0.5), or it may vary systematically with language complexity metrics such as Kolmogorov complexity, syntactic entropy, or type system strictness, which would enable prediction of optimal operator scales for new languages without empirical tuning.</li>
                <li>Extremely high semantic distances (D > D_critical, where D_critical ≈ 3-5× median population distance) may exhibit a phase transition where operator scale becomes irrelevant to executability, as the semantic gap is too large to bridge through any single genetic operation, potentially requiring fundamentally different evolutionary mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Multi-step genetic operations that gradually increase semantic distance through intermediate offspring (semantic gradient ascent) may be able to achieve 2-10x larger total semantic distances while maintaining executability >50% compared to single-step operations, potentially following a 'semantic annealing' schedule similar to simulated annealing.</li>
                <li>The theory may extend to higher-order interactions where the semantic locality of three or more parents in crossover operations creates emergent constraints on operator scale that don't exist in pairwise operations, potentially enabling novel recombination strategies that access regions of solution space unreachable by binary crossover.</li>
                <li>There may be specific semantic dimensions (e.g., syntactic vs. functional vs. behavioral semantics) where operator scale constraints differ dramatically (potentially by 5-10x), suggesting that decomposing semantic distance into orthogonal components could enable more sophisticated operator design that optimizes each dimension independently.</li>
                <li>The relationship between semantic distance and operator scale may exhibit fractal or self-similar properties at different scales of abstraction (token, expression, function, module, program), where the same inverse relationship holds at each level but with different constants, potentially enabling hierarchical operator design.</li>
                <li>Populations evolved under semantic locality-aware operators may develop emergent 'semantic structure' where solutions cluster in specific regions of semantic space that are particularly amenable to genetic operations, potentially creating a form of evolutionary niche construction that facilitates future evolution.</li>
                <li>The theory may generalize beyond genetic programming to other forms of evolutionary computation and even to human creativity, where the 'semantic distance' between ideas and the 'scale' of conceptual changes may follow similar inverse relationships in determining the viability and novelty of new ideas.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a genetic programming system using inversely-scaled operators (S = k/D) performs worse than random-scale operators on both executability and novelty metrics across multiple domains, this would challenge the core inverse relationship proposed by the theory.</li>
                <li>If code and literature domains show no significant difference (less than 20% difference) in optimal operator scale at equivalent semantic distances across multiple programming and natural languages, this would contradict the domain-specific constant k prediction.</li>
                <li>If increasing operator scale at fixed semantic distance does not increase novelty beyond a certain threshold (or if novelty plateaus at low operator scales), this would challenge the linear relationship between operator scale and novelty.</li>
                <li>If executability rates do not follow the predicted power-law relationship with the product of semantic distance and operator scale (i.e., if P(executable) vs. (D × S) does not fit a power law with R² > 0.6), this would contradict the multiplicative interaction model.</li>
                <li>If populations evolved with semantically-aware, scale-adjusted operators show no improvement (less than 10% improvement) in discovery diversity or convergence speed compared to traditional genetic programming across multiple benchmark problems, this would undermine the practical utility of the theory.</li>
                <li>If semantic distance measured in embedding space does not correlate (R < 0.4) with executability outcomes after genetic operations, this would challenge the fundamental premise that semantic locality governs executability.</li>
                <li>If the optimal operator scale does not vary inversely with semantic distance (i.e., if empirically determined S* vs. D does not show a negative correlation with R < -0.5), this would directly contradict the central mathematical relationship of the theory.</li>
                <li>If multi-step genetic operations that traverse semantic space gradually do not achieve larger total semantic distances while maintaining executability compared to single-step operations, this would challenge the semantic path principle.</li>
                <li>If the theory's predictions fail to generalize across different types of genetic operators (e.g., if it works for crossover but not mutation, or vice versa), this would suggest the theory is incomplete or that different operators require different theoretical frameworks.</li>
                <li>If changing the embedding space used to measure semantic distance (e.g., from Word2Vec to BERT to CodeBERT) changes the qualitative relationships (not just quantitative parameters) predicted by the theory, this would challenge the claim that the theory is robust to embedding choice.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for the role of population diversity dynamics and how semantic locality changes over evolutionary time as the population converges or diverges, particularly how the distribution of semantic distances evolves and whether this requires dynamic adjustment of operator scale distributions. </li>
    <li>The interaction between semantic locality and other genetic programming mechanisms such as elitism, selection pressure, and population size is not explicitly modeled, though these factors likely influence the effective semantic distance distribution and optimal operator scales. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how semantic locality interacts with the phenomenon of code bloat or intron accumulation in genetic programming, particularly whether bloat affects semantic distance measurements or whether semantic locality-aware operators can mitigate bloat. </li>
    <li>The role of human-defined fitness functions versus emergent novelty metrics in shaping the semantic landscape is not fully integrated into the theory, particularly how fitness landscapes interact with semantic distance to determine evolutionary trajectories. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for the computational cost of calculating semantic distances in real-time during evolution, which may be prohibitive for large populations or complex embedding models, potentially limiting practical applicability. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how semantic locality principles apply to co-evolutionary systems where multiple populations evolve simultaneously, potentially with different semantic spaces and operator scale requirements. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for the role of neutral mutations (mutations that don't change semantics) in evolutionary search, which may be important for traversing semantic space without affecting executability. </li>
