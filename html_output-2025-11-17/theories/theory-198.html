                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-198</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Vision-Language-Action Co-Training Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about when and how pretraining on text worlds transfers to 3D embodied tasks, including mappings between high-level action semantics and low-level perception and predicted sample complexity gains, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For embodied tasks requiring tight coupling between perception, language understanding, and motor control, co-training on vision-language data and robot trajectories simultaneously is more effective than sequential pretraining followed by finetuning when: (1) robot data is limited (<100K trajectories), (2) the action space is complex and high-dimensional, and (3) the model has sufficient capacity to maintain multiple capabilities. Co-training preserves language and vision capabilities while learning action mappings, prevents catastrophic forgetting, and enables the model to learn joint representations that bridge semantic and sensorimotor spaces. The optimal mixing ratio between web data and robot data depends on task complexity, available robot data scale, and the semantic relevance of web data to the target tasks. However, for simpler tasks or when using frozen pretrained encoders, sequential training or modular approaches can be equally or more effective.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Co-training prevents catastrophic forgetting of language and vision capabilities while learning action mappings, particularly for large models (>1B parameters)</li>
                <li>Joint optimization enables learning of cross-modal representations that bridge semantic and sensorimotor spaces more effectively than sequential training when action spaces are complex (>100 discrete actions or continuous high-dimensional control)</li>
                <li>The optimal mixing ratio between web data and robot data typically ranges from 50-66% robot data, depending on the relative scale and quality of each data source and model architecture</li>
                <li>Co-training is most beneficial when robot data is limited (<100K trajectories) and web data can provide complementary semantic knowledge relevant to the target tasks</li>
                <li>Larger models (>5B parameters) benefit more from co-training due to increased capacity to maintain multiple capabilities simultaneously without interference</li>
                <li>Co-training with interactive expert guidance (e.g., DAgger-style) can be more effective than offline co-training, especially for complex long-horizon tasks</li>
                <li>The benefits of co-training diminish when using frozen pretrained encoders, as the encoder's representations are not adapted to the specific action space</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>RT-2 using co-finetuning (keeping web VLM data during robot training) achieved ~2x better generalization than naive finetuning on robot data alone, with RT-2-PaLI-X showing large improvements in out-of-distribution generalization <a href="../results/extraction-result-1843.html#e1843.0" class="evidence-link">[e1843.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1843.html#e1843.1" class="evidence-link">[e1843.1]</a> </li>

    <li>RT-2 models trained from scratch on robot data performed poorly even at 5B scale, while co-finetuned models achieved strong generalization, indicating pretraining is critical <a href="../results/extraction-result-1843.html#e1843.1" class="evidence-link">[e1843.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1843.html#e1843.2" class="evidence-link">[e1843.2]</a> </li>
    <li>EMMA using online cross-modality imitation (DAgger-DPO) with LLM expert achieved 71-94% success vs near-zero for behavior cloning alone, showing benefits of interactive co-training with expert guidance <a href="../results/extraction-result-1709.html#e1709.0" class="evidence-link">[e1709.0]</a> </li>
    <li>EmbodiedGPT using chain-of-thought pretraining on Ego4D (200M videos) + robot finetuning achieved 50.8-81.2% success with only 10-25 demos vs 0% for baselines, demonstrating large-scale multimodal pretraining enables few-shot transfer <a href="../results/extraction-result-1856.html#e1856.0" class="evidence-link">[e1856.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1856.html#e1856.1" class="evidence-link">[e1856.1]</a> </li>
    <li>UniPi using internet-scale video pretraining (14M video-text pairs + 60M image-text pairs) + Bridge finetuning (7.2k pairs) achieved 77.1% success vs 72.6% without pretraining, showing modest but consistent gains from web-scale pretraining <a href="../results/extraction-result-1855.html#e1855.0" class="evidence-link">[e1855.0]</a> </li>

    <li>MineCLIP co-finetuning on web VLM tasks and robot trajectories was more effective than finetuning only on robot data, with co-finetuning preserving useful VLM capabilities <a href="../results/extraction-result-1843.html#e1843.2" class="evidence-link">[e1843.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Co-training with curriculum scheduling (gradually increasing robot data proportion from 30% to 70% over training) should outperform fixed mixing ratios by allowing initial semantic learning followed by action specialization</li>
                <li>Co-training with task-relevant web data (e.g., manipulation videos filtered by object categories present in robot tasks) should be 10-20% more effective than generic web data</li>
                <li>Multi-stage co-training (web pretraining → mixed co-training at 50/50 → robot finetuning at 90/10) should outperform single-stage approaches by 5-15% on held-out tasks</li>
                <li>Co-training with synthetic robot data generated from simulators should provide benefits intermediate between web-only (baseline) and real-robot data (upper bound), achieving 60-80% of the real-data performance gain</li>
                <li>Co-training with multiple related robot tasks simultaneously (e.g., pick-and-place + pushing + pouring) should improve zero-shot transfer to new tasks by 15-25% compared to single-task training</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether co-training benefits scale linearly with model size or plateau at some capacity threshold (e.g., 10B, 50B, or 100B parameters)</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal optimal mixing ratio (e.g., 60/40 robot/web) that generalizes across different robot platforms (arms, mobile manipulators, humanoids) and task domains (manipulation, navigation, locomotion)</li>
                <li>Whether co-training can compensate for very limited robot data (<1K trajectories) or if minimum data thresholds exist below which co-training provides no benefit</li>
                <li>Whether co-training with multiple robot morphologies simultaneously (e.g., 7-DOF arm + mobile base + humanoid) would improve or hurt transfer to each individual morphology due to competing optimization objectives</li>
                <li>Whether co-training with adversarial or contrastive objectives between web and robot data would improve robustness and generalization compared to standard supervised co-training</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal mixing ratio changes during training (e.g., starting with more web data and gradually increasing robot data proportion) or should remain constant</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that sequential pretraining→finetuning with proper learning rate scheduling and regularization outperforms co-training across multiple robot platforms would challenge the necessity of joint optimization</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that co-training with random web data (unrelated to robot tasks) performs as well as task-relevant web data would challenge the importance of semantic relevance and suggest co-training benefits are primarily from regularization</li>
                <li>Showing that co-training benefits disappear with sufficient robot data (>1M trajectories) would challenge the long-term value of web data and suggest it only helps in low-data regimes</li>
                <li>Finding that smaller models (<1B parameters) benefit more from co-training than larger models would challenge capacity-based explanations and suggest architectural factors are more important</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that frozen pretrained encoders with simple finetuning of action heads achieve comparable performance to full co-training would challenge the need for joint representation learning</li>
                <li>Finding that co-training with multiple unrelated tasks hurts performance compared to single-task training would challenge the generality of multi-task learning benefits</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
