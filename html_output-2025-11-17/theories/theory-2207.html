                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories (Meta-Epistemic Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the epistemic reliability of LLM-generated scientific theories is not solely a function of the LLM's internal knowledge or the evaluator's expertise, but arises from the meta-level interaction between the generative and evaluative processes. The theory posits that the epistemic status (truth, plausibility, novelty) of LLM-generated theories is best understood as a property of the coupled system, rather than of either component in isolation.</p>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the epistemic reliability of LLM-generated theories is unchanged by the diversity or interaction of evaluators, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If meta-level coupling does not affect the truth or plausibility of generated theories, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
