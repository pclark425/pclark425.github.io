                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the information compression inherent in neural language models' representations leads to a loss of fine-grained symbolic distinctions necessary for strict logical reasoning. As information is compressed into high-dimensional vectors, subtle differences between logical forms, variable identities, or rule applications are blurred, resulting in failures to maintain logical consistency or perform precise inference.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs often conflate similar but distinct logical statements, such as confusing universal and existential quantifiers. </li>
    <li>Compression in neural representations is known to cause information loss, as seen in autoencoders and deep networks. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs struggle to distinguish between logically equivalent but syntactically different statements. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Somewhat related to existing work on information bottlenecks, but the focus on logical reasoning is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Information loss due to compression in neural networks is well-known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between compression-induced loss and logical reasoning failures in LLMs is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Reducing the degree of compression (e.g., via larger hidden states or explicit symbolic slots) will improve logical reasoning performance.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring discrimination between closely related logical forms will be especially challenging for highly compressed models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It is unknown whether alternative encoding schemes (e.g., sparse or disentangled representations) can fully preserve symbolic distinctions.</li>
                <li>The trade-off between compression for generalization and the need for fine-grained symbolic fidelity is not yet quantified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly compressed neural models can reliably distinguish all relevant logical forms, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If logical errors persist even in models with minimal compression, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can distinguish certain logical forms in short contexts, suggesting that compression effects may be context-dependent. </li>
