                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Graph-Based Method Transfer Constraint Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how scientific procedural knowledge transfers across different experimental domains and contexts, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Graph-based methods transfer successfully when the target domain's graph structure satisfies the structural and semantic assumptions of the source method. Transfer success depends on four key dimensions: (1) Structural assumptions - whether the graph topology (locality, connectivity patterns, degree distributions) is preserved; (2) Semantic assumptions - whether edge meanings and node relationships are consistent; (3) Dynamic assumptions - whether temporal evolution patterns are similar; and (4) Physical constraints - whether domain-specific constraints (e.g., distance, reachability) apply. Methods making weaker assumptions transfer more broadly, but may sacrifice performance. The theory predicts that: spectral methods require similar eigenstructure and degree distributions; diffusion methods require consistent flow dynamics and appropriate directionality; message-passing methods require meaningful neighborhood aggregation; and topology-based methods (e.g., centrality measures) transfer most broadly because they rely only on connectivity patterns. Violations of assumptions require either architectural adaptation (e.g., modifying operators for undirected graphs) or explicit constraint encoding (e.g., physical reachability masks). The optimal transfer strategy balances assumption strength (stronger assumptions enable better performance but limit transferability) with domain alignment (how well source and target satisfy shared assumptions).</p>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Graph neural networks will transfer successfully from molecular property prediction to protein structure prediction because both domains satisfy locality (local chemical environments matter) and have similar graph construction principles (atoms/residues as nodes, bonds/contacts as edges)</li>
                <li>Spectral graph methods will transfer better between social networks with similar degree distributions (e.g., both scale-free) than between networks with different distributions (e.g., scale-free vs. regular lattice)</li>
                <li>Topology-based methods (betweenness, PageRank) will transfer successfully from web graphs to citation networks because both have similar link semantics (endorsement/reference)</li>
                <li>Traffic forecasting methods using physical constraints will transfer successfully to other transportation modes (e.g., rail, air) with appropriate constraint modifications (track connectivity, flight routes)</li>
                <li>Temporal graph methods will transfer between domains with similar temporal dynamics (e.g., both have daily cycles) but fail when dynamics differ fundamentally (e.g., seasonal vs. event-driven)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether graph neural networks can learn to automatically adapt to different graph assumptions (e.g., learn to ignore directionality when it's not meaningful) without explicit architectural changes or meta-learning</li>
                <li>Whether there exist universal graph representations that preserve transfer across all domains, or whether domain-specific graph construction is always necessary for optimal performance</li>
                <li>Whether methods that explicitly model assumption violations (e.g., learning which edges to ignore) will outperform methods that require assumption satisfaction</li>
                <li>Whether graph methods will maintain their transfer advantages as graph size scales to billions of nodes, or whether computational constraints will favor simpler methods</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid methods that combine multiple graph assumptions (e.g., both spectral and diffusion) will transfer more robustly than methods based on single assumptions</li>
                <li>Whether graph construction choices (e.g., k-NN vs. ε-radius, weighted vs. unweighted) have consistent effects on transfer across domains or are domain-specific</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that graph methods transfer successfully despite systematic violations of their structural assumptions (e.g., spectral methods working well despite completely different eigenstructure) would challenge the theory's core claim about assumption alignment</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that methods with strong, domain-specific assumptions transfer as broadly as methods with weak, general assumptions would contradict the predicted tradeoff between assumption strength and transferability</li>
                <li>Showing that explicit physical constraint encoding provides no benefit over unconstrained methods would challenge the prediction that domain constraints must be explicitly encoded</li>
                <li>Finding that graph construction strategy has no systematic impact on transfer success would challenge the theory's claim about the importance of domain-appropriate graph construction</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that architectural adaptation is unnecessary when assumptions are violated (i.e., methods work without modification) would challenge the predicted need for adaptation</li>
                <li>Finding that topology-based methods do not transfer more broadly than semantic-dependent methods would contradict the prediction about assumption strength and transferability</li>
