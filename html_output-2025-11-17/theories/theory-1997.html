                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Abstraction Law in LLM-Driven Biomedical Knowledge Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large, diverse corpora of biomedical abstracts, can induce higher-order, qualitative gene–disease association laws that are not explicitly stated in any single abstract. The emergent abstraction process leverages distributed semantic representations and cross-document pattern recognition, enabling the LLM to synthesize novel, generalizable laws from aggregate evidence.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will be able to extract gene–disease association laws that are not explicitly stated in any single abstract but are supported by distributed evidence.</li>
                <li>The strength of association laws extracted by LLMs will increase with the number of weakly supportive abstracts.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to identify novel associations that are missed by traditional rule-based extraction methods.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize higher-order, multi-gene or multi-disease association laws from distributed evidence.</li>
                <li>Emergent laws may capture context-dependent or conditional associations not accessible to traditional meta-analysis.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially identify latent variables or hidden confounders through emergent abstraction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to extract emergent laws from distributed evidence, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot amplify weak signals into robust association laws, the distributed evidence amplification law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce explicit statements and fail to synthesize novel laws, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where distributed evidence is too weak or inconsistent for meaningful law abstraction. </li>
    <li>Situations where emergent laws are spurious due to correlated noise across abstracts. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
