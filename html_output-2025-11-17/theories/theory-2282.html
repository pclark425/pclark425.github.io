                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2282</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative, interactive process between human experts and AI systems. The process leverages the complementary strengths of humans (domain expertise, intuition, contextual judgment) and AI (systematic, large-scale, unbiased filtering) to refine, challenge, and validate candidate theories, leading to higher scientific value and reduced risk of error or bias.</p>
