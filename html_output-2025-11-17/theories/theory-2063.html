                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Quantitative Law Discovery via LLM-Driven Scholarly Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can autonomously identify, abstract, and synthesize emergent quantitative laws that are not explicitly stated in any single paper. By leveraging their ability to model context, semantics, and mathematical relationships, LLMs can generalize across studies, reconcile conflicting findings, and propose unified quantitative relationships that reflect the underlying phenomena described in the literature.</p>
