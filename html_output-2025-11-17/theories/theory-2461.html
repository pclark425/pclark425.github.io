                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Formulation 1: Network Integration and Stress Adaptability)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective resistance of certain visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology is governed by the intrinsic integration and cohesiveness of their molecular signaling and proteostasis networks. Neurons with highly interconnected, redundant, and feedback-rich pathways can rapidly sense, adapt to, and neutralize proteotoxic stress, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis and resisting pathological aggregation. In contrast, neurons with fragmented or poorly integrated networks are less able to mount effective adaptive responses, rendering them more vulnerable to Aβ and tau-induced degeneration.</p>

                <li>Artificially engineering network integration in vulnerable neurons (e.g., via synthetic biology approaches) will confer resistance to Aβ and tau pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with highly integrated networks are not more resistant to Aβ and tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing network integration does not improve resistance, the theory would be undermined.</li>
