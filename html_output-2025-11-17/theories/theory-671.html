                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that prompting large language models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate rules from their pretraining (literature-derived) knowledge, and then empirically validating and operationalizing these rules as measurable feature functions on structured data, enables the construction of interpretable, high-performing predictive models that can outperform black-box deep learning baselines in scientific domains. The theory is grounded in the LLM4SD pipeline and related evidence, and is further supported by the observed benefits of combining literature-synthesized and data-inferred rules, as well as the importance of domain-specific pretraining and ablation studies.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLM4SD pipeline demonstrates that LLM-synthesized and empirically validated rules, when operationalized as features, yield interpretable models that outperform GNNs and random forest baselines on 58 molecular property tasks. The combination of literature-synthesized and data-inferred rules outperforms either alone in all domains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.0" class="evidence-link">[e6058.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Ablation studies in LLM4SD show that models using both literature-synthesized and data-inferred features outperform those using only one type, and that domain-specific pretraining (e.g., Galactica) further improves performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.0" class="evidence-link">[e6058.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM4SD's interpretable models (random forest or linear) trained on LLM-derived features achieve higher AUC-ROC and lower MAE/RMSE than state-of-the-art GNNs and RF+ECFP4 baselines across physiology, biophysics, quantum mechanics, and physical chemistry tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.0" class="evidence-link">[e6058.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Statistical validation of individual rules via Mann-Whitney U tests and t-tests, and cross-referencing with domain literature, supports the empirical validity of many LLM-synthesized rules. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.0" class="evidence-link">[e6058.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some rules inferred by LLMs are not found in the literature, suggesting the potential for novel discovery, but also the need for empirical validation to filter spurious rules. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.0" class="evidence-link">[e6058.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Fine-tuned GPT-3 models for predictive chemistry (Smit et al.) and Jablonka et al. (2024) show that LLMs, when adapted to domain data, can match or outperform conventional techniques in property prediction and reaction yield estimation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6022.html#e6022.3" class="evidence-link">[e6022.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6006.html#e6006.10" class="evidence-link">[e6006.10]</a> </li>
    <li>Augmenting interpretable models with LLM-derived features during training can improve predictive performance while preserving interpretability. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6022.html#e6022.8" class="evidence-link">[e6022.8]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a novel integration of LLM-based synthesis with empirical validation and interpretable modeling, directly abstracted from recent empirical work (LLM4SD) and supported by ablation and benchmarking evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Rule extraction and empirical validation are established in interpretable ML, and LLMs have been used for knowledge extraction, but not in combination as a systematic pipeline for scientific prediction.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes that LLM-guided rule synthesis, when combined with empirical validation and operationalization as features, enables interpretable models that can outperform black-box baselines in scientific prediction, and that combining literature-synthesized and data-inferred rules is superior to either alone.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying LLM-guided rule extraction and empirical validation to other scientific domains (e.g., materials science, biology) will yield interpretable models that match or exceed black-box baselines.</li>
                <li>Combining literature-synthesized and data-inferred rules will outperform using either alone in predictive tasks, as measured by standard metrics (AUC-ROC, MAE, RMSE).</li>
                <li>Domain-specific pretraining of LLMs will further improve the quality and relevance of synthesized rules and downstream model performance.</li>
                <li>Empirically validated LLM-synthesized rules will align with known domain knowledge and be statistically significant predictors in new datasets.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-guided rule extraction may enable the discovery of genuinely novel scientific rules not present in the literature or current domain knowledge, which could be experimentally validated.</li>
                <li>Operationalizing LLM-synthesized rules in domains with highly complex or non-linear relationships (e.g., genomics, climate modeling) may yield diminishing returns compared to black-box models.</li>
                <li>In domains with limited structured data or highly tacit knowledge, the approach may require adaptation or hybridization with other methods.</li>
                <li>The approach may reveal systematic biases or gaps in LLM pretraining corpora if certain domain rules are consistently missed or misrepresented.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-guided rule extraction and empirical validation do not yield interpretable models that match or exceed black-box baselines (e.g., GNNs, deep neural nets) on new scientific prediction tasks, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If the approach fails to generalize to new scientific domains or tasks (e.g., fails in biology or materials science), the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If empirically validated LLM-synthesized rules are consistently spurious or not statistically significant, the theory's core mechanism is invalidated.</li>
                <li>If combining literature-synthesized and data-inferred rules does not outperform using either alone, the theory's claim of synergy is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some rules synthesized by LLMs may be spurious or not found in the literature, raising questions about their validity and the need for careful empirical validation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6058.html#e6058.0" class="evidence-link">[e6058.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In some molecule-generation tasks, specialized small models (e.g., MolT5, Text+Chem T5) outperform instruction-tuned LLMs, suggesting that rule-based approaches may not always be superior for all tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6077.html#e6077.0" class="evidence-link">[e6077.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The approach may not fully account for domains where knowledge is highly tacit, multimodal, or not well represented in text corpora. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6009.html#e6009.7" class="evidence-link">[e6009.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6009.html#e6009.5" class="evidence-link">[e6009.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a new theory, directly abstracted from recent empirical work (LLM4SD) and supported by ablation and benchmarking evidence, and is not present in prior interpretable ML or LLM literature as a unified framework.</p>
