                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HMOT: Hierarchical Modular Orchestration for Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be orchestrated in a hierarchical, modular fashion to distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers. By decomposing the distillation process into specialized modules (e.g., retrieval, summarization, abstraction, synthesis, contradiction detection), and coordinating these modules through a central orchestrator, the system can iteratively refine, validate, and generalize scientific theories in response to a specific query or topic.</p>
