                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Dynamic Evaluation Manifolds for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation space for LLM-generated scientific theories is not static, but dynamically adapts based on evolving scientific standards, risk tolerance, and domain-specific priorities. The evaluation manifold is thus a time- and context-dependent structure, and effective evaluation requires continuous updating of criteria and calibration thresholds in response to new scientific developments and societal needs.</p>
