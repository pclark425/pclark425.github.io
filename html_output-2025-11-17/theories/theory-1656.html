                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Tool-Augmented Simulation: Externalization of Domain-Specific Reasoning and Computation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is fundamentally determined by the degree to which domain-specific reasoning and computation can be externalized to specialized tools, and the effectiveness of the LLM-tool interface. The locus of simulation bottlenecks shifts from the LLM's internal limitations to the integration and orchestration of external resources as tool augmentation increases.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the benefit of domain-specific tools is known, its explicit theoretical role in simulation accuracy for LLMs is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Domain-specific tools are known to improve task performance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the dependency of simulation accuracy on the match between tool domain optimization and simulation requirements.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained end-to-end with tool use as part of their objective, the bottleneck may shift again, possibly enabling emergent simulation capabilities.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with poor tool integration still achieve high simulation accuracy, the theory's bottleneck claim is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs without tool augmentation can solve tasks requiring formal computation, the externalization bottleneck law is challenged.</li>
