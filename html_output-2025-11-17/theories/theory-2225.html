                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative, Human-in-the-Loop, and Self-Refining Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most robust evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories emerges from an iterative process that integrates human expertise, LLM self-assessment, and systematic refinement. The process leverages feedback loops, error detection, and adaptive trust calibration to maximize both accuracy and scientific insight, while minimizing bias and blind spots inherent to either humans or LLMs alone.</p>
