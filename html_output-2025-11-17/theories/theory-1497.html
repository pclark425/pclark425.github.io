                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the brain represents conceptual knowledge in multiple, co-existing representational formats (e.g., symbolic, analog, sensory-motor, statistical), and that a domain-general arbitration mechanism dynamically selects or blends these formats for a given cognitive task. The selection is governed by a precision-weighted process, where the reliability (precision) of each format's predictions for the current context determines its influence on behavior and cognition.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies show that the same concept can be accessed via different neural systems (e.g., visual, verbal, motor), depending on context. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In tasks where one representational format is made less reliable (e.g., by adding noise to visual input), participants will shift to using alternative formats (e.g., verbal or motor codes) for the same concept.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the precision of a less-dominant format (e.g., via training or neurostimulation) will cause it to dominate conceptual processing, even in contexts where it is not typically used.</li>
                <li>In individuals with atypical format precision profiles (e.g., synesthesia, autism), the arbitration mechanism will produce unique patterns of conceptual access and reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a new representational format is introduced (e.g., via sensory substitution), the arbitration mechanism will integrate it based on its precision.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If participants do not shift to alternative formats when the dominant format is degraded, the theory's arbitration mechanism is called into question.</li>
                <li>If neuroimaging fails to show any context-dependent shifts in representational format use, the theory's predictions are undermined.</li>
                <li>If the influence of a representational format on behavior is not proportional to its measured precision, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the neural implementation of the arbitration mechanism. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how new representational formats are acquired or integrated. </li>
