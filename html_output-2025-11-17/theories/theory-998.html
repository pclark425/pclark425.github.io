                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Utilization Theory for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by employing a hierarchical memory system, where short-term, mid-term, and long-term memories are dynamically managed and selectively accessed based on the agent's current context, task complexity, and environmental cues. The theory asserts that such a structure enables efficient retrieval, abstraction, and generalization, supporting both immediate action and long-term planning.</p>
