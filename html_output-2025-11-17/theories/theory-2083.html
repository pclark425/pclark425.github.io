                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-SR Programmatic Equation Discovery Law: General Corpus-Driven Symbolic Regression Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when provided with large-scale scholarly corpora, can perform a form of symbolic regression directly from textual data, identifying variables, inferring relationships, and proposing candidate equations that are consistent with the corpus. The process leverages the LLM's ability to generalize across diverse expressions and to synthesize symbolic forms that best explain the observed textual evidence.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to extract variables and relationships from scientific text and generate symbolic expressions. </li>
    <li>Symbolic regression traditionally uses numerical data, but recent work explores text-driven approaches. </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to prefer outputs that are consistent with a set of constraints or evidence. </li>
    <li>Symbolic regression systems use fitness functions to select best-fitting equations; here, the 'fitness' is textual consistency. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law adapts symbolic regression fitness maximization to the textual domain, which is a new approach.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Fitness maximization is standard in symbolic regression, and LLMs can be guided by constraints.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The use of corpus-level textual consistency as a fitness criterion for LLM-driven equation discovery is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will outperform rule-based extraction systems in generating equations that reflect the consensus of the corpus.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent variables or hidden relationships not explicitly named in the corpus, leading to novel equations.</li>
                <li>LLMs could propose equations that are mathematically valid but not yet recognized in the field, potentially leading to new discoveries.</li>
                <li>LLMs may synthesize equations that generalize across subfields, revealing unifying principles not previously articulated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to propose equations that match the consensus of the corpus, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to distinguish between spurious and meaningful relationships in the text, the symbolic regression analogy would be invalid.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot outperform random or rule-based extraction in equation discovery, the theory's claims are weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how LLMs handle contradictory or low-quality sources within the corpus. </li>
    <li>The impact of domain-specific jargon or highly technical symbolic notation on LLM performance is not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends symbolic regression to the textual domain via LLMs, which is a novel synthesis.</p>
