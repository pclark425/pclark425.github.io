                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Demonstration Bottleneck Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the structure and content of prompts and demonstrations provided to LLMs act as a primary bottleneck on the accuracy and fidelity of scientific simulation, regardless of the underlying model's scale or training. The theory asserts that the information encoding, explicitness, and alignment of prompt/demonstration structure with the target scientific subdomain's epistemic norms are limiting factors, and that improvements in prompt engineering can yield accuracy gains even without model retraining.</p>

<ol>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prompt engineering is a known factor, the theory's assertion that prompt structure can be the primary limiting factor in scientific simulation accuracy is a new, more general claim.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt engineering is known to affect LLM performance, and domain-specific prompting has been explored.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of prompt structure as a bottleneck that can override model scale or training for scientific simulation is novel.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on few-shot learning, the law's generalization to scientific simulation and its bottleneck framing are novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Few-shot learning and demonstration informativeness are known to affect LLM performance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law's focus on the necessity of domain-specific information in demonstrations for scientific simulation is more explicit and general.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompts are rewritten to match the epistemic conventions of a new scientific subdomain, LLM simulation accuracy will increase without model retraining.</li>
                <li>Providing demonstrations that explicitly include all domain-relevant steps will improve LLM performance on complex scientific reasoning tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For highly novel scientific subdomains with no established conventions, prompt structure may become the dominant limiting factor, potentially leading to unpredictable LLM behavior.</li>
                <li>If a prompt is constructed using a hybrid of conventions from two distinct scientific subdomains, LLM simulation accuracy may degrade in non-linear or unexpected ways.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high scientific simulation accuracy with poorly structured or irrelevant prompts, this would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>If adding domain-specific information to demonstrations does not improve LLM performance, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs perform well despite minimal or generic prompting, possibly due to strong pretraining on the target domain. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
