                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Some large language models, especially when prompted with chain-of-thought or step-by-step reasoning, exhibit emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities for arithmetic. This theory posits that, beyond pattern completion, sufficiently large and well-trained LLMs can learn to approximate multi-step algorithmic procedures for arithmetic, especially when guided by explicit reasoning prompts.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained with chain-of-thought examples for arithmetic, it may generalize to new arithmetic operations not seen in training.</li>
                <li>If a model is scaled beyond current sizes, it may develop the ability to perform algorithmic arithmetic without explicit chain-of-thought prompts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If chain-of-thought prompting does not improve arithmetic accuracy in large models, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If small models can perform multi-step arithmetic with high accuracy, this would challenge the scale-threshold law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models show improved arithmetic accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting even when their parameter count is below the hypothesized threshold. </li>
