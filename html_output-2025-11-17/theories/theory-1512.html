                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1512</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Feature Binding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is functionally represented as compositional structures, where basic features (sensory, motor, affective, abstract) are bound together via flexible binding mechanisms to form complex concepts. The binding is context-sensitive and allows for generativity, enabling the construction of novel concepts from existing features. The format supports both the decomposition of concepts into features and the synthesis of new concepts through recombination.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Patients with impaired binding mechanisms (e.g., due to oscillatory disruption) will show deficits in concept composition.</li>
                <li>Novel concepts constructed from familiar features will activate feature-specific brain regions.</li>
                <li>Feature-based priming will facilitate the construction and retrieval of complex concepts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial enhancement of binding mechanisms (e.g., via neurostimulation) will improve generative concept formation.</li>
                <li>Training on feature recombination tasks will increase neural synchrony in binding-related regions.</li>
                <li>In neurodevelopmental disorders, deficits in feature binding will correlate with impaired conceptual generativity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts cannot be decomposed into features, the feature binding law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If novel concepts cannot be constructed from existing features, the generative composition law is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If neural synchrony is not involved in concept composition, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how abstract features are initially acquired or grounded. </li>
    <li>The role of long-term semantic memory in constraining feature recombination is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory extends compositional and feature-based models with a novel, explicit binding law for concept formation.</p>
