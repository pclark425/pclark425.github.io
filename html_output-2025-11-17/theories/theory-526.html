                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Symbolic Regression and Program Synthesis Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A general theory that large language models, when used as generators of symbolic expressions, program skeletons, or code, and paired with iterative refinement (e.g., evolutionary search, optimization-by-prompting, or islands models) and external parameter optimization, can efficiently discover, recover, or approximate quantitative laws from numeric data. This approach leverages LLMs' priors for human-like, interpretable forms and enables rapid exploration of function/program space, outperforming classical symbolic regression and genetic programming in sample efficiency, out-of-distribution generalization, and interpretability, provided that the search is guided by external evaluators and complexity penalization.</p>

                <li>Scaling LLM-driven symbolic regression to high-dimensional, noisy, or real-world datasets (e.g., from experimental physics or biology) will enable discovery of previously unknown laws or relationships.</li>
                <li>Integrating vision-language models to process figures or plots as input will allow LLM-driven symbolic regression to extract laws from multi-modal scientific data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-driven symbolic regression fails to outperform classical baselines in law discovery accuracy, interpretability, or OOD generalization on new benchmarks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLM priors or complexity penalization lead to systematic omission of important but complex laws, the theory would be questioned.</li>

    <li>LLM memorization of training data can confound true discovery; benchmarks contaminated with training data may overstate performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3652.html#e3652.0" class="evidence-link">[e3652.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3647.html#e3647.0" class="evidence-link">[e3647.0]</a> </li>
