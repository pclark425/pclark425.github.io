                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1204</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Representation Theory for LLM Chemical Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs capable of synthesizing novel chemicals for specific applications rely on hierarchical internal representations that encode chemical information at multiple levels of abstraction, from atomic connectivity to functional group motifs to macroscopic properties. The robustness and expressivity of these hierarchical representations enable the LLM to generalize across chemical spaces and generate molecules that satisfy complex, multi-scale application requirements.</p>
