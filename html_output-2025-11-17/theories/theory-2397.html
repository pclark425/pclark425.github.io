                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Transcriptional and Epigenetic Safeguards</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that selective resistance of certain visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by intrinsic transcriptional and epigenetic programs that maintain homeostasis under proteotoxic stress. Neurons with stable, stress-adaptive transcriptional profiles and protective epigenetic marks (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications) are more resilient, while those with less adaptive or more plastic epigenomes are more vulnerable.</p>
