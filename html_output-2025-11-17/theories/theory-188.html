                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Observation Abstraction Transfer Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about sim-to-real transfer for scientific discovery agents that specifies environment fidelity requirements and skill-transfer conditions from virtual labs to real robotics labs, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Sim-to-real transfer is facilitated by using observation representations that are invariant to simulation-reality differences while preserving task-relevant information. Effective abstractions include: (1) semantic/geometric representations (segmentation, object poses, feature tracks, 3D bounding boxes) that preserve spatial and structural information while discarding appearance details, (2) learned latent representations (VAEs, contrastive learning, foundation model embeddings) trained to be invariant across domains, (3) proprioceptive/physical measurements (joint angles, forces, IMU) that are directly measurable in both domains, and (4) temporal abstractions (optical flow, feature tracks) that capture motion patterns invariant to appearance. The effectiveness of an abstraction is determined by: (a) information preservation - how much task-relevant information is retained, (b) invariance - how similar the distribution is across sim and real, (c) computational efficiency - the cost of computing the abstraction, and (d) learnability - whether the abstraction can be learned from available data. Abstraction is most beneficial when the domain gap is primarily in appearance/rendering rather than dynamics, and when task-relevant features can be separated from domain-specific features.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Observation abstractions that preserve task-relevant geometric or semantic information while discarding appearance details enable transfer across visual domain gaps</li>
                <li>The optimal abstraction level balances information preservation (keeping task-relevant features), invariance (similarity across domains), computational efficiency, and learnability</li>
                <li>Learned abstractions (VAEs, contrastive learning, foundation models) can discover invariant representations when the invariance structure is not known a priori</li>
                <li>Proprioceptive observations (joint angles, forces, IMU) transfer more reliably than exteroceptive observations (vision) when both are available, due to direct measurability in both domains</li>
                <li>Multi-modal observations (vision + proprioception) are more robust than single-modality observations for transfer, providing redundancy when individual modalities have domain gaps</li>
                <li>Temporal abstractions (feature tracks, optical flow, temporal consistency constraints) can be more invariant than single-frame abstractions for dynamic tasks</li>
                <li>The dimensionality of the observation space affects transfer: compact spaces reduce overfitting to simulation-specific distributions, but must retain sufficient task-relevant information</li>
                <li>Semantic abstractions (segmentation, object detection, scene graphs) are effective when the semantic categories are consistent across sim and real</li>
                <li>Geometric abstractions (3D poses, bounding boxes, point clouds) are effective when geometric relationships are preserved across domains</li>
                <li>Abstraction is most beneficial when the domain gap is primarily in appearance/rendering rather than dynamics or physics</li>
                <li>Hand-designed abstractions (segmentation, poses) are preferable when the task structure is well-understood; learned abstractions are preferable when the invariance structure is unknown</li>
                <li>Abstractions that require calibration or domain-specific tuning (e.g., depth sensors) may fail to transfer unless the calibration process itself transfers</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of an abstraction depends on whether it can be computed reliably in both simulation and reality with similar accuracy</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Finding a task where raw pixel observations transfer better than semantic abstractions (e.g., tasks requiring fine-grained texture discrimination) would challenge the abstraction principle</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that high-dimensional observation spaces transfer better than compact spaces (e.g., when compact spaces discard critical information) would challenge the dimensionality principle</li>
                <li>Showing that learned abstractions fail to generalize to out-of-distribution real-world scenarios (e.g., novel objects, lighting conditions) would challenge the invariance learning principle</li>
