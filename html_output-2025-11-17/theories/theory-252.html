                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Layer Abstraction Gap Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about faithfulness gaps between natural language descriptions and code implementations in automated experimentation.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that faithfulness gaps between natural language descriptions and code implementations in automated experimentation arise from systematic information loss and transformation errors across five distinct abstraction layers: (1) Conceptual Layer (high-level scientific ideas), (2) Algorithmic Layer (procedural specifications), (3) Implementation Layer (code structures), (4) Execution Layer (runtime behavior), and (5) Data Layer (actual values and states). The theory posits that gaps compound multiplicatively across layers, with each layer introducing independent sources of unfaithfulness through omission, ambiguity, implicit assumptions, and emergent complexity. The theory predicts that gap magnitude increases exponentially with the number of layers traversed, and that certain types of specifications (dynamic, adaptive, or context-dependent) are particularly vulnerable to multi-layer degradation.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Faithfulness gaps compound multiplicatively across abstraction layers: if each layer has an independent gap probability p, the total faithfulness after n layers is approximately (1-p)^n.</li>
                <li>The conceptual-to-algorithmic transition has the highest information loss rate (40-60% of critical details omitted) because natural language descriptions prioritize novelty over completeness.</li>
                <li>Implementation-layer gaps are dominated by implicit defaults and library-specific behaviors that are rarely documented in algorithmic descriptions.</li>
                <li>Execution-layer gaps emerge primarily from three sources: non-deterministic operations, hardware-specific behaviors, and adaptive mechanisms that modify behavior based on runtime state.</li>
                <li>Data-layer gaps occur when actual values, distributions, or states differ from those specified at higher layers due to bugs, environmental factors, or emergent interactions.</li>
                <li>Specifications that span more abstraction layers (e.g., end-to-end system descriptions) have exponentially higher gap rates than single-layer specifications (e.g., individual function descriptions).</li>
                <li>Dynamic and adaptive components (learning rate schedules, early stopping, adaptive batch sizes) experience 3-5x higher gap rates than static components because they introduce execution-layer complexity.</li>
                <li>Cross-layer dependencies create compound gaps: when a gap at layer L affects specifications at layer L+1, the resulting gap magnitude is multiplicative rather than additive.</li>
                <li>The probability of detecting a gap decreases exponentially with the number of layers between the description and the actual behavior being described.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Studies of ML reproducibility show that failures occur at multiple levels: conceptual misunderstandings, algorithmic ambiguities, implementation bugs, and execution environment differences. </li>
    <li>Analysis of paper-to-code comparisons reveals that discrepancies exist at multiple abstraction levels simultaneously, not just at a single layer. </li>
    <li>Natural language descriptions in papers typically operate at 2-3 abstraction levels above actual code implementation, creating multiple opportunities for information loss. </li>
    <li>Hyperparameter specifications show systematic gaps across conceptual (tuning strategy), algorithmic (search procedure), and implementation (default values) layers. </li>
    <li>Execution-layer gaps emerge from runtime behaviors not captured in static descriptions, including adaptive mechanisms, hardware dependencies, and stochastic processes. </li>
    <li>Data preprocessing pipelines often contain implicit transformations that are not documented in natural language descriptions, creating implementation-to-execution gaps. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Experiments with specifications that explicitly address all five abstraction layers (conceptual rationale, algorithmic procedure, implementation details, execution environment, and data characteristics) will have 70-90% higher reproducibility rates than those addressing only 1-2 layers.</li>
                <li>The number of abstraction layers between natural language description and actual behavior will be the strongest predictor of faithfulness gap magnitude, stronger than any single-layer factor.</li>
                <li>Automated tools that verify consistency across adjacent abstraction layers (e.g., checking that code implements the described algorithm) will detect 60-80% of faithfulness gaps.</li>
                <li>Papers that include layer-specific documentation (conceptual diagrams, pseudocode, implementation code, execution logs, and data samples) will reduce gaps by 50-70% per additional layer documented.</li>
                <li>Gaps in adaptive/dynamic components will be concentrated at the execution and data layers, while gaps in static components will be concentrated at the conceptual and algorithmic layers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists a theoretical minimum gap rate that cannot be reduced below a certain threshold due to fundamental limitations in mapping between abstraction layers, or if perfect faithfulness is theoretically achievable.</li>
                <li>If machine learning models could be trained to automatically translate between abstraction layers with higher fidelity than human researchers, potentially reducing gaps by learning the systematic patterns of information loss.</li>
                <li>Whether certain scientific domains or experimental paradigms have fundamentally different layer structures that make them more or less susceptible to multi-layer gaps.</li>
                <li>If standardized intermediate representations (between natural language and code) could serve as 'gap buffers' that prevent compound multiplication of errors across layers.</li>
                <li>Whether the human cognitive limitations in maintaining consistency across multiple abstraction levels represent a fundamental bottleneck that cannot be overcome through better practices alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If experiments with single-layer specifications show similar gap rates to multi-layer specifications, this would challenge the theory's core premise of compounding gaps.</li>
                <li>If gaps are found to be concentrated at only one or two layers rather than distributed across all five layers, this would suggest the layer model is overcomplicated.</li>
                <li>If the relationship between number of layers and gap magnitude is found to be linear rather than exponential, this would contradict the multiplicative compounding prediction.</li>
                <li>If automated cross-layer consistency checking fails to detect a significant proportion of gaps, this would challenge the theory's assumption that gaps arise from layer-to-layer inconsistencies.</li>
                <li>If dynamic and static components show similar gap patterns across layers, this would contradict the theory's distinction between component types.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of tacit knowledge and community conventions that may bridge gaps informally without explicit documentation. </li>
    <li>Psychological factors affecting how researchers perceive and communicate across abstraction layers, including expertise effects and cognitive biases. </li>
    <li>The potential for gaps to partially cancel out across layers (e.g., an implementation bug that compensates for an algorithmic misspecification). </li>
    <li>Social and institutional pressures that may systematically bias which layers receive more careful specification (e.g., novelty emphasis at conceptual layer, space constraints limiting implementation details). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
