                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1571</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent FTL via Quantum-Topological Transport Networks</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by exploiting emergent phenomena in quantum and topological materials—such as nonlocal correlations, topological edge states, and analog gravity effects—it is possible to construct networks that allow effective FTL transport of information or matter, bypassing conventional spacetime constraints within engineered domains. The theory suggests that macroscopic, coherently entangled networks of topological quantum materials can support nonlocal transport channels, and that analog gravity effects in condensed matter systems can be tuned to enable effective metric manipulation, potentially allowing superluminal propagation within engineered structures.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Failure to observe nonlocal transport or superluminal effects in engineered networks would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If decoherence or noise destroys nonlocality at macroscopic scales, practical FTL would be ruled out.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>No direct evidence for macroscopic FTL transport in quantum or topological systems; all current demonstrations are limited to local or subluminal effects. </li>
