                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Salience-Guided Memory Retrieval Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by employing mechanisms that prioritize the storage and retrieval of information based on contextual relevance and salience. The agent should dynamically assess which past events, facts, or strategies are most likely to be useful in the current context, and retrieve or reinforce those memories preferentially, using attention or gating mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the salience mechanism is tuned to non-obvious features (e.g., emotional tone), agents may develop unexpected strategies or biases.</li>
                <li>Over-reliance on salience may cause agents to ignore subtle but important information, leading to unpredictable failures in complex games.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with uniform memory retrieval outperform those with context- or salience-guided retrieval, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If salience-weighted reinforcement leads to overfitting or catastrophic forgetting, the theory's assumptions may be flawed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some text games may not have clear salient events, making salience-based reinforcement less effective. </li>
