                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Modularization and Reasoning Depth Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ability of language models to perform strict logical reasoning is governed by the emergence of hierarchical modularization within the model. As model scale and data complexity increase, subnetworks not only specialize for atomic logical operators but also organize into higher-level modules that encode reasoning strategies of increasing depth and abstraction. The depth of hierarchical modularization directly predicts the maximum depth of logical reasoning the model can perform, and interventions that enhance or disrupt this hierarchy correspondingly affect reasoning depth.</p>
