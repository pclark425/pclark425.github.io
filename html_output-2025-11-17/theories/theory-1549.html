                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel is feasible within current or near-future technological and budgetary constraints if a warp bubble can be generated and sustained using only positive energy densities, by leveraging advanced field manipulation and engineered spacetime metrics. The theory abstracts from specific implementation details and focuses on the general physical and engineering principles required for such a system.</p>
