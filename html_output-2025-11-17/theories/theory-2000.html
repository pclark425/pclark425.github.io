                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Abstract Law Synthesis for Biomedical Gene–Disease Associations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize qualitative laws describing gene–disease associations by aggregating and abstracting patterns from large corpora of biomedical abstracts. Through semantic understanding, LLMs can generalize beyond individual statements to infer higher-level association rules, even when explicit statements are distributed across multiple sources.</p>
