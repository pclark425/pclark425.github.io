                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1070</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent World-State Representation Emergence in Autoregressive Language Models for Board Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that autoregressive language models, when trained on textual representations of board games (such as Sudoku), develop internal latent representations that encode the evolving world-state of the game. These representations are not explicitly provided but emerge as a result of the model's need to track constraints, spatial relationships, and legal moves in order to predict valid next moves or solutions. The theory further claims that these latent world-state representations are generalizable across different board games with similar structural properties.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Language models can solve multi-step board games (e.g., Sudoku) from linearized text, implying internal state tracking. </li>
    <li>Probing studies show that hidden states in LMs encode information about board positions and constraints. </li>
    <li>Models can generate valid next moves or solutions, which requires knowledge of the current world-state. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context tracking is established, the claim that LMs develop a general, game-agnostic latent world-state for spatial reasoning is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that LMs can track some context and constraints in text-based tasks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The emergence of a general latent world-state representation for spatial board games is a new, domain-general claim.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Probing hidden states in LMs trained on board games will reveal clustering by world-state features (e.g., filled cells, constraint satisfaction).</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on a mixture of structurally diverse board games, it may develop disentangled or multi-modal latent world-state representations.</li>
                <li>Latent world-state representations may be robust to adversarial input perturbations that preserve game legality but alter surface form.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models cannot be probed to reveal any world-state information, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If transfer to structurally similar games fails even with extensive training, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models may rely on shallow pattern matching rather than true latent world-state tracking, especially for small or simple games. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
