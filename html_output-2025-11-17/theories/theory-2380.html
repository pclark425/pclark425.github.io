                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles in dementia is primarily determined by their position and role within the cortical and subcortical connectivity network. Neurons with high centrality, extensive long-range connections, or specific network motifs are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation and subsequent degeneration, while those with more local, redundant, or modular connectivity are relatively protected.</p>
