                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Abstraction for Efficient Planning in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hierarchical memory architectures—where lower levels store fine-grained episodic details and higher levels store increasingly abstracted semantic representations—can plan and reason more efficiently in complex text game environments. The hierarchical structure enables agents to decompose tasks, retrieve relevant details at the appropriate level of abstraction, and avoid combinatorial explosion in memory retrieval and planning.</p>
