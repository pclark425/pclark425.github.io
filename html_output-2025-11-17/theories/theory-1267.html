                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structural Inductive Bias and Modality Adaptation Theory: Information Bottleneck Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that creates an information bottleneck, filtering out irrelevant or redundant graph details while preserving the minimal sufficient structure and semantics needed for the target task. The theory predicts that such bottlenecked representations will improve model robustness, reduce overfitting, and enhance interpretability.</p>
