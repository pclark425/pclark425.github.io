                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Coordination Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by coordinating multiple levels of memory—short-term, long-term, and meta-memory—through hierarchical control mechanisms. The theory asserts that effective task-solving requires not only storing and retrieving information, but also dynamically selecting which memory system to engage, based on task phase, uncertainty, and feedback, enabling both rapid adaptation and robust long-term knowledge accumulation.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human cognition involves hierarchical memory systems (e.g., working memory, episodic memory, semantic memory) coordinated for complex tasks. </li>
    <li>Recent LLM agent architectures (e.g., ReAct, Toolformer, AutoGPT) use both context windows (short-term) and external memory (long-term) for task-solving. </li>
    <li>Meta-learning approaches in RL and LLMs demonstrate the utility of meta-memory for strategy adaptation. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is somewhat related to existing work in cognitive science and hierarchical RL, but its formalization for LLM agent memory coordination is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hierarchical memory systems are well-established in cognitive science and some AI architectures.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law of dynamic coordination and selection among memory systems by LLM agents, based on task phase and uncertainty, is not formalized in current LLM agent theory.</p>
