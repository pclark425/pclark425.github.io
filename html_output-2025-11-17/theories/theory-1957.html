                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented LLM Distillation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when augmented with iterative retrieval mechanisms, can autonomously distill qualitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers. The process leverages cycles of evidence retrieval, hypothesis generation, and law refinement, enabling the LLM to synthesize robust, generalizable, and novel qualitative laws that reflect the underlying patterns in the scientific literature.</p>

                <li>If LLMs fail to abstract generalizable laws from diverse corpora, the emergent abstraction law would be undermined.</li>
