                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1432</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Error Signal Amplification Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that generate-then-reflect cycles in language models function as an internal error signal amplification mechanism. Each reflection step increases the salience of discrepancies between the model's output and implicit correctness criteria, allowing the model to iteratively focus attention and computation on problematic aspects of its answer. This process leads to a form of internal bootstrapping, where error signals are recursively amplified and corrected, resulting in higher answer quality.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If error signal amplification is made explicit in model architecture, reflection efficiency may increase dramatically.</li>
                <li>There may exist a threshold beyond which further reflection amplifies noise or hallucination rather than correctness.</li>
                <li>Models trained with explicit error signal tracking may develop novel forms of self-monitoring.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If repeated reflection does not increase focus on error regions, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve with additional reflection cycles, the theory is falsified.</li>
