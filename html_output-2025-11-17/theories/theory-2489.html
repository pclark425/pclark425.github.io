                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their unique network connectivity, activity patterns, and molecular signatures. Neuronal populations with high synaptic activity, extensive long-range connectivity, and specific expression of vulnerability-associated genes are more susceptible to Aβ and tau pathology, while those with local, low-activity networks and protective gene expression are more resistant.</p>
