                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The ability of large language models to perform arithmetic and mathematical reasoning improves with increased model size and exposure to diverse, high-quality training data, including code and mathematical reasoning datasets. Larger models have greater capacity to represent complex reasoning patterns and algorithms, while diverse training data enables learning of arithmetic rules and heuristics that generalize across tasks.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Larger model size correlates positively with arithmetic reasoning accuracy and generalization.</li>
                <li>Training on diverse datasets including code, mathematical reasoning, and arithmetic problems enhances the model's ability to learn arithmetic algorithms and heuristics.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning on specialized arithmetic datasets with stepwise strategies can compensate for smaller model size to some extent.</li>
                <li>Model capacity enables representation of more complex reasoning patterns and reduces systematic errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>PaLM 540B outperforms smaller models on arithmetic reasoning tasks, with scaling from 62B to 540B resulting in discontinuous performance improvements. <a href="../results/extraction-result-33.html#e33.0" class="evidence-link">[e33.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-27.html#e27.1" class="evidence-link">[e27.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Codex (175B) trained on code and arithmetic problems achieves high accuracy on arithmetic tasks, outperforming baselines and smaller models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.0" class="evidence-link">[e28.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.0" class="evidence-link">[e36.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MathGLM (2B) fine-tuned on a specialized arithmetic dataset with stepwise strategy achieves superior performance compared to larger models like GPT-4. <a href="../results/extraction-result-21.html#e21.0" class="evidence-link">[e21.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-J (6B) shows improved arithmetic accuracy with inclusion of diverse arithmetic training data and two-shot prompting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing model size beyond current scales (e.g., >1T parameters) will continue to improve arithmetic reasoning performance.</li>
                <li>Incorporating more diverse and high-quality arithmetic and code datasets in training will enhance generalization to novel arithmetic tasks.</li>
                <li>Smaller models fine-tuned with curriculum learning and stepwise strategies can approach the performance of larger models on specific arithmetic tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there is a saturation point beyond which increasing model size yields diminishing returns for arithmetic reasoning is unknown.</li>
                <li>The optimal balance between model size and training data diversity for arithmetic tasks remains to be determined.</li>
                <li>Whether specialized architectures beyond scaling and data diversity can further improve arithmetic reasoning is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If larger models trained on diverse datasets do not outperform smaller models on arithmetic tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If fine-tuning smaller models on arithmetic datasets does not improve performance, the role of training data diversity would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If increasing model size without corresponding data diversity fails to improve arithmetic reasoning, the theory's emphasis on data diversity would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some smaller models combined with symbolic solvers outperform larger models, indicating that size and data alone do not fully explain arithmetic reasoning capabilities. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-25.html#e25.0" class="evidence-link">[e25.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Models remain sensitive to irrelevant context despite large size and diverse training data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.0" class="evidence-link">[e28.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.1" class="evidence-link">[e28.1]</a> </li>
