                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-755</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modular Arithmetic as Emergent Subspace Dynamics in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models develop emergent subspaces within their high-dimensional activation space that correspond to modular arithmetic operations. These subspaces are structured such that arithmetic operations correspond to predictable trajectories or transformations, and modularity is implemented via periodic boundary conditions in these subspaces.</p>
