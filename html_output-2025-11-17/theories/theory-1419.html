                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1419</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Control Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to reflect, engage in a form of meta-cognitive control analogous to human self-monitoring. The model allocates attention to its own reasoning process, evaluates the plausibility and coherence of its outputs, and strategically decides which aspects to revise, discard, or retain. This meta-cognitive process is emergent from the model's architecture and training, rather than being explicitly programmed.</p>
