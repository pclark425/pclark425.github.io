                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most effective when conducted as an iterative, interactive process between human experts and AI systems. The process involves cycles of automated plausibility checks, human expert review, and targeted refinement, leveraging the complementary strengths of both parties. The theory predicts that such co-evaluation will yield higher-quality, more robust scientific theories than either human or AI evaluation alone.</p>
