                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual and Semantic Reasoning Law for LLM-Based Anomaly Detection in Lists</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) detect anomalies in lists by leveraging their ability to infer implicit contextual and semantic patterns from the list as a whole, rather than relying solely on explicit rules or statistical outliers. The LLM constructs a latent schema or 'norm' for the list, and identifies items that deviate from this inferred schema as anomalies.</p>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to detect anomalies in lists where the anomaly is a clear semantic deviation, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform no better than random guessing on contextually-defined anomaly detection tasks, the theory would be called into question.</li>
