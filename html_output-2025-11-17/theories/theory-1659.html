                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Cognitive Offloading and Bounded Rationality in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, like human problem-solvers, are subject to bounded rationality: their internal reasoning is limited by training data, architecture, and context window. Tool augmentation enables cognitive offloading, allowing LLMs to bypass their own limitations by leveraging external computation and knowledge. The degree of offloading, and the match between tool capabilities and task demands, determines simulation accuracy.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will show the greatest accuracy improvements on tasks that most exceed their internal capacity, when given access to well-matched tools.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are given access to a large suite of tools and must autonomously select the best one, emergent tool-selection strategies may arise.</li>
                <li>The limits of cognitive offloading in LLMs may be reached if tool integration or selection becomes a new bottleneck.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve on tasks that exceed their internal capacity when given access to tools, the offloading law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If task-tool fit does not predict simulation accuracy, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs misuse or misunderstand tool outputs, leading to errors despite good task-tool fit. </li>
