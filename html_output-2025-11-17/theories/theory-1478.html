                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Symbolic-Analog Representational Format Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented using a hybrid format that combines symbolic structures (for compositionality, variable binding, and logical inference) with analog, high-dimensional vector representations (for similarity, generalization, and gradedness). Symbolic structures provide the scaffolding for discrete relations and roles, while analog vectors encode feature-rich, context-sensitive content. The interaction between these two formats enables flexible, context-dependent reasoning and supports both rule-based and similarity-based cognition.</p>
