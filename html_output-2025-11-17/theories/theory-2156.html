                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill scientific theories by identifying points of consensus and contradiction across a large body of literature, and resolving these through probabilistic reasoning and synthesis. The process involves mapping the landscape of agreement and disagreement, weighting evidence, and constructing theories that maximize explanatory coherence while minimizing unresolved contradictions.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may resolve longstanding scientific controversies by probabilistically synthesizing evidence across many papers.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to identify consensus or contradictions in a corpus, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot resolve contradictions or produce incoherent theories when faced with conflicting evidence, the theory's core mechanism is called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain how LLMs handle evidence of equal strength supporting mutually exclusive theories. </li>
