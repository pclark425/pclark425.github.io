                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Proteostasis-Immunity Imbalance Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is initiated and driven by a dynamic imbalance between proteostasis (the maintenance of protein homeostasis) and neuroimmune surveillance. When the capacity for protein clearance (e.g., amyloid, tau) is exceeded by production or impaired by aging/genetic factors, chronic neuroinflammation ensues, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by measuring proteostasis and immune biomarkers in blood and CSF.</p>
