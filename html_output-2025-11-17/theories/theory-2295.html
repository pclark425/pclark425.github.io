                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Systemic Metabolic-Inflammatory Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is fundamentally a disorder of systemic metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation, with the brain as a vulnerable target organ. Chronic peripheral metabolic stress (e.g., insulin resistance, dyslipidemia) and low-grade inflammation trigger a cascade of blood-brain barrier dysfunction, microglial priming, and impaired proteostasis, leading to the accumulation of amyloid, tau, and ultimately neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible via peripheral metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers, in combination with brain imaging.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Epidemiological studies link diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome to increased AD risk. </li>
    <li>Systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction precede and predict AD pathology in longitudinal studies. </li>
    <li>Animal models show that high-fat diets and induced insulin resistance lead to increased amyloid and tau pathology. </li>
    <li>Blood-brain barrier breakdown is observed in individuals with metabolic syndrome and is associated with early cognitive decline. </li>
    <li>Microglial priming and activation are observed in response to peripheral inflammatory signals. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While metabolic/inflammatory risk is known, the assertion of causality and necessity is a novel, stronger claim that extends risk factor models into a unified, causally-prior framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Links between metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and AD risk are established; peripheral inflammation is recognized as a risk factor.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts a direct, causal, and necessary role for peripheral metabolic-inflammation in initiating central AD pathology, not just as a risk factor but as a primary driver.</p>
