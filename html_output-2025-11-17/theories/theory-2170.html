                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Reweighting Theory for LLM-Guided Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill scientific theories by dynamically reweighting the importance of claims, evidence, and methodologies from scholarly papers based on context, recency, and methodological rigor. The LLM leverages its training on vast corpora to assign higher weight to more reliable or contextually relevant information, enabling the emergence of robust, consensus-driven theories even in the presence of conflicting or low-quality studies.</p>
