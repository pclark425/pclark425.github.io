                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Capacity-Fidelity Scaling Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> World model fidelity scales predictably with architectural hierarchy depth and layer width, following a power law relationship where deeper hierarchies enable longer-horizon predictions and wider layers enable richer state representations. Specifically, prediction horizon scales approximately as H ∝ D^α * W^β where D is effective depth (measured as the longest path through the computational graph), W is average layer width (measured as mean hidden dimension across layers), and α > β, indicating depth is more critical for temporal coherence than width. This relationship exhibits phase transitions at critical architectural scales where emergent capabilities (e.g., object permanence, physical reasoning) appear. The theory further posits that the optimal depth-to-width ratio varies systematically with task temporal horizon, and that hierarchical temporal abstraction architectures can achieve equivalent performance with reduced effective depth through explicit multi-scale processing.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>World model prediction horizon H scales as H ∝ D^α * W^β where D is effective architectural depth (longest computational path), W is average layer width (mean hidden dimension), and α > β, with α approximately 1.5-2.0 times larger than β.</li>
                <li>Depth contributes primarily to temporal coherence and long-horizon prediction capability, while width contributes primarily to representational richness, state space coverage, and multi-modal integration capacity.</li>
                <li>The ratio of depth to width (D/W) determines the trade-off between temporal coherence and spatial/representational fidelity, with optimal ratios varying systematically by task domain: higher ratios (0.8-1.2) for long-horizon planning tasks, lower ratios (0.3-0.5) for manipulation and perception tasks.</li>
                <li>Critical architectural thresholds exist where emergent world modeling capabilities may appear discontinuously, though the exact parameter counts and whether emergence is truly discontinuous or an artifact of evaluation metrics remains to be empirically determined.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical architectures with L explicit temporal abstraction levels can achieve equivalent prediction horizon to flat architectures with approximately L times greater effective depth, following H_hierarchical(D, L) ≈ H_flat(D * L).</li>
                <li>The scaling relationship is modulated by architectural inductive biases: architectures with appropriate symmetries (e.g., equivariance to physical transformations) achieve better scaling efficiency, measured as performance per parameter.</li>
                <li>Training dynamics impose practical constraints on depth scaling: without architectural innovations (residual connections, normalization), gradient flow issues limit effective depth to approximately 10-20 layers regardless of nominal depth.</li>
                <li>At sufficient scale, the relationship between architectural parameters and performance becomes increasingly dominated by training compute and data quantity rather than architectural choices alone, suggesting an interaction term between scale and optimization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Transformer-based world models show improved long-horizon prediction with increased depth, with performance gains following power law scaling in language models that may generalize to world models. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical world models with explicit multi-scale temporal abstractions outperform flat architectures on long-horizon tasks, suggesting that architectural structure can compensate for raw depth. </li>
    <li>Scaling laws in language models demonstrate predictable power law relationships between model size (depth and width) and performance, providing a template for similar analysis in world models. </li>
    <li>Emergent capabilities in large language models appear at specific scale thresholds rather than gradually, though the exact nature of this emergence is debated. </li>
    <li>Deep residual networks enable training of very deep architectures, suggesting that with appropriate architectural innovations, depth scaling can be practically achieved. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A world model with 2x depth but same parameter count (achieved through narrower layers) will show 40-60% improvement in prediction horizon (measured as timesteps until prediction error exceeds threshold) but 10-20% degradation in single-step reconstruction quality (measured as MSE or perceptual loss).</li>
                <li>Hybrid architectures combining convolutional spatial processing with transformer temporal processing will achieve 20-30% better scaling efficiency (measured as performance per parameter on visual prediction benchmarks) than pure transformer architectures for visual world models.</li>
                <li>The optimal depth-to-width ratio for robotic manipulation tasks (horizon <50 steps) will be approximately 0.3-0.5, while for long-horizon planning tasks (horizon >200 steps) it will be 0.8-1.2, testable through systematic architecture search.</li>
                <li>World models with explicit hierarchical temporal abstraction (e.g., 3 levels with 4x temporal downsampling per level) will match the prediction horizon of flat models with 3x the depth while using 40-50% fewer parameters.</li>
                <li>Incorporating physics-informed inductive biases (e.g., Hamiltonian structure, conservation laws) will improve scaling efficiency by 30-50% on physical prediction tasks compared to generic architectures of the same size.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist a fundamental 'world modeling wall' beyond which additional architectural scale provides diminishing returns without incorporating explicit symbolic reasoning or causal structure, potentially around 10-100B parameters, where the marginal improvement per parameter drops below a critical threshold.</li>
                <li>World models may exhibit a predictable 'emergence curve' where specific capabilities (object permanence, collision prediction, occlusion handling, intuitive physics) appear at quantifiable architectural scales, testable through systematic ablation studies, or emergence may be continuous but appear discontinuous due to evaluation metric properties.</li>
                <li>Architectural scaling laws may break down entirely for world models that need to capture rare but critical events (black swans), requiring fundamentally different architectural principles based on uncertainty quantification, explicit memory systems, or compositional reasoning rather than capacity scaling.</li>
                <li>The relationship between architectural scale and sample efficiency may be non-monotonic, with very large world models (>1B parameters) potentially requiring more data due to increased capacity for memorization rather than generalization, particularly in low-data regimes.</li>
                <li>Emergent capabilities in world models may require specific architectural motifs (e.g., particular attention patterns, recurrent structures, memory mechanisms) that don't naturally arise from standard scaling, suggesting that architecture search may be as important as scale, and that some capabilities may never emerge from pure scaling.</li>
                <li>Multi-modal world models may exhibit different scaling laws for different modalities, with vision requiring higher width-to-depth ratios than language or proprioception, potentially requiring modality-specific architectural components that scale differently.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that prediction horizon does not improve with depth beyond a certain threshold (e.g., 12 layers) while holding parameters constant would challenge the depth-scaling component and suggest alternative factors dominate.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that emergent capabilities appear gradually and continuously rather than discontinuously across architectural scales would contradict the phase transition hypothesis and support alternative smooth scaling theories.</li>
                <li>Showing that width and depth contribute equally to all aspects of world model performance (α ≈ β) would invalidate the differential scaling exponents and the specialization hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Discovering that the optimal depth-to-width ratio does not vary systematically with task temporal horizon would undermine the task-specific architectural optimization principle.</li>
                <li>Finding that hierarchical temporal abstraction architectures do not reduce effective depth requirements would challenge the hierarchical efficiency claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that architectural inductive biases provide no scaling efficiency benefits would suggest that raw capacity is the only relevant factor.</li>
                <li>Showing that very wide, shallow networks can achieve equivalent long-horizon prediction to deep networks would fundamentally challenge the depth-for-temporal-coherence hypothesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how architectural scaling interacts with training dynamics, curriculum learning, or data distribution shifts, which may significantly modulate the effective scaling relationships. </li>
    <li>The role of architectural inductive biases (e.g., equivariance, locality) in scaling efficiency is acknowledged but not quantitatively integrated into the scaling law formulation. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for multi-modal fusion architectures and how different modalities (vision, language, proprioception) may scale differently and interact. </li>
    <li>The interaction between architectural scale and memory mechanisms (e.g., external memory, retrieval systems) is not addressed, which may be critical for certain world modeling capabilities. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how architectural scaling interacts with different training objectives (reconstruction, contrastive, predictive coding) which may favor different architectural configurations. </li>
