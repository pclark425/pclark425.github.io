                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Extraction of Procedural Synthesis Heuristics in Chemistry</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when combined with prompt engineering, structured output schemas, and downstream machine learning, can reliably extract procedural synthesis heuristics (qualitative rules-of-thumb) from large, heterogeneous chemistry literature. The process involves segmenting papers, classifying and summarizing synthesis parameters, and then using the extracted dataset to induce empirical rules (e.g., modulator:metal ratio, solvent:metal ratio) that predict experimental outcomes such as single-crystal vs. polycrystalline formation.</p>
