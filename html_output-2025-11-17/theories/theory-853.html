                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Coordination Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by coordinating multiple levels of memory—short-term, working, episodic, and semantic—through a hierarchical control mechanism. The agent allocates memory resources and retrieval strategies at each level based on task phase, temporal distance, and relevance, enabling both rapid adaptation and long-term generalization.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
