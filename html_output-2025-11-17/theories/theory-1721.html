                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1721</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Semantic-Statistical LLM Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when applied to lists of data, can detect anomalies by integrating both semantic understanding and statistical reasoning. The LLM leverages its pre-trained knowledge to interpret the context and meaning of data entries, while also modeling statistical regularities (such as frequency, co-occurrence, and distributional properties) within the list. Anomalies are detected when an entry deviates from both the expected semantic context and the learned statistical patterns, enabling the identification of outliers that are not easily captured by traditional statistical or rule-based methods alone.</p>

                <li>If the list contains adversarially crafted entries that mimic normal data, the LLM's detection performance is unpredictable.</li>
