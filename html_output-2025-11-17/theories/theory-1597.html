                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1597</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Hyper-Fast Soliton Transport via Engineered Plasma and Electromagnetic Fields</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) transport can be achieved by engineering a soliton-like spacetime distortion (metric bubble) around a spacecraft using positive-energy plasma and dynamically controlled electromagnetic fields. The plasma acts as a medium for amplifying and shaping the electromagnetic fields, which in turn manipulate spacetime locally to create a stable, propagating soliton that carries the spacecraft at effective FTL speeds without violating local causality or requiring exotic negative energy.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the metric soliton is maintained, the spacecraft will traverse interplanetary distances in minutes, with no observable time dilation for occupants.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If the plasma shell fails to support or amplify the required electromagnetic fields, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If the metric soliton cannot be formed or maintained under positive-energy conditions, the theory is called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The long-term stability and containment of the plasma shell in the vacuum of space is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential quantum effects at the plasma-metric interface are not considered. </li>
