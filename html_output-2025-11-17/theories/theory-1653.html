                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1653</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is fundamentally constrained by information bottlenecks at three levels: (1) the training data bottleneck (coverage and quality of domain-specific data), (2) the model architecture bottleneck (capacity to represent and manipulate scientific abstractions), and (3) the prompt/context bottleneck (ability to extract and condition on relevant knowledge). Simulation accuracy is maximized only when all three bottlenecks are minimized; a bottleneck at any level leads to degraded performance.</p>
