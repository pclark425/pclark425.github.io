                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured and Interpretable Memory Representations Enable Efficient Planning, Exploration, and Error Recovery in LLM Agents for Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with structured and interpretable memory representations—such as explicit world models, event logs, and object-centric state tables—can plan, explore, and recover from errors more efficiently in text games. By organizing memory in a way that mirrors the underlying game structure, agents can reason about causality, dependencies, and affordances, leading to improved task performance and adaptability.</p>
