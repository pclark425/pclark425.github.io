                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluation Integrity and Contamination Theory (Systemic Perspective)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the integrity of evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories is fundamentally determined by the degree of isolation between the evaluation process and the generative process, and that contamination—defined as any information leakage or feedback from evaluation to generation or vice versa—systematically biases evaluation outcomes. The theory provides qualitative and quantitative laws for how contamination propagates, how it can be detected, and how it impacts the reliability and validity of scientific theory assessment.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
