                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Self-Monitoring through Internal Consistency Checking</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to reflect, engage in an emergent process of self-monitoring by checking for internal consistency within their outputs. This self-monitoring enables the detection of contradictions, logical errors, or factual inconsistencies, which are then used to guide subsequent revisions and improve answer quality.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If a model is prompted to check for consistency, it will identify and correct more contradictions than in a non-reflective setting.</li>
                <li>If reflection is omitted, internal inconsistencies are more likely to persist in outputs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained specifically to enhance internal consistency checking, overall answer quality may surpass current benchmarks.</li>
                <li>If reflection is performed with access to external knowledge bases, the consistency checking process may become more robust.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models fail to identify inconsistencies during reflection, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If revisions do not resolve identified inconsistencies, the mechanism is called into question.</li>
