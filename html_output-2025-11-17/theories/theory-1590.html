                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1590</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal FTL via Quantum Measurement-Induced Collapse</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel could be achieved by exploiting quantum measurement-induced collapse in engineered macroscopic systems. By preparing a spacecraft in a superposed quantum state across distant locations and triggering a controlled measurement, the system collapses to a single location, effectively relocating the spacecraft instantaneously. The theory explores how advances in macroscopic quantum coherence, measurement control, and quantum information could make this process viable within realistic technological and budgetary constraints.</p>
