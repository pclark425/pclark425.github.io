                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be multidimensional (covering factuality, logical coherence, novelty, etc.), task-aligned (dimensions and their weights are chosen to match the intended scientific use-case), and calibration-aware (accounting for the LLM's confidence-accuracy alignment in each dimension). The theory asserts that only by integrating these three principles can evaluation frameworks produce reliable, actionable, and scientifically meaningful assessments of LLM-generated theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Evaluation frameworks that ignore multidimensionality or task alignment will produce less reliable and less actionable assessments of LLM-generated scientific theories.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Integrating calibration-awareness may reveal that some dimensions are systematically unreliable for current LLMs, leading to new research on LLM improvement.</li>
                <li>Task-aligned weighting may uncover previously overlooked but critical evaluation dimensions for certain scientific domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-dimensional or non-task-aligned evaluation frameworks outperform multidimensional, task-aligned, and calibration-aware frameworks, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If calibration-awareness does not improve reliability or trustworthiness of evaluation, the theory's claims are weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to operationalize or measure calibration in the absence of ground truth for novel scientific theories. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to resolve conflicts between dimensions (e.g., high novelty but low factuality). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes known principles into a new, formalized framework for a novel context.</p>
