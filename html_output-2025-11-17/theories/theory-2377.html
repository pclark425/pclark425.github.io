                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Connectivity and Extracellular Matrix Shielding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neurons to Aβ/tau pathology is governed by the molecular composition of their synaptic connectivity and the properties of their local extracellular matrix (ECM). Neurons with high expression of specific cell adhesion molecules and sparse perineuronal net (PNN) coverage are more exposed to extracellular Aβ/tau aggregates, while those with dense, protective ECM structures are shielded from toxic species.</p>
