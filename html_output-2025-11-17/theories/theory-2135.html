                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Guided LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be used to distill scientific theories from large scholarly corpora by leveraging explicit and implicit constraints—such as logical consistency, empirical support, and domain-specific ontologies—during the synthesis process. The LLM acts as a constraint-satisfying engine, filtering and combining candidate theory statements to maximize coherence, explanatory power, and empirical adequacy.</p>
