                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Contextualization Law for LLM-Based List Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs perform anomaly detection in lists by constructing hierarchical contextual representations, where both local (item-to-item) and global (list-level) patterns are integrated. Anomalies are detected when an item fails to fit at one or more levels of this hierarchy.</p>
