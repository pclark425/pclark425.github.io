                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively abstracting high-level patterns and then refining these abstractions through targeted retrieval and synthesis, guided by user queries and feedback. The process alternates between broad conceptual generalization and focused evidence-based refinement, enabling the emergence of robust, testable scientific theories.</p>
