                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Fabrication-Validation Gap Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in automated scientific discovery systems, there exists a fundamental asymmetry between the system's capacity to generate/fabricate novel scientific claims and its capacity to validate those claims, with this gap widening systematically as discoveries shift from incremental to transformational. Specifically, generation capabilities scale with pattern recognition and extrapolation from training data, allowing systems to produce increasingly novel outputs. However, validation capabilities require either: (1) precedent-based comparison, (2) formal verification methods, or (3) empirical ground truth—all of which become scarcer or unavailable for truly transformational discoveries. This creates a 'fabrication-validation gap' where the most transformational discoveries that systems can generate are precisely those they are least equipped to validate. The gap manifests as: systems generating plausible-seeming transformational claims without the epistemic tools to assess their validity; higher rates of false positives in transformational discovery validation; and a reliance on surface-level plausibility checks rather than deep validity assessment for novel claims.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The fabrication-validation gap G for a discovery of novelty N can be expressed as G(N) = F(N) - V(N), where F(N) is the system's fabrication capability and V(N) is its validation capability for discoveries of novelty N.</li>
                <li>For incremental discoveries (low N), F(N) ≈ V(N), resulting in a small gap. For transformational discoveries (high N), F(N) >> V(N), resulting in a large gap.</li>
                <li>The fabrication capability F(N) scales approximately linearly or sub-linearly with novelty N, as systems can extrapolate and recombine learned patterns: F(N) ≈ F₀ + α·N, where α > 0 but may decrease for very high N.</li>
                <li>The validation capability V(N) decreases non-linearly with novelty N, as precedent-based validation becomes unavailable: V(N) ≈ V₀·e^(-β·N), where β > 0, reflecting exponential decay in validation reliability.</li>
                <li>The gap G(N) therefore increases with novelty: G(N) ≈ F₀ + α·N - V₀·e^(-β·N), which grows approximately linearly for large N.</li>
                <li>Systems will produce higher rates of false positives (invalid discoveries marked as valid) for transformational discoveries compared to incremental discoveries due to the validation deficit.</li>
                <li>The gap creates a 'plausibility trap' where transformational claims are assessed primarily on surface-level coherence rather than deep validity, as the system lacks the tools for the latter.</li>
                <li>Validation of transformational discoveries increasingly relies on proxy metrics (coherence, consistency with known facts) rather than direct validity assessment, as ground truth becomes unavailable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Large language models and generative AI systems can produce fluent, plausible-sounding scientific text that may contain factual errors or logical inconsistencies that the systems themselves cannot detect. </li>
    <li>Neural networks demonstrate poor performance on out-of-distribution examples, which are analogous to transformational discoveries that differ significantly from training data. </li>
    <li>Automated systems show degraded calibration and reliability when making predictions on data that differs from their training distribution, indicating validation capabilities do not match generation capabilities. </li>
    <li>AI systems can generate novel molecular structures or scientific hypotheses but require separate, often more complex validation systems to assess their viability. </li>
    <li>Verification and validation of AI systems remains a significant challenge, particularly for novel or unexpected outputs. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Automated discovery systems will show higher false positive rates (claiming invalid discoveries are valid) for transformational discoveries compared to incremental discoveries, while false negative rates may remain similar.</li>
                <li>The ratio of generation speed to validation accuracy will increase as discovery novelty increases, with systems able to generate transformational claims much faster than they can reliably validate them.</li>
                <li>Systems will show greater reliance on surface-level features (linguistic plausibility, coherence) rather than deep validity checks when evaluating transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>Ensemble methods that combine multiple validation approaches will show higher disagreement for transformational discoveries, revealing the validation deficit.</li>
                <li>Human expert validation will be required more frequently for transformational discoveries than incremental ones when using automated systems, indicating the gap.</li>
                <li>The computational cost ratio of validation to generation will increase with discovery novelty, as validation requires more extensive checking for transformational claims.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the fabrication-validation gap represents a fundamental limit of learning-based systems, or whether novel architectures (e.g., neurosymbolic systems, formal verification integration) could close the gap for transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial training specifically designed to penalize the fabrication-validation gap could reduce it, or would simply shift the gap to more subtle forms.</li>
                <li>Whether the gap could be exploited by adversarial actors to cause automated systems to generate and validate false transformational discoveries, creating a new attack vector.</li>
                <li>Whether human-AI collaborative systems naturally compensate for the gap, or whether humans become over-reliant on system-generated transformational claims due to their plausibility.</li>
                <li>Whether the gap follows similar dynamics across all scientific domains, or whether formal domains (mathematics, theoretical physics) show different gap characteristics than empirical domains.</li>
                <li>Whether meta-learning approaches that explicitly learn to validate novel discoveries could close the gap, or whether they would inherit the same limitations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that automated systems show equal or better validation accuracy for transformational discoveries compared to incremental discoveries would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Finding that generation and validation capabilities scale similarly with discovery novelty would undermine the gap hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Showing that false positive rates remain constant or decrease with discovery novelty would challenge the theory's predictions.</li>
                <li>Evidence that systems can reliably self-assess the validity of their transformational discoveries without external validation would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that simple validation enhancements (e.g., additional training data) eliminate the gap would suggest it's not a fundamental asymmetry.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of different types of novelty (conceptual vs. empirical vs. methodological) in determining the size of the fabrication-validation gap. </li>
    <li>How the gap manifests differently across scientific domains with varying degrees of formalization and empirical grounding. </li>
    <li>The interaction between epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness) in contributing to the validation deficit. </li>
    <li>Whether the gap is symmetric—i.e., whether systems that are poor at validating transformational discoveries are also poor at generating them, or whether generation and validation are truly asymmetric capabilities. </li>
