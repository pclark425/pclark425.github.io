                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1462</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Feature Binding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge is represented functionally as structured compositions of feature bindings, where each concept is a dynamic assembly of feature-value pairs. These bindings are flexibly combined according to compositional rules, allowing for the construction of novel concepts and the systematic generalization of knowledge. The theory accounts for the productivity and systematicity of conceptual thought, as well as the ability to represent complex, hierarchical, or relational concepts.</p>

<ol>
    <li>People can systematically combine features to create novel concepts (e.g., 'red square', 'flying car'). </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel combinations of familiar features will be rapidly and systematically represented and understood.</li>
                <li>Feature binding errors (e.g., induced by distraction) will lead to predictable conceptual confusions.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical concepts will show neural signatures of both their sub-concepts and their unique combinations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially training new compositional rules (e.g., in artificial grammar learning) will induce new patterns of feature binding in conceptual representation.</li>
                <li>Disruption of feature binding mechanisms (e.g., via brain stimulation) will selectively impair compositional but not atomic concept processing.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical composition may predict individual differences in abstract reasoning or creativity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If people cannot systematically combine features to create novel concepts, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If complex concepts do not show evidence of hierarchical or compositional structure in behavior or neural data, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If feature binding errors do not produce predictable conceptual confusions, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how feature values are selected or learned. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how context modulates feature binding. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and extends prior work, making a stronger claim about the functional-level representational format.</p>
