                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1988</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement via LLM-Guided Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill qualitative laws from large corpora, but can iteratively refine these laws by generating hypotheses, testing them against the corpus, and updating the law representations. The process mimics aspects of the scientific method, with the LLM acting as both hypothesis generator and evaluator, leading to increasingly accurate and generalizable qualitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously discover previously unknown exceptions or boundary conditions to established scientific laws.</li>
                <li>LLMs may converge on novel, more general laws that unify disparate findings across the corpus.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve law accuracy or generality through iterative refinement, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot identify exceptions or correct errors in initial law hypotheses, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If iterative refinement leads to overfitting or hallucination rather than improved law quality, the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs reinforce initial biases or errors during iterative refinement. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
