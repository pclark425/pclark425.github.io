                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-866</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Coordination Theory for LLM Agents: Dynamic Memory Arbitration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically arbitrating between multiple memory systems—short-term (contextual), long-term (episodic), and external (tool or database)—based on task demands, uncertainty, and resource constraints. The agent's memory controller adaptively selects, fuses, or suppresses memory sources to maximize task-relevant information and minimize cognitive overload or interference.</p>
