                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluation Integrity and Contamination Theory (Information-Theoretic Perspective)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory frames the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories as an information-theoretic process, where the integrity of evaluation is a function of the mutual information between the evaluation and generation processes. Contamination is quantified as the nonzero mutual information between these processes, and the theory provides both qualitative and quantitative laws for how this information flow affects the reliability, reproducibility, and validity of evaluation outcomes.</p>
