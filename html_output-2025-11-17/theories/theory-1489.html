                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Relational Symbolic-Analog Hybrid Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented in a hybrid format that combines structured symbolic relations (akin to predicate-argument structures) with distributed analog features. Concepts are encoded as structured graphs, where nodes represent entities or properties, edges represent relations, and each node/edge is associated with a high-dimensional analog vector capturing graded, context-sensitive features. This format enables flexible compositionality, abstraction, and context-dependent generalization, while supporting both symbolic reasoning and similarity-based inference.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Neuropsychological and behavioral evidence shows both rule-based (symbolic) and similarity-based (analog) generalization in concept use. </li>
    <li>Neuroimaging studies reveal distributed, overlapping activation patterns for related concepts, but also distinct patterns for different relational structures. </li>
    <li>Cognitive models (e.g., Hummel & Holyoak, 2003; Rogers & McClelland, 2004) require both structured and distributed representations to account for human concept learning and reasoning. </li>
    <li>Lesion studies show dissociations between rule-based and similarity-based reasoning, suggesting separable but interacting representational systems. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to prior hybrid models, this law is novel in specifying the necessity and structure of the hybrid format at the functional level, not just as a computational convenience.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hybrid models combining symbolic and distributed representations have been proposed in cognitive science and AI, but typically as computational models, not as explicit functional-level brain theories.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that the brain's functional representational format is a structured graph with both symbolic and analog components, and that this hybrid is necessary for the observed flexibility and generalization in conceptual knowledge.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>

</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing work on compositionality and context, but the mechanistic link to a hybrid representational format is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Compositionality is a well-known property of human conceptual knowledge; context effects are also widely observed.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law specifies that compositionality and context effects arise from the hybrid graph-analog representational format, not from purely symbolic or distributed systems alone.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel concept is constructed by combining two known concepts, neural activation patterns will show both shared structure (from the symbolic graph) and blended analog features.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring context-dependent interpretation of ambiguous concepts will show dynamic modulation of analog feature vectors in relevant brain regions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the analog feature vectors are selectively disrupted (e.g., via targeted TMS), similarity-based generalization will be impaired but rule-based reasoning will remain intact.</li>
                <li>If symbolic graph structure is disrupted (e.g., via focal lesions), compositional generalization will be impaired but feature-based similarity judgments will remain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If all conceptual knowledge can be accounted for by either purely symbolic or purely distributed representations, the necessity of the hybrid format is called into question.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate analog features in concept representations, the theory's account of context effects is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise neural mechanisms by which symbolic and analog components are integrated are not specified by the theory. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
