                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that optimally balances information sufficiency and compression, following the information bottleneck principle. The representation should retain all information relevant to downstream tasks (e.g., node/edge types, attributes, global structure) while minimizing redundancy and irrelevant detail, thus maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the target outputs, and minimizing unnecessary complexity.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If removing task-irrelevant features from graph-to-text representations does not improve generalization, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If highly compressed representations consistently underperform compared to more detailed ones, the information bottleneck law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If language models trained on maximally informative representations (i.e., with all features) always outperform those trained on bottlenecked representations, the theory would be falsified.</li>
