                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the primary bottleneck for strict logical reasoning in language models (LMs) is not the representational or computational capacity of the models, but the interface between unstructured natural language (NL) and structured symbolic representations. LMs can, in principle, implement perfect logical reasoning if provided with symbolic input, but their ability to extract, manipulate, and generalize logical structure from NL is fundamentally limited by the statistical nature of their training and the lack of explicit symbolic bias. Hybrid neuro-symbolic systems, which explicitly parse or augment NL with symbolic representations and/or external solvers, can overcome this bottleneck and achieve near-perfect logical reasoning, provided the translation step is robust.</p>

                <li>If translation errors are artificially injected into a hybrid neuro-symbolic pipeline, performance will drop sharply, even if the solver is perfect.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained end-to-end with a differentiable symbolic reasoning module and a learned NL-to-symbolic parser, it may learn to generalize logical reasoning to OOD NL tasks, provided sufficient data and architectural bias.</li>
                <li>If a sufficiently large LM is trained on a massive, diverse, and logic-rich NL corpus, it may develop emergent NL-to-symbolic mapping capabilities that close the gap to hybrid systems, even without explicit symbolic augmentation.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with a curriculum that gradually increases logical complexity and paraphrase diversity, it may overcome the statistical generalization bottleneck.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with explicit symbolic supervision (e.g., paired NL and logic forms), it may learn to generalize to unseen logical forms in NL.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model given symbolic input fails to perform perfect logical reasoning up to its depth, this would challenge the sufficiency of symbolic input for reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a text-based LM, trained only on NL, can generalize to arbitrary logical compositions and OOD logical tasks without symbolic augmentation, this would challenge the bottleneck theory.</li>
                <li>If hybrid neuro-symbolic systems fail to outperform pure LMs even when translation is robust, this would call the theory into question.</li>
