                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Tool-Augmented Simulation: Externalization of Domain-Specific Reasoning and Computation (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is fundamentally determined by the degree to which domain-specific reasoning and computation are externalized via tool augmentation. The theory asserts that LLMs, when coupled with external tools (e.g., calculators, code interpreters, domain-specific databases), can offload complex or non-linguistic reasoning, thereby overcoming intrinsic model limitations and enabling more accurate simulation of scientific phenomena.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs with calculator or code execution plugins outperform base LLMs on tasks requiring arithmetic, symbolic math, or code-based reasoning. </li>
    <li>Domain-specific tool augmentation (e.g., chemistry calculators, physics engines) enables LLMs to simulate scientific processes more accurately than text-only models. </li>
    <li>LLMs without tool augmentation often fail on tasks requiring precise computation, such as multi-step math or algorithmic reasoning. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs with access to code interpreters can solve more complex scientific problems than those relying solely on text generation. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While tool use for LLMs is known, the explicit generalization to simulation accuracy across scientific subdomains and the necessity of externalization is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that LLMs can be improved with tool use for arithmetic and code tasks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law generalizes the effect to all domain-specific reasoning and simulation, and frames tool augmentation as a necessary condition for accurate simulation in complex scientific domains.</p>
