                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Providing large language models with detailed, algorithmic prompting that specifies step-by-step instructions enables them to learn and execute arithmetic algorithms more effectively than few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting alone. This approach reduces systematic errors and improves out-of-distribution generalization on arithmetic tasks.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Algorithmic prompting provides explicit procedural guidance that LLMs can follow to simulate arithmetic algorithms.</li>
                <li>This reduces reliance on pattern matching and heuristics, improving generalization to longer or more complex problems.</li>
                <li>Systematic errors in prompts lead to significant performance degradation, indicating sensitivity to prompt correctness.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Codex achieves higher accuracy on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and parity tasks using algorithmic prompting compared to few-shot and CoT prompting, with error reductions of approximately 9-10x. <a href="../results/extraction-result-36.html#e36.0" class="evidence-link">[e36.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Algorithmic prompting combined with CoT will further improve arithmetic reasoning accuracy.</li>
                <li>Algorithmic prompting will enable smaller models to perform better on arithmetic tasks than with standard prompting.</li>
                <li>Refining algorithmic prompts to cover edge cases will reduce systematic errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether algorithmic prompting can fully replace external tool integration for complex arithmetic is unknown.</li>
                <li>The limits of algorithmic prompting in enabling LLMs to learn novel arithmetic algorithms remain to be explored.</li>
                <li>Whether algorithmic prompting can be automated or learned by the model itself is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If algorithmic prompting does not improve accuracy over CoT or few-shot prompting, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models fail to follow algorithmic prompts consistently, the theory's assumptions about procedural learning would be questioned.</li>
