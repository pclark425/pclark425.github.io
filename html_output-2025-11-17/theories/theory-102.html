                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM Prompt-Based Belief Augmentation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models used as planning agents in partially observable text environments can overcome memory limitations and improve long-horizon performance through explicit textual belief-state augmentation in prompts. The effectiveness depends on: (1) the structure and conciseness of the belief representation (compact summaries outperform full trajectory replay), (2) the agent's ability to update beliefs based on observations and tool outputs, (3) the alignment between belief format and task requirements, and (4) the trade-off between prompt length constraints and belief completeness. This approach is most beneficial when tasks require long-horizon memory beyond the LLM's effective context window, when state information is distributed across multiple observations, or when tool outputs must be tracked over time. The mechanism works by maintaining a persistent textual summary that is updated at each step and provided as context for action selection.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Explicit textual belief-state summaries in LLM prompts significantly improve performance in partially observable environments by providing persistent memory beyond the model's effective context window (typically improving task completion by 50-130% and reducing invalid actions by 50%).</li>
                <li>Compact, structured belief representations (templates with 5-10 key fields, tips, or recent K-step histories) are more effective than verbose full-trajectory histories due to prompt length constraints, with optimal K typically between 2-10 depending on task complexity.</li>
                <li>Belief updates can be performed by: (1) the LLM itself via prompted generation, (2) rule-based external modules that format updates, or (3) hybrid approaches; LLM-generated updates provide flexibility but may introduce inconsistencies, while rule-based updates ensure consistency but lack adaptability.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of prompt-based belief is limited by: (1) the LLM's ability to maintain consistency across updates, (2) retrieval of relevant information from long prompts (attention degradation), and (3) the alignment between belief structure and task requirements.</li>
                <li>Trade-offs exist between belief completeness (more information) and prompt efficiency (staying within context limits); optimal balance depends on task horizon, state complexity, and LLM context window size, with diminishing returns beyond certain belief sizes.</li>
                <li>Prompt-based belief is most beneficial when: (1) task horizon exceeds LLM's effective memory span, (2) critical information is distributed across non-consecutive observations, (3) tool outputs must be tracked over time, or (4) coordination requires maintaining models of other agents' knowledge.</li>
                <li>Different belief formats are optimal for different task types: key-value templates for structured state tracking, narrative summaries for spatial/temporal reasoning, and procedural code for algorithmic tasks.</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An LLM agent with a learned belief summarization module (e.g., a small neural network that compresses observations into compact summaries) will outperform agents with hand-crafted belief templates by 10-20% on tasks with complex state spaces.</li>
                <li>Agents that use retrieval-augmented generation to selectively include relevant past information in prompts (rather than fixed-size windows) will outperform fixed-window agents by 15-30% on tasks with long-range dependencies.</li>
                <li>In multi-agent settings, LLM agents that maintain explicit belief states about teammates' knowledge (theory of mind) will achieve 20-40% higher coordination success than agents without such beliefs.</li>
                <li>Hybrid belief systems that combine rule-based updates for factual information with LLM-generated updates for strategic reasoning will outperform pure LLM-based belief updates by 10-15%.</li>
                <li>Agents that use hierarchical belief representations (high-level goals + low-level state) will handle longer horizons more effectively than flat belief representations, improving performance by 20-30% on complex tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether prompt-based belief mechanisms can scale to very long-horizon tasks (1000+ steps) or whether they fundamentally hit context-length limits even with retrieval augmentation, and what the scaling curve looks like.</li>
                <li>Whether future LLMs with 1M+ token context windows will eliminate the need for compact belief representations, or whether structured summaries will remain beneficial due to attention degradation or computational costs.</li>
                <li>Whether learned prompt optimization techniques (e.g., soft prompts, meta-learning) can automatically discover optimal belief representation formats for different task types, and how much improvement they provide over hand-crafted formats.</li>
                <li>Whether belief augmentation provides similar benefits across different LLM architectures (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder vs mixture-of-experts) or whether the optimal approach is architecture-dependent.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-modal belief representations (combining text, images, structured data) in prompts provide synergistic benefits beyond single-modality beliefs, and what the optimal integration strategy is.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that LLMs with very large context windows (100K+ tokens) perform as well without explicit belief summaries as with them would challenge the need for compact representations and suggest the theory is primarily about working around context limitations.</li>
                <li>Showing that random or adversarial belief updates (e.g., inserting false information) perform as well as principled updates would question the importance of belief structure and update mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Finding that belief augmentation provides no benefit in tasks where it should be highly relevant (e.g., long-horizon partially observable tasks) would challenge the theory's core claims about when belief is beneficial.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that implicit memory mechanisms (e.g., fine-tuned recurrent models) consistently outperform explicit prompt-based belief would suggest the approach is suboptimal compared to learned alternatives.</li>
                <li>Showing that belief augmentation hurts performance on tasks where it's predicted to help would indicate the theory's boundary conditions are incorrect.</li>
            </ol>
