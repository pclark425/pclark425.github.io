                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1949</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Hypothesis Refinement in LLM-driven Law Discovery</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be used as engines for iterative hypothesis generation and refinement, where candidate qualitative laws are proposed based on initial pattern recognition, then tested and refined through further corpus interrogation and counterexample search. The process mimics aspects of the scientific method, with the LLM acting as both hypothesis generator and critic, leveraging its broad knowledge to converge on robust qualitative laws.</p>
