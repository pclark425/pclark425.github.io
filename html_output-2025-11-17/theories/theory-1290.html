                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1290</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Fidelity Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that maximizes semantic fidelity: the preservation and explicit encoding of all graph semantics (nodes, edges, attributes, and higher-order structures) in a form that is both interpretable and learnable by language models. The theory predicts that representations which systematically encode all graph semantics, while minimizing ambiguity and information loss, will enable language models to generalize better and perform more robust reasoning over graph-structured data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Graph-to-text representations that encode all node, edge, and attribute information will outperform those that omit any of these elements on graph reconstruction and reasoning tasks.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Encoding higher-order graph structures (e.g., motifs, cycles) explicitly in text may further improve LM reasoning, but the effect is unknown.</li>
                <li>There may be a trade-off between semantic completeness and representation length that affects model efficiency in large-scale settings.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models trained on incomplete or ambiguous representations match or exceed the performance of those trained on semantically complete, unambiguous representations, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If explicit encoding of all semantics leads to overfitting or degraded generalization, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the computational cost or scalability of fully semantically complete representations for very large graphs. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
