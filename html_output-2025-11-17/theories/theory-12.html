            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multiple reasoning paths provide diverse perspectives that reduce the impact of individual errors.</li>
                <li>Aggregating answers via majority vote or validation improves final answer correctness.</li>
                <li>Self-consistency leverages the stochastic nature of LLM generation to enhance robustness.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>PaLM-540B using self-consistency with chain-of-thought prompting achieves higher accuracy on GSM8K and MultiArith than single-path methods. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MathPrompter generates multiple analytical solutions and validates them, improving accuracy from 78.7% to 92.5% on MultiArith. <a href="../results/extraction-result-24.html#e24.0" class="evidence-link">[e24.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing the number of reasoning paths sampled will improve accuracy up to a saturation point.</li>
                <li>Combining self-consistency with external tool validation will further enhance reliability.</li>
                <li>Self-consistency will be more beneficial for complex multi-step arithmetic problems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether self-consistency can fully eliminate hallucinated or nonsensical reasoning paths is unknown.</li>
                <li>The computational trade-offs of self-consistency at very large scales remain to be explored.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If multiple reasoning paths do not improve accuracy over single paths, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If aggregation methods fail to select correct answers from diverse outputs, the theory's effectiveness would be questioned.</li>
