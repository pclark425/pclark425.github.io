                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Decorrelation and Externalization Theory of LLM Self-Reflection (Cognitive Dynamics Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory frames LLM self-reflection as a cognitive dynamic process, where each generate-then-reflect cycle acts as a meta-cognitive intervention. The externalization of reasoning serves as a 'cognitive break' that disrupts the model's tendency to repeat prior errors, enabling a form of simulated meta-cognition. Over multiple cycles, this process systematically reduces error autocorrelation and increases the diversity and robustness of solutions.</p>

                <li>If the reflection step is replaced with a non-cognitive intervention (e.g., random noise), will error autocorrelation still decrease?</li>

                <li>If error autocorrelation does not decrease with externalized reflection, the theory would be challenged.</li>
