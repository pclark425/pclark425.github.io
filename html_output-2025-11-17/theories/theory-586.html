                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Coordination Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance, generalization, and robustness by coordinating multiple memory types—short-term (context window), long-term (external retrieval-augmented), and structured (symbolic or hierarchical)—with dynamic selection and integration mechanisms. The theory asserts that hybrid memory architectures, which combine parametric, non-parametric, and structured memory, allow agents to adaptively balance recency, relevance, and precision, enabling superior performance across diverse tasks such as open-domain QA, long-term dialogue, planning, and multi-agent collaboration.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents with hybrid memory coordination will outperform single-memory-type agents on tasks requiring both factual recall and reasoning (e.g., open-domain QA with multi-hop reasoning).</li>
                <li>Dynamic memory selection (e.g., using classifiers or thresholds) will reduce retrieval cost and improve accuracy on large-scale QA and dialogue tasks.</li>
                <li>Multi-agent systems with consensus/shared memory will show faster convergence and better coordination than agents with only private memory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Integrating symbolic (DB) memory with retrieval-augmented and parametric memory may enable agents to perform complex, auditable multi-modal reasoning (e.g., combining structured records with unstructured evidence).</li>
                <li>Hybrid memory architectures may enable continual learning and adaptation in open-ended, lifelong agent settings, but the optimal balance of memory types is unknown.</li>
                <li>Dynamic memory selection mechanisms may enable agents to self-regulate memory growth and avoid memory bloat in long-running deployments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If hybrid memory agents do not outperform single-memory-type agents on tasks requiring both long-term recall and reasoning, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If dynamic memory selection does not yield efficiency or accuracy gains over static memory usage, the law's generality would be limited.</li>
                <li>If consensus/shared memory in multi-agent systems does not improve coordination or introduces instability, the theory's applicability to MAS would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully address tasks where memory integration introduces interference or catastrophic forgetting, such as in fine-tuned parametric memory agents. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4669.html#e4669.7" class="evidence-link">[e4669.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4671.html#e4671.11" class="evidence-link">[e4671.11]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts between memories retrieved from different sources (e.g., contradictory facts from parametric and non-parametric memory). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4906.html#e4906.0" class="evidence-link">[e4906.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4906.html#e4906.4" class="evidence-link">[e4906.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and generalizes hybrid memory coordination and dynamic selection as a foundational principle for LLM agents, extending beyond prior domain-specific or static approaches.</p>
