                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-869</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by integrating hierarchical episodic and semantic memory systems. Episodic memory stores temporally ordered, context-rich experiences, while semantic memory encodes abstracted, generalized knowledge. The agent dynamically selects between episodic recall and semantic abstraction based on task demands, using cross-memory interactions to support both precise recall and flexible generalization. This integration enables agents to solve both novel and familiar tasks efficiently, leveraging the strengths of both memory types.</p>
