                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective and Abstractive Memory Consolidation Theory for Long-Term Coherence in LLM Agents (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents achieve long-term coherence and effective task-solving by employing a dual-process memory system: (1) reflective memory, which enables the agent to self-monitor, evaluate, and selectively consolidate experiences, and (2) abstractive memory, which allows the agent to generalize and compress episodic experiences into higher-level schemas. The interplay between these two memory processes enables LLM agents to maintain context, adapt to new tasks, and avoid catastrophic forgetting, thus supporting robust, coherent behavior over extended interactions.</p>

    <li>Cognitive architectures combining reflection and abstraction in humans support robust, adaptive behavior. </li>
    <li>LLM agents with both reflective and abstractive modules outperform those with only one type of memory. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents equipped with both reflective and abstractive memory modules will outperform agents with only one or neither on long-horizon, multi-session tasks.</li>
                <li>Selective consolidation via reflection will reduce memory bloat and improve retrieval efficiency in LLM agents.</li>
                <li>Abstractive memory will enable LLM agents to generalize from past experiences to novel but structurally similar tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal balance between reflective and abstractive memory processes for different task domains is unknown and may yield emergent behaviors.</li>
                <li>LLM agents with advanced reflective-abstractive memory may develop self-generated goals or meta-learning capabilities.</li>
                <li>Unexpected forms of memory interference or emergent biases may arise from the interaction of reflective and abstractive processes.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM agents with both reflective and abstractive memory do not outperform those with only one type on long-horizon tasks, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If selective consolidation does not reduce memory bloat or improve retrieval, the role of reflection is challenged.</li>
                <li>If abstraction does not improve generalization, the necessity of abstractive memory is questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of external, non-agent-controlled memory stores (e.g., vector databases) on long-term coherence is not fully explained. </li>
    <li>The role of emotional or affective memory in LLM agents is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
