                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1076</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Constraint Satisfaction in Language Models for Spatial Puzzles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations that enable emergent constraint satisfaction when solving spatial puzzles like Sudoku. Rather than explicitly encoding rules, LLMs learn to represent and enforce constraints through distributed activation patterns, allowing them to generalize to novel puzzles and constraint structures. This emergent mechanism is a byproduct of exposure to structured data and the model's optimization for next-token prediction, resulting in the implicit encoding of spatial and logical relationships.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize constraint satisfaction to puzzles with entirely new types of constraints if the underlying logic is similar.</li>
                <li>Distributed representations for constraint satisfaction may enable transfer to non-spatial logical reasoning tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize to novel puzzles with similar constraint logic, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If activation patterns do not reflect distributed encoding of constraints, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanism by which distributed representations enable constraint satisfaction is not fully understood. </li>
