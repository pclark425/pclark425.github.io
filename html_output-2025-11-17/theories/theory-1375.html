                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Self-Reflection Competence Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that self-reflection efficacy in language models is an emergent property that arises only when a model's internal representations support meta-cognitive operations, such as error detection, uncertainty estimation, and counterfactual reasoning. The emergence of these capabilities is not strictly linear with scale, but results from the interaction of model size, training data diversity, and architectural inductive biases.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training on synthetic data designed to elicit meta-cognition may induce self-reflection in smaller models.</li>
                <li>There may exist architectures that enable self-reflection to emerge at much smaller scales than current transformers.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If models lacking meta-cognitive operations can still improve via self-reflection, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection emerges in models with limited data or shallow architectures, the triadic requirement would be invalidated.</li>

    <li>Some models may develop partial self-reflection abilities through memorization rather than genuine meta-cognition. </li>
