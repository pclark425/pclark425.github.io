                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextualized Relational Schema Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is functionally represented as context-sensitive relational schemas—structured networks of roles, relations, and fillers that are dynamically instantiated based on current context and goals. Rather than static representations, schemas are flexibly assembled from a library of relational templates and context cues, allowing rapid adaptation to novel situations and supporting compositional generalization.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel combinations of familiar relational roles and fillers will be processed more rapidly and accurately than entirely novel structures.</li>
                <li>Contextual cues that prime specific schemas will facilitate relational reasoning and generalization in related tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially manipulating context cues (e.g., via priming or brain stimulation) will induce novel schema instantiations not observed in natural settings.</li>
                <li>Training artificial agents with dynamic schema instantiation mechanisms will yield human-like flexibility in relational reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If humans cannot flexibly recombine schema components to handle novel relational situations, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context cues do not modulate schema instantiation in neural or behavioral data, the theory's core claim would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the neural or algorithmic mechanisms for schema library storage and retrieval. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
