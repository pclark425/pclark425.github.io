                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2259</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Evaluation Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be conducted across multiple, distinct dimensions (such as factual accuracy, novelty, explanatory power, and ethical alignment), and that the overall evaluation outcome is determined by the explicit alignment and integration of these dimensions. The theory asserts that robust evaluation requires not only the measurement of each dimension but also a principled method for their aggregation, which must be transparent, context-sensitive, and aligned with the intended use and stakeholder values.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If a new evaluation dimension (e.g., interpretability) is added, the overall evaluation outcome will change unless the aggregation method is updated.</li>
                <li>If stakeholder values shift (e.g., increased emphasis on ethical alignment), the aggregation method and thus the evaluation outcome will shift accordingly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel aggregation method is used (e.g., non-linear or context-adaptive), it may produce unexpected rankings of theories.</li>
                <li>If dimensions are highly correlated, the effectiveness of multidimensional evaluation may be reduced, potentially leading to redundancy or bias.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-dimensional evaluation produces outcomes as robust as multidimensional evaluation, the theory's premise is challenged.</li>
                <li>If aggregation methods do not affect the final ranking of theories despite changes in stakeholder values, the alignment law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The theory does not specify how to select or define new evaluation dimensions as scientific practice evolves. </li>
