                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) equipped with multi-modal alignment capabilities can optimize molecular structures in a latent space by aligning textual prompts with chemical representations, enabling the synthesis of novel chemicals tailored to specific applications. The alignment between text and molecular representations allows the LLM to interpret high-level functional requirements and translate them into actionable molecular edits.</p>
