                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Representational Bottlenecks and Epistemic Transfer in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is fundamentally limited by representational bottlenecks—constraints in the LLM's ability to encode, manipulate, and transfer domain-specific scientific knowledge. Epistemic transfer, or the ability to generalize knowledge from training to novel scientific subdomains, is modulated by the overlap between the LLM's internal representations and the epistemic structure of the target domain. Bottlenecks and transfer limitations explain systematic errors and suggest interventions.</p>
