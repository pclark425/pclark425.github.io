                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1639</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Simulation Fidelity Boundary Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the boundaries of simulation fidelity in LLMs are determined by the interplay of three principal axes: model scale (capacity), alignment (domain-specific adaptation), and prompt/context design (information structuring). The theory asserts that each axis has a nonlinear, saturating effect on simulation accuracy, and that the effective simulation boundary is defined by the intersection of their respective saturation points. The theory further posits that the simulation boundary is dynamic, shifting with advances in model architecture, alignment techniques, and prompt engineering.</p>
