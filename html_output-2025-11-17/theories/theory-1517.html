                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Functional Stable Coactivation Criterion for Concept Individuation (General Form)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the functional individuation of concepts in the brain is determined by the stable and selective coactivation of feature representations across varying contexts. A concept is individuated if its associated features consistently coactivate in a manner that is both stable (across time and context) and selective (distinct from other concepts), regardless of the underlying neural substrate. This provides a general, functional-level account of how conceptual knowledge is represented and distinguished.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging studies show that concepts evoke consistent, context-invariant patterns of activation (e.g., Haxby et al., 2001; Mitchell et al., 2008). </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and interference effects indicate that concepts are functionally individuated by stable feature coactivation (e.g., semantic priming literature). </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., distributed semantic models) rely on stable, selective coactivation for concept representation. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to distributed representation theories, this law formalizes the functional requirements for individuation, not just representation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The idea that concepts are represented by distributed, stable patterns is present in distributed semantic models and supported by neuroimaging.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit functional criterion—requiring both stability and selectivity of coactivation for individuation—is formalized here as a necessary and sufficient condition.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Concepts with unstable or non-selective coactivation patterns will be less reliably accessed or confused with other concepts in behavioral tasks.</li>
                <li>Training that increases the stability and selectivity of feature coactivation will improve concept discrimination and recall.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some abstract or context-dependent concepts may not show stable coactivation, challenging the sufficiency of the criterion.</li>
                <li>Artificial systems using this criterion may develop novel, non-human-like conceptual boundaries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be individuated without stable or selective coactivation, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If increasing coactivation stability/selectivity does not improve concept individuation, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how stability and selectivity are achieved or learned in biological systems. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes and formalizes requirements implicit in existing models, but the individuation criterion is novel.</p>
