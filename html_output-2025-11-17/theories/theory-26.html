                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> When multiple pieces of evidence are provided to language models, there exists an optimal amount of evidence beyond which additional evidence becomes counterproductive. This occurs through two mechanisms: (1) Evidence Saturation - after a certain amount of relevant evidence, the model's uncertainty is sufficiently reduced and additional evidence provides diminishing marginal information gain, and (2) Noise Accumulation - as more evidence is added, the probability of including irrelevant, contradictory, or adversarial information increases, which actively degrades model performance. The optimal evidence quantity depends on evidence quality (retrieval precision), model architecture (ability to filter noise), and task characteristics. Beyond the optimum, models exhibit decreased confidence, increased hallucination, and reduced accuracy as they struggle to integrate conflicting signals or are misled by adversarial examples that exploit their scoring heuristics.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There exists an optimal evidence quantity k* for each task-model combination where performance is maximized: P(correct|k) is maximized at k = k*.</li>
                <li>Performance as a function of evidence quantity follows an inverted-U curve: P(correct|k) increases for k < k*, plateaus near k*, and decreases for k > k*.</li>
                <li>The optimal quantity k* increases with evidence quality (retrieval precision): k* ∝ precision(retrieval).</li>
                <li>Beyond k*, the probability of including adversarial or contradictory evidence increases: P(adversarial_evidence) ≈ 1 - (1 - p_adversarial)^k, where p_adversarial is the base rate of adversarial examples.</li>
                <li>Hallucination rate increases with evidence quantity beyond the optimum: H(k) = H_base + α * max(0, k - k*), where α > 0.</li>
                <li>Different model architectures have different k* values, with models that can better filter noise (like FiD with cross-attention) having higher k* than models that marginalize uniformly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Increasing the number of generated candidate solutions improves verifier performance up to ~400 completions for 6B models, but beyond that performance declines because search finds adversarial solutions that fool the verifier. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.2" class="evidence-link">[e203.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Conditioning on more retrieved documents often reduces perplexity and increases F1 but can decrease Knowledge F1 and increase hallucination rates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-209.html#e209.2" class="evidence-link">[e209.2]</a> </li>
    <li>RAG-Token hallucination increased from 17.0% with k=5 documents to 21.5% with k=25 documents; FiD-RAG hallucination increased from 7.9% to 19.8%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-209.html#e209.2" class="evidence-link">[e209.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Adding multiple retrieved documents (k>1) often lowers overall accuracy and increases frequency of responses matching neither prior nor any single context. <a href="../results/extraction-result-194.html#e194.11" class="evidence-link">[e194.11]</a> </li>
    <li>For RAG-Sequence retrieving more docs monotonically improves Open-domain QA, but for RAG-Token performance peaks at k=10 and shows trade-offs between BLEU and ROUGE. <a href="../results/extraction-result-210.html#e210.5" class="evidence-link">[e210.5]</a> </li>
    <li>More retrieved documents increase available context but also increase chance of retrieving noisy/partially relevant/contradictory information. <a href="../results/extraction-result-209.html#e209.2" class="evidence-link">[e209.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-document RAG reduced model accuracy and increased ambiguous outputs, though it also lowered context bias by diluting single incorrect documents. <a href="../results/extraction-result-194.html#e194.11" class="evidence-link">[e194.11]</a> </li>
    <li>Search exposes the verifier to adversarially-looking completions that verifier heuristics mistakenly score highly, so excessive search increases chance of selecting spurious solutions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.2" class="evidence-link">[e203.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For any retrieval system, there exists a measurable k* that can be determined empirically by plotting accuracy vs k and finding the maximum.</li>
                <li>Improving retrieval precision (e.g., through better retrievers or re-rankers) will shift k* to higher values, allowing models to benefit from more evidence.</li>
                <li>Training models with explicit noise-filtering objectives will increase their k* values, allowing them to handle more evidence without degradation.</li>
                <li>Providing evidence with explicit quality scores or confidence ratings will allow models to better handle large k by downweighting low-quality evidence.</li>
                <li>The rate of performance degradation beyond k* will be steeper for tasks requiring precise factual accuracy than for tasks requiring general topical relevance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exist 'adversarial evidence detectors' that can be trained to identify when additional evidence is likely to be harmful before it affects generation.</li>
                <li>Whether the inverted-U relationship holds across all task types or whether some tasks show monotonic improvement with evidence quantity.</li>
                <li>Whether models can be trained to dynamically determine their own optimal k* for each query based on query characteristics.</li>
                <li>Whether the noise accumulation effect is primarily due to contradictory information or to dilution of relevant information across too many sources.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist prompting strategies that can maintain the benefits of large k while avoiding the noise accumulation problem.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where performance continues to improve monotonically with evidence quantity without any degradation would challenge the saturation aspect of the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that performance degradation beyond k* is entirely due to computational limitations rather than noise accumulation would challenge the noise mechanism.</li>
                <li>Showing that models with perfect noise filtering still exhibit performance degradation with too much evidence would challenge the noise accumulation explanation.</li>
                <li>Finding that k* does not correlate with retrieval precision would challenge the quality-dependent aspect of the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Why RAG-Sequence shows monotonic improvement while RAG-Token shows saturation - what architectural difference causes this? <a href="../results/extraction-result-210.html#e210.5" class="evidence-link">[e210.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The exact functional form of the inverted-U curve and whether it's the same across different domains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.2" class="evidence-link">[e203.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-209.html#e209.2" class="evidence-link">[e209.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Why some metrics (F1) improve while others (Knowledge F1) degrade with more evidence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-209.html#e209.2" class="evidence-link">[e209.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Whether the adversarial examples that fool verifiers are fundamentally different from natural noise in retrieved documents. <a href="../results/extraction-result-203.html#e203.2" class="evidence-link">[e203.2]</a> </li>
