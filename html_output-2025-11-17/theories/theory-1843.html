                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented and Ensemble Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can most accurately estimate the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries when they are augmented with retrieval mechanisms that access up-to-date, structured, and unstructured scientific data, and when their outputs are combined via ensemble reasoning across multiple independent LLMs or reasoning chains. The theory asserts that retrieval augmentation provides access to the latest signals and context, while ensemble reasoning mitigates individual model biases and uncertainty, leading to more robust and calibrated probability estimates for scientific forecasting.</p>
