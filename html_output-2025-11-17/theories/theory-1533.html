                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1533</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement Principle for Macroscopic FTL Spacetime Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the key to practical faster-than-light (FTL) travel lies in the ability to confine and manipulate negative energy densities in macroscopic regions, in a manner that circumvents or locally relaxes the quantum inequalities (QI) that otherwise limit the magnitude and duration of negative energy. By engineering quantum fields and boundary conditions at the mesoscale or larger, it may be possible to create stable spacetime geometries (such as warp bubbles) with energy requirements compatible with current or near-future technology.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Macroscopic FTL bubbles can be sustained for durations sufficient for interstellar travel using current or near-future quantum engineering.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no engineered quantum system can confine negative energy beyond QI bounds, the theory is falsified.</li>
