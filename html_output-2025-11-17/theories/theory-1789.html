                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Knowledge Synthesis and Uncertainty Calibration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by synthesizing probabilistic knowledge from their training data and calibrating their uncertainty based on the diversity, recency, and consensus of scientific discourse. The LLM's output probability reflects an aggregation of explicit and implicit signals about the plausibility, maturity, and controversy of a hypothesis, modulated by the model's ability to recognize gaps, contradictions, and converging evidence in the literature.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law extends known uncertainty calibration to the domain of scientific discovery forecasting.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Uncertainty calibration is a known property in probabilistic models and LLMs can express uncertainty.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between evidence diversity in training data and LLM probability assignment for future discoveries is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to identify areas where consensus is forming, predicting discoveries before formal consensus is reached.</li>
                <li>LLMs may underestimate the probability of discoveries in fields with low publication volume but high innovation potential.</li>
                <li>LLMs may overestimate probabilities in fields with high publication bias or echo chambers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs assign high probability to hypotheses with little or no supporting evidence, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to reflect consensus or uncertainty in their probability assignments, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates do not correlate with evidence density or consensus, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Discoveries resulting from non-public or proprietary research are not captured by LLMs trained on public data. </li>
    <li>LLMs may not account for paradigm shifts or disruptive discoveries not foreshadowed in the literature. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
