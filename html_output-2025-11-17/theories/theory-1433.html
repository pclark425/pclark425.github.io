                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection and Answer Optimization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a cyclical process of generation and self-reflection, where each reflection step enables the model to identify, evaluate, and correct errors or suboptimal reasoning in its previous outputs. The process leverages the model's ability to critique its own outputs, leading to incremental improvements and convergence toward higher-quality answers.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing the number of generate-then-reflect cycles will improve answer quality up to a point, after which further cycles yield minimal gains.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are given access to external tools or knowledge during reflection, the convergence point may shift to a higher-quality answer.</li>
                <li>If reflection steps are adversarially perturbed, the model may converge to suboptimal or incorrect answers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve with additional reflection cycles, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If models do not converge and continue to oscillate or degrade in answer quality, the convergence law is challenged.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection introduces new errors not present in the original output. </li>
    <li>Tasks where the model lacks sufficient knowledge to improve through reflection. </li>
