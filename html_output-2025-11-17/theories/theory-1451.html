                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Relational Mapping Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally represented as structured, multimodal relational maps. Each concept is encoded as a node within a high-dimensional graph, where edges represent learned relations (e.g., causal, taxonomic, spatial, temporal) between concepts. The representational format is inherently multimodal, integrating perceptual, linguistic, motor, and affective information, and is dynamically modulated by context and task demands. This structure enables flexible inference, generalization, and compositionality.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging and behavioral studies show that humans represent concepts with structured relations, such as taxonomies and causal links. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While graph-based models exist, this law extends them to a functional, multimodal, and context-sensitive framework.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Semantic network and graph-based models of conceptual knowledge are well-established in cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law generalizes the representational format to all conceptual knowledge and emphasizes the functional, not just structural, role of relational graphs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Disrupting specific relational edges (e.g., via TMS or lesions) will impair reasoning about those relations but not about unrelated concepts.</li>
                <li>Concepts with richer multimodal integration will show more robust activation across multiple brain regions during recall.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially enhancing or suppressing specific modalities (e.g., via neurofeedback) will alter the structure of conceptual graphs in predictable ways.</li>
                <li>Training artificial agents with explicit multimodal relational graphs will yield human-like generalization and compositionality.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be represented and manipulated without any relational or multimodal structure, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If lesioning relational edges does not impair relational reasoning, the theory's core claim would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how new modalities are incorporated into existing conceptual graphs. </li>
