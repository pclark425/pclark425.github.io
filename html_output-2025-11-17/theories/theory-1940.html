                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1940</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Formatting-Induced Degeneration Cascade Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the structure and clarity of prompt formatting directly modulate the likelihood and severity of degeneration phenomena in LLM outputs. Specifically, poorly formatted or ambiguous prompts increase the risk of output validity collapse, including repetition, truncation, hallucination, and semantic drift. The theory further asserts that this effect is not merely additive but can trigger cascading failures in multi-step or compositional tasks, as initial misinterpretations propagate through subsequent generations.</p>
