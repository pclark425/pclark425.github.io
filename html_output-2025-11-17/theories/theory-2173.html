                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Guided Rule Extraction and Empirical Validation for Scientific Prediction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when systematically guided by structured prompts and iterative feedback, can extract candidate scientific rules from large corpora of scholarly papers. These rules can then be empirically validated by cross-referencing with observed data or further literature, enabling the automated construction and refinement of predictive scientific theories. The process is iterative, with feedback from empirical validation informing subsequent LLM extraction cycles, leading to increasingly robust and generalizable scientific models.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize, synthesize, and abstract rules from large text corpora when given appropriate prompts. </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering and iterative feedback loops have been shown to significantly improve the quality and specificity of LLM outputs. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While LLMs are used for summarization and information extraction, their use as iterative, guided scientific rule extractors for theory construction is a new conceptualization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs can summarize and extract information from text; prompt engineering and iterative feedback are known to guide and improve LLM outputs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit, iterative use of LLMs for scientific rule extraction and refinement, as a pipeline for theory construction, is novel.</p>
