                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Human Collaboration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most robust qualitative laws are distilled when LLMs and human experts engage in iterative cycles of law proposal, critique, and refinement. LLMs generate candidate laws from large corpora, which are then evaluated, critiqued, and refined by human experts, with feedback loops improving both the LLM's distillation process and the quality of the resulting laws.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLM-human collaboration may enable the discovery of laws that neither could have formulated independently.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If iterative LLM-human cycles do not improve law quality over LLMs or humans alone, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If expert feedback fails to reduce spurious generalizations, the theory would be called into question.</li>
