                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents can best use memory by adaptively compressing and abstracting stored information based on the demands of the current and anticipated tasks. The agent dynamically selects the granularity and representation of memory traces, balancing storage cost and retrieval utility, to maximize task performance.</p>
