                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modular and Search-Augmented Reasoning Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that strict logical reasoning in language models is best achieved by modularizing the reasoning process into explicit selection, inference, and verification steps, and augmenting with search or value-guided exploration. This modularization prevents direct shortcutting from question to answer, reduces hallucination, and enables interpretable, stepwise reasoning. Value-guided search and self-consistency further improve performance by exploring multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most plausible or correct ones. The theory also asserts that architectural constraints (e.g., separating selection and inference, or using explicit memory or backward-chaining) are necessary to achieve robust, faithful logical reasoning, especially as reasoning depth increases.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a modular, stepwise reasoning architecture with explicit selection, inference, and verification is applied to a new logical reasoning task, it will outperform an end-to-end model of similar size.</li>
                <li>If value-guided search or self-consistency decoding is added to a modular reasoning model, accuracy on deep or distractor-rich tasks will increase significantly.</li>
                <li>If architectural constraints are relaxed (e.g., allowing inference to access the question), hallucination and shortcutting will increase.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If modularization is applied to tasks with highly entangled or non-symbolic reasoning, it is unclear whether the same gains will be observed.</li>
                <li>If value-guided search is combined with self-consistency in a single model, it is unknown whether gains will be additive or redundant.</li>
                <li>If modular architectures are trained end-to-end with large-scale pretraining, it is unknown whether explicit modularization will still provide unique benefits.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If end-to-end models with no modularization or search outperform modular, search-augmented models on strict logical reasoning tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If hallucination and shortcutting are not reduced by architectural constraints, the theory's claims would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If value-guided search or self-consistency decoding fails to improve accuracy on deep reasoning tasks, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some logic-specific or neurosymbolic interventions (e.g., solver-augmented models, logic-driven fine-tuning) can yield high logical reasoning performance even for non-modular architectures. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3454.html#e3454.8" class="evidence-link">[e3454.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3439.html#e3439.0" class="evidence-link">[e3439.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3432.html#e3432.0" class="evidence-link">[e3432.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some tasks (e.g., shallow NLI, simple arithmetic) can be solved by end-to-end models without modularization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3544.html#e3544.0" class="evidence-link">[e3544.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3544.html#e3544.9" class="evidence-link">[e3544.9]</a> </li>
