                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) exhibit a sharp, emergent transition in their ability to perform strict logical reasoning once a critical threshold in model scale, data diversity, and architectural expressivity is surpassed. Below this threshold, LLMs rely on pattern-matching and shallow heuristics, but above it, they can represent and manipulate abstract logical structures, enabling robust deductive and compositional reasoning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Adding more structured logical data to training will lower the required parameter threshold for emergent reasoning.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist a second, higher threshold where models can perform meta-logical reasoning (e.g., inventing new logical systems).</li>
                <li>Thresholds may shift depending on the logical system's complexity (e.g., first-order vs. higher-order logic).</li>
                <li>The threshold may be affected by architectural innovations (e.g., attention mechanisms, memory modules).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a small model (below the predicted threshold) can be trained to perform strict logical reasoning, the threshold hypothesis is challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing model size and data diversity does not result in a sharp transition in logical reasoning ability, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If models above the threshold fail on basic logical reasoning tasks, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small models with specialized architectures (e.g., neural theorem provers) can perform logical reasoning without large scale. </li>
