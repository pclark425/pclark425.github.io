                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1744</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Language Model-Based Statistical Consistency Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) can detect anomalies in lists of data by modeling the statistical regularities of the list's domain. Anomalies are identified as items that deviate from the learned distribution, as measured by the LM's internal probability or perplexity scores. The LM's ability to generalize across domains allows it to flag both syntactic and semantic outliers, even in non-linguistic or structured data, provided the data is suitably tokenized.</p>
