                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Statistical Pattern Extraction and Memorization in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models perform arithmetic primarily by extracting and memorizing statistical patterns from their training data, rather than by developing true algorithmic or symbolic reasoning. Arithmetic performance is thus a function of the frequency and diversity of arithmetic expressions in the training data, and generalization is limited to patterns that are sufficiently represented in the data.</p>

                <li>LLMs will make more errors on arithmetic expressions with number lengths or formats not present in training data.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on data with adversarially misleading arithmetic patterns, their performance on standard arithmetic will degrade in predictable ways.</li>
                <li>LLMs trained on data with systematic arithmetic errors will reproduce those errors in outputs.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to arithmetic in non-standard notations, their performance on standard notation may be impaired.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs generalize perfectly to arithmetic expressions never seen in training, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform well on arithmetic tasks with number lengths or formats absent from training data, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' performance is not correlated with pattern frequency in training data, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial generalization to unseen arithmetic expressions, suggesting some abstraction beyond memorization. </li>
    <li>LLMs can sometimes perform multi-step arithmetic with chain-of-thought prompting, even for rare expressions. </li>
