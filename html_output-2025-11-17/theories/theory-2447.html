                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the network connectivity patterns and the nature of their axonal projections. Neurons with extensive, long-range, and metabolically demanding projections (especially those connecting to subcortical or distant cortical regions) are more susceptible to pathological accumulation, while neurons with local, short-range, or less metabolically intensive projections are more resistant. This vulnerability is further modulated by the integration of these neurons within specific network motifs, their synaptic input/output balance, and their participation in large-scale brain networks.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the metabolic demand of local-projecting neurons will increase their vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Disrupting network motifs (e.g., by silencing hub neurons) will alter the spatial pattern of pathology in the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If local-projecting, low-metabolic-demand neurons show equal or greater pathology than long-range, high-demand neurons, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If network hub neurons are not preferentially affected in visual cortex, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with long-range projections may be resistant, suggesting additional molecular or genetic factors. </li>
    <li>Certain local circuit interneurons can show pathology despite low projection length and metabolic demand. </li>
