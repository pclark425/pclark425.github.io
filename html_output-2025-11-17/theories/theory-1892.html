                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as a High-Dimensional Control Signal for LLM Computation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the presentation format of a problem acts as a high-dimensional control signal, dynamically steering the computation of a large language model (LLM) by modulating attention, memory retrieval, and reasoning pathways. The prompt format thus serves not only as an input but as a functional controller, shaping the trajectory of computation and the resulting output.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If a prompt is structured to emphasize step-by-step reasoning, the LLM will show increased attention to intermediate steps and produce more detailed outputs.</li>
                <li>If a prompt is structured as a direct question, the LLM will focus attention on answer-relevant tokens and retrieve concise answers.</li>
                <li>Changing prompt format will systematically alter the distribution of attention and memory retrieval in the LLM.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is designed to encode conflicting control signals (e.g., both step-by-step and direct answer), the LLM may exhibit unstable or oscillatory computation patterns.</li>
                <li>If control signals are encoded in non-linguistic prompt features (e.g., whitespace, formatting), the LLM may still modulate computation accordingly.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained to recognize and ignore certain control signals, their sensitivity to prompt format may be selectively reduced.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show changes in attention, memory retrieval, or reasoning pathways when prompt format is altered, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If prompt format has no effect on LLM output or internal computation, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot be steered by prompt format even in controlled experiments, the theory's explanatory power is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs with fixed, non-adaptive computation may not exhibit control-signal-based modulation. </li>
    <li>Some LLMs may have hard-coded biases that override prompt-based control signals. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
