                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Threshold and Synergy Theory of Alzheimer's Disease Causation (Dynamic Network Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the general threshold-synergy model by positing that Alzheimer's disease arises from dynamic, time-dependent interactions among multiple risk factors, which form a network of positive and negative feedback loops. The network's structure and connectivity determine the system's resilience or vulnerability. Disease onset occurs when the network's cumulative perturbation exceeds a critical threshold, destabilizing homeostatic mechanisms and triggering neurodegeneration. Detection should focus on temporal patterns and network signatures across risk domains.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Network analysis may reveal previously unrecognized feedback loops (e.g., between gut microbiome and neuroinflammation) critical for AD onset.</li>
                <li>Some individuals may have network architectures that confer resilience, allowing them to withstand large perturbations without developing AD.</li>
                <li>Temporal synchronization of risk factor exacerbations (e.g., stress and metabolic dysfunction) may be a critical trigger for AD in susceptible individuals.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If static risk factor accumulation predicts AD as well as or better than dynamic network perturbation models, the dynamic law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If time-series biomarker analysis does not improve prediction of AD onset over static models, the temporal law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Monogenic, deterministic forms of AD may not require dynamic network perturbation. </li>
