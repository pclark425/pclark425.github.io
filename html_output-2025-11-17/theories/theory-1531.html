                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement Principle for FTL Propulsion via Dynamical Casimir Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by dynamically modulating boundary conditions in engineered quantum systems, it is possible to generate and confine negative energy densities in spacetime regions, enabling the formation of FTL propulsion structures (e.g., warp bubbles) within realistic energy budgets. The principle leverages the dynamical Casimir effect and quantum squeezing to transiently violate quantum inequality constraints in a controlled, repeatable manner.</p>
