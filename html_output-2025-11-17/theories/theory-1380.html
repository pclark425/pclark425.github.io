                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy: General Threshold Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that there exists a critical capability threshold in language models, above which self-reflection and iterative answer refinement reliably improve answer quality, and below which such processes are ineffective or even detrimental. The threshold is determined by the model's ability to accurately evaluate and revise its own outputs, which is a function of both model architecture and training data.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that only sufficiently capable models (e.g., GPT-4) benefit from self-reflection, while smaller models do not. </li>
    <li>The effectiveness of self-reflection is task-dependent, with more complex tasks requiring higher capability thresholds. </li>
    <li>Models below the threshold may reinforce their own errors or hallucinations during self-reflection. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the empirical trend is known, the formalization as a threshold law conditional on both model and task is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work notes that larger, more capable models benefit more from self-reflection and iterative refinement.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit conditional law relating a capability threshold to task complexity and self-reflection efficacy is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For any given task, there exists a minimum model size or capability below which self-reflection does not improve answer quality.</li>
                <li>As task complexity increases, the minimum capability threshold for effective self-reflection also increases.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist architectures or training regimes that lower the threshold for effective self-reflection.</li>
                <li>Hybrid models combining external verification may bypass the threshold for some tasks.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If small or less capable models consistently improve with self-reflection, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the threshold does not shift with task complexity, the theory would be called into question.</li>
