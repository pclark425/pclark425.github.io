                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories (Dynamic Feedback Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is a dynamic, iterative process in which feedback from evaluators is recursively incorporated into subsequent LLM outputs, leading to a co-evolution of theory quality and evaluation criteria. The reliability and novelty of the resulting theories depend on the structure, timing, and content of evaluator feedback, as well as the LLM's capacity to adapt to such feedback.</p>

            <ol>
