                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be guided to induce qualitative laws from scholarly corpora through carefully designed prompts that specify the desired form, scope, or abstraction level of the law. Prompt engineering acts as a control mechanism, shaping the LLM's hypothesis space and enabling targeted law discovery, including the induction of laws at varying levels of generality or specificity.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prompt engineering has been shown to control the specificity, abstraction, and style of LLM outputs. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be guided to generate hypotheses, summaries, or laws at varying levels of detail via prompt design. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies demonstrate that LLMs respond to explicit instructions in prompts, producing outputs that align with the requested abstraction or form. </li>
    <li>LLMs have been used to extract, summarize, and generalize scientific findings from large corpora when given structured prompts. </li>
    <li>Prompt-based control is effective across multiple LLM architectures and domains, though with varying degrees of success. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prompt engineering is established, its application to the targeted induction of scientific laws from large corpora is a novel extension, not previously formalized as a law.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt engineering for controlling LLM outputs is well-established, including for tasks like summarization, question answering, and hypothesis generation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit use of prompt constraints to induce qualitative scientific laws at targeted abstraction levels from scholarly corpora is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will generate more general or more specific qualitative laws depending on the abstraction level specified in the prompt.</li>
                <li>Prompt engineering will improve the relevance and accuracy of induced laws.</li>
                <li>Explicitly structured prompts will yield more consistent and interpretable law induction outputs from LLMs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to induce novel forms of scientific laws not previously articulated by humans when prompted with creative or cross-domain instructions.</li>
                <li>Prompt-driven law induction may reveal latent, unrecognized regularities in scientific corpora.</li>
                <li>LLMs may synthesize cross-disciplinary laws when prompted to generalize across multiple scientific domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompt engineering fails to control the abstraction or form of induced laws, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate targeted laws despite clear prompt constraints, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce irrelevant or incoherent laws regardless of prompt specificity, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may be limited by the quality or coverage of the underlying corpus, regardless of prompt design. </li>
    <li>Some scientific laws may require formal mathematical reasoning or domain-specific knowledge not accessible to the LLM. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory applies prompt engineering to a new, specific scientific discovery task—law induction from large corpora—making it closely related but not identical to existing work.</p>
