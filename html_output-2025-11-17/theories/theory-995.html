                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Compression-Expansion Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimally solve text game tasks by adaptively compressing and expanding their memory representations in response to task demands, balancing the trade-off between memory efficiency and information richness. Compression (summarization, abstraction) is used to manage memory load, while expansion (reconstruction, detail retrieval) is triggered when fine-grained information is required for decision-making.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If memory expansion is imperfect (i.e., lossy compression), agents may hallucinate or misremember details, affecting performance in high-precision tasks.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with only compressed or only expanded memory perform as well as those with adaptive compression-expansion, the theory's necessity is called into question.</li>
                <li>If memory expansion does not improve performance on tasks requiring detailed recall, the theory's claims are weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of catastrophic forgetting or memory interference during repeated compression-expansion cycles is not addressed. </li>
