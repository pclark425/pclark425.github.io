                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-776</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Pattern Matching Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging compositional pattern matching over their training data. Rather than executing explicit algorithmic computation, LMs learn statistical associations between input patterns (e.g., '12 + 7 =') and output patterns (e.g., '19'), and generalize to new arithmetic queries by recombining learned sub-patterns. This process is modulated by the frequency and diversity of arithmetic expressions in the training data, the model's capacity, and the representational structure of numbers and operators.</p>
