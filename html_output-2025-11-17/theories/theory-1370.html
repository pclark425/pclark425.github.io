                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through generate-then-reflect cycles by iteratively aligning their outputs with internalized representations of correctness, coherence, and task requirements. Each reflection step acts as a self-supervised feedback loop, allowing the model to re-evaluate and adjust its response based on discrepancies between its output and its learned standards.</p>
