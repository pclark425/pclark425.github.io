                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2258</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Evaluation Alignment Theory (Generalized Feedback Loop Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the multidimensional alignment concept by positing that evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is a dynamic, iterative process. Evaluative feedback across multiple dimensions (explicit and implicit) is used to adapt both the evaluation framework and the LLM's generative process, creating a feedback loop that incrementally improves both theory generation and evaluation alignment over time.</p>
