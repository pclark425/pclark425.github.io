                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Compositional Schema Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge is represented in the brain as a hierarchy of compositional schemas, where each schema encodes a structured set of relations and roles. Concepts are instantiated by binding specific fillers to abstract roles within these schemas, and higher-level concepts are recursively constructed from lower-level schemas. The representational format is symbolic-structural at the schema level, but the instantiation of roles and bindings is realized through dynamic, distributed processes.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be instantiated without any evidence of schema structure or role-filler binding, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical compositionality is not observed in neural or behavioral data, the theory would be called into question.</li>
