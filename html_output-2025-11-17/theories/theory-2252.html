                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2252</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative process in which human experts and AI systems collaboratively assess, critique, and refine candidate theories. The theory posits that this co-evaluation process leverages complementary strengths and mitigates the weaknesses of both humans and LLMs.</p>
