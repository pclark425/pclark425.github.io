                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Loop Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to self-reflect, instantiate a meta-cognitive loop analogous to human metacognition. In this loop, the model generates an initial answer, then simulates an internal critic that evaluates, calibrates, and potentially revises the answer. The effectiveness of this loop depends on the model's ability to simulate diverse internal perspectives and to integrate feedback, leading to either improved calibration or, if the loop is poorly structured, to bias reinforcement.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs can critique and revise their own outputs when prompted, analogous to human metacognition. </li>

    <li>Self-reflection and self-critique have been shown to improve LLM performance on tasks requiring reasoning and factual accuracy. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law draws on existing concepts in cognitive science and LLM research but applies them in a novel, formalized way to LLMs, specifying the conditions and outcomes of meta-cognitive loop activation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Human metacognition and self-critique are well-studied; LLMs have been shown to benefit from self-critique and iterative refinement.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit analogy to a meta-cognitive loop and the conditional structure for LLMs is new, as is the formalization of the loop's activation criteria.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>Meta-cognitive loops may enable LLMs to self-correct hallucinations in some domains but not others.</li>
                <li>The structure of the meta-cognitive loop (e.g., order of critique, diversity of perspectives) may affect the degree of calibration or bias amplification.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve with multi-perspective self-reflection, the integration law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If meta-cognitive loops do not form (i.e., no evidence of internal critique or revision), the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection increases bias or error rates in a systematic way, the calibration aspect of the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs hallucinate new errors during self-reflection, not present in the initial answer. </li>
    <li>Instances where LLMs fail to simulate genuinely diverse perspectives, especially on controversial or unfamiliar topics. </li>
