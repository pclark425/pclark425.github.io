                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Hierarchical Law Abstraction in Biomedical Literature</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can extract not only flat gene–disease association laws, but also hierarchical laws that capture relationships at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., gene family, pathway, disease subtype) by aggregating and abstracting patterns across biomedical abstracts. This enables the discovery of both specific and generalizable laws, supporting multi-scale reasoning in biomedical knowledge.</p>
