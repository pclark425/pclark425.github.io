                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-735</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Algorithm Activation and Superficial Alignment Theory (Hierarchical Representation Hypothesis)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs develop a hierarchy of representations for arithmetic, where superficial alignment governs shallow, pattern-based representations and latent algorithmic activation enables deeper, compositional reasoning. The interplay between these layers determines the model's ability to perform arithmetic, with failures arising when queries require transitions between representational levels.</p>
