            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Iterative prompting of an LLM with feedback such as 'increase water solubility' will yield molecules with progressively higher predicted solubility.</li>
                <li>Providing feedback like 'route is too long, find a shorter synthesis' will result in LLMs proposing more concise synthetic pathways.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new synthetic strategies or molecular scaffolds through iterative, language-guided optimization.</li>
                <li>The feedback loop may enable LLMs to overcome biases or gaps in the training data, leading to unexpected chemical innovations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to meaningfully incorporate feedback and do not improve outputs over iterations, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If iterative feedback leads to degradation or loss of chemical validity, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of LLMs' ability to interpret highly technical or ambiguous feedback are not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential for feedback loops to reinforce undesirable biases or errors is not explicitly explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
