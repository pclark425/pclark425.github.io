                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Refinement Theory of Language Model Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-refinement, where each generate-then-reflect cycle enables the model to identify, correct, and integrate errors or uncertainties from previous outputs, leading to emergent meta-cognitive behavior and higher answer reliability.</p>
