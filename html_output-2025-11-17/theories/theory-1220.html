                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Contextualization for Zero-Shot Molecular Design</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs equipped with retrieval-augmented mechanisms can dynamically incorporate relevant chemical knowledge from external databases or corpora into their context window. This enables the LLM to synthesize molecules for applications and chemical classes not present in its training data, by leveraging retrieved examples and property annotations to guide generation in a zero-shot manner.</p>
