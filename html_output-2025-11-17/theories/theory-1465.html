                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that for many natural categories, conceptual knowledge is represented as a set of feature-weighted prototype subspaces within the overall conceptual latent space. Each category is associated with a prototype (central tendency) and a set of diagnostic features, each with a context-dependent weight. Category membership and typicality are determined by the distance to the prototype, modulated by the weighted features relevant in the current context.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prototype effects and context-dependent typicality are robust in behavioral studies (e.g., typicality ratings shift with context, and people judge category membership based on similarity to a central prototype). </li>
    <li>Neural data show graded activation patterns corresponding to typicality and feature relevance (e.g., fMRI studies show that more typical category members elicit stronger or more central activation patterns in relevant brain regions). </li>
    <li>Feature weighting is observed in both behavioral and neural data: the importance of specific features for category judgments changes with context (e.g., 'has wings' is more diagnostic for 'bird' in some contexts than others). </li>
    <li>Computational models that use weighted feature spaces (e.g., context-sensitive vector spaces) better predict human typicality judgments than unweighted or rule-based models. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Prototype and feature weighting are known, but the explicit subspace and context-weighted formalization is a novel, more precise claim that integrates context, feature weighting, and latent space structure.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prototype theory and feature weighting are established in cognitive psychology, and context effects on typicality are well-documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the representation as a contextually weighted subspace within a latent space, not just as a list of features or a single prototype, and proposes a quantitative mechanism for how context modulates category boundaries.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating the diagnosticity of features in context (e.g., emphasizing 'can fly' for birds) will shift typicality gradients and neural activation patterns for category members.</li>
                <li>Novel categories with clear prototypes and diagnostic features will show rapid formation of weighted subspaces in neural data, with typicality gradients emerging as a function of feature weighting.</li>
                <li>Contextual priming (e.g., preceding a category judgment with a context cue) will systematically alter both behavioral typicality ratings and neural similarity structure among category members.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial neural networks trained with context-dependent feature weighting will better match human typicality judgments than standard prototype models, especially in ambiguous or context-rich situations.</li>
                <li>Disruption of feature weighting mechanisms (e.g., via targeted brain stimulation or pharmacological intervention) will flatten typicality gradients and impair context-sensitive category judgments.</li>
                <li>In high-dimensional conceptual spaces, the theory predicts that contextually weighted subspaces will be observable as low-dimensional manifolds in neural population activity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If category membership and typicality are invariant to context or feature weighting, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If neural data do not show subspace structure or context-dependent weighting (e.g., if all category members are equally represented regardless of context), the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If behavioral typicality gradients do not shift with manipulation of feature diagnosticity or context, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not account for categories defined by strict rules or necessary/sufficient conditions (e.g., mathematical or legal categories). </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how prototypes and feature weights are initially learned or updated over time. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory refines and formalizes prototype theory with a latent space and context-weighted subspace structure, integrating context, feature weighting, and neural representational geometry.</p>
