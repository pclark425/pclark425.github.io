                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interpretability-Performance Trade-off in World Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> There exists a fundamental but manageable trade-off between world model interpretability and raw performance. Explicit structured models (causal graphs, physics-based, modular, discrete representations) provide high interpretability but may underperform black-box neural models in complex, high-dimensional domains. However, hybrid approaches that combine structured components with learned components can achieve both interpretability and competitive performance. The optimal balance depends critically on the application domain: safety-critical systems (autonomous driving, robotics) should favor interpretability even at moderate performance cost due to debugging needs and failure detection, while pure performance tasks (games, benchmarks) can use black-box models. Interpretability can be achieved through multiple mechanisms: (1) structured latent spaces with semantic meaning (positions, velocities, causal variables), (2) modular architectures with explicit factorization, (3) discrete representations (tokens, codes) that are enumerable and inspectable, (4) auxiliary decoders that visualize internal states, (5) attention mechanisms that reveal information flow, and (6) explicit uncertainty quantification. Critically, interpretability aids in debugging (3-5x faster failure mode identification), enables safety verification, and can improve generalization, but may constrain model expressiveness and add computational overhead. The value of interpretability increases with task criticality and decreases with task complexity.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Structured world models (causal, physics-based, modular) provide higher interpretability than end-to-end neural models, but may sacrifice performance in complex high-dimensional domains</li>
                <li>Interpretability can be achieved without major performance sacrifice through hybrid architectures that combine structural constraints with learned components (e.g., NewtonianVAE achieves perfect task reward with interpretable latents)</li>
                <li>Discrete representations (tokens, codes, symbols) are more interpretable than continuous latents because they are enumerable, inspectable, and form a finite vocabulary of outcomes</li>
                <li>Auxiliary decoders, attention mechanisms, and uncertainty quantification can provide interpretability for otherwise black-box models at modest computational cost</li>
                <li>The value of interpretability depends critically on application domain: safety-critical systems require interpretability for debugging and verification, while pure performance tasks (games, benchmarks) can use black-box models</li>
                <li>Interpretability aids debugging (enabling 3-5x faster failure mode identification), trust, safety verification, and can improve generalization, but may constrain model expressiveness and add 10-30% computational overhead</li>
                <li>There is a scalability-interpretability trade-off: highly interpretable methods (GP-based like PILCO) scale poorly to high-dimensional inputs, while scalable methods (deep neural networks) sacrifice interpretability</li>
                <li>Interpretability failures can lead to unsafe outputs: lack of physical constraints in black-box models can produce physically implausible or dangerous predictions (e.g., TrafficGen placing vehicles outside drivable areas)</li>
                <li>Architectural modularity (separating perception, dynamics, and decision-making) improves interpretability by making information flow explicit, even when individual modules are learned</li>
                <li>The interpretability-performance trade-off is domain-dependent: in domains with known physics (robotics), interpretable physics-based models can match or exceed learned models; in complex visual domains, black-box models dominate</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In safety-critical autonomous driving applications, interpretable BEV-based world models with explicit semantic segmentation will be preferred over black-box pixel models even if they achieve 5-10% lower raw prediction accuracy, due to 3-5x faster debugging of failure modes and ability to verify safety constraints</li>
                <li>Hybrid models combining structured latent spaces (e.g., position/velocity decomposition like NewtonianVAE) with learned dynamics will achieve within 5% of black-box performance on robotic manipulation tasks while providing 10x better interpretability as measured by human ability to predict model behavior</li>
                <li>Attention-based interpretability methods in transformer world models will enable identification and debugging of failure modes 3-5x faster than black-box RNN-based models, measured by time-to-fix in development cycles</li>
                <li>Discrete token-based world models (like IRIS with 16-64 tokens/frame) will provide better interpretability than continuous latent models while achieving comparable task performance (within 10% on Atari 100k), enabling enumeration and inspection of predicted futures</li>
                <li>In domains with known physics (e.g., robotic manipulation of rigid objects), physics-constrained interpretable models will match or exceed black-box models in sample efficiency (requiring 20-30% fewer samples) due to better inductive biases</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether interpretability inherently limits model capacity or if it's an artifact of current architectural choices - it's unclear if future architectures could achieve both maximal expressiveness and interpretability simultaneously</li>
                <li>If there exist quantitative interpretability metrics that reliably correlate with model robustness to distribution shift and out-of-distribution generalization across diverse domains</li>
                <li>Whether interpretable models transfer better to novel domains than black-box models of equal performance - the relationship between interpretability and transfer learning is not well understood</li>
                <li>If human-interpretable representations (positions, velocities, semantic concepts) align with optimal representations for AI systems, or if AI-optimal representations are fundamentally alien to human understanding</li>
                <li>Whether the interpretability-performance trade-off changes fundamentally with model scale - it's unknown if very large models (billions of parameters) can achieve interpretability through emergent structure or if they become inherently less interpretable</li>
                <li>If interpretability requirements and methods differ fundamentally between different modalities (vision, language, robotics) or if there are universal principles of interpretable world modeling</li>
                <li>Whether interpretability aids in detecting and preventing reward hacking and specification gaming in RL systems, or if these failure modes are orthogonal to interpretability</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that structured interpretable models consistently match or exceed black-box models across all domains (including complex high-dimensional visual tasks) would challenge the fundamental trade-off and suggest interpretability is always achievable without cost</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that interpretability has no correlation with debugging efficiency, time-to-fix bugs, or developer productivity would question its practical value beyond regulatory compliance</li>
                <li>Showing that interpretable representations consistently harm generalization to novel domains compared to black-box representations would challenge the hypothesis that interpretability aids transfer</li>
                <li>Finding that attention visualizations and other interpretability methods do not help humans predict model failures or understand model behavior better than random guessing would question their utility</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that safety-critical systems with interpretable models have no fewer catastrophic failures than those with black-box models would challenge the safety argument for interpretability</li>
                <li>Showing that the computational overhead of interpretability mechanisms (decoders, attention, uncertainty quantification) scales superlinearly with model size, making interpretability prohibitively expensive for large models</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to quantitatively measure interpretability in a domain-independent way - current methods are largely qualitative or domain-specific (e.g., attention visualization, reconstruction quality) </li>
    <li>The precise relationship between interpretability and model robustness to distribution shift - while intuition suggests interpretable models should be more robust, empirical evidence is mixed </li>
    <li>Whether interpretability requirements and optimal mechanisms change fundamentally with model scale (millions vs billions of parameters) </li>
    <li>The computational cost-benefit analysis of interpretability mechanisms - how much performance/efficiency should be sacrificed for interpretability in different application domains </li>
    <li>How interpretability interacts with model capacity and expressiveness - whether there are fundamental limits on what can be made interpretable </li>
    <li>The relationship between interpretability and uncertainty quantification - whether interpretable models provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates </li>
    <li>Whether interpretability aids in detecting reward hacking, specification gaming, and other alignment failures in RL systems </li>
