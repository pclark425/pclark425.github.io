                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Latent Spaces for Physical Control</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that optimal world models for physical control tasks should employ latent spaces with explicit structure that mirrors the underlying physics and control requirements of the domain. Specifically, the latent representation should be decomposed into interpretable subspaces corresponding to: (1) controllable state factors (directly influenced by actions), (2) uncontrollable environmental factors (evolving independently), (3) geometric/kinematic properties (positions, orientations, velocities), and (4) dynamic/contact properties (forces, momentum, contact states). This structured decomposition enables more efficient learning, better generalization, improved sample efficiency, and enhanced interpretability compared to unstructured latent representations. The structure should incorporate physical inductive biases (conservation laws, symmetries, constraints) and align the latent space geometry with the action space to facilitate control. This approach optimally balances fidelity (through physics-informed structure), interpretability (through meaningful decomposition), computational efficiency (through targeted computation on relevant subspaces), and task-specific utility (through control-aligned representations).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Latent spaces for physical control should be explicitly decomposed into subspaces representing controllable factors (directly influenced by actions) and uncontrollable factors (environmental dynamics), enabling targeted planning and control.</li>
                <li>Geometric properties (positions, orientations, velocities) should occupy separate, interpretable subspaces with appropriate geometric structure (e.g., SO(3) for rotations, R^3 for positions) rather than unstructured vector spaces.</li>
                <li>Dynamic properties (forces, momenta, contact states) should be represented in dedicated subspaces that respect physical constraints such as conservation laws and Newton's laws.</li>
                <li>The latent space should incorporate physical inductive biases including symmetries (translation, rotation, permutation), conservation laws (energy, momentum), and known constraints (kinematic chains, collision avoidance).</li>
                <li>The geometry of the latent space should be aligned with the action space such that similar actions produce similar latent trajectories, facilitating gradient-based control and policy learning.</li>
                <li>Contact-rich manipulation tasks require explicit representation of contact states (binary or continuous contact indicators) and contact forces as distinct latent factors.</li>
                <li>Structured latent spaces should enable compositional generalization by representing objects and their interactions separately, allowing transfer to novel object configurations.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of forward prediction should be allocatable across subspaces, allowing selective high-fidelity computation for task-critical factors (e.g., contact dynamics during grasping) while using lower fidelity for less critical factors.</li>
                <li>Interpretability is achieved through physical meaningfulness: each latent dimension or subspace should correspond to physically interpretable quantities that can be validated against ground truth physics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Physics-informed neural networks that incorporate physical laws as inductive biases show improved sample efficiency and generalization in dynamics modeling </li>
    <li>Disentangled representations that separate independent factors of variation improve generalization and transfer learning </li>
    <li>Structured state representations that separate controllable from uncontrollable factors improve control performance </li>
    <li>Incorporating geometric and symmetry constraints into neural network architectures improves data efficiency in physical reasoning tasks </li>
    <li>Contact-aware representations that explicitly model contact states and forces improve manipulation planning and control </li>
    <li>Hamiltonian and Lagrangian neural networks that preserve energy conservation laws show superior long-term prediction accuracy </li>
    <li>Object-centric representations that decompose scenes into entities improve compositional generalization in physical prediction </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In robotic manipulation tasks, world models with explicit contact state subspaces will achieve 30-50% better sample efficiency compared to unstructured latent representations when learning contact-rich skills like insertion or assembly.</li>
                <li>For multi-object physical reasoning tasks, structured latent spaces with object-centric decomposition will generalize to scenes with 2-3x more objects than seen during training, while unstructured representations will fail.</li>
                <li>In locomotion control, latent spaces that separate center-of-mass dynamics from joint configurations will enable zero-shot transfer of learned policies across robots with different morphologies but similar mass distributions.</li>
                <li>World models with Hamiltonian-structured latent spaces will maintain prediction accuracy over 10x longer time horizons compared to unstructured models in energy-conserving physical systems.</li>
                <li>For dexterous manipulation, explicitly representing controllable (finger positions) versus uncontrollable (object pose under gravity) factors will reduce the dimensionality of the control problem and improve policy learning speed by 40-60%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learned structured latent spaces will spontaneously discover physically meaningful decompositions (e.g., separating kinetic and potential energy) without explicit supervision, or if such structure must be architecturally enforced.</li>
                <li>If there exists an optimal granularity of structural decomposition (e.g., should forces be further decomposed into normal and tangential components, or is a single force vector sufficient) that balances interpretability against model complexity.</li>
                <li>Whether structured latent spaces can effectively handle phase transitions in physical systems (e.g., solid-to-liquid, contact-to-no-contact) or if these require special architectural considerations.</li>
                <li>If the benefits of structured latent spaces scale to very high-dimensional control problems (100+ DOF robots) or if the overhead of maintaining structure becomes prohibitive.</li>
                <li>Whether structured latent spaces enable better sim-to-real transfer by making domain adaptation more interpretable and targeted, or if unstructured representations are equally effective when given sufficient data.</li>
                <li>If human operators can more effectively correct or guide AI systems with structured latent spaces through interpretable interventions on specific physical factors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If unstructured latent representations (e.g., standard VAEs) achieve comparable sample efficiency and generalization to structured representations on physical control benchmarks, the added complexity of structure would not be justified.</li>
                <li>If the computational overhead of maintaining structured decompositions and enforcing physical constraints exceeds the efficiency gains from targeted computation on relevant subspaces.</li>
                <li>If learned structured representations fail to align with ground truth physical quantities (e.g., the 'position' subspace doesn't actually encode positions), undermining interpretability claims.</li>
                <li>If structured latent spaces show worse performance on tasks where the optimal representation is not aligned with physical structure (e.g., tasks requiring abstract reasoning about non-physical properties).</li>
                <li>If the architectural constraints required to enforce structure (e.g., specific network topologies, loss functions) significantly harm the model's ability to fit complex, real-world physical dynamics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The optimal method for learning the decomposition into subspaces (supervised vs. unsupervised, architectural constraints vs. regularization) remains underspecified, and different approaches may be needed for different domains. </li>
    <li>How to handle partial observability where some physical factors are not directly observable but must be inferred, and how this affects the structure of the latent space. </li>
    <li>The interaction between structured latent spaces and different control paradigms (model predictive control, reinforcement learning, trajectory optimization) and whether certain structures are better suited to specific control approaches. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
