                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1289</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Alignment Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that maximally preserves the semantic structure and relationships present in the original graph, aligning the linearized text with the underlying graph semantics. The representation should encode both local and global graph structure in a way that is accessible to the language model, enabling it to reconstruct or reason about the original graph from the text.</p>

    <li>Representations that include both local (e.g., node neighborhoods) and global (e.g., graph motifs, cycles) information enable LMs to perform better on reasoning tasks. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>There may exist a trade-off between semantic fidelity and representation length, with diminishing returns for highly verbose encodings.</li>
                <li>Encoding higher-order graph properties (e.g., cycles, cliques) in text may enable LMs to perform novel forms of graph reasoning not possible with simpler representations.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs trained on semantically aligned representations do not outperform those trained on simple linearizations, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If global structure encoding does not improve reasoning about complex graph properties, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to efficiently encode large or dense graphs without overwhelming the language model. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle ambiguous or lossy mappings between graph and text. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
