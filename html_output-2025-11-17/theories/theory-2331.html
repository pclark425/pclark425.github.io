                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2331</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the convergence of multiple systemic disruptions—genetic, metabolic, vascular, and immune—leading to a breakdown of neural network homeostasis. The interplay between these factors triggers a self-reinforcing cycle of synaptic dysfunction, proteinopathy (amyloid and tau), and neuroinflammation, which together drive cognitive decline. Detection is most effective when it targets the network-level signatures of dysfunction, rather than single biomarkers.</p>
