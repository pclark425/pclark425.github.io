                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1309</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory for Graph-to-Text Conversion</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that maximizes the mutual information between the original graph and the generated text, subject to a constraint on text length or complexity. The theory predicts that optimal representations are those that compress the graph into text just enough to retain all information relevant for downstream tasks, while minimizing redundancy and noise.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Graph-to-text representations that maximize mutual information with the original graph, while minimizing text length, will yield better LM performance than either lossy or overly verbose representations.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>There may exist a non-linear trade-off between information retention and text complexity, with optimal points varying by graph domain.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs trained on maximally informative but longer text do not outperform those trained on compressed or lossy text, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If removing irrelevant information from text does not improve LM generalization, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to measure or estimate mutual information between graphs and text in practice. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to select task-relevant information for compression in multi-task or open-domain settings. </li>
