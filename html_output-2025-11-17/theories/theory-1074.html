                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Pattern Completion via In-Context Learning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models solve spatial puzzle games by leveraging in-context learning to perform pattern completion. When presented with a partially-filled puzzle, the model uses its training on similar patterns to infer likely completions, effectively matching the current context to stored templates or statistical regularities. This process allows the model to 'fill in' missing information by analogy to previously seen examples, rather than by explicit logical deduction.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize to entirely novel spatial puzzle types if the underlying statistical regularities are similar to those seen in training.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on adversarially generated puzzles with misleading patterns, their performance may degrade or show systematic biases.</li>
                <li>LLMs might develop emergent strategies for spatial reasoning if exposed to sufficiently diverse and complex puzzle distributions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can solve spatial puzzles with entirely novel structures not present in training data, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well on rare and common puzzle patterns, this would call into question the reliance on statistical regularities.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can explain their reasoning in terms of explicit logical rules rather than pattern analogy, this would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show limited ability to generalize to puzzles with novel constraints, which is not fully explained by pattern completion. </li>
