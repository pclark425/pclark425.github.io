                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-744</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Statistical Pattern Matching Theory of Arithmetic in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging statistical regularities in the training data, matching input patterns to output patterns without explicit internal computation of arithmetic rules. The model's ability to perform arithmetic is thus a function of the frequency, diversity, and consistency of arithmetic examples in its training corpus, rather than an emergent understanding of mathematical operations.</p>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model can solve arithmetic problems it has never seen in any form, this would challenge the theory.</li>
