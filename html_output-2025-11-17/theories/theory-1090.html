                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit State Tracking and Memory Augmentation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language models can best perform strict logical reasoning when equipped with explicit state tracking and external memory mechanisms that allow them to represent, update, and query logical states throughout multi-step reasoning. The theory posits that strict logical reasoning requires the model to maintain a persistent, manipulable representation of logical variables, premises, and inference steps, which is not natively supported by standard transformer architectures.</p>
