                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1534</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement via Topological Quantum Field Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that by exploiting topological quantum field effects—such as those found in topological insulators, quantum Hall systems, or engineered photonic lattices—it is possible to create robust, large-scale regions of negative energy density. These topologically protected states can be used to confine negative energy in a manner that is less susceptible to decoherence and environmental noise, enabling the construction of stable FTL spacetime geometries.</p>
