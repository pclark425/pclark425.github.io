                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Criteria Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework, integrating criteria such as logical coherence, empirical adequacy, novelty, falsifiability, and ethical considerations. Each dimension is necessary but not sufficient alone; robust evaluation emerges from their intersection. The theory further posits that both quantitative (e.g., statistical fit, predictive accuracy) and qualitative (e.g., explanatory power, ethical acceptability) metrics must be systematically combined, and that LLMs can be used to automate or assist in scoring along these axes.</p>
