                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) can detect anomalies in lists of data by learning the statistical regularities and latent structures of the data domain, and flagging items that deviate significantly from these learned patterns. The LM's internal representations encode both explicit and implicit distributional properties, allowing it to serve as a general-purpose anomaly detector across diverse data types.</p>

                <li>If a language model is trained on lists with adversarially crafted anomalies that mimic the distribution, it may or may not be able to detect them, depending on the model's capacity and training.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>If a language model assigns high likelihood to random or out-of-domain items, the theory's premise about low-probability anomaly detection is undermined.</li>
                <li>If a language model cannot distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution items in a list, the theory is called into question.</li>
