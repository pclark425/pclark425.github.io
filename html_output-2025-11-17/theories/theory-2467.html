                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Stress-Adaptation Network Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the dynamic interplay between intrinsic cellular stress response capacity and extrinsic adaptive support from local glial and vascular networks. Neurons that possess robust intrinsic proteostatic, antioxidant, and repair mechanisms, and are embedded in microenvironments with high glial support and vascular adaptability, are resistant. Conversely, neurons with limited intrinsic defenses and poor extrinsic support are vulnerable.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neurons with high expression of chaperones, antioxidant enzymes, and DNA repair proteins show reduced pathology in AD models. </li>
    <li>Astrocyte and microglial support, as well as robust local blood flow, correlate with neuronal survival in vulnerable regions. </li>
    <li>Experimental upregulation of proteostatic and antioxidant genes in neurons confers resistance to amyloid-β and tau toxicity. </li>
    <li>Regions of the visual cortex with high glial density and vascular adaptability show lower plaque and tangle burden. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has considered intrinsic and extrinsic factors separately, the explicit AND logic and dynamic network adaptation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cell-intrinsic stress response and glial support have been individually implicated in neuronal survival.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law integrates both intrinsic and extrinsic factors as a necessary AND condition, emphasizing their dynamic interplay as the determinant of resistance.</p>
