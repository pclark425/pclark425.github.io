                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit-Environment Interaction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology arises from the interplay between intrinsic circuit properties (such as connectivity, neurotransmitter profile, and firing patterns) and the local microenvironment (including glial support, vascularization, and extracellular matrix composition). The interaction between these factors determines the degree of exposure to toxic protein species, the efficiency of clearance mechanisms, and the resilience to metabolic or proteostatic stress.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing connectivity in a resistant region will render it vulnerable only if glial/vascular support is not simultaneously increased.</li>
                <li>Regions with high glial support but low vascularization may show intermediate vulnerability, suggesting a non-linear interaction.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If regions with high connectivity and low glial/vascular support do not show increased pathology, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If boosting glial or vascular support in vulnerable regions does not confer resistance, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations with low connectivity and high glial support still develop pathology, suggesting additional factors. </li>
