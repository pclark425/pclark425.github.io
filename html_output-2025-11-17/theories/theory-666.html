                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) pretrained on scientific literature in molecular sciences can, when prompted, synthesize interpretable, measurable feature rules (e.g., molecular weight, logP, TPSA, H-bond counts) that are overwhelmingly present in existing literature and statistically significant for downstream predictive modeling. The theory further asserts that these literature-synthesized rules, when transcribed into feature functions and used in interpretable models, enable state-of-the-art predictive performance across diverse molecular property prediction tasks, often surpassing black-box ML baselines. The theory also recognizes that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the quality and coverage of the pretraining corpus, and that LLMs may recite rather than discover if the rules are present verbatim in the training data.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLM4SD pipeline uses Galactica-6.7b to synthesize rules such as molecular weight, logP, TPSA, and H-bond counts, which are overwhelmingly present in literature and statistically significant; interpretable models trained on these features outperform GNN and random forest baselines. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.0" class="evidence-link">[e5980.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.1" class="evidence-link">[e5980.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Galactica-30b, when used in the same pipeline, produced similar types of molecular feature rules and outperformed smaller models in quantum mechanics tasks, indicating that scale and domain-specific pretraining improve the extraction and utility of such rules. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.2" class="evidence-link">[e5980.2]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs for Knowledge Synthesis in Chemistry (Zheng et al. 2023a) and related works demonstrate that LLMs can synthesize literature knowledge, infer from data, and produce interpretable explanations for chemistry tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5879.html#e5879.3" class="evidence-link">[e5879.3]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs (general) are described as being able to synthesize scientific literature, identify patterns/correlations, and propose candidate laws from large corpora, with the caveat that outputs may reflect memorization or recitation if the rules are present in the training data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5878.html#e5878.0" class="evidence-link">[e5878.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs-for-literature-synthesis (general mention) asserts that LLMs can process and comprehend large amounts of scientific literature to extract relevant information and generate coherent hypotheses, enabling accelerated scientific discovery, but notes the risk of recitation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5880.html#e5880.1" class="evidence-link">[e5880.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Galactica's domain probes (chemical reactions & IUPAC) and LaTeX equation probes show that LLMs can extract and generate domain-specific relationships and structured mappings learned from large scientific corpora, though these are not always new discoveries. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5932.html#e5932.1" class="evidence-link">[e5932.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5932.html#e5932.0" class="evidence-link">[e5932.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5937.html#e5937.0" class="evidence-link">[e5937.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs can hallucinate or generate spurious rules, especially when pretraining data is biased or limited, as seen in Galactica's hallucination issues. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5976.html#e5976.4" class="evidence-link">[e5976.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5873.html#e5873.0" class="evidence-link">[e5873.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The approach yields feature-like empirical rules rather than closed-form physical laws; reliance on the LLMs' pretraining corpora (possible memorization); variability with model scale and pretraining domain (Falcon-7b failed some tasks while larger Falcon-40b recovered performance; Galactica scale effects varied by domain); some inferred rules not present in literature may be spurious or dataset-specific. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.0" class="evidence-link">[e5980.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.1" class="evidence-link">[e5980.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.2" class="evidence-link">[e5980.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5980.html#e5980.3" class="evidence-link">[e5980.3]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While feature engineering is established, the LLM-driven, literature-informed, and interpretable modeling paradigm is new and formalized in LLM4SD and related works.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Feature engineering and empirical rule extraction are established in molecular property prediction; LLMs have been used for information extraction and summarization.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The systematic use of LLMs to synthesize, validate, and deploy literature-derived feature rules for interpretable, high-performing molecular property prediction is novel, especially the pipeline that combines LLM-driven rule synthesis, statistical validation, and interpretable modeling.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying the LLM literature-synthesized feature rule approach to new molecular property prediction tasks will yield interpretable models that match or exceed the performance of black-box ML baselines.</li>
                <li>LLMs pretrained on literature in other scientific domains (e.g., materials science, pharmacology) will be able to synthesize analogous feature rules for those domains.</li>
                <li>Increasing the scale and domain-specificity of LLM pretraining will improve the quality and statistical significance of synthesized feature rules.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-synthesized feature rules may reveal previously unrecognized mechanisms or descriptors that lead to new scientific insights in molecular sciences.</li>
                <li>The approach may generalize to cross-domain or interdisciplinary tasks, enabling the discovery of universal feature rules.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize feature rules that are not present in the literature but are nonetheless statistically significant and predictive, potentially leading to novel discoveries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-synthesized feature rules are not statistically significant or do not improve model performance compared to classical feature engineering, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If interpretable models trained on LLM-derived features consistently underperform black-box ML baselines, the theory's claim of superior performance is weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on literature from a domain fail to produce meaningful or predictive feature rules for that domain, the theory's generalizability is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Direct programmatic or symbolic equation discovery from data, as in LLM-SR or SGA frameworks, where LLMs are used to generate executable symbolic equations or code rather than feature rules. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5880.html#e5880.0" class="evidence-link">[e5880.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5881.html#e5881.0" class="evidence-link">[e5881.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5881.html#e5881.1" class="evidence-link">[e5881.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5881.html#e5881.3" class="evidence-link">[e5881.3]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs used for direct extraction of quantitative values or tabulated data from literature (e.g., RAG pipelines, ChatGPT Chemistry Assistant), which do not synthesize feature rules but rather extract structured data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5985.html#e5985.0" class="evidence-link">[e5985.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5877.html#e5877.1" class="evidence-link">[e5877.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs used for hypothesis generation or program search in mathematics (e.g., FunSearch, Romera-Paredes et al.), which are not focused on feature rule synthesis in molecular sciences. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5879.html#e5879.2" class="evidence-link">[e5879.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5881.html#e5881.2" class="evidence-link">[e5881.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5880.html#e5880.3" class="evidence-link">[e5880.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5942.html#e5942.2" class="evidence-link">[e5942.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory formalizes a new, LLM-centric approach to feature rule synthesis in molecular sciences, as exemplified by LLM4SD, which goes beyond traditional feature engineering by leveraging LLMs' internalized literature knowledge.</p>
