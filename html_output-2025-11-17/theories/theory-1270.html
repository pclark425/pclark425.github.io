                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Fidelity Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximizes semantic fidelity: the preservation and explicit encoding of all graph semantics (nodes, edges, attributes, and higher-order structures) in a form that is both interpretable and compositional for language models. The theory asserts that representations which maintain explicit, lossless mappings between graph elements and their textual counterparts enable language models to learn graph-structured reasoning and generalization more effectively.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that explicit, structured graph encodings (e.g., linearized triples, adjacency lists with attributes) improve downstream graph reasoning tasks in LMs. </li>
    <li>Lossy or ambiguous representations (e.g., naive serialization) degrade model performance on tasks requiring structural understanding. </li>
    <li>AMR and RDF triple-based representations have been shown to support semantic parsing and reasoning in NLP tasks. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to prior work on semantic parsing and structured data-to-text, the explicit requirement for lossless, compositional, and general graph representations is a novel, more general principle.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Existing work has shown that explicit representations (e.g., RDF triples, AMR graphs) can improve semantic parsing and reasoning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law generalizes to all graph types and asserts that maximal semantic fidelity is necessary for ideal LM training, not just beneficial.</p>
