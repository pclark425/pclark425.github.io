                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Neuronal Identity Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is primarily determined by intrinsic molecular and physiological properties of the neurons themselves. These properties include gene expression profiles, metabolic rates, synaptic activity patterns, and the presence or absence of specific receptors or transporters that modulate susceptibility to toxic protein aggregation.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with a 'vulnerable' molecular profile remain resistant in vivo, the theory would be challenged.</li>
