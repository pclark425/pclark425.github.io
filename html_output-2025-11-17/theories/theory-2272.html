                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the integrity of LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation is determined by the control and traceability of information flow between generation, evaluation, and dissemination stages. It introduces laws about information leakage, feedback loops, and the propagation of contamination, and predicts that robust information barriers and audit trails are necessary to ensure valid scientific outcomes.</p>
