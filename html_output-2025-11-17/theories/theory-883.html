                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Integration Theory for Task-Solving in LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve robust task-solving by organizing memory into a hierarchy: short-term episodic memory for immediate context, mid-term reflective memory for integrating recent experiences, and long-term abstractive memory for storing generalized schemas. Dynamic interaction between these layers enables both detailed recall and flexible generalization, supporting coherent reasoning and adaptation across tasks.</p>
