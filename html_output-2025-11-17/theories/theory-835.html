                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-835</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Arbitration Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance by employing a hierarchical arbitration mechanism that dynamically allocates memory control between deliberative and programmatic processes. The arbitration is context-sensitive, leveraging meta-cognitive signals (e.g., uncertainty, novelty, or resource usage) to determine when to invoke explicit, goal-driven memory operations versus automatic, rule-based routines. This enables agents to flexibly balance efficiency and adaptability across diverse tasks and environments.</p>
