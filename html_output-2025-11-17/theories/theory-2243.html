                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional, Task-Aligned, and Calibration-Aware Evaluation Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be conducted within a multidimensional space of criteria, where each dimension corresponds to a distinct aspect of scientific value (e.g., explanatory power, novelty, falsifiability, calibration to empirical evidence, and task alignment). The theory asserts that effective evaluation requires explicit alignment of these criteria with the intended scientific task and domain, and that evaluators must account for both the calibration of the LLM's outputs to known scientific standards and the interdependencies among evaluation dimensions.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-dimensional evaluation proves as effective as multidimensional evaluation in identifying high-value LLM-generated theories, the theory's claims are undermined.</li>
                <li>If calibration and task alignment do not improve evaluation outcomes, their status as core axes is called into question.</li>
