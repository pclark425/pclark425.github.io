                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the brain represents conceptual knowledge using multiple representational formats (e.g., symbolic, analogical, sensorimotor, affective), and dynamically arbitrates among them based on a precision-weighted mechanism. The format with the highest estimated precision for a given context dominates conceptual processing, allowing flexible, context-sensitive cognition.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Behavioral and neuroimaging studies show flexible recruitment of symbolic, analogical, and sensorimotor representations depending on task demands and context. </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., Bayesian arbitration) demonstrate that weighting by precision optimizes inference and decision-making. </li>
    <li>Neuropsychological evidence shows that damage to specific representational systems leads to compensatory reliance on alternative formats. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context-dependent format use is known, the precision-weighted arbitration mechanism as a general law is not previously formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multiple representational formats for concepts and context-dependent recruitment are established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formalization of arbitration as a precision-weighted selection mechanism across all formats is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating the reliability (precision) of a representational format (e.g., adding noise to visual input) will shift conceptual processing toward alternative formats (e.g., linguistic).</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will show increased activation in the brain regions associated with the format that has the highest precision in a given context.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training to increase the precision of a non-dominant format (e.g., sensorimotor) will lead to its increased use in conceptual tasks even when other formats are available.</li>
                <li>In ambiguous contexts where no format has high precision, the brain will show increased arbitration-related activity (e.g., in frontoparietal control networks).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing the precision of a format does not increase its dominance in conceptual processing, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the selection of representational formats, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how precision is estimated or learned for each format. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how new representational formats emerge developmentally or evolutionarily. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes known context effects and representational diversity into a new arbitration framework.</p>
