                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Circuit Augmentation Theory of Arithmetic Fine-Tuning (Generalization and Transfer)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the latent circuit augmentation framework to explain how fine-tuned arithmetic circuits in language models can generalize to novel arithmetic tasks and transfer to related domains. It posits that the augmentation of latent circuits during fine-tuning not only improves performance on the trained arithmetic tasks but also creates a substrate for transfer learning, enabling the model to adapt to new symbolic reasoning tasks with minimal additional training.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fine-tuning a language model on arithmetic will improve its performance on related symbolic tasks (e.g., logic, algebra) even without direct training.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Augmented circuits for arithmetic may facilitate transfer to non-symbolic tasks that share structural properties (e.g., pattern completion).</li>
                <li>There may be a limit to transfer: if the new task is too dissimilar, augmented circuits may interfere rather than help.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If fine-tuning on arithmetic does not improve transfer to related symbolic tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models with augmented circuits require as many updates as baseline models to learn new symbolic tasks, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The degree to which transfer occurs may depend on the specific architecture and pretraining data, which is not fully specified by the theory. </li>
