                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Control in Language Model Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, during generate-then-reflect cycles, engage in a form of meta-cognitive control, dynamically allocating computational resources (e.g., attention, depth of reasoning) to subproblems or uncertainties identified during reflection, thereby selectively enhancing answer quality where it is most needed.</p>
