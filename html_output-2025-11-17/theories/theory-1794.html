                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1794</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Knowledge Aggregation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by aggregating latent, distributed knowledge across disparate domains. By synthesizing weak signals, partial results, and underappreciated connections, LLMs can identify areas where the preconditions for discovery are met, even if no single source contains the full answer. The probability assigned by the LLM reflects the degree of latent knowledge convergence.</p>
