                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Mission-Focused Instruction Tuning for Robust Scientific Law Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when iteratively tuned with mission-focused instructions, can progressively refine their extraction of scientific laws from large corpora. The process involves repeated cycles of extraction, evaluation, and re-instruction, allowing the LLM to adapt to new evidence, correct errors, and converge on robust, generalizable theories even in the presence of noisy or incomplete data.</p>
