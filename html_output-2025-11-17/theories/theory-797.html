                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Layer Prioritization Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimize task performance by adaptively prioritizing memory layers (short-term, episodic, semantic, procedural) in real time, based on task phase, uncertainty, and feedback. The prioritization mechanism dynamically shifts attention and computational resources to the most relevant memory type, enabling efficient problem solving, rapid adaptation, and resilience to context shifts.</p>
