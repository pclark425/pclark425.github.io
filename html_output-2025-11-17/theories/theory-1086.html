                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Driven Training Objectives Enable Neural Networks to Internalize Global Spatial Rules</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when neural networks, such as language models, are trained on spatial puzzles with explicit global constraints (e.g., Sudoku), the training objectives drive the models to internalize abstract, global spatial rules. These internalized rules enable the models to reason about spatial relationships and constraints beyond local patterns, supporting generalization to new instances and even to novel spatial tasks with similar underlying structure.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on inductive bias and constraint learning, the focus on global spatial rule internalization and its generalization is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that neural networks can learn to satisfy constraints present in their training data, and that training objectives shape learned representations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit claim that constraint-driven objectives lead to the internalization of abstract, transferable global spatial rules is new.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Models trained on standard Sudoku generalize to larger grids (e.g., 16x16) or to puzzles with similar constraint structures. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends generalization theory to the domain of abstract, global rule transfer in spatial reasoning.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Generalization in neural networks is well-studied, but typically focuses on local or statistical patterns.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The theory emphasizes generalization via internalized abstract global rules, not just pattern recognition.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A model trained on one type of spatial puzzle (e.g., Sudoku) may generalize to structurally different puzzles (e.g., KenKen) if the global constraint logic is similar.</li>
                <li>Internalized global rules may enable models to explain their reasoning or generate human-interpretable constraint representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model trained on Sudoku fails to generalize to larger or differently structured Sudoku puzzles, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If a model does not reject globally invalid solutions in novel puzzles, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain generalization to puzzles with fundamentally different or more complex constraint structures. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
