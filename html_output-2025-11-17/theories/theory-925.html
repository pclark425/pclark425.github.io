                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Abstraction Drives Efficient Exploration and Adaptation in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hierarchical memory—where information is abstracted at multiple levels (e.g., low-level events, mid-level situations, high-level strategies)—can more efficiently explore, adapt, and solve complex text game tasks. Hierarchical abstraction enables the agent to compress experiences, recognize patterns, and transfer high-level strategies across different games, leading to improved sample efficiency and adaptability.</p>
