                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Cognitive Scaffolding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format in which a problem is presented to a large language model (LLM) acts as a form of cognitive scaffolding, shaping the model's internal reasoning trajectory and influencing its ability to decompose, sequence, and solve complex tasks. Structured prompt formats (e.g., stepwise, chain-of-thought, or explicit decomposition) provide external cues that guide the LLM to emulate human-like problem-solving strategies, thereby enhancing performance on tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, abstraction, or error correction.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If a prompt is restructured to explicitly scaffold sub-steps, LLM performance on multi-step tasks will improve compared to an unstructured prompt.</li>
                <li>If a prompt omits scaffolding, LLMs will be more prone to errors in intermediate reasoning steps.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel scaffolding format is introduced (e.g., visual or tabular decomposition), LLMs may show further performance gains or new error patterns.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit scaffolding prompts, they may generalize to self-scaffold even when given unstructured prompts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show improved performance with scaffolded prompts, the scaffolding law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If decomposition in prompts does not reduce error rates or cognitive load, the decomposition-performance law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can solve complex tasks without explicit scaffolding, possibly due to implicit internal representations. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
