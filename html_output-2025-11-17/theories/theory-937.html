                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance Filtering for Efficient LLM Agent Memory Use</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents maximize their effectiveness in text games by employing a contextual relevance filtering mechanism that dynamically selects which memories (actions, observations, facts) are most pertinent to the current decision point. By prioritizing and retrieving only contextually relevant information, the agent avoids memory overload, reduces distraction from irrelevant details, and improves reasoning and planning efficiency.</p>
