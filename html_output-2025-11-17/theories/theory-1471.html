                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Modulation of the Modal–Amodal Continuum</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the position of a concept's representation along the modal–amodal continuum is not fixed, but is dynamically modulated by context, including task demands, prior knowledge, and environmental cues. The brain flexibly shifts the representational format of a concept toward more modal or more amodal instantiations depending on what is most adaptive for the current situation, with hybridization occurring when both types of information are relevant.</p>
