                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2193</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Alignment Theory of LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires alignment across multiple, distinct dimensions—empirical, conceptual, methodological, and communicative. Each dimension represents a necessary but not sufficient condition for acceptance, and misalignment in any dimension can lead to theory rejection. The theory further asserts that these dimensions are not reducible to one another and must be independently assessed to ensure robust evaluation.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In some interdisciplinary or emergent fields, misalignment in one dimension (e.g., methodology) may be tolerated if other dimensions are exceptionally strong.</li>

                <li>If evaluators cannot reliably distinguish between failures in different dimensions, the independence law is questioned.</li>
