                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLM and RL agents for text games that incorporate explicit structured memory modules (e.g., knowledge graphs, belief states, episodic buffers, or hierarchical subgoal stacks) and reasoning mechanisms (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-reflection, ToM inference) are able to overcome partial observability, avoid repetitive or invalid actions, and plan efficiently over long horizons. The combination of structured memory and explicit reasoning is especially critical in environments with sparse rewards, compositional tasks, or multi-agent coordination.</p>
