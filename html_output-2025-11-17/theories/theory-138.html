                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Exploration via Problem Decomposition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how adaptive experimental design works for AI agents operating in unknown environments, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Exploiting known or learned structure in the environment (symmetries, submodularity, hierarchical decomposition, homomorphisms, causal structure) enables dramatically more efficient exploration than treating the environment as an unstructured black box. Agents that identify and leverage structure can aggregate information across equivalent states, focus exploration on representative subspaces, decompose complex exploration problems into simpler subproblems, or use causal reasoning to avoid self-reinforcing failures. The key mechanisms are: (1) symmetry exploitation reduces the effective state space by aggregating data across equivalent states (sample complexity scales with compression factor Φ), (2) submodular structure enables greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees (e.g., 1-1/e for monotone submodular maximization), (3) hierarchical decomposition enables temporal abstraction and credit assignment across multiple timescales, (4) homomorphisms enable planning in abstract spaces with provable regret bounds, (5) causal structure (treating actions as interventions) prevents self-reinforcing belief failures, and (6) learned latent structure (e.g., VAE goal spaces) can provide similar benefits when learned accurately. The effectiveness of structured exploration increases with the degree of structure present and the accuracy of the structural assumptions, but is limited by the computational cost of identifying and exploiting structure.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Exploiting known structure (symmetries, submodularity, hierarchy, causal structure) enables more efficient exploration than unstructured black-box methods, with sample complexity improvements scaling with the degree of structure.</li>
                <li>Symmetry exploitation reduces effective state space by aggregating data across equivalent states, with sample complexity scaling polynomially with the compression factor Φ (e.g., O(Φ^(3/2)) for GAE).</li>
                <li>Submodular objectives enable greedy algorithms with provable approximation guarantees: at least (1-1/e) ≈ 0.63 for monotone submodular maximization, and 1/2 for non-monotone cases.</li>
                <li>Adaptive submodularity (marginal gains nonincreasing with observations) enables lazy evaluation that can reduce computational cost by 4×-40× while maintaining solution quality.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical decomposition enables temporal abstraction and credit assignment across multiple timescales, converting long-horizon sparse-reward problems into sequences of shorter subproblems.</li>
                <li>Homomorphisms enable planning in abstract spaces with provable regret bounds that depend on the abstract space size rather than the original space size.</li>
                <li>Causal structure (treating actions as interventions) prevents self-reinforcing belief failures that occur when agents treat their own actions as informative evidence.</li>
                <li>Learned structure (e.g., learned homomorphisms, learned hierarchies, learned latent goal spaces) can provide similar benefits to known structure if learned accurately, but requires sufficient data and appropriate inductive biases.</li>
                <li>The benefit of structured exploration increases with: (1) the degree of structure present (compression factor, submodularity ratio, hierarchy depth), (2) the accuracy of structural assumptions, and (3) the ratio of structure-exploitation cost to environment interaction cost.</li>
                <li>Misspecified structure can hurt performance if the agent's structural assumptions don't match the true environment, potentially leading to worse performance than unstructured methods.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of identifying and exploiting structure can outweigh the sample-efficiency benefits in some settings, particularly when structure is weak or complex.</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a gridworld with k-fold rotational symmetry, an agent that exploits this symmetry will learn approximately k× faster than an agent that treats each rotation as a separate state, with the speedup increasing with state space size.</li>
                <li>For coverage problems with diminishing returns (submodular), greedy marginal-gain maximization will achieve at least 63% (1-1/e) of optimal coverage, regardless of problem size.</li>
                <li>In hierarchical tasks with clear temporal structure (e.g., multi-room navigation), agents that learn and exploit the hierarchy will achieve exponentially better sample complexity (O(log n) vs O(n)) than flat agents as the number of rooms n increases.</li>
                <li>The advantage of structure exploitation will increase with problem size: for state spaces with compression factor Φ, the sample complexity advantage will scale as O(Φ^(3/2)) for geometric structure.</li>
                <li>In mixed continuous+discrete optimization problems, alternating optimization that exploits the problem structure will find better solutions faster than joint optimization or random search.</li>
                <li>Agents that treat their actions as causal interventions (not evidence) will reliably adapt to the correct environment in multi-hypothesis settings, while naive Bayesian agents will sometimes lock onto incorrect hypotheses.</li>
                <li>In environments with learned latent structure (e.g., VAE goal spaces), exploration performance will approach that of hand-engineered structure as the quality of the learned representation improves.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In environments with approximate or noisy symmetries (e.g., symmetries that hold only approximately or with some probability), whether structure exploitation helps or hurts compared to treating the environment as unstructured depends on the noise level and may have a sharp phase transition.</li>
                <li>For very complex structures (e.g., multiple interacting symmetries and hierarchies, or high-order structure), whether agents can learn and exploit the structure efficiently within reasonable sample budgets is uncertain and may depend critically on the learning algorithm and representation.</li>
                <li>In adversarial settings where an opponent can break or manipulate the structure (e.g., by introducing asymmetries or breaking submodularity), whether structure-exploiting agents are more vulnerable than robust unstructured agents is unclear and may depend on the agent's ability to detect structure violations.</li>
                <li>Whether structure exploitation can be combined with deep neural networks (which learn their own implicit structure) in a way that provides additional benefits beyond what the neural network learns implicitly is an open question with potentially large practical impact.</li>
                <li>In online settings where the structure itself changes over time (e.g., symmetries appear and disappear), whether agents can adapt their structure exploitation strategies quickly enough to maintain benefits is uncertain.</li>
                <li>For problems where multiple types of structure are present simultaneously (e.g., both symmetries and submodularity), whether agents can exploit multiple structures jointly or whether they interfere with each other is not well understood.</li>
                <li>In very high-dimensional spaces where structure exists but is difficult to identify, whether the cost of structure discovery exceeds the benefits of structure exploitation is unclear and may depend on the dimensionality and complexity of the structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding environments where exploiting known structure performs worse than unstructured methods (e.g., due to computational overhead or approximate structure) would challenge the theory's generality and identify important boundary conditions.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the computational cost of identifying and exploiting structure makes these methods slower in wall-clock time than simpler unstructured methods, even when they use fewer environment interactions, would limit practical applicability.</li>
                <li>Showing that in environments with misspecified structure (e.g., assumed symmetries that don't actually hold), structure-exploiting agents perform much worse than robust unstructured agents would reveal important failure modes and the need for structure verification.</li>
                <li>Identifying problem classes where the structure is so weak (e.g., compression factor Φ ≈ 1) that exploitation provides negligible benefits would question when the added complexity is worthwhile.</li>
                <li>Finding cases where learned structure (e.g., learned homomorphisms) consistently fails to provide benefits even with large amounts of training data would challenge the viability of structure learning approaches.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that in problems with multiple interacting structures, attempting to exploit all structures simultaneously performs worse than exploiting a single structure or using unstructured methods would reveal important limitations.</li>
                <li>Showing that structure exploitation makes agents more brittle to distribution shift or non-stationarity compared to unstructured methods would identify important robustness tradeoffs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to automatically discover structure (symmetries, hierarchies, submodularity) from data in a sample-efficient way remains partially open, particularly for complex or high-dimensional structures </li>
    <li>The interaction between learned structure and function approximation in deep RL is not fully understood - it's unclear whether neural networks implicitly learn to exploit structure or whether explicit structure exploitation provides additional benefits </li>
    <li>How to handle approximate or noisy structure that doesn't exactly match the theoretical assumptions is not fully characterized - there may be phase transitions where small amounts of noise destroy the benefits </li>
    <li>The computational complexity of exploiting multiple types of structure simultaneously (e.g., symmetries + submodularity + hierarchy) is not well understood </li>
    <li>How to verify that assumed structure actually holds in the environment, and how to adapt when structure violations are detected, is not fully addressed </li>
    <li>The sample complexity of learning structure (e.g., learning homomorphisms or hierarchies) as a function of structure complexity is not fully characterized </li>
    <li>How structure exploitation interacts with other exploration mechanisms (e.g., curiosity bonuses, posterior sampling) is not fully understood </li>
