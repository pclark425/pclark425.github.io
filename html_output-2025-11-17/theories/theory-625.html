                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally organized along a graded continuum from modal (perceptual, sensorimotor, affective) to amodal (symbolic, propositional, abstract) representations, with most concepts realized as dynamically hybrid structures that flexibly recruit both modal and amodal components depending on context, task demands, and developmental stage. This continuum is not a strict dichotomy but allows for intermediate and composite formats (e.g., conceptual spaces, frames, schemas, grounded symbolic tokens), and the system can shift the balance of modal and amodal activation dynamically.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the continuum and hybridization are recognized, this law is novel in its explicit claim that the system dynamically shifts the modal/amodal balance for each concept depending on context, and that intermediate formats are the norm rather than exceptions.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The modal–amodal continuum and hybridization are discussed in the review and in hybrid hub-and-spoke, dual coding, and conceptual spaces literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the continuum as a dynamic, context-sensitive spectrum, and specifies that most concepts are realized as hybrid structures whose modal/amodal balance is flexibly adjusted in real time.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Dual coding, dual embodied-symbolic, and LASS models show that linguistic/distributional (amodal) and sensorimotor (modal) systems are both activated, with timecourse and task demands determining which dominates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.1" class="evidence-link">[e5156.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.0" class="evidence-link">[e5156.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5208.html#e5208.1" class="evidence-link">[e5208.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Linguistic shortcut hypothesis and symbol interdependency hypothesis show that the system uses amodal shortcuts when possible, but recruits modal simulation when deeper processing is required. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.2" class="evidence-link">[e5156.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5208.html#e5208.2" class="evidence-link">[e5208.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Empirical evidence from property verification, category production, and modality-switching tasks shows that both modal and amodal predictors contribute, and their relative influence shifts with task demands. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5208.html#e5208.1" class="evidence-link">[e5208.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5208.html#e5208.4" class="evidence-link">[e5208.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.0" class="evidence-link">[e5156.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Developmental and cross-domain evidence shows that the modal–amodal balance shifts with age, experience, and domain (e.g., abstract concepts rely more on amodal/linguistic and emotional modalities). <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.5" class="evidence-link">[e5156.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5195.html#e5195.2" class="evidence-link">[e5195.2]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While dynamic hybridization is recognized in some models, this law is novel in its explicit claim that hybridization is the norm and that the system continuously adjusts the modal–amodal balance for each concept and context.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Dynamic hybridization is discussed in dual coding, LASS, and hybrid hub-and-spoke models.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the real-time, context-sensitive adjustment of modal–amodal balance as a core mechanism, and claims that hybridization is the default, not the exception.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neuroimaging and behavioral studies will show that the relative activation of modal and amodal regions during conceptual tasks is continuously modulated by task demands, context, and individual experience.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring rapid, shallow processing will show greater reliance on amodal/distributional representations, while tasks requiring detailed, grounded, or creative processing will show increased modal/sensorimotor activation.</li>
                <li>Abstract concepts will show greater recruitment of linguistic, emotional, and social modalities, while concrete concepts will show more sensorimotor and perceptual activation.</li>
                <li>Developmental studies will reveal a shift from predominantly modal to increasingly hybrid and amodal representations as children acquire language and abstract reasoning skills.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In individuals with atypical development (e.g., autism, language impairment), the modal–amodal balance and hybridization dynamics will differ systematically, leading to distinctive patterns of conceptual processing.</li>
                <li>Cross-linguistic and cross-cultural studies will reveal systematic differences in the modal–amodal balance for abstract concepts, reflecting cultural and linguistic variation in conceptual grounding.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks with explicit hybridization mechanisms will outperform purely modal or amodal models on tasks requiring flexible conceptual generalization and transfer.</li>
                <li>In cases of brain injury affecting either modal or amodal hubs, the system will compensate by shifting the balance to the remaining modality, leading to partial preservation of conceptual function.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If all conceptual tasks can be performed equally well using only modal or only amodal representations, the continuum and hybridization claims would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If neuroimaging fails to show context-dependent shifts in modal–amodal activation, the theory's dynamic adjustment claim would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If abstract concepts can be fully grounded in sensorimotor modalities without any amodal or linguistic contribution, the theory's claim about hybridization for abstraction would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If hybrid and intermediate representational formats (e.g., conceptual spaces, frames) are not found to be functionally relevant or are always reducible to pure modal or amodal forms, the continuum claim would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise mechanisms for integrating and aligning modal and amodal representations in real time are not fully specified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.0" class="evidence-link">[e5156.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.1" class="evidence-link">[e5156.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.3" class="evidence-link">[e5156.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Boundary conditions for the representation of highly abstract, mathematical, or legal concepts remain to be empirically established. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.5" class="evidence-link">[e5156.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5176.html#e5176.4" class="evidence-link">[e5176.4]</a> </li>
