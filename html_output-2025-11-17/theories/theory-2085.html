                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can programmatically distill quantitative laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by hierarchically abstracting, aligning, and synthesizing mathematical relationships, even when these are expressed in diverse forms and contexts. The LLM leverages its semantic understanding to identify, generalize, and unify equations and their underlying principles across heterogeneous sources.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize entirely new, previously unreported quantitative laws by combining partial relationships from multiple sources.</li>
                <li>LLMs could discover higher-order or emergent laws that are not explicitly stated in any single paper.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to align semantically equivalent equations, the resulting synthesized laws will be fragmented or incomplete.</li>
                <li>If LLMs overgeneralize and merge distinct laws, the synthesized equations will be invalid or misleading.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the challenge of extracting equations from non-textual formats (e.g., images, figures). </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how LLMs handle conflicting or contradictory equations across sources. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
