                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1680</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Load and Contextual Fidelity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by the interplay between the cognitive load imposed by the simulation task (i.e., the complexity and depth of reasoning required) and the LLM's ability to maintain high-fidelity context representations over long, multi-step reasoning chains. When the cognitive load of the task exceeds the LLM's effective context window or reasoning depth, simulation accuracy degrades. Conversely, tasks with lower cognitive load or those that can be decomposed into contextually local steps are simulated with higher accuracy.</p>

                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit context-fidelity objectives, they may achieve human-level simulation accuracy on tasks previously considered too complex.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy on tasks with cognitive load far exceeding their context window, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If context-fidelity interventions do not improve simulation accuracy on multi-step tasks, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well on tasks regardless of context window or reasoning chain length, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs sometimes make errors on low-cognitive-load tasks due to other factors (e.g., hallucination, misalignment, spurious correlations). </li>
    <li>Domain-specific knowledge gaps or training data biases can cause errors independent of cognitive load or context fidelity. </li>
