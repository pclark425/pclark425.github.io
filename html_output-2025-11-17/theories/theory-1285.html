                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Abstraction and Multi-Scale Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that ideal graph-to-text representations for LM training should encode graphs at multiple levels of abstraction, capturing both local (node/edge) and global (subgraph, motif, or community) structures. By providing hierarchical and multi-scale information, the representation enables LMs to reason about both fine-grained and coarse-grained graph properties, supporting transfer and generalization across diverse graph domains.</p>
