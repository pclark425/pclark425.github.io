                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory: Representation Compression Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that strict logical reasoning in language models emerges when the model's internal representations achieve a critical level of compression and abstraction, enabling the disentanglement of logical variables and relations. This threshold is reached only when the model is sufficiently large and trained on data with explicit logical structure.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Analysis of LLM activations shows that models capable of logical reasoning have more disentangled, abstract representations of variables and relations. </li>
    <li>Smaller models or those trained on unstructured data have more entangled, less abstract representations and fail at strict logical reasoning. </li>
    <li>Emergent abilities in LLMs are often associated with phase transitions in representation geometry. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work formalizes a representation compression threshold for strict logical reasoning in LLMs.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Representation learning and abstraction are known in deep learning, but not formalized as a threshold for logical reasoning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit compression/abstraction threshold for logical reasoning emergence is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Interventions that increase representation compression (e.g., bottleneck layers, contrastive learning) will improve logical reasoning if above the threshold.</li>
                <li>Models with compressed, disentangled representations will generalize better to novel logical tasks.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be multiple compression thresholds for different logical systems or task complexities.</li>
                <li>Alternative architectures (e.g., graph neural networks) may reach the threshold with less scale.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model with low representation compression can perform strict logical reasoning, the law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing compression does not improve logical reasoning, the law is challenged.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Some models may achieve high compression but still fail at logical reasoning due to other limitations (e.g., optimization, inductive bias). </li>
