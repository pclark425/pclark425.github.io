                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1189</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Representation and Adaptive Modality Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by constructing hierarchical internal representations of chemical space, and by adaptively selecting and weighting input modalities (e.g., text, graphs, properties) based on the complexity and specificity of the application. The theory asserts that hierarchical abstraction and adaptive modality weighting are key mechanisms enabling LLMs to generalize and innovate in chemical design.</p>
