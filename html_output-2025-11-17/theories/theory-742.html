                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> With sufficient scale and training, language models develop internal representations and procedures that approximate algorithmic arithmetic reasoning, enabling them to generalize to novel arithmetic problems beyond memorized patterns. This emergent capability is not explicitly programmed but arises from the model's exposure to diverse data and its architectural capacity.</p>
