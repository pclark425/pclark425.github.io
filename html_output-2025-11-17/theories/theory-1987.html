                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Distillation via Semantic Aggregation in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill qualitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by semantically aggregating and abstracting recurring relational patterns, even when these patterns are distributed across diverse linguistic expressions and domains. The process leverages the LLM's ability to encode, align, and generalize over heterogeneous textual evidence, resulting in the emergence of high-level, human-interpretable laws.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize, synthesize, and generalize information from diverse sources, as seen in multi-document summarization and scientific review generation tasks. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs can extract and restate scientific relationships that are not explicitly stated in any single document. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to work on information extraction and summarization, the focus on emergent law abstraction from distributed, implicit patterns is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown LLMs can summarize and extract information from text, and that they can perform some forms of information synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit claim that LLMs can distill emergent, high-level qualitative laws by aggregating distributed relational patterns across a large, heterogeneous corpus is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to distill entirely novel qualitative laws that have not been explicitly formulated by humans if exposed to sufficient implicit evidence.</li>
                <li>LLMs trained on cross-disciplinary corpora may generate abstract laws that unify concepts across fields (e.g., biology and physics).</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent scientific laws that are not yet recognized by the scientific community.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM fails to generate a qualitative law despite exposure to a large corpus with recurring relational patterns, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only restate explicit statements and cannot abstract over distributed evidence, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently hallucinate or generate incorrect laws despite strong evidence to the contrary, the theory is challenged.</li>
