                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Coordination Theory for LLM Agents: Dynamic Memory Arbitration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically coordinating between multiple memory systems—short-term (context window), episodic (retrieval-augmented), and procedural (external tool or code memory)—through an arbitration mechanism that selects, fuses, or suppresses memories based on task demands, uncertainty, and resource constraints.</p>
