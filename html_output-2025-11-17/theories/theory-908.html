                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Hybrid Memory Architecture Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents in text games achieve optimal performance by employing a hierarchical hybrid memory system, combining fast, contextually-attentive short-term memory with structured, persistent long-term memory. The architecture dynamically allocates, retrieves, and updates information at different abstraction levels, enabling both rapid adaptation to immediate context and robust retention of world knowledge, goals, and strategies.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introducing more than two levels of memory hierarchy (e.g., intermediate-term memory) may further improve performance in highly complex, multi-chapter text games.</li>
                <li>Emergent meta-cognitive strategies (e.g., self-reflection, memory rehearsal) may arise in LLM agents with sufficiently flexible hybrid memory.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical hybrid memory may enable transfer learning between different text game domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with only a single memory module (short-term or long-term) perform equally well as those with hierarchical hybrid memory on complex text games, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If dynamic routing of information does not improve performance or leads to memory fragmentation, the theory's assumptions would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical memory architectures introduce significant computational overhead without performance gains, the theory's practical value would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of memory module size and retrieval latency on real-time agent performance is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of memory consolidation and forgetting mechanisms in LLM agent performance is not explicitly modeled. </li>
