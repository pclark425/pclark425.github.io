                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Spatial Reasoning from Constraint-Driven Language Model Training</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when trained on spatial puzzles with objectives that reward global constraint satisfaction, develop emergent spatial reasoning capabilities. These capabilities allow the models to infer, represent, and manipulate abstract spatial relationships, enabling them to solve puzzles that require understanding of global spatial structure.</p>
