                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM Representation and Prompt-Engineering Theory for Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be systematically leveraged for anomaly detection in lists of data by mapping list items into the LLM's internal representational space and using prompt engineering to elicit judgments or representations that reveal outliers. The theory asserts that LLMs encode both semantic and statistical regularities, and that prompt design can control the model's focus, enabling both qualitative and quantitative anomaly detection across diverse data types.</p>

            <ol>
