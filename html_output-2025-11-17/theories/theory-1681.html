                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1681</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Alignment and Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the formal structure of the scientific subdomain being simulated. When the LLM's learned representations closely match the ontologies, causal structures, and reasoning patterns of the target domain, simulation accuracy is high. Misalignment—due to insufficient domain exposure, ambiguous terminology, or lack of formal structure in training data—leads to systematic errors, hallucinations, or failure to simulate domain-specific phenomena.</p>
