                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Complementarity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that effective problem-solving in text-based games emerges from the complementary strengths of different memory systems working in concert. Specifically, it posits that: (1) Episodic memory provides concrete, context-rich experiences that ground decision-making in specific situations; (2) Semantic memory provides abstract, generalizable knowledge structures that enable reasoning across contexts; (3) Working memory provides temporary integration space where episodic and semantic information are combined for immediate action selection; (4) The complementarity arises because each memory type compensates for the weaknesses of others - episodic memory prevents semantic overgeneralization, semantic memory prevents episodic overfitting, and working memory resolves conflicts between them. The theory predicts that performance is maximized when all three memory types are present and properly balanced, with the optimal balance depending on task characteristics such as novelty, complexity, and similarity to prior experiences.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Performance in text-based games is maximized when episodic, semantic, and working memory systems are all present and properly integrated, compared to using any subset of these systems.</li>
                <li>Episodic memory compensates for semantic memory's tendency toward overgeneralization by providing concrete counterexamples and context-specific details.</li>
                <li>Semantic memory compensates for episodic memory's tendency toward overfitting by providing abstract patterns that generalize across specific experiences.</li>
                <li>Working memory serves as an integration buffer where episodic retrievals and semantic knowledge are combined to generate context-appropriate actions.</li>
                <li>The optimal balance between memory types is task-dependent: novel situations require stronger semantic guidance, familiar situations benefit from episodic recall, and complex situations require larger working memory capacity.</li>
                <li>Conflicts between episodic and semantic memory recommendations are resolved in working memory through a process that weighs contextual similarity (favoring episodic) against pattern generality (favoring semantic).</li>
                <li>Memory system complementarity exhibits diminishing returns: adding a second memory type provides larger performance gains than adding a third, following a logarithmic improvement curve.</li>
                <li>The complementarity effect is strongest in intermediate-complexity tasks; very simple tasks can be solved with semantic memory alone, while very complex tasks may overwhelm working memory integration capacity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Agents using knowledge graphs (semantic) combined with experience replay (episodic) show better transfer to new text game variants than those using either alone, demonstrating complementary benefits. </li>
    <li>Human cognitive research demonstrates that episodic and semantic memory systems have distinct but complementary roles, with episodic memory providing specific details and semantic memory providing general knowledge. </li>
    <li>Working memory capacity in humans predicts performance on complex reasoning tasks by enabling integration of multiple information sources. </li>
    <li>Schema-based memory (semantic) guides retrieval of relevant episodic memories in humans, showing complementary interaction. </li>
    <li>AI agents that combine case-based reasoning (episodic) with rule-based systems (semantic) outperform single-strategy approaches in complex domains. </li>
    <li>Transfer learning in text games is more successful when agents can identify abstract action patterns (semantic) while also recalling specific successful sequences (episodic). </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent with all three memory types (episodic, semantic, working) will outperform agents with only two types on a diverse benchmark of text games with varying complexity and novelty.</li>
                <li>In novel game scenarios, temporarily increasing the weight of semantic memory relative to episodic memory will improve performance compared to fixed weighting.</li>
                <li>Agents with larger working memory capacity will show better performance on games requiring integration of multiple clues or objectives compared to those with limited working memory.</li>
                <li>When episodic and semantic memory provide conflicting action recommendations, the agent's performance will be better if it uses contextual similarity metrics to arbitrate rather than always preferring one memory type.</li>
                <li>Ablating any one memory type will cause larger performance degradation on tasks that specifically stress that memory type's strengths (e.g., removing episodic memory hurts performance most on tasks requiring recall of specific past events).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the optimal ratio of episodic to semantic memory capacity follows a universal constant (e.g., 60:40) or varies systematically with game genre is unknown but would have major implications for memory architecture design.</li>
                <li>Whether working memory integration can be learned end-to-end through reinforcement learning or requires explicit architectural design is uncertain; if it can be learned, this would suggest complementarity emerges naturally from optimization.</li>
                <li>The theory predicts complementarity, but whether there exists a single unified memory system that could achieve the same performance is unknown; if such a system exists, it would challenge the necessity of separate memory types.</li>
                <li>Whether the complementarity effect scales to more than three memory types (e.g., adding procedural memory for skill learning) or exhibits saturation at three types is unknown but would inform memory system design.</li>
                <li>The computational cost-benefit tradeoff of maintaining multiple memory systems versus a single larger system is unclear; if single systems are more efficient, this would challenge the practical value of complementarity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an agent with only semantic memory performs as well as an agent with all three memory types across diverse text games, this would falsify the core complementarity claim.</li>
                <li>If removing working memory integration (forcing the agent to use episodic and semantic memory independently without combination) does not hurt performance, this would undermine the theory's integration mechanism.</li>
                <li>If the optimal balance between memory types does not vary with task characteristics (novelty, complexity, similarity), this would contradict the theory's prediction of task-dependent complementarity.</li>
                <li>If episodic and semantic memory do not compensate for each other's weaknesses (e.g., semantic memory does not reduce episodic overfitting), this would falsify the mutual compensation claim.</li>
                <li>If performance improvements from adding memory types are additive rather than complementary (i.e., no interaction effects), this would suggest independence rather than complementarity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the exact computational mechanisms for resolving conflicts between episodic and semantic memory in working memory. </li>
    <li>The computational and memory storage costs of maintaining multiple memory systems are not addressed, which could be prohibitive in resource-constrained settings. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain how memory systems should be initialized when an agent first encounters a completely new game domain with no prior knowledge. </li>
    <li>The temporal dynamics of how complementarity changes during learning (e.g., early vs. late in training) are not specified. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle cases where working memory capacity is exceeded and integration cannot be completed. </li>
