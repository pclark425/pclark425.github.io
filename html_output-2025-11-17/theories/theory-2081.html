                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly papers, can programmatically abstract and synthesize quantitative laws by identifying recurring semantic-relational patterns and mapping them to mathematical expressions. The process is mediated by the LLM's ability to align natural language statements with symbolic representations, enabling the distillation of generalizable equations from heterogeneous textual evidence.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to extract structured information and relationships from unstructured text, including scientific literature. </li>
    <li>Recent work shows LLMs can generate symbolic expressions from textual descriptions (e.g., 'force equals mass times acceleration' to F=ma). </li>
    <li>LLMs trained on scientific corpora can identify and align variable names, units, and relationships across diverse papers. </li>
    <li>Natural language processing (NLP) systems have been used to extract chemical reaction equations and physical laws from text. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to information extraction and symbolic regression, the explicit mapping from semantic-relational patterns in text to equations by LLMs is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown LLMs can extract entities and relations from text, and some symbolic regression systems can find equations from data.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that LLMs can programmatically abstract semantic-relational patterns from natural language and map them to equations at scale, not just extract facts.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to iteratively improve outputs based on feedback, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is used to refine model outputs. </li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to reconstruct well-known equations from a corpus where those equations are described in natural language, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate equations that are consistently inconsistent with the corpus or known empirical data, the theory's assumptions about semantic-relational mapping would be undermined.</li>
