                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that hybrid memory architectures in LLM agents, which combine episodic traces with semantic abstraction, enable agents to compress and hierarchically organize experiences. This supports the formation of reusable knowledge structures, allowing for efficient generalization across tasks and environments in text games.</p>
