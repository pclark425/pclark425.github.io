                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively generate, test, and refine candidate quantitative laws by cross-referencing and reasoning over multiple scholarly documents, using internal consistency checks, citation networks, and statistical validation to converge on robust, generalizable laws.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to perform multi-step reasoning and update hypotheses based on new evidence, as seen in chain-of-thought prompting and multi-document QA. </li>
    <li>Cross-document validation and refinement is a known approach in meta-analysis and systematic review, which LLMs can emulate at scale. </li>
    <li>Recent LLMs can synthesize information from multiple sources and update outputs based on new or conflicting evidence. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to iteratively improve their answers by incorporating feedback or additional context. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing scientific and meta-analytic methods, but its application to autonomous LLM-driven law discovery is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Iterative hypothesis refinement is a core principle in scientific reasoning and meta-analysis.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the ability of LLMs to autonomously perform this process at scale, using cross-document reasoning to refine quantitative laws.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Citation analysis is a standard method for assessing the reliability and consensus of scientific claims. </li>
    <li>LLMs can process citation graphs and use them to weight evidence, as shown in recent work on scientific knowledge graph construction. </li>
    <li>Highly cited papers are more likely to represent scientific consensus or robust findings. </li>
    <li>Automated systems have been developed to use citation networks for ranking and validating scientific claims. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing citation analysis, but its application to LLM-driven law validation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Citation analysis and network-based validation are established in scientometrics and meta-research.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law extends this to LLM-driven, automated confidence assignment for candidate quantitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will be able to improve the accuracy of distilled quantitative laws by iteratively cross-referencing new papers and updating their hypotheses.</li>
                <li>LLMs will assign higher confidence to laws that are supported by highly cited or widely referenced papers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to identify and resolve conflicting quantitative laws in the literature by weighting evidence and proposing reconciliatory models.</li>
                <li>LLMs could autonomously discover previously overlooked but robust quantitative laws by leveraging under-cited but internally consistent papers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve law accuracy with iterative cross-document reasoning, the theory's core mechanism is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot use citation networks to assign confidence or fail to distinguish between well-supported and poorly supported laws, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of citation bias and echo chambers on LLM-driven law validation is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
