                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Loop Theory of LLM Self-Improvement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can instantiate a meta-cognitive loop, analogous to human metacognition, in which the model alternates between generating candidate outputs and evaluating them using internalized criteria for quality, consistency, and factuality. The loop enables the model to simulate an internal dialogue, where each iteration refines the output by integrating feedback from previous self-evaluations, leading to emergent self-improvement even in the absence of external supervision.</p>

    <li>LLMs can be prompted to critique outputs using explicit or implicit criteria, and can revise outputs to better align with these criteria. </li>
