                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries is fundamentally determined by the degree of epistemic alignment between the LLM's internal knowledge representations and the evolving structure of the scientific community's beliefs, incentives, and discourse. The more closely the LLM's learned representations mirror the latent structure of scientific consensus formation, debate, and uncertainty, the more accurate its probability estimates for future discoveries will be.</p>
