                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Compression and Abstraction Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents in text games should employ adaptive memory compression and abstraction mechanisms, distilling raw observations and experiences into higher-level, task-relevant representations. This process enables efficient use of limited context windows and supports generalization across similar game scenarios.</p>
