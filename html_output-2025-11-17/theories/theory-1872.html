                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1872</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Socio-Scientific Signal Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs' ability to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries is enhanced by their capacity to integrate not only technical scientific knowledge, but also social, economic, and institutional signals embedded in their training data. These signals—such as funding trends, publication rates, and public interest—modulate the likelihood of scientific breakthroughs and are implicitly modeled by LLMs.</p>
