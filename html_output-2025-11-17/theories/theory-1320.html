                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the process of self-reflection in language models acts as an internal alignment mechanism, whereby the model's outputs are iteratively brought into closer agreement with external standards (such as correctness, coherence, or user intent) through self-evaluation and targeted revision. The reflection step serves to align the model's internal representations and output distributions with desired objectives, even in the absence of explicit external feedback.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Reflection cycles that explicitly target alignment criteria (e.g., factuality, politeness) will result in outputs that are measurably closer to those criteria.</li>
                <li>The diversity of errors in outputs will decrease with each reflection cycle, as the model converges on more aligned responses.</li>
                <li>If a model is prompted to reflect on its own biases, subsequent outputs will show reduced bias according to the reflection criteria.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection prompts are adversarial or misaligned, the model's outputs may shift away from desired standards, potentially amplifying biases or errors.</li>
                <li>Reflection-induced alignment may generalize to new, unseen tasks if the reflection criteria are sufficiently abstract.</li>
                <li>There may be diminishing returns or even negative effects after a certain number of reflection cycles, depending on the model's capacity and the nature of the task.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection cycles do not result in outputs that are more aligned with external standards, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the output distribution does not shift measurably after multiple reflection cycles, the law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection leads to increased error rates or incoherence, the theory's assumptions would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection prompts are ambiguous or poorly designed, leading to no improvement or even degradation in alignment. </li>
    <li>Tasks where external standards are ill-defined or subjective, making alignment difficult to measure. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
