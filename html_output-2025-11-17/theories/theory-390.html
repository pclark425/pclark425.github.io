                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Fabrication-Validation Gap Theory (Revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in automated scientific discovery systems, there exists a systematic asymmetry between the system's capacity to generate/fabricate novel scientific claims and its capacity to validate those claims. This asymmetry is architectural and domain-dependent rather than fundamental, manifesting in three distinct forms: (1) Implementation Gap - between code/protocol generation and executable validation, (2) Conceptual Gap - between hypothesis generation and logical/theoretical verification, and (3) Empirical Gap - between prediction generation and experimental confirmation. The gap size is determined by three primary factors: novelty level (N), system architecture quality (A), and domain formalization (D). Generation capabilities scale with pattern recognition and extrapolation from training data, allowing systems to produce increasingly novel outputs. Validation capabilities depend on: (1) precedent-based comparison (which decays with novelty), (2) formal verification methods (available in formal domains), (3) empirical ground truth (costly for novel claims), and (4) architectural validation infrastructure (designable and non-decaying). The critical insight is that the gap is not an inherent limitation but an architectural choice: systems with dedicated validation modules, formal verification capabilities, closed-loop experimental feedback, or strategic human-AI collaboration can substantially reduce or eliminate the gap even for highly novel outputs. However, without such architectural investments, the gap widens systematically with novelty. The gap manifests as: systems generating plausible-seeming claims without epistemic tools to assess validity; higher validation failure rates for novel discoveries in poorly-architected systems; reliance on surface-level plausibility checks rather than deep validity assessment; systematic implementation failures preventing validation attempts; and false positive rates that increase with novelty in systems lacking validation infrastructure. The theory predicts that validation computational costs exceed generation costs and increase with novelty, but this asymmetry can be managed through efficient validation infrastructure design.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The fabrication-validation gap G for a discovery is determined by three primary factors: novelty level N, system architecture quality A, and domain formalization D, expressed as G(N,A,D) = F(N) - V(N,A,D), where the gap is architectural and domain-dependent rather than fundamental.</li>
                <li>For poorly-architected systems (low A) in informal domains (low D): incremental discoveries show F(N_low) ≈ V(N_low,A,D) resulting in small gaps, while transformational discoveries show F(N_high) >> V(N_high,A,D) resulting in large gaps.</li>
                <li>For well-architected systems (high A) or formal domains (high D): the gap can be substantially reduced or eliminated even for high novelty, with V(N,A_high,D) approaching or matching F(N) through dedicated validation infrastructure.</li>
                <li>The gap manifests in three distinct, partially independent forms: (1) Implementation Gap - between code/protocol generation and executable validation, (2) Conceptual Gap - between hypothesis generation and logical/theoretical verification, (3) Empirical Gap - between prediction generation and experimental confirmation. Each requires different mitigation strategies.</li>
                <li>Fabrication capability F(N) scales approximately linearly with novelty through pattern recognition, extrapolation, and recombination from training data: F(N) ≈ F₀ + α·N, where α > 0 represents the system's ability to generate increasingly novel outputs.</li>
                <li>Validation capability V(N,A,D) has two components - precedent-based validation that decays with novelty, and architectural validation infrastructure that doesn't decay: V(N,A,D) ≈ V_precedent(N,D) + V_infra(A), where V_precedent(N,D) ≈ (D·V₀)·e^(-β·N) with β > 0, and V_infra(A) ≈ A·V_arch represents designable validation infrastructure.</li>
                <li>For poorly-architected systems, the gap grows approximately linearly with novelty: G(N,A_low,D_low) ≈ F₀ + α·N - V₀·e^(-β·N) ≈ F₀ + α·N for large N, as precedent-based validation becomes negligible.</li>
                <li>For well-architected systems, the gap can remain bounded or even decrease: G(N,A_high,D_high) ≈ F₀ + α·N - (D·V₀·e^(-β·N) + A·V_arch), where V_arch can be designed to match or exceed F₀ + α·N through dedicated validation modules.</li>
                <li>Systems produce higher false positive rates (invalid discoveries marked valid) for transformational discoveries when validation infrastructure is weak (low A), but this can be mitigated through dedicated validators, formal verification, or closed-loop experimental feedback.</li>
                <li>Implementation reliability constitutes a distinct validation bottleneck: systems may generate conceptually valid ideas but fail at implementation (code execution, protocol execution), creating an implementation-specific gap G_impl that can dominate total gap size. Observed implementation failure rates range from 50-75% in poorly-architected systems.</li>
                <li>Validation computational cost ratio to generation increases with novelty: Cost_ratio(N) = C_val(N)/C_gen(N), where C_val grows faster than C_gen as N increases. Observed ratios range from 10× to 1000× for experimental validation, but can be reduced through efficient validation infrastructure.</li>
                <li>Human-AI hybrid systems with strategic human placement at validation bottlenecks achieve V(N,A_hybrid) >> V(N,A_auto), substantially reducing the gap. Observed improvements range from 2-10× in validated discovery rates when humans are placed at validation rather than generation stages.</li>
                <li>Domain formalization D acts as a multiplier on precedent-based validation capability: formal domains (mathematics, protein structure with experimental validation) enable stronger validation through formal verification or integrated experimental pipelines, while informal domains rely more on costly empirical validation. Observed gap size differences between formal and informal domains range from 5-10×.</li>
                <li>Cross-domain validation methods show severe performance degradation: validation tools calibrated to one domain show 2-10× worse performance on other domains. Observed example: HD metric AUROC dropped from 0.851 (in-domain) to 0.395 (cross-domain).</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning systems to optimize validation metrics creates a novelty-feasibility tradeoff: systems show negative correlations (r ≈ -0.4 to -0.7) between novelty and feasibility scores, as optimization for validation reduces generation of novel outputs.</li>
                <li>Multi-stage validation filtering shows exponential drop-off in success rates: each validation stage (design → implementation → execution) filters 50-80% of candidates, with final validated rates being 0.1-5% of initial generation rates for novel discoveries in poorly-architected systems.</li>
                <li>The gap can exhibit non-monotonic patterns in specific contexts: some systems show higher validation success for moderately novel (Level-2) tasks than for constrained (Level-1) tasks when the constraints are misaligned with system capabilities, but this doesn't contradict the general trend of degradation at high novelty.</li>
                <li>Validation infrastructure standardization is a critical factor: lack of standardized calibration, reproducibility protocols, and evaluation frameworks contributes significantly to the gap beyond algorithmic limitations. Systems with standardized validation infrastructure show 2-5× better validation reliability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multiple systems demonstrate the core generation-validation asymmetry across implementation, conceptual, and empirical dimensions: MLGym agents achieve baseline improvements but rarely generate novel algorithms with 75% evaluation errors; PaperBench shows 1.8% execution and 0.7% result matching despite code generation capability; AI-Researcher achieves 93.8% implementation completeness but only 2.65/5 correctness; and 100% of AI-generated papers in simulated peer review showed experimental weaknesses. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2172.html#e2172.0" class="evidence-link">[e2172.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2172.html#e2172.2" class="evidence-link">[e2172.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2171.html#e2171.6" class="evidence-link">[e2171.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2171.html#e2171.7" class="evidence-link">[e2171.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2180.html#e2180.8" class="evidence-link">[e2180.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2157.html#e2157.0" class="evidence-link">[e2157.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2175.html#e2175.7" class="evidence-link">[e2175.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2175.html#e2175.0" class="evidence-link">[e2175.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Progressive validation filtering quantitatively demonstrates the gap: EXP-Bench shows accuracy dropping from 20.6% (initial monitor) to 3.7% (design+conclusion) to 0.4% (implementation) to 0.2% (execution validation), revealing that generation plausibility far exceeds validated correctness in multi-stage evaluation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2162.html#e2162.0" class="evidence-link">[e2162.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Novelty consistently degrades validation performance across diverse systems and domains: DeepSeek-R1 produces higher novelty but lower validation success compared to GPT-4o; reasoning LLMs show 'overthinking' with reduced external tool use on novel tasks; BAIS-SD shows GPT-4o achieving only 0.220 accuracy versus 0.762 for human experts on novel single-cell discovery tasks; ProcessBench shows PRMs failing to generalize to harder out-of-distribution problems. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2152.html#e2152.3" class="evidence-link">[e2152.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2180.html#e2180.4" class="evidence-link">[e2180.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2180.html#e2180.5" class="evidence-link">[e2180.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2171.html#e2171.4" class="evidence-link">[e2171.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2156.html#e2156.5" class="evidence-link">[e2156.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2166.html#e2166.9" class="evidence-link">[e2166.9]</a> </li>
    <li>Validation computational costs systematically exceed generation costs and increase with novelty: self-driving labs face reproducibility and calibration challenges despite >100× data acquisition efficiency; wet-lab validation creates throughput bottlenecks in Virtual Lab and SAMPLE; DeepScientist implementation attempts cost ~$20 and 1 GPU-hour each with ~60% failure rate; validation-to-generation cost ratios increase with task complexity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2146.html#e2146.1" class="evidence-link">[e2146.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.7" class="evidence-link">[e2176.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.6" class="evidence-link">[e2176.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2174.html#e2174.3" class="evidence-link">[e2174.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.5" class="evidence-link">[e2176.5]</a> </li>
    <li>False positive patterns emerge systematically in validation processes: LLM judges show leniency and score inflation when human references are absent; implementation errors account for ~60% of DeepScientist failures; automated evaluators overestimate outputs in autonomous settings; GPT-4o achieved near-random AUROC (~0.5) for novelty judgment without retrieval augmentation; AI-text detectors can be evaded by paraphrasing. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2149.html#e2149.5" class="evidence-link">[e2149.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2174.html#e2174.3" class="evidence-link">[e2174.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2163.html#e2163.8" class="evidence-link">[e2163.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2149.html#e2149.1" class="evidence-link">[e2149.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2173.html#e2173.7" class="evidence-link">[e2173.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain formalization strongly affects gap size, confirming special-case predictions: AlphaFold achieved breakthrough validated predictions in protein structure (formal domain with experimental validation); A-Lab synthesized 41 novel materials in 17 days with integrated robotic validation; in contrast, generative imaging models show large gaps for novel scientific outputs; cross-domain validation metrics show dramatic performance drops (HD metric: 0.851 AUROC in-domain, 0.395 cross-domain). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2171.html#e2171.10" class="evidence-link">[e2171.10]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2171.html#e2171.11" class="evidence-link">[e2171.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2151.html#e2151.0" class="evidence-link">[e2151.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2151.html#e2151.5" class="evidence-link">[e2151.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2151.html#e2151.4" class="evidence-link">[e2151.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2163.html#e2163.4" class="evidence-link">[e2163.4]</a> </li>
    <li>System architecture quality dramatically affects gap size independent of novelty: Curie achieves 3.4× improvement in validated answers with dedicated Intra-ARM and Inter-ARM validators; NOVELSEEK shows measurable performance gains with Assessment Agent and adaptive evolution; ELISE with custom Matsu parser achieves better extraction stability and traceability; however, all systems still show some degradation on highly complex or novel tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2148.html#e2148.0" class="evidence-link">[e2148.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2148.html#e2148.2" class="evidence-link">[e2148.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2148.html#e2148.3" class="evidence-link">[e2148.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2153.html#e2153.0" class="evidence-link">[e2153.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2153.html#e2153.2" class="evidence-link">[e2153.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2149.html#e2149.0" class="evidence-link">[e2149.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2149.html#e2149.7" class="evidence-link">[e2149.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Implementation reliability constitutes a distinct validation bottleneck separate from conceptual validation: ~60% of DeepScientist failures were implementation-level errors rather than conceptual flaws; reasoning LLMs show 'overthinking' behavior with reduced tool use leading to implementation failures; ~75% of MLGym terminations are evaluation errors from invalid submissions; code generation systems show higher comprehension than execution success. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2174.html#e2174.3" class="evidence-link">[e2174.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2180.html#e2180.4" class="evidence-link">[e2180.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2172.html#e2172.0" class="evidence-link">[e2172.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2180.html#e2180.2" class="evidence-link">[e2180.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2162.html#e2162.0" class="evidence-link">[e2162.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Human-AI hybrid systems with strategic human placement at validation bottlenecks show substantial gap reduction: AI co-scientist achieves validated drug repurposing and target discoveries through multi-stage validation (tournaments, Reflection agents) plus human oversight and wet-lab validation; IRIS with human verification of Review Agent feedback reduces reward-hacking; Curie with human implementation alignment checks improves validation; successful systems place humans at validation rather than generation stages. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2169.html#e2169.0" class="evidence-link">[e2169.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2169.html#e2169.11" class="evidence-link">[e2169.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2164.html#e2164.6" class="evidence-link">[e2164.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2165.html#e2165.3" class="evidence-link">[e2165.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2164.html#e2164.1" class="evidence-link">[e2164.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2148.html#e2148.0" class="evidence-link">[e2148.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Retrieval-augmentation and knowledge-grounding reduce but don't eliminate the gap: RAG improves factual grounding and reduces hallucinations for literature-covered claims; ELISE's retrieval strategies improve alignment with human references; however, these methods cannot validate truly novel discoveries outside retrieved corpora, and performance degrades with sparse literature coverage or out-of-distribution queries. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2149.html#e2149.6" class="evidence-link">[e2149.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.1" class="evidence-link">[e2176.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2178.html#e2178.1" class="evidence-link">[e2178.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2170.html#e2170.2" class="evidence-link">[e2170.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2164.html#e2164.5" class="evidence-link">[e2164.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2149.html#e2149.0" class="evidence-link">[e2149.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Closed-loop experimental systems minimize gaps through direct empirical testing but face scalability limits: SAMPLE achieves validated thermostable enzyme discoveries through design-build-test-learn loops; BioDiscoveryAgent shows improved hit-rates with closed-loop perturbation experiments; however, validation throughput remains limited by experimental costs and human oversight is still required for interpretation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.6" class="evidence-link">[e2176.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.5" class="evidence-link">[e2176.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2167.html#e2167.8" class="evidence-link">[e2167.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2176.html#e2176.7" class="evidence-link">[e2176.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Fine-tuning demonstrates a novelty-feasibility tradeoff: LLaMA-8B-FT improved alignment (IAScore 0.2781→0.6746) and feasibility scores but reduced novelty and distinctiveness; similar patterns observed in other systems where optimizing for validation metrics reduces generation of novel outputs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2168.html#e2168.0" class="evidence-link">[e2168.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2173.html#e2173.4" class="evidence-link">[e2173.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Validation infrastructure standardization and quality are critical factors: self-driving labs face reproducibility challenges due to instrument heterogeneity and lack of standardized calibration; benchmarks reveal need for standardized evaluation protocols; lack of validation infrastructure contributes significantly to the gap beyond fundamental algorithmic limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2146.html#e2146.1" class="evidence-link">[e2146.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2155.html#e2155.5" class="evidence-link">[e2155.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2162.html#e2162.0" class="evidence-link">[e2162.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2150.html#e2150.0" class="evidence-link">[e2150.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Process supervision and verifier-based approaches improve validation for in-distribution tasks but show limited generalization: Marco-o1, SCoRe, and similar methods strengthen reasoning and reduce hallucinations; however, verifiers trained on existing process traces poorly generalize to novel reasoning styles, and computational costs are high. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2167.html#e2167.6" class="evidence-link">[e2167.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2166.html#e2166.9" class="evidence-link">[e2166.9]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2166.html#e2166.8" class="evidence-link">[e2166.8]</a> </li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Automated discovery systems with dedicated validation modules (integrated theorem provers, execution validators, reproducibility checkers) will show 2-5× lower false positive rates on transformational discoveries compared to systems without such modules, with the improvement being larger for implementation gaps than conceptual gaps.</li>
                <li>The implementation gap will be 2-3× larger than the conceptual gap for code-generation systems: systems will show 40-60% success at generating plausible code descriptions but only 10-30% success at producing executable, correct implementations for novel tasks.</li>
                <li>Human-AI hybrid systems with humans placed at validation bottlenecks (rather than generation stages) will outperform fully automated systems by 3-10× on validated novel discovery rates, with larger improvements in informal domains than formal domains.</li>
                <li>Systems operating in formal domains (mathematics, formal verification, protein structure with experimental validation) will show gaps 5-10× smaller than systems in informal domains (biology without experimental validation, social sciences) at equivalent novelty levels.</li>
                <li>Closed-loop experimental systems (with integrated robotic validation) will show 2-4× higher validated discovery rates than open-loop systems (generation without automated experimental feedback) in empirical sciences, but will face 10-100× higher per-discovery costs.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning systems to optimize validation metrics will reduce novelty of generated outputs with correlation coefficients of -0.4 to -0.7 between novelty and feasibility scores, creating a fundamental tradeoff that requires explicit management.</li>
                <li>Multi-stage validation filtering (design → implementation → execution) will show exponential drop-off with each stage filtering 50-80% of candidates: systems starting with 1000 generated ideas will end with 1-50 validated discoveries for novel tasks.</li>
                <li>RAG-augmented systems will show 2-3× better validation performance on literature-covered claims but no improvement (or even degradation due to retrieval noise) on truly novel claims outside the retrieval corpus, with performance depending critically on corpus coverage.</li>
                <li>Cross-domain transfer of validation methods will show 2-10× performance degradation: a validation system achieving 80% accuracy in its training domain will achieve only 8-40% accuracy when applied to a different domain without retraining.</li>
                <li>Systems with standardized validation infrastructure will show 2-5× better reproducibility and 1.5-3× better validation reliability compared to systems with ad-hoc validation, with larger improvements for empirical gaps than conceptual gaps.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether meta-learning approaches that explicitly train on validation tasks (learning to validate rather than learning to generate) could close the gap for novel discoveries to within 10% of generation capability, or whether they inherit the same architectural limitations and show similar degradation patterns.</li>
                <li>Whether the gap represents a fundamental computational complexity barrier (validation being inherently harder than generation in the P vs NP sense) or purely an architectural/training limitation that could be overcome with sufficient resources, and whether this differs by gap type (implementation vs conceptual vs empirical).</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial training specifically targeting the fabrication-validation gap (training systems to detect their own invalid outputs) could reduce false positive rates to below 5% even for highly novel outputs, or whether adversaries would simply shift to more subtle fabrications that maintain the gap.</li>
                <li>Whether quantum computing or other novel computational paradigms could enable validation methods that scale polynomially rather than exponentially with novelty, fundamentally changing the gap dynamics and making V(N) ≈ F(N) achievable for all N.</li>
                <li>Whether the gap could be exploited as a systematic security vulnerability: adversarial actors deliberately generating high-novelty false discoveries that automated systems cannot validate, creating misinformation at scale with false positive rates exceeding 50%.</li>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal architecture A* that achieves V(N,A*,D) = F(N) for all N in a given domain, or whether some irreducible gap always remains for sufficiently high novelty (N > N_critical) regardless of architecture quality.</li>
                <li>Whether the three gap types (implementation, conceptual, empirical) can be independently optimized, or whether they are fundamentally coupled such that improving one by factor X necessarily degrades another by factor Y, with X·Y ≈ constant.</li>
                <li>Whether human-AI hybrid systems could achieve super-human validation rates (validating discoveries humans alone could not validate within reasonable time/cost) through complementary capabilities, or whether human involvement merely brings validation to human-level as an upper bound.</li>
                <li>Whether the gap dynamics differ fundamentally for different types of novelty (conceptual vs empirical vs methodological), requiring completely different mitigation strategies, or whether a unified architectural approach can address all novelty types with similar effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Whether standardization of validation infrastructure across the scientific community could reduce the gap globally by 5-10×, or whether domain-specific customization is necessary and standardization would be counterproductive, reducing validation quality by forcing inappropriate methods.</li>
                <li>Whether the non-monotonic patterns observed in some systems (higher validation for moderately novel tasks) represent a general phenomenon that could be exploited to design systems with inverted gap dynamics, or whether they are artifacts of specific architectural choices.</li>
                <li>Whether the novelty-feasibility tradeoff is fundamental (Pareto frontier) or can be overcome through architectural innovations that achieve both high novelty and high feasibility simultaneously, breaking the observed negative correlation.</li>
                <li>Whether validation infrastructure investment shows diminishing returns (logarithmic improvement with linear investment) or threshold effects (sudden improvements at critical investment levels), and what the optimal investment level is for different domains and novelty ranges.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding automated systems that show equal or better validation accuracy for transformational discoveries compared to incremental discoveries without any dedicated validation infrastructure (low A) would contradict the novelty-dependent gap hypothesis for poorly-architected systems.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that generation and validation capabilities scale identically with discovery novelty across multiple domains and architecture types would undermine the fundamental asymmetry claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that false positive rates remain constant or decrease with discovery novelty in poorly-architected systems (low A) across multiple domains would challenge the theory's core predictions about validation degradation.</li>
                <li>Finding that minimal architectural enhancements (e.g., adding basic validation checks with A increasing by <20%) completely eliminate the gap for all novelty levels would suggest the gap is trivial rather than systematic and architectural.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that systems can reliably self-assess the validity of their transformational discoveries without any external validation infrastructure, human oversight, or formal verification would contradict the validation deficit hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Finding that domain formalization has no effect on gap size (formal and informal domains show identical gaps at equivalent architecture quality) would challenge the domain-dependence claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that human-AI hybrid systems perform no better than fully automated systems at validation when humans are placed at validation bottlenecks would contradict the strategic human placement hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the three gap types (implementation, conceptual, empirical) are actually manifestations of a single underlying gap with identical dynamics and mitigation strategies would challenge the multi-gap framework.</li>
                <li>Finding that validation costs scale identically or more favorably than generation costs with novelty (Cost_ratio(N) ≤ 1 for all N) would undermine the computational asymmetry claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that cross-domain validation methods perform equally well across all domains (no performance degradation) would contradict the domain-specificity of validation tools.</li>
                <li>Finding that fine-tuning for validation metrics increases rather than decreases novelty (positive correlation) would contradict the novelty-feasibility tradeoff prediction.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that multi-stage validation filtering shows constant or increasing success rates at each stage (no exponential drop-off) would challenge the progressive filtering prediction.</li>
                <li>Finding that validation infrastructure standardization reduces validation quality or reliability would contradict the standardization benefit prediction.</li>

    "theory_name": "Fabrication-Validation Gap Theory (Revised)",
    "type": "specific",
    "theory_description": "This theory posits that in automated scientific discovery systems, there exists a systematic asymmetry between the system's capacity to generate/fabricate novel scientific claims and its capacity to validate those claims. This asymmetry is architectural and domain-dependent rather than fundamental, manifesting in three distinct forms: (1) Implementation Gap - between code/protocol generation and executable validation, (2) Conceptual Gap - between hypothesis generation and logical/theoretical verification, and (3) Empirical Gap - between prediction generation and experimental confirmation. The gap size is determined by three primary factors: novelty level (N), system architecture quality (A), and domain formalization (D). Generation capabilities scale with pattern recognition and extrapolation from training data, allowing systems to produce increasingly novel outputs. Validation capabilities depend on: (1) precedent-based comparison (which decays with novelty), (2) formal verification methods (available in formal domains), (3) empirical ground truth (costly for novel claims), and (4) architectural validation infrastructure (designable and non-decaying). The critical insight is that the gap is not an inherent limitation but an architectural choice: systems with dedicated validation modules, formal verification capabilities, closed-loop experimental feedback, or strategic human-AI collaboration can substantially reduce or eliminate the gap even for highly novel outputs. However, without such architectural investments, the gap widens systematically with novelty. The gap manifests as: systems generating plausible-seeming claims without epistemic tools to assess validity; higher validation failure rates for novel discoveries in poorly-architected systems; reliance on surface-level plausibility checks rather than deep validity assessment; systematic implementation failures preventing validation attempts; and false positive rates that increase with novelty in systems lacking validation infrastructure. The theory predicts that validation computational costs exceed generation costs and increase with novelty, but this asymmetry can be managed through efficient validation infrastructure design.",
