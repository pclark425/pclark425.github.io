                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Symbolic Law Discovery as a Self-Organizing System</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the process of LLM-enabled law discovery, when coupled with program synthesis and simulation feedback, forms a self-organizing system. The LLM, acting as a central agent, dynamically adapts its symbolic law proposals in response to feedback, leading to emergent, stable, and generalizable scientific laws. The system's behavior is characterized by feedback loops, error correction, and convergence properties analogous to self-organizing systems in nature.</p>
