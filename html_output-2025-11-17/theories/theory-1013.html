                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by dynamically integrating episodic (event-based) and semantic (fact-based) memory in a hierarchical structure. Episodic memory encodes temporally ordered sequences of actions and observations, while semantic memory abstracts persistent facts and rules about the game world. The agent leverages episodic memory for context-sensitive reasoning and semantic memory for generalization, with a control mechanism that determines when to retrieve, update, or abstract information between the two layers.</p>
