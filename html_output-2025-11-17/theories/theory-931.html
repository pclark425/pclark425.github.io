                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Memory Routing Enables Contextual Adaptation in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM text game agents equipped with dynamic memory routing—mechanisms that flexibly direct information flow between memory modules based on current context and task demands—achieve superior contextual adaptation. By dynamically selecting which memory modules to consult or update, agents can tailor their reasoning and recall to the specific requirements of each game state, supporting efficient adaptation to diverse and changing environments.</p>
