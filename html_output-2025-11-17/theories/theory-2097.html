                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Hierarchical Law Abstraction in Molecular Sciences</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when trained on molecular science literature, can autonomously construct hierarchical abstractions of feature–property relationships, identifying both low-level (specific) and high-level (general) quantitative laws. The LLM organizes extracted rules into a multi-level structure, enabling the discovery of universal principles and context-dependent exceptions, and facilitating the transfer of knowledge across molecular subdomains.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover new, previously unrecognized universal laws by abstracting across many specific rules.</li>
                <li>LLMs could identify rare or subtle exceptions that have been overlooked by human experts.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to organize extracted rules into meaningful hierarchies, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot identify or propose exceptions in the presence of conflicting evidence, the contextual exception claim would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to distinguish between genuine exceptions and spurious or erroneous data is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
