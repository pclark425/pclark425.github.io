                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Coordination</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by coordinating two distinct but interacting memory systems: an episodic memory that stores temporally ordered, context-rich experiences, and a semantic memory that encodes abstracted, generalized knowledge. The agent dynamically decides which memory system to query or update based on the nature of the task, the novelty of the context, and the need for generalization versus specificity. This coordination enables both rapid adaptation to new situations and robust performance on familiar tasks.</p>

    <li>Cognitive science distinguishes episodic and semantic memory systems, with humans flexibly using each depending on task demands (Tulving, 1972; McClelland et al., 1995). </li>
    <li>Recent LLM research shows that agents benefit from both storing specific experiences (episodic) and abstracted knowledge (semantic) (Madotto et al., 2020). </li>
    <li>Meta-learning studies indicate that episodic memory is critical for rapid adaptation, while semantic memory supports generalization (Botvinick et al., 2019). </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the memory systems are known, their dynamic, task-driven coordination in LLM agents is a new synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The distinction between episodic and semantic memory is well-established in cognitive science and has been explored in neural architectures.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit, dynamic selection and coordination of these systems in LLM agents based on task novelty and specificity is novel.</p>

                <li>If agents can autonomously discover when to consolidate episodic into semantic memory, they may develop emergent abstraction capabilities.</li>
                <li>Dynamic coordination of memory systems may enable agents to transfer knowledge across highly dissimilar tasks.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with both memory systems do not outperform those with only one on tasks requiring both specificity and generalization, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If consolidation of episodic into semantic memory does not reduce forgetting or improve generalization, the theory's mechanism would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts between episodic and semantic memory when they provide contradictory information. </li>
