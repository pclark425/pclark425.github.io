                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection Type Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their network connectivity and projection type. Neurons with long-range corticocortical projections, especially those in layers III and V, are more vulnerable to tau pathology and neurodegeneration, while neurons with predominantly local or short-range connections (such as those in primary visual cortex) are relatively resistant. The anatomical and functional integration of these neurons into large-scale cortical networks exposes them to trans-synaptic propagation of tau seeds and amyloid pathology, leading to earlier and more severe involvement.</p>
