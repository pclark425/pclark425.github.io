                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory: General Bottleneck Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the primary limitation in language models' ability to perform strict logical reasoning arises from a bottleneck at the interface between distributed neural representations and explicit symbolic manipulation. The mismatch between continuous, high-dimensional neural encodings and the discrete, compositional nature of symbolic logic leads to systematic failures in tasks requiring precise logical inference, variable binding, and rule application.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform well on naturalistic language but struggle with tasks requiring strict logical consistency, such as formal proofs or multi-step deduction. </li>
    <li>Neural models often fail to generalize to novel logical forms or rules not seen during training. </li>
    <li>Attempts to extract symbolic rules from neural activations reveal entangled, non-compositional representations. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Closely related to existing neuro-symbolic literature, but the explicit framing as a bottleneck for logical reasoning in LLMs is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The neuro-symbolic gap is a recognized challenge in AI, with prior work noting difficulties in mapping between neural and symbolic representations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the bottleneck as the primary limiting factor for strict logical reasoning in LLMs, and predicts systematic, not incidental, failure modes.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hybrid models that explicitly bridge neural and symbolic representations will outperform pure neural models on strict logical reasoning tasks.</li>
                <li>Increasing the scale of neural models alone will not eliminate systematic logical errors without addressing the neuro-symbolic interface.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It is unknown whether end-to-end training with large, diverse logical datasets can induce emergent neuro-symbolic interfaces.</li>
                <li>The degree to which architectural innovations (e.g., modularity, external memory) can mitigate the bottleneck is not yet established.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a pure neural model achieves human-level performance on formal logic tasks without explicit symbolic augmentation, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If systematic logical errors are not observed in neural models on tasks requiring explicit symbolic manipulation, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial success on simple logic puzzles, suggesting the bottleneck may be task- or complexity-dependent. </li>
