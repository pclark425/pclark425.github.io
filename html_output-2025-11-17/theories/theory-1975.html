                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1975</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement via Human-LLM Interaction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when used in conjunction with iterative human feedback, can refine and validate candidate qualitative laws distilled from scholarly corpora. The process involves LLMs generating initial law candidates, humans providing corrections or clarifications, and the LLM updating its abstractions accordingly. This interactive loop enables the convergence toward more accurate, generalizable, and scientifically valid qualitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will produce more accurate and scientifically valid qualitative laws when used in an iterative feedback loop with domain experts.</li>
                <li>The number of corrections required to reach consensus will decrease with each iteration.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to generalize corrections across similar law candidates, improving efficiency.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Iterative human-LLM interaction may enable the discovery of laws that are not present in any single paper but emerge from the synthesis of multiple expert perspectives.</li>
                <li>The process may reveal systematic biases in either LLM outputs or human feedback, leading to new insights about scientific consensus formation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative feedback does not improve the accuracy or generalizability of distilled laws, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to incorporate expert corrections or revert to previous errors, the convergence mechanism would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of expert disagreement or conflicting feedback on the convergence process is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The scalability of the approach for very large or highly interdisciplinary corpora is not specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory adapts and extends interactive learning to a new, high-impact scientific use case.</p>
