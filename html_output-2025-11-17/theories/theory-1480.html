                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that polysemous concepts (e.g., 'bank' as riverbank or financial institution) are represented as dynamic subspaces within a high-dimensional conceptual space. Each sense of a polysemous concept corresponds to a distinct, context-activated subspace, and the brain dynamically partitions the overall embedding based on contextual cues. This allows for rapid, context-sensitive disambiguation and flexible switching between senses, without requiring separate, static representations for each sense.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows context-dependent shifts in neural activation for polysemous words, indicating that the same word form can activate different neural patterns depending on context. </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and semantic ambiguity resolution are highly context-sensitive, with faster and more accurate responses when context supports a particular sense. </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., ELMo, BERT) demonstrate that word embeddings for polysemous words shift in high-dimensional space depending on sentence context, supporting the plausibility of subspace partitioning. </li>
    <li>ERP studies show rapid context-driven disambiguation of ambiguous words, with N400 modulations reflecting contextually appropriate sense activation. </li>
    <li>Lesion studies indicate that damage to regions involved in context integration impairs disambiguation of polysemous words, suggesting a functional role for context-driven partitioning. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context-dependent disambiguation is known, the subspace partitioning mechanism as a functional representational format is novel and not explicitly articulated in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context-dependent semantic disambiguation is well-established in psycholinguistics and neuroscience, and computational models show context-sensitive embeddings.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit proposal that polysemous concepts are represented as dynamic, context-activated subspaces within a unified embedding, rather than as static or entirely separate representations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neural population codes for polysemous concepts will shift into distinct subspaces depending on context, even when the stimulus is identical.</li>
                <li>Rapid context switches will induce corresponding rapid changes in the neural embedding of polysemous concepts.</li>
                <li>Behavioral priming for a specific sense of a polysemous word will be stronger when the context matches the subspace partition activated by the prime.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially biasing the neural population toward a particular subspace (e.g., via priming or stimulation) will bias interpretation of ambiguous concepts.</li>
                <li>Training artificial neural networks with dynamic subspace partitioning will yield human-like ambiguity resolution.</li>
                <li>The degree of subspace separation may predict individual differences in ambiguity resolution ability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If polysemous concepts are represented as fixed, context-invariant codes, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the neural embedding of ambiguous concepts, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If behavioral ambiguity resolution is not context-sensitive, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how new senses are integrated into the subspace structure over time (e.g., through learning or experience). </li>
    <li>The theory does not address whether all types of polysemy (e.g., homonymy vs. metonymy) are handled via the same subspace mechanism. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends existing context-dependent models by specifying the subspace partitioning mechanism as the functional format for polysemous concept representation.</p>
