    <li>Schema-guided retrieval is well-established in human cognition and supports generalization. </li>
    <li>AI systems with schema-based retrieval show improved performance in structured reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to use structured templates or high-level plans, which improves their ability to recall and apply relevant information in complex tasks. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Schema-guided retrieval is known in cognitive science and some AI, but its systematic use in LLM text game agents, especially for dynamic integration during play, is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Schema theory is established in cognitive science and some AI, and schema-guided retrieval is known to support generalization and reasoning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit use of schema-guided semantic memory retrieval in LLM agents for text games, including the integration of retrieved facts into ongoing reasoning, is novel.</p>
