                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by learning statistical associations between token patterns in input and output, rather than by explicit algorithmic computation, leading to high accuracy on seen formats and frequent errors on novel or out-of-distribution arithmetic problems.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can generalize to novel arithmetic formats without additional training, this would challenge the theory.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial generalization to novel arithmetic formats, suggesting limited abstraction beyond memorization. </li>
