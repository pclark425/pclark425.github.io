                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Routing Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can optimize task performance by adaptively routing information between memory modules based on real-time assessment of task context, uncertainty, and expected utility. The routing mechanism is modulated by learned or meta-learned policies that balance exploration, exploitation, and memory efficiency.</p>
