                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Abstraction via Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large corpora of scholarly papers, can autonomously abstract qualitative laws by identifying recurring patterns, causal relationships, and generalizations across diverse sources. The process leverages the LLM's ability to synthesize, generalize, and represent knowledge in a structured form, enabling the emergence of new, high-level scientific laws that may not be explicitly stated in any single paper.</p>
