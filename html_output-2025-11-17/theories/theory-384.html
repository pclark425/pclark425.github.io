                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit Simulator Fidelity for ML Training: Verification vs. Transfer Requirements</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about minimal simulator fidelity requirements for training transferable scientific reasoning in domains such as thermodynamics, circuits, and biology, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The evidence base now includes substantial documentation of circuit simulator fidelity for ML/RL training in analog circuit design automation (sizing and placement optimization) and power converter topology generation, but reveals a critical gap between verification fidelity and transfer learning fidelity. Two distinct fidelity requirements exist: (1) Verification fidelity—the simulation accuracy needed to reliably predict real-world performance during design validation, and (2) Transfer learning fidelity—the minimal simulation fidelity needed to train models that successfully transfer to real hardware. The evidence establishes detailed verification fidelity practices (industrial SPICE with foundry PDKs, PVT corners, hierarchical mismatch modeling, post-layout parasitic extraction for analog circuits; simplified Ngspice models for power converters) but provides no empirical validation of transfer learning fidelity requirements since no sim-to-real transfer experiments exist for any circuit type. Domain-specific fidelity approaches are documented: analog sizing/placement uses high-fidelity industrial SPICE with comprehensive variation modeling, while power converter topology generation uses simplified fixed-parameter models. A two-phase training strategy is demonstrated where agents train on small sampled subsets of high-fidelity simulations then verify with full Monte Carlo. Digital circuits and RF circuits remain absent from the evidence base.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Verification fidelity and transfer learning fidelity are distinct requirements: verification fidelity ensures accurate performance prediction during design validation, while transfer learning fidelity determines the minimal simulation accuracy needed for models to successfully transfer to real hardware</li>
                <li>For analog circuit sizing and placement optimization, current industrial practice uses high-fidelity simulation including: industrial SPICE with foundry PDK models, comprehensive PVT corners (process/voltage/temperature), hierarchical global/local mismatch modeling, and post-layout parasitic extraction via tools like Calibre</li>
                <li>For power converter topology generation, simplified circuit simulation (Ngspice with fixed-parameter ideal components) is used without explicit parasitic, thermal, noise, or process variation modeling</li>
                <li>Corner-only simulation (30 simulations) captures global die-to-die process variation but misses statistical worst-case scenarios; hierarchical global-local Monte Carlo simulation (6,000 simulations) is necessary for robust industrial verification of analog circuits</li>
                <li>A two-phase training strategy is viable: train RL agents on small sampled subsets (N'=2-5) of high-fidelity simulations using ensemble critics to estimate worst-case bounds, then verify with full Monte Carlo, achieving up to 80× sample efficiency gains</li>
                <li>Current industrial analog circuit ML practice does NOT model aging effects, electromigration, or full 3D electromagnetic coupling</li>
                <li>Domain randomization for analog circuits includes hierarchical global/local mismatch sampling and PVT corner enumeration, though sufficiency for sim-to-real transfer is unvalidated</li>
                <li>No empirical validation exists for minimal simulator fidelity requirements for sim-to-real transfer in any circuit domain (analog, digital, RF, or power), making all transfer fidelity claims speculative</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>

    <li>GLOVA uses industrial SPICE-level simulation with foundry PDK device models, comprehensive PVT modeling (process corners TT/SS/FF/SF/FS, supply voltage 0.8V/0.9V, temperature -40°C/27°C/80°C), hierarchical global/local mismatch modeling per PDK variances, and post-layout parasitic capacitances for analog circuit sizing optimization <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GLOVA explicitly compares three verification fidelity levels: corner-only (30 simulations) captures global process variation but misses statistical worst-cases; corner+local MC (3,000 simulations) adds local mismatch; corner+global-local MC (6,000 simulations) is necessary for robust industrial verification and probabilistically exposes worst-case mismatches <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Analog placement optimization uses Cadence Virtuoso with Calibre post-layout extraction to include routing effects and parasitic modeling in simulator-in-the-loop RL training for Current Mirror, Comparator, and OTA circuits <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.2" class="evidence-link">[e2055.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.3" class="evidence-link">[e2055.3]</a> </li>

    <li>GLOVA explicitly documents fidelity boundaries: aging, electromigration, and full 3D electromagnetic coupling are NOT modeled in current industrial practice for analog circuit ML applications <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain randomization is implemented in GLOVA through hierarchical mismatch sampling (global variation h^(1) ~ N(0, Σ_global(x)), then local mismatches h^(2) ~ N(h^(1), Σ_local(x))) and PVT corner enumeration during training <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> </li>
    <li>All studies report no sim-to-real transfer experiments (sim_to_real_transfer: false), confirming that minimal fidelity requirements for successful transfer to real hardware remain empirically unvalidated <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.0" class="evidence-link">[e2058.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.0" class="evidence-link">[e2055.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.3" class="evidence-link">[e2055.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2056.html#e2056.0" class="evidence-link">[e2056.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.1" class="evidence-link">[e2058.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.2" class="evidence-link">[e2058.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2058.html#e2058.3" class="evidence-link">[e2058.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.1" class="evidence-link">[e2055.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2055.html#e2055.2" class="evidence-link">[e2055.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Analog circuit sizing agents trained with industrial SPICE including PVT corners and hierarchical mismatch modeling will produce designs that meet specifications in post-layout verification simulation with high probability</li>
                <li>The two-phase training approach (small sampled subsets with ensemble critics, then full MC verification) will generalize to other analog circuit design tasks beyond those tested, maintaining sample efficiency gains</li>
                <li>Power converter topology generation using simplified Ngspice models will continue to produce valid topologies that meet basic electrical constraints (KVL, KCL) in simulation</li>
                <li>Post-layout parasitic extraction will remain necessary for accurate prediction of layout-dependent effects (mismatch, offset) in analog placement optimization tasks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether analog circuit sizing agents trained with industrial SPICE (PVT + hierarchical MC) will successfully transfer to fabricated silicon without additional calibration or adaptation</li>
                <li>Whether simplified Ngspice models (fixed parameters, no explicit parasitics) are sufficient for power converter designs to transfer to real hardware, or if parasitic modeling, thermal effects, and component tolerances must be added</li>
                <li>The minimum subset of PVT corners and Monte Carlo samples required during training (not just verification) to enable successful sim-to-real transfer for analog circuits</li>
                <li>Whether domain randomization strategies (hierarchical mismatch sampling, PVT enumeration) as currently implemented are sufficient for sim-to-real transfer, or if additional randomization over unmodeled effects (aging, EM, thermal coupling) is necessary</li>
                <li>Whether the fidelity boundaries documented (no aging, no EM, no full 3D EM coupling) represent acceptable simplifications for transfer learning or critical missing elements that would cause transfer failure</li>
                <li>Whether digital circuit design tasks would require similar high-fidelity simulation (timing corners, process variation, parasitic extraction) or could succeed with gate-level ideal models</li>
                <li>Whether RF circuit design would require electromagnetic field solvers and distributed effects modeling for successful transfer, or if lumped-element SPICE models with parasitics would suffice</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that analog circuit designs trained with corner-only simulation (no Monte Carlo) transfer successfully to silicon would challenge the claim that hierarchical MC is necessary for robust design</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that power converter designs trained with simplified Ngspice models (no parasitics, fixed parameters) transfer successfully to real hardware would challenge assumptions about parasitic and tolerance modeling requirements</li>
                <li>Showing that agents trained without post-layout parasitic extraction produce layouts that perform as predicted on silicon would challenge the necessity of extraction in the training loop</li>
                <li>Finding that agents trained without domain randomization (single nominal PVT corner) transfer successfully would challenge the value of variation-aware training</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that adding currently-unmodeled effects (aging, EM, full 3D EM coupling) to training simulations does not improve transfer performance would validate current fidelity boundaries</li>
                <li>Showing that verification fidelity (full MC) is not predictive of real silicon performance would fundamentally challenge the simulation-based design paradigm</li>
