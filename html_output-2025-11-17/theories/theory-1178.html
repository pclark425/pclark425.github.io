                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Conditional Chemical Synthesis Theory (General: Language-to-Molecule Mapping)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when conditioned on natural language prompts specifying desired chemical properties or applications, can map these linguistic constraints to valid chemical structures and plausible synthetic routes. The LLM leverages its internal representations, learned from vast chemical and textual corpora, to generate molecules and synthesis plans that satisfy the specified conditions, effectively translating high-level intent into actionable chemical proposals.</p>
