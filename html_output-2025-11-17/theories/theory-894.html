                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Frequency-Weighted Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the utility of a memory in a language model agent is a function of its recall frequency, recency, and contextual relevance, and that agents should prioritize memory retrieval and consolidation based on a frequency-weighted utility score. This approach enables agents to balance between overfitting to recent or frequent events and maintaining a diverse, contextually rich memory, thereby optimizing task performance and personalization.</p>
