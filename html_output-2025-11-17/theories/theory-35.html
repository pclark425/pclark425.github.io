                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Training data generated through multi-agent debates involving multiple strong teacher models and a student model, with explicit self-reflection (SR) from incorrect agents and teacher feedback (TF), provides substantially richer learning signals than single-teacher distillation or direct demonstrations. The debate structure creates: (1) targeted feedback directed at student errors rather than generic demonstrations, (2) multiple correct reasoning paths cross-verified by teachers, (3) explicit error analysis through self-reflection, (4) corrective strategies through teacher feedback, and (5) tree-structured preference data that captures why answers are preferred. The approach is data-efficient (2.5-7.7x expansion from debates to training instances) and scales positively with debate count, unlike some baselines that fail at small scales.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multi-teacher debate distillation provides 2-3 percentage point improvements over single-teacher distillation when using the same number of teacher interactions.</li>
                <li>Self-reflection (SR) and teacher feedback (TF) components are critical: removing them causes 4-6 percentage point performance drops.</li>
                <li>The approach is data-efficient: 100-1000 debates provide substantial improvements, with each debate yielding 2.5-7.7x training instances through structured extraction.</li>
                <li>Debate-structured data scales positively with debate count, showing monotonic improvements unlike some baselines that plateau or fail at small scales.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness depends on student model capacity: stronger students (Llama-3.1-8B) gain more from T-DPO on hard tasks than weaker students (Mistral-7B).</li>
                <li>Multi-teacher debates provide richer diversity of insights and reasoning paths than single-teacher outputs, leading to more robust learning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multi-teacher debate distillation (D&R) achieved 38.16 average accuracy compared to 35.21 for best single-teacher distillation (+2.95 points), with larger gains in some categories like Physics (+5.54 points). <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.3" class="evidence-link">[e213.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Removing self-reflection (SR) caused -3.07 to -4.92 point drops, and removing teacher feedback (TF) caused -4.61 to -5.54 point drops, showing these components are critical for transferring self-correction abilities. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.2" class="evidence-link">[e213.2]</a> </li>
    <li>D&R remained effective at small scales (100 debates) and improved monotonically with more debates, while baseline MAGD1 struggled at small scales, demonstrating data efficiency. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.4" class="evidence-link">[e213.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Debate-derived SFT instances provided +12.02 average accuracy points over baseline (23.98 to 36.00), capturing the majority of distillation gains before preference optimization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.0" class="evidence-link">[e213.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Tree-structured preference optimization (T-DPO) on debate data added +2.16 average points over SFT-only, with particularly large gains on Physics (+5.54 points). <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.1" class="evidence-link">[e213.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Each debate yielded 2.5-7.7x more training instances (SFT + T-DPO) than the debate itself, showing efficient utilization of debate data. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.4" class="evidence-link">[e213.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying multi-teacher debate distillation to scientific literature QA would yield 3-5 percentage point improvements over single-teacher distillation, with larger gains for questions requiring synthesis across multiple perspectives.</li>
                <li>Including explicit self-reflection and teacher feedback in scientific QA training data would improve the model's ability to self-correct by 20-30% compared to training without these components.</li>
                <li>Debate-structured data would be particularly effective for scientific domains with multiple valid approaches (e.g., different experimental methodologies, theoretical frameworks).</li>
                <li>Using 3-5 teacher models in debates would provide optimal tradeoff between diversity and computational cost, with diminishing returns beyond 5 teachers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether multi-teacher debates would work for scientific QA where teachers might have conflicting domain expertise or theoretical commitments - might require careful teacher selection.</li>
                <li>The optimal debate structure for scientific literature QA - whether round-robin, adversarial, or collaborative debate formats provide the best learning signals.</li>
                <li>Whether debate-structured data would help with scientific tasks requiring novel hypothesis generation, where teachers might not have ground-truth to verify against.</li>
                <li>How debate distillation would scale to very large numbers of teachers (10+) - whether additional diversity continues to help or creates noise.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-teacher distillation performs as well as multi-teacher debates when controlling for total teacher compute, this would challenge the diversity hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If removing self-reflection and teacher feedback components does not decrease performance, this would question their importance.</li>
                <li>If debate-structured data performs no better than randomly sampled teacher outputs at small scales, this would challenge the data-efficiency claim.</li>
                <li>If weaker student models benefit as much as stronger students from debate data, this would question the capacity-dependence mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Debate distillation showed no improvement on MATH for Mistral-7B student (-0.32 points), suggesting student capacity can bottleneck benefits on very hard tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.5" class="evidence-link">[e213.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory doesn't explain the large variation in gains across categories (Physics +5.54, CS +0.49), suggesting task-specific factors matter. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.1" class="evidence-link">[e213.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Single-teacher distillation with Claude 3.5 achieved 35.21 average, which is quite strong, suggesting diminishing returns from adding more teachers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.3" class="evidence-link">[e213.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal number of debate rounds (up to 4) is not well explained - why not more rounds for harder problems? <a href="../results/extraction-result-213.html#e213.2" class="evidence-link">[e213.2]</a> </li>
