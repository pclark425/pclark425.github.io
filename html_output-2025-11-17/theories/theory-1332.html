                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Decorrelation and Externalization Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve answer quality through a process of iterative decorrelation and externalization: with each generate-then-reflect cycle, the model externalizes its internal uncertainties, errors, or contradictions, and then decorrelates its next answer from prior mistakes by explicitly addressing these externalized elements. This process enables the LLM to progressively reduce error propagation and converge toward more accurate, robust answers.</p>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some errors may not be easily externalized or recognized by the LLM, limiting the effectiveness of the process. </li>
    <li>Tasks with ambiguous or subjective answers may not benefit from decorrelation or externalization. </li>
