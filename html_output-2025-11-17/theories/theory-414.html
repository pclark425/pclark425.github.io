                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Executable Feedback Loop Superiority Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of optimal coordination, communication protocols, and feedback mechanisms between multiple specialized AI agents conducting different phases of scientific research, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Multi-agent systems that incorporate executable feedback loops—where agents' outputs are automatically executed in objective environments (compilers, test suites, simulators, runtime environments) and results fed back for iterative refinement—achieve significantly higher correctness, reliability, and task completion rates than systems relying solely on LLM-based peer review or self-reflection. Executable feedback provides ground truth signals that are immune to model hallucination and enable objective convergence criteria. The theory predicts that the benefit scales with: (1) task verifiability (availability of automated oracles), (2) the quality and coverage of the executable feedback mechanism, (3) the cost-effectiveness of execution relative to task value, and (4) the integration of executable feedback with structured communication protocols. The theory applies most strongly to tasks with clear correctness criteria (code generation, formal verification, system testing) and less strongly to tasks with subjective or emergent quality criteria (creative writing, open-ended research).</p>

            <ol>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether executable feedback can be effectively applied to non-verifiable research tasks (e.g., theory development, qualitative analysis) using learned surrogate models or proxy metrics, and if so, what magnitude of improvement would be achieved</li>
                <li>The extent to which learned surrogate models (e.g., neural network approximations of expensive simulations) can substitute for expensive executable feedback while maintaining 80-90% of the benefit</li>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal balance between executable feedback frequency and computational cost, and whether this balance varies systematically with task domain or agent architecture</li>
                <li>How executable feedback interacts with different agent coordination structures (centralized vs. decentralized vs. hierarchical) and whether certain structures amplify or diminish the benefits</li>
                <li>Whether executable feedback can be effectively applied to creative or open-ended tasks by using multi-objective evaluation (combining execution metrics with learned quality models), and what the tradeoffs would be</li>
                <li>The extent to which executable feedback can help agents discover novel solutions that human-designed tests don't anticipate, versus constraining agents to only solutions that pass existing tests</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that LLM-based peer review achieves equivalent correctness to executable feedback on a broad range of tasks would challenge the necessity of execution infrastructure</li>
                <li>Finding that executable feedback creates local optima that prevent discovery of better solutions (e.g., agents optimize for passing tests rather than solving the underlying problem) would limit applicability</li>
                <li>Showing that the computational cost of executable feedback outweighs correctness benefits in typical workflows (e.g., execution takes 10x longer than generation with only 10% improvement) would undermine practical value</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that low-quality executable feedback (incomplete test suites, inaccurate oracles) performs worse than high-quality LLM peer review would show that execution alone is insufficient</li>
                <li>Finding that executable feedback reduces solution diversity or creativity by over-constraining the search space would indicate important limitations for open-ended tasks</li>
                <li>Showing that agents become over-reliant on executable feedback and fail to develop robust internal models would suggest potential negative effects on generalization</li>

    <li>How to handle cases where executable feedback is expensive or time-consuming (e.g., wet-lab experiments, large-scale simulations, hardware testing) and the cost-benefit tradeoff is unclear <a href="../results/extraction-result-2538.html#e2538.1" class="evidence-link">[e2538.1]</a> </li>
