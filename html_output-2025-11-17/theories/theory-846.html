                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-846</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid and Hierarchical Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance and generalization by employing a hybrid memory architecture that integrates both short-term (contextual/working) and long-term (episodic/semantic) memory systems, organized hierarchically. The architecture enables dynamic routing of information between memory types and levels, allowing agents to flexibly retrieve, update, and abstract knowledge according to task demands, temporal scale, and salience. This hybrid, hierarchical approach supports continual learning, efficient scaling, and robust adaptation to novel or long-horizon tasks.</p>
