                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1832</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Knowledge Integration Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by hierarchically integrating knowledge across multiple levels: foundational principles, current consensus, and emerging trends. The accuracy of these estimates depends on the model's ability to synthesize information from these layers, with fine-tuning on annotated corpora that reflect both established knowledge and frontier research enhancing the model's predictive power. The theory further posits that LLMs can extrapolate discovery likelihoods by identifying latent patterns in the evolution of scientific ideas.</p>
