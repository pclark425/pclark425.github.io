                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Symbolic Augmentation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve optimal strict logical reasoning when their neural representations are augmented with explicit, external symbolic reasoning modules. The theory asserts that the integration of symbolic logic engines—capable of formal proof, deduction, and error-checking—enables LMs to overcome the limitations of purely statistical reasoning, resulting in higher logical fidelity and generalization.</p>
