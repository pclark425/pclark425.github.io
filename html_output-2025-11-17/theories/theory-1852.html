                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to diverse forms of scientific evidence (text, data, figures, code), can integrate these modalities to form probabilistic estimates of future discoveries. By learning the joint distribution of multimodal signals and their historical association with breakthroughs, LLMs can assign likelihoods to future events, even in complex, data-rich domains.</p>
