                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can accurately estimate the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries by integrating retrieval-augmented mechanisms with probabilistic reasoning over structured and unstructured scientific knowledge. The LLM leverages both its internalized knowledge and dynamically retrieved external data to form a probabilistic model of scientific progress, conditioned on historical trends, current research activity, and latent scientific paradigms.</p>
