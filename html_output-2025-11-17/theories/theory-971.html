                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Architectures Enable Robust Long-Horizon Reasoning and Generalization in LLM Agents for Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with hybrid memory architectures—integrating both episodic (event-based, context-specific) and semantic (fact-based, abstracted) memory systems—achieve superior long-horizon reasoning and generalization in text-based games. The hybrid approach allows agents to flexibly retrieve and combine specific past experiences with generalized knowledge, supporting context-sensitive decision-making, transfer to novel tasks, and resilience to context shifts.</p>
