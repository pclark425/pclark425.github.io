                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1491</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Simulation-Based Representational Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented functionally as dynamic, executable simulations—internal models that can be run forward or backward to predict, imagine, or reason about entities and events. Concepts are encoded as parameterized generative processes, which can be flexibly instantiated, manipulated, and composed to support inference, prediction, and counterfactual reasoning. This simulation-based format enables the brain to use concepts not just as static symbols or feature bundles, but as executable programs that can model causal and temporal structure.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Behavioral and neuroimaging evidence shows that people mentally simulate events, actions, and outcomes when reasoning about concepts (e.g., mental imagery, motor simulation, event prediction). </li>
    <li>Lesion and TMS studies show that disrupting simulation-related brain regions impairs conceptual reasoning about actions and events. </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., program induction, generative models) account for human-like concept learning and generalization via simulation-based representations. </li>
    <li>People can predict the consequences of hypothetical or counterfactual scenarios, indicating the use of internal generative models. </li>
    <li>Neuroimaging studies show that imagining or reasoning about events activates similar brain regions as perceiving or enacting them. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While simulation-based accounts exist for some domains, the claim that all conceptual knowledge is fundamentally simulation-based is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Simulation theories exist for specific domains (e.g., motor, spatial, event cognition), and generative models are used in AI and cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law generalizes simulation-based representation as the core functional format for all conceptual knowledge, not just for perceptual or motor concepts.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Humans can imagine novel scenarios by combining known concepts (e.g., 'flying car'), and can mentally simulate their properties and consequences. </li>
    <li>Computational models using program composition can generate novel concepts and predict human generalization patterns. </li>
    <li>Children and adults can flexibly combine conceptual primitives to create new, meaningful concepts. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing work, but the explicit claim about the brain's functional representational format is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Compositionality in simulation and generative models is well-studied in AI and cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law asserts that compositional simulation is the core mechanism for novel concept construction in brains, not just a property of artificial models.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks requiring counterfactual reasoning or prediction will engage brain regions associated with simulation (e.g., premotor cortex, hippocampus) even for abstract concepts.</li>
                <li>Novel concept learning will involve the composition and parameterization of existing simulation processes, observable as neural signatures of process recombination.</li>
                <li>Impairment of simulation-related brain regions will reduce the ability to reason about both concrete and abstract concepts.</li>
                <li>Conceptual transfer to new domains will involve the reuse and recombination of simulation primitives.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If simulation-related brain regions are disrupted, all forms of conceptual reasoning (not just perceptual or motor) will be impaired.</li>
                <li>Concepts that cannot be simulated (e.g., highly abstract or logical concepts) will show atypical neural signatures or require alternative representational formats.</li>
                <li>Training in simulation-based reasoning (e.g., mental imagery) will enhance conceptual learning across domains.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks with explicit simulation modules will better match human concept learning patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual reasoning about non-perceptual, non-motor concepts does not engage simulation-related brain regions, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If novel concept construction does not involve neural signatures of simulation composition, the theory's core claim is challenged.</li>
                <li>If individuals with impaired simulation abilities (e.g., aphantasia) show no deficits in conceptual reasoning, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If static, non-simulative representations suffice for all conceptual tasks, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how static, non-dynamic concepts (e.g., taxonomic categories) are represented as simulations. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how concepts acquired solely through language (without direct experience) are simulated. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends simulation-based accounts to all conceptual knowledge, which is a novel and testable claim.</p>
