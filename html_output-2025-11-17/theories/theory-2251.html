                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates semantic, empirical, methodological, and epistemic criteria. The theory asserts that only by considering these dimensions in concert can the scientific validity and utility of LLM-generated theories be robustly assessed.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories evaluated with all four dimensions will have higher acceptance rates in scientific review than those evaluated with only one or two.</li>
                <li>Automated systems that neglect any dimension (e.g., empirical adequacy) will be more prone to accepting flawed theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal weighting of each dimension for different scientific domains is unknown and may vary.</li>
                <li>Some LLM-generated theories may pass all dimensions but still fail in long-term scientific utility.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If theories that fail in one dimension (e.g., semantic consistency) are routinely accepted, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If single-dimension evaluation proves as effective as multi-dimensional evaluation, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the role of social or institutional factors in theory acceptance. </li>
