                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented LLM Distillation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when augmented with iterative retrieval mechanisms over large scholarly corpora, can autonomously distill qualitative scientific laws by repeatedly querying, synthesizing, and refining candidate laws based on retrieved evidence. The process leverages the LLM's ability to generalize across diverse sources and iteratively improve law quality, leading to emergent, robust, and generalizable scientific knowledge.</p>
