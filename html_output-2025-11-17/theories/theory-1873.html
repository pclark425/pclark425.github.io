                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Selective Forecasting and Uncertainty Hedging Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by selectively aggregating, weighting, and extrapolating from patterns in the scientific literature, expert discourse, and historical discovery trajectories. The LLM's probabilistic forecasts are modulated by its internal uncertainty representations, which are shaped by both the density and diversity of supporting evidence, as well as the model's ability to recognize and hedge against epistemic blind spots.</p>

    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to synthesize and summarize scientific literature, and to identify consensus and outlier views. </li>
    <li>Forecasting models in other domains (e.g., economic, epidemiological) improve with selective aggregation of relevant signals. </li>
    <li>LLMs can extract and combine information from multiple sources, including recent publications, preprints, and expert commentary. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While aggregation is a known property of LLMs and ensemble models, its formalization as a law for scientific discovery forecasting is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to synthesize and summarize information, and ensemble forecasting methods aggregate signals for prediction.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law that LLMs can selectively aggregate and weight evidence for the purpose of forecasting scientific discoveries is new.</p>
