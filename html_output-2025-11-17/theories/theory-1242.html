                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Abstraction Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that encodes graphs as a hierarchy of compositional abstractions, where subgraphs and motifs are represented as reusable, interpretable units. Such representations enable language models to generalize across graph structures by learning and reusing patterns, supporting both local and global reasoning, and facilitating transfer to novel graphs with similar substructures.</p>
