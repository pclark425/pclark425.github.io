                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1621</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Contextualization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by their ability to hierarchically contextualize information at multiple levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. Subdomains that require deep, multi-level contextualization (e.g., integrating experimental data, theory, and domain-specific conventions) challenge LLMs unless their architectures and training data support such hierarchical reasoning. Shallow or single-level contextualization leads to systematic errors, especially in subdomains with complex, layered knowledge structures.</p>
