                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Structured Memory and Reasoning Modules are Essential for Overcoming Partial Observability and Enabling Efficient Planning in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents require explicit, structured memory and reasoning modules to efficiently solve text games, particularly under conditions of partial observability and long-horizon planning. The theory asserts that such modules are not merely beneficial but essential for maintaining coherent world models, inferring hidden state, and planning multi-step action sequences that adapt to dynamic, partially observed environments.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While structured memory is known to help, its necessity for latent state inference in partially observable text games is a novel, formalized claim.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Structured memory (e.g., knowledge graphs, object-centric memory) has been used to improve state tracking in text-based RL and LLM agents.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the necessity of explicit structured memory for latent state inference under partial observability, not just as an enhancement.</p>

                <li>If explicit structured memory and reasoning modules do not improve performance over implicit approaches in complex text games, the necessity claim is weakened.</li>
