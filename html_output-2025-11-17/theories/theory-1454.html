                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Unified Hierarchical Predictive Hybridism (UHPH)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> UHPH posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented in a unified, hierarchical structure that integrates multiple representational formats (distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor codes). This hybrid system enables flexible, context-sensitive conceptual processing, supporting both abstract reasoning and grounded, perceptual-motor inference. The hierarchy allows for both bottom-up and top-down information flow, with higher levels encoding more abstract, amodal concepts and lower levels encoding more concrete, modality-specific features.</p>
