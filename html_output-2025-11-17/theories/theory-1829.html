                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Specialization and Fine-Tuning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to accurately estimate the probability of specific future real-world scientific discoveries is fundamentally determined by the degree of domain specialization and the quality of fine-tuning on relevant, temporally structured scientific corpora. The theory asserts that LLMs act as probabilistic synthesizers of scientific trajectories, and their predictive power is a function of their exposure to domain-specific causal, methodological, and temporal patterns.</p>
