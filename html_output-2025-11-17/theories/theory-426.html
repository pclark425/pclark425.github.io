                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Phase Transition Theory of Resource Allocation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of optimal resource allocation in automated scientific discovery systems, balancing computational cost of evaluation against expected information gain, probability of breakthrough discoveries, and diversity of explored hypotheses under budget constraints, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Optimal resource allocation in automated discovery systems follows a phase-transition pattern where the system should dynamically shift from exploration-dominated to exploitation-dominated behavior based on measurable uncertainty metrics relative to expected utility. The transition can be operationalized through: (1) threshold-based switching when uncertainty metrics fall below domain-informed thresholds, (2) probabilistic scheduling with time-decay (p_explore = α^t), (3) continuous weighting via acquisition functions (e.g., UCB with adaptive β), or (4) budget-aware nonmyopic planning. Systems implementing such adaptive transitions achieve 20-74× improvements in sample efficiency across diverse domains compared to fixed-strategy approaches. The optimal transition timing depends on problem dimensionality, noise level, evaluation cost structure, remaining budget, and objective-relevant uncertainty rather than generic model uncertainty. Critical insight: transitions should be driven by task-relevant uncertainty (e.g., MOCU, objective-space thresholds) rather than purely model-based metrics to avoid wasting resources on irrelevant exploration.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Optimal allocation requires transitioning from exploration to exploitation as task-relevant uncertainty decreases relative to expected improvement or remaining budget</li>
                <li>The transition point can be operationalized through: (1) threshold-based switching when uncertainty < threshold, (2) probabilistic scheduling with decay rate α, (3) continuous weighting via acquisition functions with adaptive parameters, or (4) budget-aware nonmyopic planning</li>
                <li>Systems implementing adaptive transitions achieve 20-74× better sample efficiency than fixed-strategy approaches, with gains depending on problem structure</li>
                <li>The optimal transition timing depends on: problem dimensionality, noise level, budget size, evaluation cost structure, and objective-relevant (not generic) uncertainty</li>
                <li>Early over-exploitation leads to local optima and poor final performance (demonstrated by pure greedy/EI failures); late transition wastes budget on unnecessary exploration (demonstrated by pure UCB/variance underperformance)</li>
                <li>Nonmyopic planning naturally implements adaptive transitions by considering remaining budget in utility calculations, with lookahead horizon matching remaining budget</li>
                <li>Multi-fidelity systems should allocate cheap evaluations for exploration and expensive evaluations for exploitation, with transition driven by correlation between fidelities</li>
                <li>Threshold-based transitions should use domain-informed thresholds based on practical significance rather than arbitrary statistical cutoffs</li>
                <li>Probabilistic decay schedules should use α < 1 with optimal α depending on total budget T (faster decay for smaller budgets)</li>
                <li>Continuous acquisition functions (UCB, LCB) with adaptive exploration parameters (β, λ) can implement smooth transitions, with optimal parameters typically 1-10% of objective range</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A meta-learning system that learns optimal transition thresholds and decay rates from previous discovery campaigns would outperform hand-tuned parameters by 15-40%, with larger gains in heterogeneous problem distributions</li>
                <li>In multi-objective optimization, separate transition schedules per objective (based on per-objective uncertainty and tolerances) would outperform global transitions by 10-25%, especially when objectives have different scales and noise levels</li>
                <li>Combining threshold-based and probabilistic transitions (hybrid: probabilistic until threshold, then switch) would be more robust to noise and problem variability than either alone, reducing failure rate by 30-50%</li>
                <li>The optimal decay rate α in probabilistic scheduling should scale approximately as α ≈ 1 - c/√T for fixed-horizon problems with budget T, where c is a problem-dependent constant</li>
                <li>Budget-aware nonmyopic methods (like ENS) will show increasing advantage over myopic methods as budget increases, with crossover typically around 50-100 evaluations</li>
                <li>In needle-in-haystack problems, the transition should be delayed until uncertainty in the needle region specifically (not average uncertainty) drops below threshold, requiring spatial uncertainty tracking</li>
                <li>Multi-fidelity systems with 3+ fidelity levels should implement cascaded transitions: cheap→medium fidelities for broad exploration, medium→expensive for focused exploration, expensive-only for final exploitation</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether continuous acquisition functions (like UCB with varying β) can match or exceed the performance of discrete switching strategies across all problem classes, or if discrete switches provide fundamental advantages in some settings</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal transition point can be predicted a priori from problem features (dimensionality, smoothness, multimodality, Lipschitz constant) without running initial experiments, enabling zero-shot transition scheduling</li>
                <li>Whether adaptive transitions remain optimal when evaluation costs vary by 100-1000× within a single campaign, or if cost-aware acquisition functions that don't explicitly transition perform better</li>
                <li>Whether human-in-the-loop systems benefit from different transition schedules than fully automated systems due to cognitive biases, fatigue, or different information processing, and if so, what the optimal human-aware schedule looks like</li>
                <li>Whether very rapid switching (every iteration or every few iterations) between exploration and exploitation modes outperforms gradual transitions in highly non-stationary or adversarial environments</li>
                <li>Whether the phase transition framework applies to discovery tasks with fundamentally different objectives (e.g., maximizing diversity, minimizing risk, satisfying constraints) or if different allocation theories are needed</li>
                <li>Whether quantum or neuromorphic computing architectures that enable massive parallelism fundamentally change optimal transition strategies by making exploration nearly free</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding problem classes where fixed pure-exploitation strategies (greedy, EI-only) consistently outperform adaptive transitions across multiple random seeds and initializations would challenge the universality claim and suggest problem-structure-dependent allocation</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that random switching between exploration/exploitation (coin flip each iteration) performs as well as principled transitions would undermine the theory and suggest the transition mechanism doesn't matter, only the average allocation</li>
                <li>Showing that the transition point is unpredictable from uncertainty metrics (no correlation between optimal transition timing and any measurable uncertainty) would challenge the operationalization approach and suggest transitions should be problem-specific heuristics</li>
                <li>Finding that very rapid switching (alternating exploration/exploitation every iteration) outperforms gradual transitions would question the phase-transition framing and suggest mixed strategies are fundamentally different</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that optimal transition timing is highly sensitive to random seed or initialization (variance in optimal transition point > 50% of budget) would challenge the robustness and practical applicability of the theory</li>
                <li>Finding that generic model uncertainty (predictive variance) works as well as objective-relevant uncertainty (MOCU, task-specific metrics) for driving transitions would challenge the need for sophisticated uncertainty quantification</li>
                <li>Showing that human-selected transition points (based on intuition/experience) consistently outperform algorithm-determined transitions would suggest the theory misses important qualitative factors</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory doesn't fully explain why some methods (like BEACON) succeed with pure exploration in novelty search tasks where the objective is diversity itself rather than optimization <a href="../results/extraction-result-2456.html#e2456.2" class="evidence-link">[e2456.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Optimal transitions for multi-fidelity settings with 3+ fidelity levels are not fully characterized - should transitions be cascaded (cheap→medium→expensive) or should all fidelities be used throughout with changing proportions? <a href="../results/extraction-result-2498.html#e2498.3" class="evidence-link">[e2498.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2633.html#e2633.6" class="evidence-link">[e2633.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2493.html#e2493.7" class="evidence-link">[e2493.7]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of problem structure (convexity, smoothness, Lipschitz constant, multimodality) in determining optimal transition timing needs quantitative characterization beyond qualitative statements <a href="../results/extraction-result-2608.html#e2608.0" class="evidence-link">[e2608.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2622.html#e2622.1" class="evidence-link">[e2622.1]</a> </li>
    <li>How diversity-promotion mechanisms (DPP, qVS, batch penalization) interact with exploration-exploitation transitions is unclear - should diversity be maintained throughout or also transition? <a href="../results/extraction-result-2422.html#e2422.5" class="evidence-link">[e2422.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2422.html#e2422.2" class="evidence-link">[e2422.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2622.html#e2622.0" class="evidence-link">[e2622.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory doesn't address how to handle multiple competing hypotheses or models - should each hypothesis have its own transition schedule or should transitions be coordinated? <a href="../results/extraction-result-2481.html#e2481.5" class="evidence-link">[e2481.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2482.html#e2482.1" class="evidence-link">[e2482.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Optimal transitions in safety-critical domains where exploration has costs beyond information (potential damage, safety violations) are not characterized <a href="../results/extraction-result-2476.html#e2476.0" class="evidence-link">[e2476.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How transitions should adapt when the objective function is non-stationary or adversarial (changing over time) is not addressed <a href="../results/extraction-result-2491.html#e2491.4" class="evidence-link">[e2491.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction between transition timing and batch size in parallel evaluation settings needs characterization - larger batches may require earlier transitions <a href="../results/extraction-result-2622.html#e2622.0" class="evidence-link">[e2622.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2630.html#e2630.7" class="evidence-link">[e2630.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2635.html#e2635.6" class="evidence-link">[e2635.6]</a> </li>
