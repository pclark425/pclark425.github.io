                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Cross-Disciplinary Law Synthesis in Peer Review</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by virtue of their broad training and contextual understanding, can synthesize higher-order laws that capture both universal and field-specific reviewer feedback principles. The theory asserts that LLMs can distinguish between generalizable feedback laws and those that are discipline- or venue-specific, enabling the mapping of the 'lawscape' of peer review across the sciences.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover emerging feedback laws in rapidly evolving fields (e.g., AI ethics) before they are codified by journals.</li>
                <li>LLMs could reveal that some feedback laws are converging or diverging across disciplines over time.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>If LLM-constructed lawscapes do not match expert-curated mappings, the theory's validity is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of non-textual review elements (e.g., reviewer identity, social networks) on lawscape mapping is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
