                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the epistemic validity of LLM-generated scientific theories is a function of the independence, transparency, and reproducibility of the evaluation process. It introduces laws relating the structure of evaluation protocols to the likelihood of epistemic contamination, and provides criteria for maximizing the trustworthiness of scientific knowledge produced by LLMs.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>LLM-generated theories evaluated by independent panels will have higher reproducibility scores than those evaluated by the same team that generated them.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist optimal points on the transparency-contamination curve where both validity and openness are maximized.</li>
                <li>Novel evaluation protocols (e.g., cryptographically blinded review) may outperform traditional methods in both validity and transparency.</li>
                <li>Automated, LLM-based evaluators may introduce new forms of contamination not present in human-only review.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If open evaluation protocols do not increase contamination risk, the tradeoff law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If independence of evaluation does not improve epistemic validity, the independence law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If reproducibility is not higher in independently evaluated LLM-generated theories, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of automated evaluators (e.g., LLMs as reviewers) is not explicitly addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of adversarial attacks or prompt injection on evaluation integrity is not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends established epistemic principles to a new domain with novel formalization and explicit application to LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation.</p>
