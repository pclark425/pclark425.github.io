                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Compression Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by compressing and synthesizing the epistemic state of a scientific field as represented in their training data. The model's internal representations encode the distribution of hypotheses, open questions, and research trajectories, allowing it to infer the likelihood of specific discoveries based on the density and convergence of relevant signals.</p>
