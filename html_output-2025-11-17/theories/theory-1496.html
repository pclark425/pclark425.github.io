                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Contextualization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the functional format of conceptual knowledge in brains is inherently dynamic and context-sensitive. Rather than being stored as static entities, concepts are constructed on-the-fly through the interaction of long-term knowledge, current goals, and environmental context. The representational format is thus a process: concepts are temporary, contextually-tuned assemblies of features, relations, and affective/motivational states, allowing for rapid adaptation and flexible inference.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Changing task goals will predictably shift which features are activated for a given concept, observable in both behavior and neuroimaging.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training individuals to flexibly shift conceptual features will enhance their ability to adapt to novel tasks.</li>
                <li>Individuals with deficits in executive function will show less flexible, more rigid conceptual representations.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual representations remain static across different contexts and goals, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If context and goals do not modulate feature selection, the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The theory does not specify how stable, long-term conceptual knowledge is maintained alongside dynamic construction. </li>
