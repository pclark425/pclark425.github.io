                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as a Dynamic Calibration-Bias Tradeoff</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LLMs) engaging in iterative self-reflection operate on a dynamic tradeoff between calibration (error correction and uncertainty reduction) and bias amplification (reinforcement of initial errors or overconfidence). The process is governed by the interaction between the model's internal uncertainty estimates, the diversity of reflection prompts, and the feedback loop created by repeated self-evaluation. The theory predicts that optimal answer quality is achieved when the reflection process adaptively balances these forces, and that both under- and over-reflection can degrade performance.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There exists an optimal number of self-reflection iterations for each task, beyond which answer quality plateaus or declines.</li>
                <li>Introducing diversity in reflection prompts across iterations will yield better calibration and answer quality than using a single prompt repeatedly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For highly ambiguous or open-ended tasks, the optimal calibration-bias balance point may shift dynamically during reflection.</li>
                <li>In some domains, increasing reflection diversity may paradoxically increase bias if the prompts are misaligned with the error profile.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing the number of reflection iterations always improves answer quality, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If prompt diversity does not affect calibration or bias, the reflection diversity law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where answer improvement occurs with minimal or no reflection diversity, possibly due to strong prior knowledge in the model. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
