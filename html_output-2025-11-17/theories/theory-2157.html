                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Mission-Focused Instruction Tuning for Robust Open Information Extraction (General Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be systematically tuned using mission-focused instructions—explicit, context-rich prompts that encode the goals and constraints of a scientific theory distillation task—to robustly extract, synthesize, and abstract theories from large corpora of scholarly papers. The theory asserts that such tuning enables LLMs to generalize across domains, handle noisy or conflicting evidence, and produce structured, testable scientific laws.</p>
