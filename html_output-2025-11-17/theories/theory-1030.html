                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Constraint Satisfaction in Language Model Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) solve spatially-structured puzzle games (such as Sudoku) by leveraging distributed representations of constraints and candidate solutions, enabling emergent constraint satisfaction through token-level prediction. Rather than explicit symbolic reasoning, LLMs implicitly encode puzzle rules and spatial relationships in their weights, allowing them to generate valid solutions by predicting sequences that are statistically likely to satisfy all constraints.</p>
