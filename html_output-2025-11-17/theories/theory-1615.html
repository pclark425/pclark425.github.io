                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1615</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Contextualization Theory of LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by their ability to dynamically contextualize queries within the latent structure of the subdomain, integrating both explicit and implicit cues from the prompt, prior conversation, and model state. The theory asserts that context integration—across temporal, topical, and epistemic dimensions—enables LLMs to simulate subdomain reasoning processes, and that failures in context integration are a primary source of simulation inaccuracy.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law formalizes a mechanism that is observed but not previously theorized in this way.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context window limitations and prompt specificity are known to affect LLM accuracy.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between context integration failure and simulation inaccuracy in scientific subdomains is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Providing LLMs with richer, multi-turn context will improve simulation accuracy in scientific subdomains.</li>
                <li>Explicitly encoding subdomain context in prompts will yield higher accuracy than generic prompts.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are given access to external memory or context augmentation tools, simulation accuracy may increase beyond current limits.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained to dynamically infer missing context from minimal cues, they may achieve high simulation accuracy even with sparse prompts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy without any explicit or implicit subdomain context, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If context window limitations do not affect simulation accuracy, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs sometimes generalize to new subdomains with minimal context, possibly via emergent reasoning. </li>
