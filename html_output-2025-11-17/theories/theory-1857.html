                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Induced Calibration Distortion Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the act of prompting large language models (LLMs) to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries systematically distorts their internal calibration, due to the interaction between prompt structure, model priors, and the model's exposure to training data. The theory asserts that LLMs' probability estimates are not direct reflections of real-world likelihoods, but are shaped by prompt-induced biases and the model's learned distributional knowledge, leading to systematic over- or under-estimation of true probabilities.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs produce identical, well-calibrated probability estimates regardless of prompt structure, this theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs accurately estimate the likelihood of future discoveries that are highly dissimilar to anything in their training data, the theory's claim about training distribution bias would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates for future scientific discoveries are invariant to both prompt structure and training data coverage, the theory would be falsified.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs are explicitly calibrated post-hoc using external data or human feedback, which may mitigate prompt-induced distortion. </li>
    <li>LLMs with explicit uncertainty quantification modules or external calibration layers may not follow the same distortion patterns. </li>
