                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents (General Theory 1)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the utility of memory in LLM agents for text games is fundamentally determined by the alignment between the agent's memory mechanisms and the underlying causal and temporal dependencies of the task. Memory is most beneficial when it enables the agent to bridge gaps in observability, track non-local dependencies, and reconstruct hidden or evolving world states that are not directly accessible from the current observation.</p>
