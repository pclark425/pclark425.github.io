                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory of LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs distill scientific theories from large corpora by iteratively abstracting general patterns from evidence, then refining these abstractions through targeted re-examination of exceptions, contradictions, or new data. The process alternates between high-level synthesis and low-level correction, enabling the LLM to converge on robust, generalizable theories that account for both the majority of evidence and important outliers.</p>
