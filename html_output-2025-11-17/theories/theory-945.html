                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory provides a quantitative law relating the expected utility of memory for LLM agents in text games to the mutual information between past observations and future rewards, conditioned on the task's dependency structure. The theory predicts that the optimal memory system is one that maximizes the conditional mutual information between stored memory and future task-relevant outcomes.</p>
