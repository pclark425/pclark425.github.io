                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1649</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Alignment and Representation Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is determined by the degree of alignment between the model's internal representations and the ontological structure of the target scientific subdomain. The more closely the LLM's learned representations and reasoning patterns match the formal and conceptual structure of the subdomain, the higher the simulation accuracy. Misalignment leads to systematic errors, hallucinations, or failures in domain-specific reasoning.</p>
