                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Decomposition and Iterative Composition Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve strict logical reasoning by decomposing complex prompts into atomic subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then iteratively composing the solutions. The process is governed by explicit control over decomposition, solution isolation, and composition, ensuring that error propagation is minimized and logical consistency is maintained throughout the reasoning chain.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If decomposition and composition are learned end-to-end during LM training, models may develop internal representations that mimic explicit logical reasoning.</li>
                <li>If atomic subproblem isolation is applied recursively to very deep reasoning chains, LMs may solve problems previously unsolvable by end-to-end approaches.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs perform equally well on complex logical tasks without decomposition and composition, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If error rates do not increase when error containment mechanisms are removed, the law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Some LMs may have emergent robustness to error propagation even without explicit decomposition or validation. </li>
