                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop internal, symbolic-like representations and manipulations for arithmetic operations, despite being trained only on next-token prediction. These emergent representations allow LLMs to perform arithmetic by simulating algorithmic processes similar to those used in symbolic computation, such as carrying in addition or borrowing in subtraction, even though these processes are not explicitly programmed.</p>

                <li>LLMs trained on corrupted arithmetic data will develop correspondingly corrupted internal representations, which can be detected via probing.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on languages with different arithmetic conventions (e.g., right-to-left scripts) will develop different internal symbolic representations.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on adversarial arithmetic data (e.g., with systematic errors), their internal representations will reflect these errors in a structured way.</li>
                <li>LLMs with architectural modifications (e.g., recurrent connections) may develop more robust or different symbolic representations for arithmetic.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize to arithmetic expressions with novel digit lengths, this would challenge the theory of emergent symbolic reasoning.</li>
                <li>If probing fails to reveal any structured internal representation during arithmetic, this would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' arithmetic performance is entirely explained by memorization of seen examples, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs perform poorly on arithmetic tasks despite large scale, suggesting other factors (e.g., architecture, training data) are involved. </li>
    <li>LLMs sometimes make systematic errors on arithmetic tasks that do not correspond to any known symbolic algorithm. </li>
