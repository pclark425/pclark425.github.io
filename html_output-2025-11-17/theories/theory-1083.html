                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Spatial Reasoning from Implicit Constraint Propagation in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when exposed to spatial puzzles during training, develop emergent spatial reasoning abilities through implicit constraint propagation. Rather than explicitly representing spatial layouts, the models learn to propagate constraints through their attention and representation mechanisms, enabling them to enforce global consistency and solve spatial puzzles.</p>
