                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Selective Vulnerability and Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resilience of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined not only by intrinsic molecular factors but also by their position and function within cortical microcircuits. Neurons with high synaptic connectivity, metabolic demand, or excitatory drive are more susceptible to pathology due to increased exposure to toxic species and metabolic stress, while sparsely connected or inhibitory neurons are relatively protected.</p>
