                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1560</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Manipulation for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by exploiting quantum vacuum effects, such as the Casimir effect or vacuum polarization, to locally alter the properties of spacetime. By engineering regions of reduced or negative energy density using advanced materials and field configurations, it may be possible to create spacetime geometries that permit effective FTL motion. The approach leverages recent advances in quantum field theory, nanotechnology, and high-intensity lasers, aiming for realizable experiments and prototypes within current or near-future budgets.</p>
