                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Cognitive Simulation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when prompted to reflect, simulate a form of internal cognitive process analogous to human metacognition. Through iterative generate-then-reflect cycles, the model constructs and updates an internal representation of its own reasoning, enabling it to identify and correct errors, fill knowledge gaps, and improve answer quality. The process is emergent from the model's architecture and training, and does not require explicit meta-learning modules.</p>
