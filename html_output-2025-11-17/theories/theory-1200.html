                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Emergent Chemical Space Exploration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by virtue of their large-scale training on diverse chemical and scientific corpora, can interpolate and extrapolate within chemical space, enabling the synthesis of novel chemicals that occupy previously unexplored regions. The emergent representations in LLMs allow for the generation of molecules that are not only novel but also optimized for specific, potentially multi-objective, application criteria.</p>
