                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Order Entropy Selection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about variability and reproducibility in language model-driven scientific experimentation.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ordering of components within prompts for language model-driven scientific experiments can be systematically optimized by measuring and selecting based on output entropy patterns. The theory posits that: (1) different orderings of identical prompt components produce measurably different output entropy distributions, (2) these entropy patterns are stable and reproducible within a given model, (3) entropy levels correlate with specific experimental objectives (low entropy for reproducible data extraction, high entropy for creative hypothesis generation), and (4) systematic entropy-based selection of prompt orderings can improve both reproducibility and task performance compared to intuitive or random ordering choices. The theory provides a quantitative framework for what has traditionally been an ad-hoc aspect of prompt engineering in scientific applications.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Different orderings of identical prompt components produce statistically distinguishable output entropy distributions when measured across multiple samples.</li>
                <li>For a given model and task, entropy patterns associated with specific prompt orderings are stable across repeated measurements with sufficient sample sizes.</li>
                <li>Low-entropy orderings (producing more consistent, focused outputs) are optimal for reproducibility-critical scientific tasks such as structured data extraction, classification, and standardized analysis.</li>
                <li>High-entropy orderings (producing more diverse, varied outputs) are optimal for exploratory scientific tasks such as hypothesis generation, brainstorming, and creative problem-solving.</li>
                <li>The relationship between prompt ordering and output entropy is model-specific but exhibits consistent patterns within model families and architectures.</li>
                <li>Systematic entropy-based selection of prompt orderings outperforms random selection and naive intuitive ordering in terms of task-appropriate performance metrics.</li>
                <li>The entropy-ordering relationship can be characterized through empirical measurement, requiring sample sizes proportional to the desired measurement precision.</li>
                <li>Entropy-guided prompt ordering selection reduces experimenter degrees of freedom and improves inter-researcher reproducibility in language model experiments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prompt engineering and the specific structure of prompts significantly affects language model performance and output characteristics in scientific and reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Language model outputs exhibit measurable uncertainty and entropy that can be quantified and used for reliability assessment. </li>
    <li>Reproducibility in NLP and language model experiments is affected by methodological choices including prompt design, and systematic approaches are needed. </li>
    <li>Order and sequence effects in language models demonstrate that the arrangement of information affects model behavior and outputs. </li>
    <li>Entropy and information-theoretic measures have been successfully used to guide optimization and selection in machine learning contexts. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When testing 10+ different orderings of the same prompt components, entropy measurements will show coefficient of variation >0.2, indicating meaningful differences between orderings.</li>
                <li>For data extraction tasks, selecting the lowest-entropy ordering from a set of candidates will improve inter-run consistency by 20-40% compared to random ordering selection.</li>
                <li>For hypothesis generation tasks, selecting higher-entropy orderings will increase output diversity metrics by 30-50% while maintaining relevance.</li>
                <li>Entropy rankings of prompt orderings will show >0.7 Spearman correlation when measured on the same model at different times with sufficient sample sizes (n>20).</li>
                <li>Researchers using entropy-guided ordering selection will achieve higher inter-researcher agreement (Cohen's kappa >0.7) compared to intuitive ordering selection (kappa ~0.4-0.5).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether entropy-based ordering selection transfers across different model families (e.g., orderings optimized for GPT-4 also being optimal for Claude or LLaMA) or requires model-specific optimization.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal entropy level for a given task type can be predicted a priori from task characteristics, or must be determined empirically for each new task.</li>
                <li>Whether combining entropy-based selection with other prompt optimization objectives (e.g., accuracy, fairness, computational efficiency) creates synergies or requires trade-off balancing.</li>
                <li>Whether fine-tuned or domain-adapted models show different entropy-ordering relationships compared to base models, potentially requiring recalibration.</li>
                <li>Whether the benefits of entropy-guided ordering persist or diminish as language models become more capable and potentially more robust to prompt variations.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-objective entropy optimization (simultaneously optimizing for multiple entropy characteristics) can further improve performance beyond single-metric optimization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If entropy measurements for the same prompt ordering show high instability (test-retest correlation <0.5) even with large sample sizes (n>50), the theory's assumption of stable entropy patterns would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If randomly selected prompt orderings consistently match or outperform entropy-optimized orderings on task performance metrics across multiple tasks, the practical utility of the theory would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If low-entropy orderings do not produce more reproducible outputs, or high-entropy orderings do not produce more diverse outputs, the core entropy-objective relationship would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If different researchers applying the same entropy-based selection procedure to the same task select dramatically different orderings, the objectivity and reliability of the approach would be compromised.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of entropy measurement and ordering selection exceeds the cost of the actual experiments by more than an order of magnitude, the practical applicability would be severely limited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The interaction between prompt ordering effects and other prompt design factors such as wording choice, formatting, and delimiter selection. </li>
    <li>How entropy-based ordering selection applies to multi-turn conversational experiments where the prompt structure evolves dynamically across turns. </li>
    <li>The relationship between prompt component granularity (how finely prompts are decomposed) and the effectiveness of entropy-based ordering selection. </li>
    <li>Whether certain types of prompt components (e.g., instructions vs. examples vs. context) have stronger ordering effects than others. </li>
    <li>How to handle cases where multiple orderings produce statistically indistinguishable entropy levels. </li>
