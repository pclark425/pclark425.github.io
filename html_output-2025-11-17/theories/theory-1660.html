                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Tool-Augmented Simulation: Externalization of Domain-Specific Reasoning and Computation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy and reliability of LLM-based scientific simulation are fundamentally determined by the degree to which external tools can externalize, represent, and compute the domain-specific reasoning processes required for the task. The theory asserts that LLMs, when augmented with tools that encode the formal structures, representations, and computational procedures of a scientific subdomain, can achieve simulation accuracy approaching that of domain experts. Conversely, when such externalization is incomplete or misaligned, simulation accuracy is limited by the LLM's internal representations and generalization capacity.</p>
