                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be dynamically adapted to the context of use, including the scientific domain, the intended downstream task, and the risk profile of the application. It posits that static evaluation rubrics are insufficient, and that evaluation criteria must be re-weighted or redefined based on the evolving scientific context, the novelty of the theory, and the calibration of the LLM's confidence. The theory further claims that only through such dynamic, context-sensitive evaluation can the true scientific value and risks of LLM-generated theories be accurately assessed.</p>
