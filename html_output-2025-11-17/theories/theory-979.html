                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Compression Theory for LLM Agent Memory in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by dynamically selecting, compressing, and prioritizing memory content based on contextual relevance to current goals and game state. The agent maintains a memory buffer that adaptively encodes salient events, objects, and rules, using relevance-driven compression and retrieval mechanisms to maximize utility within limited memory resources.</p>

                <li>If agents with compressed memory consistently lose to agents with full, uncompressed memory in long-horizon games, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
