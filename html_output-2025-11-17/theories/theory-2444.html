                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection-Dependent Vulnerability Theory (Metabolic-Activity Emphasis)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the interplay between their network connectivity, projection patterns, and metabolic activity. Neurons with high synaptic throughput, extensive long-range projections, and elevated metabolic rates are more susceptible to toxic protein accumulation due to increased protein turnover, oxidative stress, and exposure to trans-synaptically spreading pathology.</p>
