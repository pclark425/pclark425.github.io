                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Empirical Rule Synthesis and Feature Abstraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that large language models (LLMs), when pretrained on extensive scientific literature, can synthesize empirical rules and abstract feature-based relationships that capture both explicit and latent domain knowledge. These rules, often in the form of measurable features, statistical associations, or interpretable descriptors, can be transcribed into feature functions for downstream interpretable modeling. The process enables the distillation of actionable, human-interpretable knowledge from vast, heterogeneous corpora, even when explicit equations are not present in the literature. The theory further posits that LLMs can infer novel, statistically significant rules from labeled data, some of which may not be present in existing literature, thus expanding the frontier of empirical scientific understanding.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs pretrained on domain-specific literature will be able to synthesize empirically valid and interpretable rules for new scientific tasks in that domain, even when explicit equations are not present in the literature.</li>
                <li>Data-inferred rules generated by LLMs will include a nontrivial fraction of novel, statistically significant features that improve model performance and are later validated by domain experts.</li>
                <li>LLM-driven feature abstraction pipelines will outperform classical feature engineering and black-box ML models in terms of interpretability and, in many cases, predictive accuracy.</li>
                <li>LLMs can be used to rapidly generate structured datasets from unstructured literature, enabling new empirical modeling pipelines in domains with previously fragmented data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize rules that reveal previously unknown mechanisms or causal relationships in complex scientific domains, leading to new scientific insights.</li>
                <li>The combination of literature-synthesized and data-inferred rules may enable the discovery of cross-domain or interdisciplinary laws that are not apparent from single-domain analysis.</li>
                <li>LLMs could autonomously generate feature abstractions that anticipate future scientific discoveries, as seen in unsupervised word embedding models predicting material applications.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize rule synthesis to domains with sparse or noisy literature, provided sufficient transfer learning or cross-domain pretraining.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-synthesized rules are consistently non-significant, non-interpretable, or fail to improve downstream model performance compared to classical feature engineering, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If data-inferred rules from LLMs are predominantly spurious or overfit to the training data, with little generalization or expert validation, the theory's claim of novel discovery is weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs pretrained on literature in a given domain fail to synthesize known, established rules for that domain, the literature-synthesis law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLM-driven pipelines fail to outperform or match classical ML baselines in predictive accuracy or interpretability across a range of scientific tasks, the theory's generality is challenged.</li>
