                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs function as dynamic engines for distilling qualitative laws from large, heterogeneous sets of scholarly papers. By leveraging their ability to model context, resolve terminological differences, and perform analogical mapping, LLMs can extract, reconcile, and articulate underlying regularities even when these are expressed in diverse forms across disciplines.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Given papers from chemistry and materials science describing phase transitions, an LLM will extract a generalized law about state changes that applies to both.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may distill a law from disparate fields (e.g., linguistics and genetics) that reveals a previously unrecognized structural similarity.</li>
                <li>Dynamic law distillation may enable LLMs to propose new, testable hypotheses that bridge currently disconnected scientific domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot reconcile terminology and fail to extract shared laws from analogous descriptions, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If analogical mapping does not lead to the distillation of generalized laws, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of LLMs' analogical reasoning and the fidelity of law distillation in highly technical or formal domains are not fully understood. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work frames LLMs as dynamic law distillation engines; this is a new theoretical perspective.</p>
