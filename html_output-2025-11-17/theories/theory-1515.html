                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Contextual Modulation of Functional Coactivation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that while stable coactivation patterns define core conceptual units, the representational format of conceptual knowledge is dynamically modulated by context, task demands, and recent experience. Thus, concept individuation is achieved by a core stable coactivation pattern, surrounded by a flexible, context-sensitive 'halo' of additional coactivations. This allows for both stability and adaptability in conceptual representation, accounting for context effects and conceptual flexibility.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the mechanisms by which the core and halo interact or are learned. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how new concepts are formed or how the core-halo boundary is established. </li>
