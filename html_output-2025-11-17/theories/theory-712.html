                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging statistical regularities in their training data, matching input patterns to output patterns without explicit symbolic computation. The models learn frequent co-occurrences of arithmetic expressions and their results, and use these learned associations to generate answers, especially for simple or common arithmetic problems.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is prompted with arithmetic expressions that are frequent in its training data, it will answer correctly.</li>
                <li>If the training data is augmented with more examples of rare arithmetic expressions, performance on those expressions will improve.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained on synthetic arithmetic data with uniform coverage, it may develop more generalizable arithmetic abilities.</li>
                <li>If a model is prompted with arithmetic in a novel numeral system, performance will depend on the frequency of similar patterns in training.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model can solve arithmetic expressions it has never seen before with high accuracy, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If performance on rare arithmetic expressions is as high as on frequent ones, the theory would be called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Some LMs show partial generalization to novel arithmetic expressions, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond pattern matching. </li>
