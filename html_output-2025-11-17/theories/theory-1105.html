                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint Propagation and Explicit State Tracking Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models can best perform strict logical reasoning when they are equipped with mechanisms for explicit state tracking and constraint propagation. The theory asserts that logical reasoning in LMs is fundamentally limited by their ability to represent and update the state of variables and constraints over the course of multi-step inference, and that augmenting LMs with explicit state representations and constraint propagation modules enables more reliable and interpretable logical reasoning.</p>
