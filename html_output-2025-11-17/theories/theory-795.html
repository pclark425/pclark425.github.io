                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Prioritization for Efficient Task Solving in Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by organizing their memories into a hierarchy of priorities based on relevance, recency, and utility. The agent continuously evaluates and reorders its memory contents, ensuring that the most task-relevant and high-utility memories are most accessible. This prioritization enables efficient retrieval, reduces cognitive overload, and supports both short-term adaptation and long-term knowledge accumulation.</p>
