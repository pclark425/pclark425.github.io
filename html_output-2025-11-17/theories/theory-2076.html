                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Human Collaboration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most robust quantitative law discovery from scholarly literature occurs through an iterative process in which LLMs generate candidate laws, which are then evaluated, critiqued, and refined by human experts. The LLM acts as a generator and aggregator of hypotheses, while humans provide domain knowledge, error correction, and experimental validation, resulting in a feedback loop that converges on accurate, generalizable quantitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-human collaboration may enable the discovery of laws in fields where neither LLMs nor humans have previously succeeded, due to synergistic effects.</li>
                <li>The process may reveal new classes of quantitative laws that are not easily accessible to either party alone, such as highly non-linear or multi-modal relationships.</li>
                <li>The iterative process may uncover systematic biases in either LLM or human reasoning, leading to meta-theoretical insights.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative LLM-human collaboration does not outperform LLMs or humans alone in law discovery tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If human feedback does not lead to measurable improvements in the accuracy or generalizability of LLM-generated laws, the theory's mechanism would be in doubt.</li>
                <li>If the process converges on incorrect or non-generalizable laws despite multiple refinement cycles, the theory's assumptions would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of human bias or error in the feedback loop is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The effect of LLM training data limitations on the diversity and novelty of generated laws is not explicitly modeled. </li>
