                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Conditional Chemical Synthesis Theory (General: Constraint-Driven Generative Optimization)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when provided with explicit application-specific constraints (e.g., target properties, synthetic accessibility, regulatory requirements), can act as generative optimizers that search chemical space for novel molecules and synthetic routes. The LLM's internal representations and output distributions are dynamically shaped by these constraints, enabling the generation of candidate chemicals that are both novel and tailored to the specified application.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel chemical scaffolds that satisfy complex, multi-dimensional constraints not previously explored by humans.</li>
                <li>Dynamic constraint shaping may enable LLMs to generalize to entirely new classes of chemical problems.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate molecules that satisfy explicit constraints, the constraint-driven generation law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot adapt their outputs in response to new constraints, the dynamic representation shaping law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the limits of LLMs in handling conflicting or infeasible constraints. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle constraints that require deep chemical reasoning beyond their training data. </li>
