                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented in a distributed, multimodal format, where concepts are grounded in sensory, motor, affective, and contextual systems. Conceptual representations are thus not amodal symbols, but are constituted by the partial reactivation of modality-specific systems that were involved in the original acquisition and use of the concept.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Disruption of a specific modality (e.g., via TMS) will selectively impair conceptual processing for concepts grounded in that modality.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial systems with multimodal input and distributed representations will better match human conceptual processing than unimodal or amodal systems.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual processing does not involve reactivation of modality-specific systems, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If patients with modality-specific lesions show no conceptual deficits, the theory would be undermined.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how multimodal information is integrated into a unified conceptual representation. </li>
