                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Driven Memory Modulation Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language model agents can best use memory by modulating encoding, retrieval, and updating processes in response to explicit and implicit task signals, such as uncertainty, novelty, or feedback. By adaptively tuning memory operations to the current task context, agents maximize relevant information retention and minimize interference, leading to superior task performance and generalization.</p>
