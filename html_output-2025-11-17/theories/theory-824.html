                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Utilization Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically leveraging a hierarchy of memory types—short-term (context window), episodic (task-specific), and semantic (general knowledge)—with adaptive retrieval and consolidation mechanisms. The agent allocates memory access based on task demands, recency, and relevance, balancing efficiency and accuracy.</p>
