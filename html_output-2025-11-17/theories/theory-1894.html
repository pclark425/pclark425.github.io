                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format-Driven Dynamic Computation Pathways Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the presentation format of a prompt dynamically selects among multiple latent computation pathways within an LLM. Different formats (e.g., stepwise, list, narrative) activate distinct subnetworks or processing modes, leading to divergent reasoning, memory retrieval, and output generation behaviors. The prompt format thus acts as a switch or selector for internal model dynamics.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is presented in a novel format, the LLM will activate a new or hybrid computation pathway, leading to distinct output behaviors.</li>
                <li>If the same question is asked in stepwise and narrative formats, the LLM will produce different reasoning chains and error types.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If pathway activation is externally manipulated (e.g., via model surgery), it may be possible to force the LLM to use a non-default reasoning style.</li>
                <li>If multiple formats are combined in a single prompt, the LLM may exhibit emergent, hybrid reasoning behaviors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show different internal activations or outputs for different prompt formats, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If output structure and reasoning are invariant to prompt format, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how pretraining or fine-tuning data distributions constrain available computation pathways. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
