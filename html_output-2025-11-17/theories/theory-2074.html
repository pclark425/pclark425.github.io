                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can synthesize emergent quantitative laws by identifying, abstracting, and generalizing recurring mathematical relationships and empirical regularities across disparate sources. The process leverages the LLM's ability to represent, align, and interpolate between formal and informal scientific statements, enabling the distillation of new, previously unarticulated quantitative laws.</p>

    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to extract and generalize mathematical relationships from text, as seen in tasks like equation extraction and symbolic regression from scientific literature. </li>
    <li>Meta-analyses and systematic reviews by humans often reveal new quantitative laws by aggregating results across studies; LLMs can automate and scale this process. </li>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to perform symbolic regression and equation discovery from textual and tabular data, indicating capacity for abstraction beyond rote extraction. </li>

<ol>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize entirely novel quantitative laws in fields where no single paper contains the full relationship, but the law is implicit in the aggregate data.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially identify higher-order or non-linear relationships that have eluded human meta-analyses, especially in complex, high-dimensional scientific domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to synthesize known quantitative laws from a corpus where the law is distributed across papers, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to align semantically equivalent variables across papers, the theory's mechanism would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of data quality, publication bias, and contradictory findings on the LLM's ability to synthesize accurate laws is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
