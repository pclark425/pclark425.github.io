                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM Literature-Driven Feature Rule Synthesis in Molecular Sciences: General Theory of Iterative Law Refinement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when used iteratively with expanding literature corpora and feedback from experimental validation, can refine, correct, and expand molecular feature–property laws over time. The process involves LLMs proposing candidate laws, which are then tested experimentally or computationally, with results fed back into the LLM for further refinement, leading to a self-improving cycle of scientific discovery.</p>
