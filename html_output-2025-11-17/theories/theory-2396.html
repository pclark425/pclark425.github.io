                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Cellular Proteostasis and Metabolic Adaptation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is governed by intrinsic molecular resilience, defined by the cell's proteostasis capacity and metabolic adaptation. Neurons with robust proteostasis networks (chaperones, autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system) and adaptive metabolic profiles (mitochondrial efficiency, antioxidant defenses) are more resistant to proteotoxic stress, while those with weaker systems are more vulnerable.</p>
