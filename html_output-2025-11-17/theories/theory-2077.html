                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Quantitative Law Extraction via LLM-Driven Pattern Aggregation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large corpora of scholarly papers, can autonomously identify, aggregate, and generalize recurring quantitative patterns, leading to the emergence of new, previously unrecognized quantitative laws. The process leverages the LLM's ability to detect statistical regularities, analogies, and latent structures across diverse scientific texts, enabling the synthesis of cross-domain laws that may not be apparent to human experts.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will propose quantitative laws that generalize across traditionally separate scientific domains.</li>
                <li>The frequency of emergent, cross-domain laws will increase with the size and diversity of the input corpus.</li>
                <li>LLMs will identify previously unrecognized analogies between fields (e.g., biology and physics) leading to new quantitative insights.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover universal quantitative laws that apply to complex systems regardless of domain.</li>
                <li>Emergent laws may reveal new mathematical structures or symmetries not previously described in the literature.</li>
                <li>LLMs may synthesize laws that challenge or extend current scientific paradigms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate any novel or cross-domain quantitative laws from large corpora, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the proposed laws are consistently trivial, incorrect, or already known, the theory's novelty claim would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot aggregate patterns beyond superficial similarities, the theory's mechanism would be in doubt.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the validation or falsification of emergent laws. </li>
    <li>Potential for LLMs to overfit to spurious correlations in the literature is not explicitly considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The underlying capabilities are established, but the specific emergent law synthesis is new.</p>
