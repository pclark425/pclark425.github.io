                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1589</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering for FTL Spacecraft</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by engineering spacetime metrics around a spacecraft using currently plausible, though highly challenging, energy densities and advanced metamaterials. By locally contracting and expanding spacetime (as in the Alcubierre drive concept), a spacecraft could effectively move between two points faster than light would in normal spacetime, without violating local causality or special relativity. The theory explores how near-term advances in energy generation, negative energy density analogues, and spacetime manipulation could make such a drive feasible within realistic budgets.</p>
