                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory: Dynamic Adaptation Law for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory asserts that the effectiveness of evaluator-LLM coupling is maximized when the coupling dynamically adapts to the evolving state of the generative process and the complexity of the scientific domain. The theory posits that static or rigid coupling strategies are suboptimal, and that adaptive feedback—responsive to both LLM uncertainty and evaluator expertise—yields superior scientific theories.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If static coupling strategies consistently outperform adaptive ones, the dynamic adaptation law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLM uncertainty signals do not correlate with the need for evaluator intervention, the uncertainty-responsive intervention law is called into question.</li>
