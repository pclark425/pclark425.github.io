                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Spatial Knowledge Representation Hierarchy Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models encode and utilize spatial, procedural, and object-relational knowledge for embodied planning tasks without direct sensory input.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models encode spatial knowledge for embodied planning through a hierarchical representation system with multiple levels of abstraction. At the lowest level, the model represents fine-grained spatial relations between objects (e.g., 'on', 'in', 'next to', 'above'). At intermediate levels, it represents spatial regions and containers (e.g., 'kitchen', 'drawer', 'table surface') that group objects and relations. At the highest level, it represents abstract spatial schemas and layouts (e.g., 'typical kitchen layout', 'standard room configuration'). During planning, the model dynamically navigates this hierarchy, using high-level schemas to guide search and constraint satisfaction, intermediate-level regions to organize object locations, and low-level relations to specify precise spatial configurations. This hierarchical organization enables efficient reasoning by allowing the model to operate at the appropriate level of abstraction for each planning subtask, and to propagate constraints bidirectionally through the hierarchy. The theory posits that this hierarchy emerges implicitly from statistical regularities in linguistic descriptions of spatial arrangements and embodied activities in the training data.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spatial knowledge is organized in at least three hierarchical levels: fine-grained relations, intermediate regions/containers, and abstract schemas.</li>
                <li>Higher levels of the hierarchy encode more abstract and context-dependent spatial information, while lower levels encode more precise and context-independent relations.</li>
                <li>During planning, the model selects the appropriate hierarchical level based on task requirements and available information.</li>
                <li>Constraints propagate bidirectionally through the hierarchy: high-level schemas constrain possible low-level configurations, and low-level impossibilities rule out high-level plans.</li>
                <li>The hierarchy enables compositional generalization by allowing novel combinations of spatial elements at different levels.</li>
                <li>Spatial regions at intermediate levels serve as 'working spaces' that organize and chunk multiple object-relation bindings.</li>
                <li>Abstract schemas at the highest level capture statistical regularities about typical spatial arrangements in different contexts (e.g., kitchens, offices, outdoor spaces).</li>
                <li>The model can perform hierarchical search by first reasoning at abstract levels to identify promising spatial configurations, then refining to lower levels.</li>
                <li>Ambiguous or underspecified spatial descriptions are resolved by filling in details from higher-level schemas.</li>
                <li>The strength of hierarchical organization varies with domain familiarity, being stronger for common spatial contexts encountered frequently in training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Language models demonstrate understanding of spatial prepositions and relations at multiple scales, from fine-grained object relations to room-level organization. </li>
    <li>Models can reason about containment hierarchies and nested spatial relations in embodied task descriptions. </li>
    <li>Language models show ability to infer typical spatial layouts and object locations based on scene context. </li>
    <li>Models demonstrate hierarchical reasoning in spatial question answering, moving between different levels of spatial granularity. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Models should show faster and more accurate planning when tasks can be decomposed into hierarchical spatial subgoals compared to tasks requiring flat spatial reasoning.</li>
                <li>When given partial spatial information, models should fill in missing details in ways consistent with typical spatial schemas for that context (e.g., assuming a refrigerator is in the kitchen if not specified).</li>
                <li>Models should demonstrate better performance on spatial planning tasks when the task description includes hierarchical spatial cues (e.g., 'in the kitchen, on the counter, next to the sink') compared to flat lists of relations.</li>
                <li>Errors in spatial reasoning should cluster at hierarchy boundaries, such as confusing which container an object is in while correctly identifying relations within containers.</li>
                <li>Models should show systematic differences in processing time or attention patterns when reasoning at different hierarchical levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether explicitly training models with hierarchically structured spatial descriptions would significantly improve their spatial reasoning capabilities compared to standard training is unknown but could reveal the importance of hierarchical structure.</li>
                <li>Whether models can dynamically adjust the granularity of their spatial representations based on task demands (e.g., using coarse representations for high-level planning, fine representations for execution) is uncertain but would indicate sophisticated hierarchical control.</li>
                <li>Whether the hierarchical structure transfers across different spatial domains (e.g., from indoor to outdoor environments, from physical to abstract spaces) is unknown but critical for generalization.</li>
                <li>Whether interventions that disrupt specific hierarchical levels (e.g., through adversarial prompts or activation editing) would show level-specific deficits in spatial reasoning is unknown but would provide strong evidence for the hierarchical organization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models show no performance difference between hierarchically structured and flat spatial task descriptions, this would challenge the claim that they utilize hierarchical representations.</li>
                <li>If spatial reasoning errors are randomly distributed rather than clustered at hierarchy boundaries, this would question the hierarchical organization hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If models cannot leverage high-level spatial schemas to fill in missing low-level details, this would challenge the bidirectional constraint propagation mechanism.</li>
                <li>If ablating or disrupting representations at one hierarchical level does not affect reasoning at other levels, this would question the integrated hierarchical structure.</li>
                <li>If models show equal difficulty with spatial reasoning across all scales and contexts, this would challenge the claim that hierarchy emerges from statistical regularities in training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how the model learns to segment continuous space into discrete regions and containers at the intermediate level. </li>
    <li>The mechanisms for handling conflicting spatial information across hierarchical levels are not fully specified. </li>
    <li>How the model represents and reasons about dynamic spatial changes (objects moving between regions) within the hierarchical framework is unclear. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how metric spatial information (distances, sizes, angles) is integrated with the hierarchical categorical structure. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
