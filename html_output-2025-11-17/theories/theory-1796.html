                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory (Meta-Scientific Dynamics)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when equipped with retrieval and probabilistic reasoning, can model the meta-dynamics of scientific discovery by tracking and integrating signals of research activity, funding, citation networks, and paradigm shifts. The LLM's probability estimates for future discoveries are thus not only based on content knowledge, but also on meta-scientific indicators and the structure of scientific communities.</p>
