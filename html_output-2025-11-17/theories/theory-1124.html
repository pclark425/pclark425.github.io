                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Structured Abstraction for Logical Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) perform strict logical reasoning most effectively when they internally construct and manipulate structured abstractions—such as symbolic representations, graphs, or logic circuits—rather than relying solely on distributed, unstructured representations. The theory asserts that the emergence, explicitness, and manipulability of such structures within the model's activations or intermediate states are critical determinants of logical reasoning performance, and that training regimes or architectures that encourage or expose such structures will yield superior logical reasoning capabilities.</p>
