                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (Cellular Stress Integration Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by the degree to which their intrinsic molecular pathways for stress response (including proteostasis, mitochondrial function, calcium buffering, and antioxidant defense) are functionally integrated. Neurons with tightly coupled stress response networks can rapidly adapt to and buffer pathological insults, while those with loosely connected or isolated pathways are more susceptible to damage.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Synthetic coupling of stress response modules in non-neuronal cells will confer resistance to Aβ and tau toxicity.</li>
                <li>Overexpression of a single stress response gene in an isolated pathway will not confer resistance unless integration is also increased.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with integrated stress response pathways are not more resistant to Aβ and tau-induced stress, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing pathway cross-talk does not alter resistance, the theory would be undermined.</li>

    <li>The influence of extrinsic factors (e.g., microglial activation, vascular dysfunction) is not directly addressed. </li>
