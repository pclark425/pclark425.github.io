                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by leveraging their internal high-dimensional latent spaces, which encode both chemical structure and functional property information, allowing them to generate candidate molecules that satisfy complex, multi-objective constraints described in natural language.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is prompted with a novel combination of functional requirements (e.g., 'a non-toxic, water-soluble dye for near-infrared imaging'), it will generate candidate molecules not present in its training data but consistent with the constraints.</li>
                <li>LLMs fine-tuned on both chemical and application-specific data will outperform those trained only on chemical data in generating application-relevant molecules.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generate entirely new classes of chemical scaffolds for applications where no known examples exist, potentially leading to the discovery of new chemical space.</li>
                <li>Prompting LLMs with abstract or poorly defined application requirements (e.g., 'a molecule that enables quantum computing at room temperature') may result in plausible but physically unrealizable molecules, or, unexpectedly, in viable candidates.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to generate molecules with the specified properties when prompted, the theory's claim about latent space navigation is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate only memorized or trivial variants of training data molecules, rather than novel structures, the theory's novelty claim is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The impact of training data biases on the diversity and novelty of generated molecules is not fully explained. </li>
