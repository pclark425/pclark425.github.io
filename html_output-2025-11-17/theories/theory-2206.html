                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories (General Quantitative Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the general coupling framework by proposing that the measurable quality (Q) of LLM-generated scientific theories is a quantitative function of the coupling strength (C) between the LLM's generative process and the evaluator's feedback process. The theory posits that there exists a non-linear, possibly optimal, regime of coupling that maximizes both validity and novelty of generated theories.</p>
