                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Curation and Utilization Principle for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The effectiveness of memory in LLM agents for text games is determined not only by the presence of memory structures (structured, episodic, or reflective), but critically by the curation, selection, and utilization mechanisms that govern what is stored, retrieved, and attended to. Unfiltered or excessive memory can degrade performance, while curated, context-relevant, and validated memory representations (e.g., tips, reflections, prioritized experience, or relevance-ranked retrieval) maximize the benefit of memory. The agent's ability to dynamically select and utilize memory based on task demands, context window constraints, and phase of operation (exploration vs. exploitation) is essential for robust, generalizable performance.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents that use relevance-ranked or prioritized memory retrieval will outperform those that use unfiltered or FIFO memory in long-horizon text games.</li>
                <li>Dynamically selecting which memory to retrieve or attend to (e.g., based on recency, importance, or context) will improve robustness to context window limits and task switching.</li>
                <li>Replacing full action history with a curated summary or validated tips will improve performance in instruction-tuned or context-limited LLM agents.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent that learns to optimize its own memory curation and retrieval policy (meta-memory) will outperform agents with fixed or heuristic memory selection.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple curation signals (e.g., recency, importance, relevance, and diversity) will yield superadditive gains in multi-agent or social deduction games.</li>
                <li>Dynamic memory selection mechanisms will enable agents to adapt to highly non-stationary or adversarial environments more effectively than static memory policies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If unfiltered or excessive memory (e.g., full action history, large experience pool) does not degrade performance relative to curated memory, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If dynamic memory selection does not improve robustness or adaptability over static memory policies, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If relevance-ranked retrieval does not outperform FIFO or random retrieval in long-horizon or multi-agent text games, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some agents (e.g., NAIL, LLM-DND-PREV-CTRL) achieve reasonable performance with simple or static memory, suggesting that curation is not always necessary for all tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3261.html#e3261.0" class="evidence-link">[e3261.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3268.html#e3268.2" class="evidence-link">[e3268.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain environments (e.g., with privileged information or short horizons) may not show strong effects of memory curation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3061.html#e3061.4" class="evidence-link">[e3061.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3272.html#e3272.4" class="evidence-link">[e3272.4]</a> </li>
