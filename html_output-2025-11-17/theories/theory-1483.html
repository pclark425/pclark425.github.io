                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuous spectrum from modal (sensory-motor grounded) to amodal (abstract, symbolic) formats, and that the brain can dynamically hybridize these formats depending on context, task demands, and learning history. Rather than being fixed, the representational format of a concept is fluid and can blend modal and amodal features, allowing for flexible, adaptive cognition.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends prior hybrid models by specifying the dynamic, context-driven blending of representational formats.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Contextual flexibility and some hybrid models are known, but not formalized as dynamic hybridization along a continuum.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law that hybridization is a dynamic, context-sensitive process that can blend modal and amodal features in real time is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Concepts with both strong sensory and abstract associations (e.g., 'music') will show co-activation of sensory and amodal brain regions, with the balance shifting based on task.</li>
                <li>Training in abstract reasoning will increase amodal activation for previously modal-dominant concepts.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring integration (e.g., analogical reasoning) will elicit hybrid neural signatures blending modal and amodal features.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially inducing hybridization (e.g., via TMS or neurofeedback) will enhance cognitive flexibility in novel problem-solving.</li>
                <li>Developmental trajectories will show increasing hybridization capacity with age and education.</li>
                <li>Cross-cultural differences in education will modulate the typical position of concepts on the continuum.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts are always represented in a fixed format regardless of context or task, the continuum and hybridization claims would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If no neural or behavioral evidence of hybridization is found even in integrative tasks, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise neural mechanisms for blending modal and amodal features are not fully specified. </li>
    <li>Some highly abstract concepts (e.g., mathematical symbols) may not show any modal activation, challenging the universality of the continuum. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
