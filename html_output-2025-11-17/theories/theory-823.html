                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Compression and Retrieval Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically compressing, abstracting, and retrieving memory traces based on task demands, context, and resource constraints. The theory asserts that agents must balance fidelity and efficiency by adaptively selecting what to store in high-fidelity (verbatim) versus low-fidelity (abstracted) memory, and by employing context-sensitive retrieval mechanisms that prioritize relevant information while minimizing retrieval costs.</p>
