                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic by developing emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities through exposure to structured data and patterns in text, enabling them to approximate arithmetic operations via learned internal representations and sequence processing, rather than explicit symbolic computation.</p>
