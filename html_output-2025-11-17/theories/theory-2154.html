                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill scientific theories by aggregating semantic representations of claims, evidence, and arguments across a large number of papers. By mapping the semantic space of a field, LLMs can identify areas of consensus, controversy, and uncertainty, and synthesize these into structured theories that reflect the collective knowledge and debates within the literature.</p>
