                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1341</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Self-Consistency-Driven Calibration in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language models use the consistency of their outputs across multiple generate-then-reflect cycles as a signal for calibrating their confidence and answer quality. When multiple independent reasoning paths converge on the same answer, the model increases its confidence and is more likely to output that answer. Conversely, divergence or instability across cycles leads to hedging or lower confidence. This self-consistency mechanism acts as an internal validation process, improving reliability and robustness.</p>
