                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Augmentation Theory for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by actively augmenting their memory through self-generated summaries, abstractions, and hypotheses, rather than relying solely on passive storage of past observations. The theory asserts that such active memory processes enable more efficient reasoning, planning, and adaptation to novel situations.</p>
