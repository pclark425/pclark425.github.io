                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Skill Acquisition and Task Decomposition Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through iterative self-reflection by acquiring meta-skills—generalizable strategies for error detection, correction, and reasoning—and by decomposing complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks. Through repeated generate-then-reflect cycles, LLMs internalize higher-order patterns of self-correction and develop increasingly effective approaches to both problem-solving and self-improvement.</p>
