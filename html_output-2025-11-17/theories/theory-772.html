                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging statistical associations between input and output patterns observed in their training data, rather than by executing explicit algorithmic procedures. This process relies on the frequency and co-occurrence of arithmetic expressions and their results in the training corpus.</p>

    <li>Language models are highly accurate on arithmetic expressions that are common in their training data, such as single-digit addition or multiplication tables. </li>

    <li>Language models often fail on arithmetic expressions that are rare or absent from their training data, such as large-number multiplication or multi-step calculations. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is fine-tuned on a new set of arithmetic expressions (e.g., base-7 addition), it will rapidly improve on those expressions but not on structurally different ones.</li>
                <li>If an arithmetic expression is artificially made frequent in the training data, the model's accuracy on that expression will increase.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on a synthetic dataset with a specific set of arithmetic facts, it will reproduce those facts even if they are incorrect.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is exposed to a synthetic corpus with systematically permuted arithmetic facts (e.g., 2+2=5), it will learn and reproduce those incorrect facts, suggesting no underlying arithmetic reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on arithmetic expressions with missing results, it may fail to infer the correct results, indicating a lack of algorithmic reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a model is exposed to a training set with partial arithmetic tables (e.g., only even-numbered sums), its ability to interpolate missing facts is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model can solve arithmetic expressions it has never seen before with high accuracy, this would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>If a model can generalize to new arithmetic operations (e.g., modular arithmetic) without exposure, this would challenge the pattern matching hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If a model can perform multi-step arithmetic reasoning on novel problems, this would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some language models show partial generalization to novel arithmetic expressions, suggesting possible emergent reasoning beyond pattern matching. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is closely related to existing work on pattern matching in LMs, but its application to arithmetic as a non-algorithmic process is new.</p>
