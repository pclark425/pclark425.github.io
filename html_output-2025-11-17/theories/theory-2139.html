                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Abstraction and Compression in LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs distill theories from large scholarly corpora by identifying recurring semantic patterns and abstracting them into compressed, generalizable statements. The process leverages the LLM's ability to recognize high-level conceptual similarities across diverse texts, enabling the synthesis of concise, domain-relevant theories.</p>
