                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the informativeness of actionable feedback—its clarity, specificity, and relevance—directly determines the magnitude and direction of improvement in iterative evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories. More informative feedback leads to greater and more reliable improvements, while less informative feedback results in smaller or inconsistent gains.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be diminishing returns to informativeness, where extremely detailed feedback does not yield proportionally greater improvement.</li>
                <li>Overly informative feedback may overwhelm evaluators, leading to reduced improvement in some contexts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If low-informativeness feedback leads to substantial and consistent improvement, the theory's central claim is challenged.</li>
                <li>If highly informative feedback fails to produce greater improvement than less informative feedback, the informativeness-improvement link is questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Improvement due to factors such as evaluator expertise, motivation, or external training, independent of feedback informativeness. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
