                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Space Discovery Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The incrementality versus transformationality of automated discoveries is determined by both the size and the quality of the constraint space within which the system operates. Systems operating in tightly constrained spaces (limited hypothesis pools, expert-defined parameters, narrow domains) typically produce incremental discoveries, while systems with broader, more intelligently-structured constraint spaces can produce transformational discoveries. However, broader constraint spaces require exponentially more validation effort and have higher failure rates unless coupled with effective search strategies. The key insight is that constraint-space size alone is insufficient—the alignment of constraints with the underlying structure of the discovery domain determines whether broad exploration yields transformational results or merely noise.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The probability of transformational discovery increases with the size of the intelligently-structured hypothesis space explored by the system, but decreases with purely random expansion of constraint space.</li>
                <li>Systems operating in expert-constrained spaces are typically limited to incremental discoveries within the boundaries of existing knowledge, unless the constraints encode deep domain structure that enables efficient exploration of transformational regions.</li>
                <li>The validation cost and failure rate increase with constraint-space size, but this relationship is modulated by the quality of search strategies—intelligent constraints can maintain broad exploration while controlling validation costs.</li>
                <li>Effective transformational discovery requires balancing constraint-space breadth with domain-informed search strategies (e.g., physics-inspired heuristics, learned priors, multi-fidelity approaches).</li>
                <li>The incrementality of a discovery is determined by both the distance from the center of the constraint space to the discovered solution AND the alignment of constraints with the underlying structure of the discovery domain.</li>
                <li>Constraint spaces that encode fundamental domain structure (e.g., physical laws, mathematical symmetries) enable more efficient exploration than arbitrary constraints of the same size.</li>
                <li>Multi-fidelity and proxy-based approaches can expand effective constraint spaces by reducing per-evaluation cost, enabling broader exploration within fixed computational budgets.</li>
            </ol>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems that incorporate domain knowledge to intelligently constrain search spaces will produce more validated transformational discoveries per unit computational cost than purely exhaustive search.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems that start with broad exploration and progressively constrain based on promising regions will outperform both fully constrained and fully unconstrained approaches.</li>
                <li>The ratio of transformational to incremental discoveries will increase as automated systems gain access to broader experimental capabilities and less constrained search spaces, but only if coupled with intelligent search strategies.</li>
                <li>Systems using multi-fidelity optimization (proxy experiments + occasional full experiments) will achieve higher rates of transformational discovery than systems constrained to single-fidelity evaluation.</li>
                <li>Constraint spaces aligned with fundamental domain structure (e.g., conservation laws, symmetries) will yield higher transformational discovery rates than arbitrary constraints of equal size.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal constraint-space size that maximizes the rate of validated transformational discoveries for a given domain and computational budget.</li>
                <li>Whether certain constraint structures (e.g., hierarchical, modular, graph-based) enable more efficient exploration than others for transformational discovery across multiple domains.</li>
                <li>Whether human intuition about which constraints to impose systematically biases automated systems away from certain types of transformational discoveries that would be accessible with different constraint choices.</li>
                <li>Whether learned constraints (e.g., from neural networks, LLMs) can match or exceed human-designed constraints for enabling transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>Whether the relationship between constraint-space size and discovery transformationality follows a phase transition or is continuous.</li>
                <li>Whether constraint-space expansion strategies (e.g., iterative broadening, adaptive refinement) can achieve transformational discovery rates comparable to starting with broad spaces while maintaining lower validation costs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding transformational discoveries produced by highly constrained systems without intelligent search strategies would challenge the necessity of broad or well-structured search spaces.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that unconstrained exhaustive search produces transformational discoveries at rates comparable to intelligently-constrained search would contradict the importance of constraint quality.</li>
                <li>Showing that validation cost does not increase with constraint-space size would undermine the practical trade-off central to the theory.</li>
                <li>Finding that constraint-space structure has no effect on discovery outcomes (only size matters) would challenge the domain-alignment component of the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that human-designed constraints consistently outperform learned or data-driven constraints would challenge the potential for automated constraint optimization.</li>
            </ol>
