                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2178</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM-Human Co-Discovery for Scientific Theory Formation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective use of LLMs for scientific rule extraction and validation involves an iterative, interactive process between LLMs and human experts. LLMs generate candidate rules or theories from large corpora, which are then reviewed, refined, or rejected by human scientists. Feedback from humans is used to further guide and improve the LLM's extraction and abstraction process, leading to a co-evolution of machine-generated and human-curated scientific knowledge.</p>
