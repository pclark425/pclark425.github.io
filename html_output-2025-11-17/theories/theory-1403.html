                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Representation and Self-Monitoring in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models develop and utilize meta-cognitive representations—internal models of their own reasoning and output quality—during generate-then-reflect cycles. These representations enable the model to monitor, evaluate, and adapt its own cognitive processes, leading to improved answer quality through self-awareness and strategic revision.</p>
