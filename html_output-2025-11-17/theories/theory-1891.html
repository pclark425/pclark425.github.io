                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as a Latent Task Specification Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the format of a prompt encodes a latent, high-dimensional specification of the intended task, which is decoded by the LLM to infer not only the surface task but also the expected reasoning style, output format, and evaluation criteria. The LLM uses this inferred latent specification to select and weight internal modules (e.g., retrieval, reasoning, summarization), thus affecting both the process and outcome of computation.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Existing work shows LLMs adapt to tasks, but the latent specification and module weighting mechanism is a new, formalized claim.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> There is evidence that LLMs use different internal mechanisms for different tasks and prompt types.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit mapping from latent task specification (decoded from prompt format) to module selection and weighting is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is reformatted to resemble a summarization task, the LLM will increase activation in summarization-related modules and produce more concise outputs.</li>
                <li>If a prompt is ambiguous in format, the LLM will exhibit mixed module activation and less consistent outputs.</li>
                <li>Explicitly specifying output format in the prompt will lead to more consistent and accurate outputs matching that format.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is constructed to encode multiple latent task specifications simultaneously (e.g., hybrid format), the LLM may blend module activations in novel ways, potentially enabling emergent capabilities.</li>
                <li>If the latent task specification is adversarially encoded in the prompt format, the LLM may be induced to select suboptimal or unintended modules.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to entirely novel prompt formats, they may infer new latent specifications and develop new module combinations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not change internal module activation or output style when prompt format is changed, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot infer task type or output format from prompt format alone, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well regardless of prompt format, the theory's explanatory power is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of prompt format on LLMs with rigid, non-modular architectures may not fit the theory. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained exclusively on highly standardized prompts may not exhibit sensitivity to prompt format. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
