                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Episodic Memory Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by integrating episodic (event-based) memories with contextual cues, using a dynamic weighting mechanism that adapts to the agent's current goal and user profile. The theory asserts that the interplay between episodic specificity and contextual generalization enables both accurate recall and flexible adaptation in personalized dialogue.</p>
