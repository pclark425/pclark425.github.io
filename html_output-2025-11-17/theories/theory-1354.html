                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment through Reflective Generation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-alignment, where each cycle of generation and reflection enables the model to better align its outputs with implicit or explicit task objectives. Reflection acts as a meta-cognitive process, allowing the model to evaluate, critique, and adjust its own outputs, leading to cumulative improvements over multiple iterations.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If reflection is made more sophisticated (e.g., with externalized memory or explicit self-modeling), the saturation point may be delayed or eliminated.</li>
