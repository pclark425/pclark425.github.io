                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Exploration Bonus Curriculum Interaction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that exploration bonuses must be dynamically modulated in coordination with curriculum progression to optimize compositional skill acquisition in interactive text environments. Specifically, exploration bonus magnitude, type, and focus should shift systematically across curriculum phases: (1) During primitive discovery, high-magnitude state-coverage bonuses maximize action-object interaction discovery; (2) During early composition, moderate prediction-error bonuses encourage novel combinations of known primitives; (3) During advanced composition, low-magnitude goal-conditioned bonuses focus exploration on task-relevant compositions while avoiding distraction. The interaction effect is critical: mismatched exploration bonuses can interfere with curriculum learning objectives, causing either insufficient exploration (missing primitives/compositions) or excessive exploration (distraction from consolidation). The theory predicts that curriculum-aligned exploration bonus schedules will outperform fixed exploration strategies by 40-60% in final task performance.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Exploration bonus magnitude should follow a decreasing schedule aligned with curriculum phases: high (β=0.8-1.0) during primitive discovery, moderate (β=0.3-0.5) during early composition, and low (β=0.1-0.2) during advanced composition and consolidation.</li>
                <li>Exploration bonus type should shift across curriculum phases: count-based/state-novelty bonuses for primitive discovery, prediction-error bonuses for composition learning, and goal-conditioned novelty bonuses for advanced task-specific exploration.</li>
                <li>Curriculum task complexity should increase only when exploration metrics indicate sufficient coverage of the current complexity level (e.g., 75-85% primitive coverage before introducing 2-step compositions).</li>
                <li>Misalignment between exploration bonus magnitude and curriculum phase produces suboptimal learning: high bonuses during consolidation phases cause distraction, while low bonuses during discovery phases cause incomplete skill acquisition.</li>
                <li>The interaction effect between exploration bonuses and curriculum structure is multiplicative rather than additive: properly aligned exploration-curriculum pairs produce synergistic improvements beyond either component alone.</li>
                <li>Exploration bonus focus should narrow as curriculum progresses: from broad state-space coverage to composition-specific novelty to task-relevant goal achievement.</li>
                <li>Transition points between curriculum phases should be triggered by exploration-based metrics (e.g., novelty rate dropping below threshold) rather than fixed episode counts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Count-based exploration bonuses effectively discover novel states in sparse-reward environments, which is critical for primitive action discovery in text games. </li>
    <li>Curriculum learning improves compositional generalization by structuring task complexity progression from simple to complex. </li>
    <li>Intrinsic motivation through prediction error drives learning of environment dynamics and supports skill composition. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical reinforcement learning benefits from discovering reusable primitive skills before learning compositions. </li>
    <li>Excessive exploration can interfere with exploitation and skill consolidation in later learning stages. </li>
    <li>Interactive text environments require both broad state-space exploration and focused compositional reasoning. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent with curriculum-aligned exploration bonus scheduling (high→moderate→low) will achieve 40-60% better final task performance compared to fixed exploration bonus agents in compositional text environments.</li>
                <li>Agents that transition from count-based to prediction-error exploration bonuses at the primitive-to-composition curriculum boundary will discover 2-3x more valid compositions than agents using only count-based bonuses throughout.</li>
                <li>Premature reduction of exploration bonuses (before 75% primitive coverage) will result in 30-50% fewer primitives discovered and corresponding deficits in compositional task performance.</li>
                <li>Maintaining high exploration bonuses during consolidation phases will increase training time by 50-100% without corresponding performance improvements due to distraction from task-relevant learning.</li>
                <li>Curriculum progression triggered by exploration metrics (novelty rate < 0.1 new states per episode) will produce 20-30% faster learning than fixed-schedule curricula.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal mathematical function (e.g., exponential decay, step function, or adaptive) for scheduling exploration bonus magnitude across curriculum phases that generalizes across different text environment domains.</li>
                <li>Whether the interaction between exploration bonus type and curriculum structure varies systematically with the compositional depth of target tasks (2-step vs. 5-step vs. 10-step compositions).</li>
                <li>Whether agents can learn to meta-learn the appropriate exploration bonus schedule from curriculum structure alone, eliminating the need for hand-designed schedules.</li>
                <li>Whether the exploration-curriculum interaction effects discovered in text environments transfer to other compositional learning domains (visual reasoning, robotic manipulation, code generation).</li>
                <li>Whether there are critical periods where exploration bonus type transitions must occur, beyond which compositional learning is permanently impaired.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If fixed high exploration bonuses throughout all curriculum phases produce equivalent or better performance than scheduled exploration bonuses, this would challenge the theory's core claim about curriculum-aligned modulation.</li>
                <li>If curriculum progression based on task performance metrics (rather than exploration metrics) produces equivalent learning outcomes, this would question the theory's emphasis on exploration-based curriculum transitions.</li>
                <li>If random exploration bonus schedules perform comparably to theoretically-motivated schedules, this would suggest the interaction effect is not as specific as the theory claims.</li>
                <li>If agents learn compositions equally well without a primitive discovery phase (flat curriculum), this would challenge the theory's assumption about phase-specific exploration needs.</li>
                <li>If a single exploration bonus type (e.g., only count-based) works equally well across all curriculum phases, this would contradict the theory's claim about type-shifting requirements.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of language model pre-training in reducing exploration requirements is not fully integrated into the theory's predictions about exploration bonus schedules. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how demonstration data or imitation learning might interact with exploration bonuses across curriculum phases. </li>
    <li>Individual differences in environment structure (deterministic vs. stochastic, fully vs. partially observable) may modulate the optimal exploration-curriculum interaction. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
