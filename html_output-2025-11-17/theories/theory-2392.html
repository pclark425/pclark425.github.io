                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Microenvironmental Susceptibility Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is determined by the unique microenvironmental features of each population, including local glial cell composition, vascularization, metabolic demand, and extracellular matrix properties. These factors modulate the exposure, clearance, and cellular response to amyloid-β and tau, thereby dictating susceptibility.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially altering the extracellular matrix composition in resistant regions may render them vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Targeted metabolic suppression in high-risk populations will decrease aggregate formation, but may impair function.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing glial support or vascularization does not reduce pathology in vulnerable regions, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If populations with low metabolic demand still develop pathology despite robust clearance, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neuronal populations with favorable microenvironments still develop pathology, suggesting intrinsic cellular factors also play a role. </li>
