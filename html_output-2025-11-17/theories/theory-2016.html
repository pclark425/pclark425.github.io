                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can induce emergent quantitative laws by semantically aggregating, aligning, and abstracting patterns of quantitative relationships described in natural language, tables, and equations. The LLM's internal representations enable it to generalize across disparate domains, identify latent variable correspondences, and synthesize candidate laws that are not explicitly stated in any single source.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on cross-disciplinary corpora may synthesize novel quantitative laws that bridge fields (e.g., relating ecological and economic variables) not previously connected.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to infer higher-order or non-linear quantitative laws (e.g., power laws, sigmoidal relationships) from noisy or incomplete data if enough examples are present.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM fails to synthesize a known quantitative law from a corpus where it is described in multiple forms, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot align semantically equivalent variables across papers with different terminology, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
