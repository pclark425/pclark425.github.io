                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1395</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Hierarchical Error Subspace Projection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each self-reflection pass in a language model projects the output into a subspace that is increasingly orthogonal to previously identified error subspaces. The process is hierarchical: initial passes address gross errors, while subsequent passes target finer-grained or more subtle error components. This hierarchical projection mechanism enables the model to systematically reduce error overlap and approach a more accurate solution through successive refinement.</p>
