                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Semantic-Constraint Chemical Synthesis Engines</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, by leveraging their ability to model semantic relationships between chemical structure, property, and application language, can synthesize novel chemicals by satisfying explicit and implicit constraints embedded in user prompts. The LLM acts as a constraint satisfaction engine, generating molecules that fulfill both structural validity and application-specific requirements, even when these requirements are only partially specified or are novel.</p>
