                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature Protection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular expression profiles, including differential expression of proteostasis regulators, cell-surface receptors, and innate immune signaling molecules. Populations expressing higher levels of protective chaperones, efficient protein degradation machinery, and low levels of amyloid/tau-binding receptors are more resistant, while those with pro-pathogenic molecular signatures are more vulnerable.</p>
