                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Deliberative and Programmatic Memory Control Theory for LLM Agents (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents achieve optimal task performance by employing a hybrid memory control system that combines deliberative (explicit, goal-driven) and programmatic (rule-based, automated) memory management. The theory asserts that the interplay between these two forms of memory control enables LLM agents to dynamically allocate, retrieve, and update information in a manner that is both context-sensitive and computationally efficient, thereby maximizing their problem-solving capabilities across diverse tasks.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human cognition leverages both explicit (deliberative) and implicit (programmatic) memory systems for complex reasoning. </li>
    <li>LLM agents with explicit memory retrieval and rule-based memory updates outperform those with only one type of memory control in multi-step reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Dual-process theories in cognitive science (e.g., Kahneman's System 1 and System 2) show that both fast, automatic and slow, deliberative processes are necessary for flexible, robust problem solving. </li>
    <li>Memory-augmented neural networks (e.g., Neural Turing Machines, Differentiable Neural Computers) combine programmatic memory access with learned, context-driven retrieval. </li>
    <li>Recent LLM agent frameworks (e.g., Reflexion, ReAct) demonstrate improved performance when agents can both reflect (deliberate) and follow procedural memory routines. </li>
