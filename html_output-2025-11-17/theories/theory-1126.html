                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Internal Representation Alignment for Logical Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of language models (LMs) to perform strict logical reasoning depends on the degree to which their internal representations can be aligned with formal logical structures. When the model's latent space encodes entities, relations, and inference rules in a manner isomorphic to formal logic, the model can perform logical reasoning reliably. This alignment can be enhanced through targeted training, architectural modifications, or explicit intermediate supervision.</p>
