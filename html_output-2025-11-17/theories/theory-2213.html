                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM-generated scientific theories should be evaluated using a multi-layered epistemic framework that integrates empirical adequacy, logical consistency, explanatory power, and meta-cognitive criteria (such as self-consistency and awareness of limitations), with explicit attention to LLM-specific error modes such as hallucination, spurious pattern-matching, and lack of causal grounding.</p>
