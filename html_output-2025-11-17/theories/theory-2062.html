                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Abstraction and Compression in LLM-Driven Law Discovery</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large, diverse scholarly corpora, can autonomously identify and abstract recurring quantitative relationships by compressing information into concise, generalizable laws. The process leverages the LLM's internal pattern recognition and abstraction capabilities, allowing it to synthesize new, potentially novel quantitative laws that are not explicitly stated in any single source.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover fundamentally new quantitative laws that have not been previously recognized by human scientists.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate any novel or generalizable quantitative laws from large corpora, the theory would be undermined.</li>
