                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Context Window Limitation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about faithfulness gaps between natural language descriptions and code implementations in automated experimentation, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models and code generation systems have fixed context windows that create systematic gaps between what natural language descriptions assume is available (full codebase, all documentation, complete history) and what is actually provided to the model. This limitation causes: (1) missing imports and undefined variables, (2) incorrect schema references, (3) loss of multi-file dependencies, and (4) inability to use distant context. The theory predicts that context limitations are a primary cause of generation failures and that the impact scales with codebase complexity.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Context window limitations cause 25-45% of code generation failures in realistic codebases (>1000 lines).</li>
                <li>The probability of generation failure increases exponentially with the distance (in tokens) between the current position and required context: P(failure) ≈ 1 - exp(-λ * distance).</li>
                <li>Including 3-7 previous context cells reduces errors by 50-70% compared to single-cell context in notebook settings.</li>
                <li>Schema descriptions and variable state information reduce undefined-variable errors by 60-80%.</li>
                <li>The context limitation impact scales super-linearly with codebase size: doubling codebase size increases context-related failures by 2.5-3.5x.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Model context window limitations cause missing imports and incorrect predictions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-481.html#e481.3" class="evidence-link">[e481.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Insufficient context leads to variable and schema errors in notebook code generation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-729.html#e729.5" class="evidence-link">[e729.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Missing schema and variable state grounding causes NameError and KeyError. <a href="../results/extraction-result-729.html#e729.1" class="evidence-link">[e729.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Lack of sufficient code context in prompts causes non-compilable postconditions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-498.html#e498.6" class="evidence-link">[e498.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Incomplete snippet extraction omits required context and definitions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-461.html#e461.4" class="evidence-link">[e461.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Title-only representation misses information needed to determine solution correctness. <a href="../results/extraction-result-698.html#e698.4" class="evidence-link">[e698.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Limited docstring-injection coverage due to dynamic typing and resolution failures. <a href="../results/extraction-result-481.html#e481.5" class="evidence-link">[e481.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Inter-file coupling mismatch between human multi-file code and LLM single-file outputs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-687.html#e687.4" class="evidence-link">[e687.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Incomplete API sequences due to inter-procedural calls and single-method extraction. <a href="../results/extraction-result-684.html#e684.2" class="evidence-link">[e684.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Prefix format dependency limits integration with different test generators. <a href="../results/extraction-result-759.html#e759.5" class="evidence-link">[e759.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Retrieval-augmented generation that selectively includes relevant distant context will reduce failures by 40-60%.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical context representations (summaries + details) will allow effective use of 5-10x more context than flat representations.</li>
                <li>Explicit schema and type information will reduce generation errors by 50-70% in statically-typed languages.</li>
                <li>Context-aware ranking of which information to include will outperform recency-based selection by 30-50%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal context window size that balances coverage and noise, or if larger is always better.</li>
                <li>Whether models can learn to effectively use very long contexts (>100k tokens) or if attention mechanisms fundamentally limit useful context.</li>
                <li>Whether certain types of context (e.g., type signatures, imports) are more valuable per token than others (e.g., implementation details).</li>
                <li>Whether context limitations can be overcome through better training or if they are fundamental to the architecture.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that increasing context window size does not reduce failures would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that models perform equally well with minimal context would undermine the theory's emphasis on context importance.</li>
                <li>Showing that context selection strategies do not affect performance would contradict the theory's predictions.</li>
                <li>Finding that context limitations account for <10% of failures would limit the theory's scope.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some generation failures arise from model capabilities rather than context limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-752.html#e752.3" class="evidence-link">[e752.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Training data quality affects generation independent of context window size. <a href="../results/extraction-result-719.html#e719.1" class="evidence-link">[e719.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Some tasks require reasoning beyond what context can provide. <a href="../results/extraction-result-456.html#e456.1" class="evidence-link">[e456.1]</a> </li>
