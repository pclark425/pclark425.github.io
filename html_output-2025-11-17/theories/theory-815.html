                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Orchestration Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that optimal task-solving in LLM agents arises from the deliberate orchestration of multiple, hierarchically organized memory systems (e.g., episodic, semantic, procedural, and meta-cognitive). By dynamically selecting, integrating, and updating information across these memory types, LLM agents can flexibly adapt to a wide range of tasks, leveraging both specific experiences and abstract knowledge. The theory emphasizes the importance of meta-level control processes that monitor task demands and allocate memory resources accordingly.</p>
