                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Pragmatic Metric Engineering for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by engineering local spacetime metrics using currently accessible quantum vacuum phenomena and advanced materials, within the constraints of national laboratory-scale budgets. It suggests that by leveraging known quantum effects (such as the Casimir effect) and scalable metamaterial technologies, it is possible to create localized spacetime distortions sufficient for effective FTL propulsion, without requiring exotic matter or unattainable energy scales.</p>
