                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Process Supervision as a Meta-Cognitive Control Mechanism in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that process supervision acts as a meta-cognitive control mechanism in LLMs, enabling the model to monitor, evaluate, and revise its own reasoning processes. By providing explicit feedback or supervision at intermediate steps, the LLM can identify and correct errors in reasoning, leading to improved answer quality through iterative self-reflection. This meta-cognitive loop is analogous to human self-monitoring and is essential for robust, scalable self-improvement in LLMs.</p>
