                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-699</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Distributed Vector Arithmetic Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models encode arithmetic operations as transformations in high-dimensional vector space. Rather than manipulating symbols directly, the model learns distributed representations of numbers and operations, and arithmetic is performed via learned vector transformations that approximate the correct result. This enables the model to interpolate and sometimes extrapolate arithmetic results, but also leads to characteristic errors when the vector space does not perfectly encode the underlying arithmetic rules.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit vector arithmetic supervision, their arithmetic accuracy may improve.</li>
                <li>If the embedding space is manipulated, arithmetic performance may change in predictable ways.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can perform perfect symbolic arithmetic regardless of vector space structure, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If arithmetic errors are random rather than systematic, the theory would be called into question.</li>
