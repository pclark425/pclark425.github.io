                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories, there exists a systematic trade-off between novelty and validity assessments, where highly novel theories are more difficult to validate and more likely to be incorrectly assessed by both human and automated evaluators. This occurs because: (1) truly novel theories lack established comparison points in existing literature, making similarity-based validation unreliable; (2) evaluators (human and automated) have limited knowledge of cutting-edge developments and may incorrectly flag novel ideas as implausible; (3) the criteria for validity are often implicitly defined by existing paradigms, creating bias against paradigm-shifting ideas; (4) the temporal nature of validation means that truly novel theories can only be properly validated against future rather than past literature. Optimal evaluation must explicitly account for this trade-off through specialized novelty assessment methods, multi-perspective evaluation, and temporal validation strategies.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Novelty metrics based on similarity can be brittle (semantic paraphrases may appear novel but are incremental); reliance on coverage of the literature corpus; threshold-setting for 'sufficient' novelty is nontrivial and domain-dependent. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4444.html#e4444.1" class="evidence-link">[e4444.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM evaluators may miss novelty outside their knowledge; alignment/safety constraints can bias judgement; numeric anchors may yield compressed distributions depending on judge calibration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4558.html#e4558.2" class="evidence-link">[e4558.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Evaluating 'idea quality' is inherently subjective; alignment with human preferences may not reflect downstream empirical success; scaling expert evaluation is costly; potential for generating plausible but untestable or invalid ideas. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4478.html#e4478.3" class="evidence-link">[e4478.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Novelty assessment requires broad literature knowledge which may vary by rater; rubric still encodes subjective judgments especially for novelty/significance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4457.html#e4457.3" class="evidence-link">[e4457.3]</a> </li>
    <li>RND depends on quality of semantic embeddings and literature coverage; sensitive to hyperparameters P and Q; validation negative samples may simplify discrimination task; database biases and publication/citation biases can influence scores. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4465.html#e4465.0" class="evidence-link">[e4465.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Operationalizing 'value' and historical novelty automatically is difficult; cross-domain and cultural dependencies; subjective and context-dependent judgments; current LLM evaluations rarely capture influence or downstream impact. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4462.html#e4462.3" class="evidence-link">[e4462.3]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM evaluators can inherit hallucinations and biases, may conflate novelty with irrelevance, and can be overly optimistic or inconsistent; lack of standardized prompts and calibration leads to variability; correlation with human experts is not guaranteed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4430.html#e4430.1" class="evidence-link">[e4430.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Paper reports earlier work found relatively low agreement among expert reviewers; structured rubrics and collaborative assessment protocols help produce more stable and reproducible outcomes, but no numeric reliability values are provided. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4612.html#e4612.2" class="evidence-link">[e4612.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Human evaluation is costly and limited in scale; ratings can be subjective and domain-dependent despite guidelines; sample sizes limit statistical power; human reviewers may be influenced by presentation/artifacts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4439.html#e4439.3" class="evidence-link">[e4439.3]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluators assess theories using only literature available at time T, theories that become highly cited after T+5 years will receive systematically lower novelty and validity scores than theories that align with existing T-literature, with the gap increasing proportionally to the degree of paradigm challenge.</li>
                <li>If a novelty metric based on semantic distance from existing literature is applied to a set of theories including both genuinely novel and off-topic theories, it will be unable to distinguish between them without additional relevance filtering, achieving no better than random classification.</li>
                <li>If human evaluators trained in a specific paradigm assess theories that challenge that paradigm, their validity ratings will be systematically lower (by at least 1-2 points on a 5-point scale) than evaluators from outside the paradigm, with the effect size increasing with evaluator expertise.</li>
                <li>If evaluation systems use multiple independent evaluators with different paradigmatic backgrounds, inter-rater agreement will be significantly lower for highly novel theories than for incremental theories.</li>
                <li>If theories are re-evaluated 5 years after initial assessment using literature published in the interim, novelty scores will remain stable but validity scores will increase for genuinely novel theories and decrease for initially overrated theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation systems explicitly separate 'paradigm-consistent novelty' from 'paradigm-challenging novelty' and apply different validation criteria to each (e.g., requiring experimental validation for paradigm-challenging theories but accepting theoretical consistency for paradigm-consistent theories), they might better identify breakthrough theories, but the optimal criteria for each category and the cost-benefit trade-off are unknown.</li>
                <li>If theories are evaluated using future literature (e.g., citations 5 years later) as ground truth, the correlation between initial novelty scores and future impact might be weak or strong depending on whether novelty metrics capture the right aspects; the predictive validity of different novelty metrics over different time horizons is unknown.</li>
                <li>If evaluators are given explicit instructions to overcome paradigm bias (e.g., 'consider theories that challenge current assumptions' or 'imagine you are evaluating from a future perspective'), they might successfully identify more paradigm-shifting ideas, or they might simply become more lenient without improving discrimination; the effectiveness of debiasing instructions is unknown.</li>
                <li>If validation systems combine similarity-based novelty metrics with explicit relevance filtering (e.g., requiring theories to address specific research questions), the optimal balance between novelty and relevance thresholds for maximizing discovery of valuable theories is unknown.</li>
                <li>If automated evaluators are trained on a dataset that includes both successful and unsuccessful paradigm-challenging theories from history, they might learn to better distinguish genuine breakthroughs from irrelevant ideas, but whether such training generalizes to contemporary novel theories is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory synthesizes observations about novelty assessment challenges into a coherent framework explaining the systematic trade-off between novelty and validity evaluation. While individual challenges (paradigm bias, temporal validation issues, similarity metric limitations) are noted in philosophy of science and scientometrics literature, the formalization of these as interrelated laws governing a fundamental trade-off in automated evaluation systems is novel. The specific application to LLM-generated theory evaluation and the quantitative predictions are new contributions.</p>

    "theory_description": "In evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories, there exists a systematic trade-off between novelty and validity assessments, where highly novel theories are more difficult to validate and more likely to be incorrectly assessed by both human and automated evaluators. This occurs because: (1) truly novel theories lack established comparison points in existing literature, making similarity-based validation unreliable; (2) evaluators (human and automated) have limited knowledge of cutting-edge developments and may incorrectly flag novel ideas as implausible; (3) the criteria for validity are often implicitly defined by existing paradigms, creating bias against paradigm-shifting ideas; (4) the temporal nature of validation means that truly novel theories can only be properly validated against future rather than past literature. Optimal evaluation must explicitly account for this trade-off through specialized novelty assessment methods, multi-perspective evaluation, and temporal validation strategies.",
