                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Constraint Propagation in Language Model Inference</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs solve spatial puzzles like Sudoku by performing iterative, multi-step constraint propagation through their sequential inference process. Each forward pass or token prediction step refines the model's internal representation of the puzzle state, gradually eliminating invalid options and converging on a valid solution.</p>
