                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Scientific Paradigm Discovery</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when exposed to large, diverse scientific corpora and guided by meta-analytic prompts, can identify not only explicit rules but also latent scientific paradigms, contradictions, and paradigm shifts. By aggregating and abstracting across disparate findings, LLMs can surface higher-order patterns and tensions that may not be apparent to individual researchers, thus accelerating the evolution of scientific understanding.</p>

            <ol>
