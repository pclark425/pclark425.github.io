                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-258</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM Prompt-Based Belief Augmentation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can maintain and update structured belief states about partially observable environments through carefully designed prompts that explicitly represent beliefs, integrate tool outputs into those beliefs, and use the augmented beliefs to guide action selection. The theory posits that by prompting LLMs to: (1) maintain explicit belief representations in their context (e.g., as structured text, tables, or lists), (2) systematically update these beliefs when new tool outputs are received, and (3) reference these beliefs when selecting actions, agents can achieve more coherent and effective planning in partially observable environments. The prompt serves as both the belief state container and the computational mechanism for belief updates, leveraging the LLM's natural language understanding to integrate heterogeneous tool outputs and reason about uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs can maintain explicit belief representations in their prompt context that encode the agent's current understanding of the partially observable environment.</li>
                <li>Prompts that include explicit belief update instructions enable LLMs to systematically integrate new tool outputs into existing belief states rather than treating each observation in isolation.</li>
                <li>Belief-augmented prompts that separate belief representation from action selection lead to more consistent and goal-directed behavior than prompts that conflate these functions.</li>
                <li>The structure of belief representation in the prompt (e.g., natural language descriptions, key-value pairs, tables) affects the LLM's ability to maintain, update, and utilize beliefs effectively.</li>
                <li>Prompts that explicitly instruct the LLM to reference current beliefs when selecting actions reduce hallucination and improve action coherence in partially observable environments.</li>
                <li>Belief augmentation through prompting is most effective when the prompt includes: (a) a designated belief state section, (b) explicit update rules or examples, and (c) instructions to ground actions in beliefs.</li>
                <li>The capacity for belief augmentation is limited by the LLM's context window size and its ability to attend to relevant belief information as context grows.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can maintain and manipulate structured information in their context window when prompted appropriately, enabling them to track state information across multiple reasoning steps. </li>
    <li>Prompting strategies that make intermediate reasoning explicit improve LLM performance on complex tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. </li>
    <li>LLMs can integrate information from multiple sources and resolve inconsistencies when prompted to do so explicitly. </li>
    <li>Tool-augmented LLMs benefit from structured prompts that guide how tool outputs should be interpreted and used. </li>
    <li>Explicit state tracking in prompts improves agent performance in sequential decision-making tasks. </li>
    <li>LLMs can perform belief state tracking and update beliefs based on observations when given appropriate task framing. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents using prompts with explicit belief state sections will outperform agents using prompts without belief tracking in partially observable navigation tasks.</li>
                <li>Prompts that include few-shot examples of belief updates will enable better belief maintenance than zero-shot prompts in novel environments.</li>
                <li>Agents prompted to maintain beliefs in structured formats (e.g., tables, JSON) will show more consistent belief updates than agents using unstructured natural language beliefs.</li>
                <li>In multi-step planning tasks, agents with belief-augmented prompts will make fewer redundant tool calls because they can reference previously gathered information.</li>
                <li>Belief-augmented prompts will show greater benefits in environments with higher degrees of partial observability compared to nearly-fully-observable environments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether belief-augmented prompts can enable LLMs to perform active information gathering, where they strategically select tools to reduce uncertainty in specific belief components.</li>
                <li>Whether LLMs can learn to compress or summarize belief states when context limits are approached, maintaining the most decision-relevant information.</li>
                <li>Whether belief augmentation through prompting can scale to environments requiring tracking of hundreds of entities or complex relational beliefs.</li>
                <li>Whether different LLM architectures (e.g., models with different context window sizes, different training objectives) show significantly different capabilities for prompt-based belief augmentation.</li>
                <li>Whether belief-augmented prompts can enable effective transfer learning, where belief structures learned in one environment generalize to structurally similar environments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with explicit belief tracking in prompts perform no better than agents without belief tracking in partially observable environments, it would suggest the additional prompt complexity provides no benefit.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to consistently update beliefs when presented with contradictory tool outputs, it would undermine the theory's claim that prompts can guide systematic belief updates.</li>
                <li>If belief representations in prompts degrade or become inconsistent over long interaction sequences, it would suggest limitations in the LLM's ability to maintain coherent beliefs through prompting alone.</li>
                <li>If removing the belief state section from prompts while keeping all other components has no effect on performance, it would suggest beliefs are not actually being used for action selection.</li>
                <li>If randomly shuffling or corrupting the belief state in the prompt does not affect subsequent actions, it would indicate the LLM is not grounding decisions in the maintained beliefs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle belief state growth when the accumulated information exceeds the LLM's context window capacity. </li>
    <li>The computational cost and latency implications of maintaining and processing increasingly large belief states in prompts are not addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to initialize belief states for novel environments or how much prior knowledge should be encoded in the initial prompt. </li>
    <li>The interaction between belief augmentation and other prompting techniques (e.g., self-consistency, chain-of-thought) is not fully characterized. </li>
