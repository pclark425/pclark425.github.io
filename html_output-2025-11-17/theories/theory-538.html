                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator Alignment Limitation Theory for LLM-Based Grading</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM-based evaluators (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT) exhibit systematic biases and limitations when used to grade LLM-generated scientific theories, particularly favoring LLM-generated outputs over human-written ones. Their alignment with human expert judgment is sensitive to prompt design, few-shot example diversity, and domain/task. While evaluator alignment can be quantified and improved (e.g., via prompt engineering and example selection), LLM-based evaluators cannot fully replace human expert evaluation in high-stakes or novel scientific domains, and their reliability is further limited when evaluating outputs from models of equal or greater capability.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new LLM-based evaluator is used without prompt calibration or diverse few-shot examples, it will overrate LLM-generated scientific theories compared to human-written ones.</li>
                <li>If the diversity and representativeness of few-shot examples in the evaluator prompt is increased, evaluator-human alignment (as measured by Δ̄ or soft consistency) will improve.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are applied to a new scientific domain without domain-specific calibration, their agreement with human experts will decrease.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are calibrated with human expert feedback and prompt engineering, their soft consistency with human experts will increase, but exact-match (hard) consistency will remain lower.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are fine-tuned on extensive human expert feedback in a new scientific field, they may eventually match or exceed inter-expert agreement, but may still exhibit systematic biases.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are used to grade outputs from models stronger than themselves, their scores may become unreliable or even inversely correlated with human judgment.</li>
                <li>If adversarial prompt engineering is used to manipulate the evaluator, the bias toward LLM-generated outputs may be amplified or reversed.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are combined with automated fact-checking or retrieval tools, their alignment with human experts on scientific theory evaluation may improve, but the risk of new failure modes (e.g., over-reliance on surface similarity) may arise.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM-based evaluator is shown to have no bias toward LLM-generated outputs in a blinded, cross-domain experiment (i.e., scores human and LLM outputs equally when humans prefer human outputs), the Evaluator Bias Law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If evaluator-human alignment does not improve with more diverse and representative few-shot examples, the Prompt and Example Sensitivity Law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators achieve high hard consistency (exact-match) with human experts across multiple domains without calibration, the Evaluator Calibration and Improvement Law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators maintain high alignment with human experts when evaluating outputs from models of equal or greater capability, the Domain and Task Limitation Law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address cases where LLM-based evaluators are adversarially attacked or manipulated by prompt engineering, which may alter or reverse bias. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3981.html#e3981.8" class="evidence-link">[e3981.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3966.html#e3966.7" class="evidence-link">[e3966.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3986.html#e3986.2" class="evidence-link">[e3986.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain evaluator performance on tasks with objective, formal outputs (e.g., code, math), where alignment with human judgment may be higher due to unambiguous ground truth. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3966.html#e3966.1" class="evidence-link">[e3966.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3978.html#e3978.1" class="evidence-link">[e3978.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3961.html#e3961.2" class="evidence-link">[e3961.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of using ensemble or hybrid evaluation strategies (e.g., combining LLM-based and human evaluation) on alignment and bias. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3967.html#e3967.2" class="evidence-link">[e3967.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3964.html#e3964.2" class="evidence-link">[e3964.2]</a> </li>
