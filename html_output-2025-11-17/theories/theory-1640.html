                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Alignment-Scale Tradeoff Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that there exists a tradeoff surface between model scale, domain alignment, and prompt/context design, such that deficiencies in one factor can be partially compensated by improvements in another, but only up to a domain-specific limit. The theory further posits that the optimal allocation of resources for maximizing simulation fidelity depends on the subdomain's complexity and the nature of the scientific reasoning required.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If simulation fidelity in a high-complexity domain can be arbitrarily improved by prompt/context design alone, the domain complexity limit law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If no tradeoff is observed (i.e., all factors must be maximized independently), the compensatory tradeoff law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If increasing model scale always yields proportional increases in simulation fidelity regardless of domain complexity, the theory is falsified.</li>
