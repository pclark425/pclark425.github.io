                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction Theory for LLM-Based Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively abstracting and synthesizing claims, evidence, and reasoning chains. The process involves multiple passes: first extracting explicit claims and supporting evidence, then abstracting commonalities and differences, and finally synthesizing higher-level theoretical frameworks that generalize across the literature. The LLM's ability to represent and manipulate complex semantic structures enables this multi-stage abstraction.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generate entirely novel theoretical frameworks that have not been explicitly stated in any paper.</li>
                <li>Iterative abstraction may allow LLMs to identify hidden patterns or relationships that are not apparent to human readers.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to produce more abstract or general theories after multiple iterations, the theory is undermined.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to handle highly technical mathematical formalisms during abstraction is not addressed. </li>
