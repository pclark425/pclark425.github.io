                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2220</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when conducted through iterative cycles of human and AI co-evaluation, where each party identifies errors, ambiguities, and novel insights, and the process continues until convergence on a stable, high-quality theory. The theory asserts that neither human nor AI evaluation alone is sufficient for optimal assessment.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Alternating human-AI review cycles will identify more errors and improve theory quality compared to single-pass or single-agent evaluation.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In some cases, human and AI reviewers may not converge, revealing fundamental ambiguities or biases in the theory or evaluation process.</li>
                <li>The process may surface novel scientific insights that neither humans nor AIs would have identified alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative co-evaluation does not improve theory quality over single-agent review, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If the process leads to oscillation or divergence rather than convergence, the theory's assumptions are challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify optimal stopping criteria for convergence. </li>
    <li>It does not address resource constraints or reviewer fatigue in iterative cycles. </li>
