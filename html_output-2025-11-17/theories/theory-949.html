                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimally solve text game tasks by dynamically compressing and expanding memory representations based on contextual relevance, allowing efficient use of limited memory resources while maintaining access to both fine-grained and abstracted information as needed for decision-making.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents that dynamically compress and expand memory based on context will outperform agents with static memory representations in text games with variable complexity.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If memory compression and expansion are recursively applied, agents may develop emergent hierarchical representations that enable transfer learning across games.</li>
                <li>In games with highly deceptive or misleading cues, over-compression may lead to systematic errors, revealing trade-offs in memory management.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with static (non-compressible) memory perform as well as those with dynamic compression/expansion, the theory's core mechanism is challenged.</li>
                <li>If memory expansion does not improve performance in ambiguous states, the utility of dynamic expansion is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to prioritize which memories to compress or expand when multiple candidates exist. </li>
