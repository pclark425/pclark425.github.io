                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-730</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Statistical Pattern Matching Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging statistical associations between input patterns and output tokens, rather than by executing explicit algorithmic procedures. This theory posits that arithmetic ability in LLMs emerges from exposure to arithmetic examples in training data, allowing the model to match input queries to likely outputs based on learned co-occurrence patterns, with performance degrading for rare or out-of-distribution queries.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is fine-tuned on a new set of arithmetic facts, its performance on those facts will improve, but generalization to unseen arithmetic will remain limited.</li>
                <li>If arithmetic queries are rephrased in a way that is rare in the training data, accuracy will decrease.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on synthetic arithmetic data with novel formats, it may develop new statistical associations, potentially improving generalization.</li>
                <li>If a model is exposed to adversarially generated arithmetic queries, it may reveal new failure modes not seen in standard benchmarks.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model can reliably solve arithmetic queries far outside its training distribution, this would challenge the statistical pattern matching theory.</li>
                <li>If a model can generalize to entirely new arithmetic operations (e.g., base conversion) without explicit training, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show improved arithmetic with chain-of-thought prompting, suggesting partial algorithmic reasoning beyond pattern matching. </li>
