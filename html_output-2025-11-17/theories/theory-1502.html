                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Precision-Weighted Arbitration for Conceptual Format Selection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the precision-weighted arbitration mechanism to a hierarchical framework, positing that conceptual format selection operates at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., from low-level sensory-motor to high-level symbolic), with arbitration occurring both within and between levels. The selection at each level is governed by the relative precision of available formats for the current task, and higher-level arbitration can override or modulate lower-level format selection based on global task goals or contextual cues.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating higher-level task context (e.g., via instructions) will shift format selection at lower levels, even when local precision is unchanged.</li>
                <li>Disruption of higher-level control regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) will reduce the ability to flexibly arbitrate between formats across levels.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical tasks (e.g., multi-step reasoning) will show dynamic shifts in format selection at different levels of abstraction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In individuals with atypical hierarchical control (e.g., frontal lobe injury), arbitration may become rigid or context-insensitive.</li>
                <li>Emergent properties may arise when arbitration weights at different levels interact nonlinearly, leading to novel conceptual behaviors.</li>
                <li>Developmental changes in hierarchical arbitration may underlie age-related shifts in conceptual flexibility.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If higher-level context does not modulate lower-level format selection, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical tasks do not show multi-level format arbitration, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If disruption of higher-level control does not affect arbitration, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the neural or computational implementation of hierarchical arbitration. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how arbitration weights are learned or updated over time. </li>
