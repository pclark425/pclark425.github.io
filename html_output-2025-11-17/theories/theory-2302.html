                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease require the integration of dynamic, multi-modal biomarkers that reflect the temporal and interactive nature of the disease's multifactorial cascade. It posits that no single biomarker or static measurement can adequately capture the initiation or progression of AD, and that only temporally-resolved, multi-domain biomarker panels can provide accurate early detection and prognosis.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Single-domain biomarkers (e.g., amyloid PET) have limited predictive value for clinical progression. </li>
    <li>Longitudinal studies show that changes in metabolic, inflammatory, and vascular biomarkers often precede or coincide with amyloid and tau changes. </li>
    <li>Multi-modal biomarker panels improve prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD compared to single biomarkers. </li>
    <li>Temporal dynamics of biomarker changes are critical for distinguishing preclinical, prodromal, and clinical AD stages. </li>
    <li>Machine learning models integrating multi-domain biomarkers outperform traditional models in predicting AD onset. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While multi-biomarker approaches are emerging, the explicit law of dynamic, temporally-resolved integration is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The use of multiple biomarkers is increasingly recognized, but the necessity of temporally-resolved, multi-domain integration is not formalized as a law.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the requirement for dynamic, multi-modal biomarker integration for accurate detection and prognosis.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Multi-modal, temporally-resolved biomarker panels will outperform single-domain biomarkers in predicting AD conversion in at-risk populations.</li>

                <li>Machine learning models using integrated biomarker data will provide earlier and more accurate AD risk stratification.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel, non-invasive biomarker combinations (e.g., blood-based panels) will achieve predictive accuracy comparable to current CSF or PET-based methods.</li>
                <li>Dynamic biomarker integration will enable identification of distinct AD subtypes with different progression rates and therapeutic responses.</li>
                <li>Temporal biomarker signatures will allow for individualized prediction of disease onset and optimal intervention windows.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that single-domain biomarkers are as predictive as multi-modal, temporally-resolved panels would challenge the law.</li>
                <li>Finding that temporal dynamics of biomarker changes do not improve prediction over static measurements would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Observing that multi-modal integration does not improve early detection or prognosis would call the law into question.</li>
            </ol>

<ol>
    <li>Some individuals may have atypical biomarker trajectories or lack detectable changes in certain domains, limiting the model's applicability. </li>
