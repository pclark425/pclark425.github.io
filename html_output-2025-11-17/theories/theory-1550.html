                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by minimizing the energy requirements for warp bubble formation through advanced field manipulation techniques, such as soliton engineering, field resonance, and constructive interference, all using only positive energy densities. The focus is on the general principle that energy-efficient field configurations can make FTL travel feasible within realistic budgets.</p>
