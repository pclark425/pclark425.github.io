                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2329</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the convergence of multiple network-level disruptions, including synaptic dysfunction, impaired neural connectivity, and aberrant glial-neuronal interactions. These disruptions are initiated and propagated by a combination of genetic susceptibility, environmental exposures, and age-related molecular changes, leading to a self-reinforcing cycle of network breakdown. Detection is most effective when targeting early network-level biomarkers, such as functional connectivity changes on fMRI or EEG, rather than relying solely on amyloid or tau pathology.</p>
