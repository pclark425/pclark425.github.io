                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1679</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Load and Contextual Complexity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the simulation accuracy of LLMs in scientific subdomains is fundamentally constrained by the cognitive load and contextual complexity required by the subdomain's tasks. LLMs are more accurate when the subdomain's simulation tasks fall within the model's effective context window and do not exceed its capacity for multi-step reasoning, memory, or abstraction. As the complexity of the required simulation (e.g., number of interacting entities, depth of reasoning, or temporal dependencies) increases beyond the LLM's effective context and reasoning capacity, accuracy declines sharply, regardless of data coverage or domain alignment.</p>
