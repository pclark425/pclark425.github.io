                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1578</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hyperwave/Hypertube FTL: Energy-Economical Engineering Paradigm</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the general framework by proposing that FTL travel via Planck-scale microbubbles can be achieved within realistic energy and budgetary constraints by leveraging quantum amplification, resonance, and collective effects. Rather than brute-force Planck-scale energy, the theory posits that carefully tuned quantum systems (e.g., high-Q resonators, squeezed vacuum states) can induce microbubble formation and hypertube stabilization through constructive interference and resonance, drastically reducing the required energy input and making the process feasible for near-future technology.</p>
