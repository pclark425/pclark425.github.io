                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Precision-Weighted Arbitration for Conceptual Format Selection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the arbitration among representational formats for conceptual knowledge operates hierarchically: at higher levels, broad format classes (e.g., symbolic vs. sensorimotor) are selected based on precision, while at lower levels, sub-formats (e.g., visual vs. motor within sensorimotor) are further selected using the same mechanism. This enables both coarse and fine-grained adaptation to context.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Sub-format selection is known, but its formalization as a precision-weighted hierarchical process is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Sub-format selection within broad representational classes is observed.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Precision-weighted arbitration at multiple hierarchical levels is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training to increase sub-format precision will lead to reorganization of the arbitration hierarchy.</li>
                <li>In ambiguous tasks, arbitration may oscillate between hierarchical levels, leading to increased cognitive load.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If sub-format selection occurs independently of broad format selection, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical neural activation is not observed during conceptual processing, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how arbitration signals are communicated between hierarchical levels. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
