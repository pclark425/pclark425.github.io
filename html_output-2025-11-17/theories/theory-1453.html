                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Unified Hierarchical Predictive Hybridism (UHPH) – General Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> UHPH posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented as a dynamic, multi-level hierarchy of predictive models, where each level encodes increasingly abstract regularities over sensory, motor, and internal states. These representations are hybrid in format, combining distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor codes, and are optimized for prediction, inference, and flexible generalization. The theory asserts that conceptual knowledge is not stored in a single format, but emerges from the interaction of multiple representational schemes, each suited to different computational demands and levels of abstraction.</p>
