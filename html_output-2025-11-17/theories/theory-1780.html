                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Chain-of-Thought and Domain-Knowledge Prompting Enhances LLM Interpretability and Anomaly-Type Classification</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that prompting large language models (LLMs) with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps and relevant domain knowledge enables the models to more accurately detect, interpret, and classify anomalies in lists of data. The theory asserts that such prompting not only improves anomaly detection accuracy, but also enhances the interpretability of the model's decisions and enables fine-grained classification of anomaly types.</p>

                <li>If the rationales produced by the LLMs are not more interpretable or do not align with human expert reasoning, the theory's interpretability claim is weakened.</li>
