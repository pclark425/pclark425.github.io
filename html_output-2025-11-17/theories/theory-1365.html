                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Meta-Cognitive Loop in LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when prompted for self-reflection, instantiate an emergent meta-cognitive loop: the model alternates between generating candidate answers and meta-level evaluations of its own outputs. This loop enables the LLM to simulate an internal supervisor, dynamically adjusting its reasoning strategies and representations based on self-identified strengths and weaknesses, leading to improved performance over multiple iterations.</p>
