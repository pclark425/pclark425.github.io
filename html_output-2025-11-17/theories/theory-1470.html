                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1470</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuum from fully modal (grounded in sensory-motor systems) to fully amodal (abstract, symbolic), and that the brain can dynamically hybridize these formats depending on task demands, context, and learning history. Rather than being fixed, the representational format is flexibly constructed, with hybrid representations emerging through functional integration of modal and amodal systems. This dynamic hybridization allows for both context-sensitive simulation and abstract generalization, supporting the full range of human conceptual abilities.</p>
