                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Modular Augmentation in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy and scope of LLM-based scientific simulation can be systematically extended by modular augmentation: integrating external tools, symbolic engines, or domain-specific modules with the LLM. The modular approach allows the LLM to delegate sub-tasks that exceed its representational or reasoning capacity, resulting in composite systems with higher fidelity and broader applicability.</p>
