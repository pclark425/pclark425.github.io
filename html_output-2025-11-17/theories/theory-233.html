                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Level Representation Theory of Embodied Knowledge in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models encode and utilize spatial, procedural, and object-relational knowledge for embodied planning tasks without direct sensory input.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models encode embodied knowledge through a hierarchical system of three distinct representational levels that emerge from the transformer architecture: (1) Lexical-Semantic Level (early layers, ~1-4 in 12-layer models) - where individual tokens and phrases encode basic spatial primitives (e.g., 'above', 'inside', 'next to'), object affordances (e.g., 'graspable', 'container'), and action verbs with implicit physical constraints (e.g., 'pour' implies liquid and container); (2) Compositional-Relational Level (middle layers, ~5-8) - where attention mechanisms compose these primitives into structured representations of spatial configurations, procedural sequences with temporal ordering, and object-object relationships, maintaining bindings between objects and their properties across context; and (3) Abstract-Planning Level (upper layers, ~9-12) - where representations are integrated into goal-oriented action plans, counterfactual reasoning about physical scenarios, and constraint satisfaction for multi-step procedures. The theory posits that without direct sensory input, LMs learn these representations through statistical co-occurrence patterns in language that reflect physical constraints of the world, creating 'linguistic shadows' of embodied experience. These shadows preserve causal structure (action A must precede action B), spatial structure (object relations constrain possible configurations), and physical constraints (certain object-action combinations are linguistically rare because they are physically impossible). The representations are primarily qualitative and relational rather than metric, which explains both the successes (qualitative spatial reasoning, procedural ordering) and failures (precise metric reasoning, novel spatial configurations) of LMs on embodied tasks.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Language models encode spatial knowledge through distributed representations that capture statistical regularities in how spatial relationships are described in language, creating implicit qualitative spatial schemas that are coordinate-free and relation-based rather than metric.</li>
                <li>Procedural knowledge is encoded as probabilistic transition patterns between action states in middle layers, where the model learns which actions typically follow others in goal-directed sequences through exposure to procedural text, with attention mechanisms maintaining state information across steps.</li>
                <li>Object-relational knowledge is maintained through attention mechanisms that bind object properties to their typical spatial and functional relationships with other objects, with specific attention heads specializing in tracking object identity and state across context.</li>
                <li>The three representational levels (lexical-semantic, compositional-relational, and abstract-planning) emerge naturally from the hierarchical architecture of transformer models, with each successive layer building increasingly abstract representations by composing information from previous layers.</li>
                <li>The lexical-semantic level (layers 1-4) encodes basic spatial primitives, action verbs, and object properties as distributed token embeddings that capture co-occurrence statistics with physical descriptors.</li>
                <li>The compositional-relational level (layers 5-8) uses attention mechanisms to compose primitives into structured representations, binding objects to locations, actions to objects, and maintaining temporal ordering of procedural steps.</li>
                <li>The abstract-planning level (layers 9-12) integrates compositional representations into goal-oriented plans by selecting action sequences that satisfy physical constraints and achieve specified objectives.</li>
                <li>Embodied planning without sensory input is possible because language itself is a compressed representation of embodied experience, and the statistical structure of language preserves the causal and spatial structure of the physical world through linguistic conventions.</li>
                <li>The model's ability to perform embodied reasoning is proportional to the richness and diversity of procedural and spatial language in its training corpus, with performance degrading for scenarios poorly represented in training data.</li>
                <li>Physical constraints (e.g., gravity, object permanence, collision, containment) are implicitly learned not through explicit rules but through the impossibility or rarity of certain linguistic descriptions in the training data (e.g., 'the cup floated upward on its own' is rare because it describes a physically impossible event).</li>
                <li>The representations are primarily qualitative and topological rather than quantitative and metric, which explains why LMs succeed at qualitative spatial reasoning (e.g., 'the cup is on the table') but struggle with precise metric reasoning (e.g., 'the cup is exactly 15.3 cm from the edge').</li>
                <li>Cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms serve as the primary computational substrate for composing spatial primitives into complex spatial configurations and for maintaining object identity and state across procedural steps, with different attention heads specializing in different relational types.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Language models demonstrate ability to perform spatial reasoning tasks and answer questions about object locations and spatial relationships despite having no visual input during training, suggesting they extract spatial knowledge from linguistic descriptions alone. </li>
    <li>Large language models can generate procedurally correct step-by-step instructions for physical tasks, maintaining temporal ordering and causal dependencies between steps. </li>
    <li>Probing studies reveal that different layers of transformer models encode different types of information hierarchically, with lower layers (1-4) capturing syntactic and lexical information, middle layers (5-8) capturing semantic relationships and compositional structure, and higher layers (9-12) capturing more abstract task-specific representations. </li>
    <li>Language models can perform commonsense physical reasoning about object properties, physical interactions, and constraints without explicit physics training, suggesting implicit learning of physical knowledge from text. </li>
    <li>Attention patterns in transformers show structured representations that align with syntactic and semantic relationships, with specific attention heads tracking dependencies and relationships between tokens. </li>
    <li>Language models can be successfully used to generate plans for robotic manipulation tasks and embodied control, suggesting they encode actionable procedural knowledge that transfers to physical domains. </li>
    <li>Emergent abilities in large language models, including complex reasoning and planning, appear at certain scale thresholds, suggesting that representational capacity and training data volume are critical for developing sophisticated embodied knowledge. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Language models trained on corpora with richer procedural descriptions (e.g., detailed how-to guides, recipe instructions, assembly manuals) will outperform those trained on less procedural text by 15-30% when generating plans for novel embodied tasks, with the effect being strongest for multi-step tasks requiring temporal ordering.</li>
                <li>Intermediate layer representations (layers 5-8 in a 12-layer model) will show 20-40% higher similarity to human spatial reasoning patterns than either early (1-4) or late (9-12) layers when tested on spatial reasoning benchmarks using representational similarity analysis.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning only the middle layers (5-8) of a language model on spatial reasoning tasks will yield 10-25% better transfer to embodied planning than fine-tuning early or late layers alone, as measured by success rate on held-out planning tasks.</li>
                <li>Language models will perform 30-50% better on planning tasks that involve common object interactions (e.g., using a cup to drink, using a knife to cut) compared to rare or unusual object uses (e.g., using a cup as a hammer, using a knife as a screwdriver), reflecting the statistical distribution of descriptions in training data.</li>
                <li>Attention patterns during embodied planning tasks will show systematic tracking of object locations and states across the generated plan, with 3-5 specific attention heads in middle layers showing >70% consistency in attending to object mentions when those objects are referenced in subsequent actions.</li>
                <li>Models will show better performance on spatial reasoning tasks that can be described using topological relationships (e.g., containment, adjacency, connectivity) compared to tasks requiring precise metric information (e.g., exact distances, angles, sizes), with a performance gap of 20-40%.</li>
                <li>Probing classifiers trained to extract spatial information will achieve highest accuracy (>80%) when applied to middle layers (5-8), moderate accuracy (60-75%) on late layers (9-12), and lower accuracy (40-60%) on early layers (1-4).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained exclusively on spatial and procedural language with all other content removed, it may develop more efficient and accurate embodied reasoning capabilities than general-purpose models (by focusing representational capacity on relevant knowledge), or it may lose crucial contextual knowledge that supports spatial reasoning (e.g., understanding goals, object functions, social contexts), leading to brittle performance.</li>
                <li>Artificially enhancing attention mechanisms to maintain stronger object-state bindings throughout generation (e.g., by adding explicit memory slots or increasing attention weights for object-tracking heads) may dramatically improve planning accuracy by 40-60%, or may lead to overly rigid plans that fail to adapt to context and show decreased performance on tasks requiring flexibility.</li>
                <li>Language models may be able to perform embodied planning in physically impossible worlds (e.g., with different gravity, non-Euclidean geometry, or different physical laws) if trained on science fiction or fantasy text describing such worlds, which would reveal whether their representations are truly physics-based or purely linguistic. If successful, this would suggest representations are linguistic-statistical rather than grounded in physical laws.</li>
                <li>Combining language model representations with even minimal sensory grounding (e.g., 100-1000 images or short videos) might lead to superlinear improvements in embodied planning (e.g., 3-5x improvement from 10x more grounding data), suggesting the representations are partially compatible with perceptual grounding, or might show only linear or sublinear improvements if the representations are fundamentally incompatible with perceptual formats.</li>
                <li>The hierarchical structure of embodied knowledge might be invertible - using high-level plans to constrain and improve low-level spatial reasoning through top-down processing - which could enable 30-50% more efficient planning by pruning impossible action sequences early, or might provide no benefit if the representations are strictly feedforward.</li>
                <li>Training models with explicit supervision at each representational level (e.g., auxiliary losses for spatial primitives at early layers, relational structure at middle layers, and planning at late layers) might accelerate learning and improve performance by 2-3x, or might interfere with the natural emergence of representations and decrease performance.</li>
                <li>Models might be able to transfer embodied knowledge across languages more effectively than other types of knowledge if spatial and physical concepts are more universal, showing <10% performance degradation on zero-shot cross-lingual embodied reasoning, or might show typical degradation (30-50%) if the linguistic encoding is language-specific.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If scrambling the order of layers in a transformer while maintaining their learned weights does not significantly impair (>20% degradation) embodied planning performance, this would challenge the claim that hierarchical levels emerge from architectural depth and that information flows from primitive to abstract representations.</li>
                <li>If language models perform equally well (within 10% performance) on embodied planning tasks involving objects and spatial relationships that are never or rarely described together in natural language (e.g., using a microscope to play basketball, storing a car inside a teacup), this would challenge the theory that they learn through statistical co-occurrence of physical descriptions.</li>
                <li>If ablating attention mechanisms and replacing them with simple feedforward connections does not impair (>30% degradation) the model's ability to track object states across procedural steps, this would challenge the claim that attention serves as the primary binding mechanism for maintaining object-state relationships.</li>
                <li>If models trained on languages with fundamentally different spatial encoding systems (e.g., absolute vs. relative spatial frames of reference, as in Guugu Yimithirr vs. English) show identical internal representations (>90% similarity in representational geometry), this would challenge the claim that linguistic structure shapes embodied representations.</li>
                <li>If adding explicit noise or contradictions to spatial and procedural descriptions during training (e.g., 20-30% of descriptions contain physically impossible events) improves rather than impairs embodied planning, this would challenge the assumption that models learn from the consistency and physical validity of descriptions in training data.</li>
                <li>If early layers (1-4) can be trained to perform abstract planning tasks with accuracy comparable to late layers (within 15%), this would challenge the claim that abstract planning capabilities specifically emerge in late layers due to hierarchical composition.</li>
                <li>If removing all procedural and spatial language from the training corpus (leaving only dialogue, narrative, and abstract text) results in less than 40% degradation in embodied planning performance, this would challenge the claim that exposure to procedural language is necessary for developing embodied reasoning capabilities.</li>
                <li>If models show equal performance on spatial reasoning tasks regardless of whether the training corpus contains rich spatial descriptions or minimal spatial language, this would challenge the theory that statistical regularities in spatial language are the source of spatial knowledge.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact computational mechanism by which distributed token representations are composed into structured spatial configurations remains unclear, particularly how coordinate-free qualitative representations support even approximate metric spatial reasoning when needed. </li>
    <li>How language models handle novel combinations of known spatial primitives and whether they can genuinely generalize compositionally to unseen spatial configurations or merely interpolate between training examples is not fully explained by the theory. </li>
    <li>The role of scale (model size and training data size) in the emergence of embodied reasoning capabilities is acknowledged but not fully characterized - the theory does not specify the minimum scale required for each representational level to emerge or how capabilities scale with model size. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain how models handle ambiguous or underspecified spatial descriptions that humans resolve using visual imagery or embodied simulation, suggesting a gap in the linguistic-only account. </li>
    <li>The relationship between the three proposed levels and the actual number of layers in models of different sizes is not specified - it's unclear if the 1-4, 5-8, 9-12 division scales proportionally with model depth or remains fixed. </li>

        "If a language model is trained exclusively on spatial and procedural language with all other content removed, it may develop more efficient and accurate embodied reasoning capabilities than general-purpose models (by focusing representational capacity on relevant knowledge), or it may lose crucial contextual knowledge that supports spatial reasoning (e.g., understanding goals, object functions, social contexts), leading to brittle performance.",
        "Artificially enhancing attention mechanisms to maintain stronger object-state bindings throughout generation (e.g., by adding explicit memory slots or increasing attention weights for object-tracking heads) may dramatically improve planning accuracy by 40-60%, or may lead to overly rigid plans that fail to adapt to context and show decreased performance on tasks requiring flexibility.",
        "Language models may be able to perform embodied planning in physically impossible worlds (e.g., with different gravity, non-Euclidean geometry, or different physical laws) if trained on science fiction or fantasy text describing such worlds, which would reveal whether their representations are truly physics-based or purely linguistic. If successful, this would suggest representations are linguistic-statistical rather than grounded in physical laws.",
        "Combining language model representations with even minimal sensory grounding (e.g., 100-1000 images or short videos) might lead to superlinear improvements in embodied planning (e.g., 3-5x improvement from 10x more grounding data), suggesting the representations are partially compatible with perceptual grounding, or might show only linear or sublinear improvements if the representations are fundamentally incompatible with perceptual formats.",
        "The hierarchical structure of embodied knowledge might be invertible - using high-level plans to constrain and improve low-level spatial reasoning through top-down processing - which could enable 30-50% more efficient planning by pruning impossible action sequences early, or might provide no benefit if the representations are strictly feedforward.",
        "Training models with explicit supervision at each representational level (e.g., auxiliary losses for spatial primitives at early layers, relational structure at middle layers, and planning at late layers) might accelerate learning and improve performance by 2-3x, or might interfere with the natural emergence of representations and decrease performance.",
        "Models might be able to transfer embodied knowledge across languages more effectively than other types of knowledge if spatial and physical concepts are more universal, showing &lt;10% performance degradation on zero-shot cross-lingual embodied reasoning, or might show typical degradation (30-50%) if the linguistic encoding is language-specific."

        "If scrambling the order of layers in a transformer while maintaining their learned weights does not significantly impair (&gt;20% degradation) embodied planning performance, this would challenge the claim that hierarchical levels emerge from architectural depth and that information flows from primitive to abstract representations.",
        "If language models perform equally well (within 10% performance) on embodied planning tasks involving objects and spatial relationships that are never or rarely described together in natural language (e.g., using a microscope to play basketball, storing a car inside a teacup), this would challenge the theory that they learn through statistical co-occurrence of physical descriptions.",
        "If ablating attention mechanisms and replacing them with simple feedforward connections does not impair (&gt;30% degradation) the model's ability to track object states across procedural steps, this would challenge the claim that attention serves as the primary binding mechanism for maintaining object-state relationships.",
        "If models trained on languages with fundamentally different spatial encoding systems (e.g., absolute vs. relative spatial frames of reference, as in Guugu Yimithirr vs. English) show identical internal representations (&gt;90% similarity in representational geometry), this would challenge the claim that linguistic structure shapes embodied representations.",
        "If adding explicit noise or contradictions to spatial and procedural descriptions during training (e.g., 20-30% of descriptions contain physically impossible events) improves rather than impairs embodied planning, this would challenge the assumption that models learn from the consistency and physical validity of descriptions in training data.",
        "If early layers (1-4) can be trained to perform abstract planning tasks with accuracy comparable to late layers (within 15%), this would challenge the claim that abstract planning capabilities specifically emerge in late layers due to hierarchical composition.",
        "If removing all procedural and spatial language from the training corpus (leaving only dialogue, narrative, and abstract text) results in less than 40% degradation in embodied planning performance, this would challenge the claim that exposure to procedural language is necessary for developing embodied reasoning capabilities.",
        "If models show equal performance on spatial reasoning tasks regardless of whether the training corpus contains rich spatial descriptions or minimal spatial language, this would challenge the theory that statistical regularities in spatial language are the source of spatial knowledge."

        "The theory applies primarily to spatial and procedural knowledge that is frequently described in language; for embodied knowledge that is rarely verbalized (e.g., fine motor control, proprioception, balance), the linguistic shadow mechanism would not provide sufficient signal.",
