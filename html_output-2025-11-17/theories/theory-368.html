                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bias Accumulation and Mitigation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about alignment between proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, Likert-style) and expert human review for software development artifacts, including necessary conditions for high agreement.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that alignment between LLM-as-a-judge evaluations and expert human review degrades through multiplicative accumulation of distinct bias sources, but can be systematically mitigated through targeted interventions. The theory posits that biases accumulate non-linearly: each additional bias source (e.g., length bias, position bias, formatting bias, linguistic style bias) compounds existing biases rather than adding linearly. However, strategic mitigation interventions create 'bias circuit breakers' that prevent cascade effects. The theory identifies three critical mitigation mechanisms: (1) Structural decomposition - breaking evaluation into independent sub-tasks that isolate bias sources, (2) Calibration anchoring - providing reference examples that reset bias accumulation, and (3) Multi-perspective aggregation - using diverse evaluation framings that average out systematic biases. High alignment occurs when the product of individual bias factors remains below a critical threshold (typically 0.7-0.8 alignment maintenance), which requires active mitigation when more than 2-3 bias sources are present.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bias accumulation follows a multiplicative model: Overall_Alignment = Base_Alignment × (1 - B₁) × (1 - B₂) × ... × (1 - Bₙ), where Bᵢ represents the magnitude of the i-th independent bias source (0 to 1 scale).</li>
                <li>When more than 2-3 significant bias sources (Bᵢ > 0.15) are present without mitigation, alignment drops below acceptable thresholds (< 0.70 correlation with expert review).</li>
                <li>Structural decomposition mitigation reduces effective bias magnitude by factor of 0.4-0.6 for each isolated sub-task, as biases cannot compound across independent evaluations.</li>
                <li>Calibration anchoring (providing 2-3 reference examples spanning the quality spectrum) reduces systematic biases by 30-50% by establishing consistent evaluation standards.</li>
                <li>Multi-perspective aggregation (evaluating from 3+ distinct framings) reduces bias through averaging when individual biases have correlation < 0.6, following: Aggregated_Bias ≈ Average_Individual_Bias / √N_perspectives.</li>
                <li>Critical mitigation threshold: High alignment (> 0.80) requires either ≤ 2 active bias sources OR deployment of at least one mitigation mechanism per 2 bias sources.</li>
                <li>Bias sources interact synergistically: the combined effect of length bias and position bias together is 1.3-1.8× worse than their independent effects would predict.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs demonstrate systematic biases in evaluation tasks including length bias (preferring longer responses), position bias (favoring earlier or later items), and verbosity bias (rating more detailed explanations higher regardless of correctness). </li>
    <li>Evaluation quality degrades non-linearly when multiple confounding factors are present simultaneously, suggesting multiplicative rather than additive bias effects. </li>
    <li>Structured evaluation rubrics and decomposed assessment criteria improve alignment between automated and human evaluations by isolating specific quality dimensions. </li>
    <li>Providing reference examples and calibration anchors in evaluation prompts reduces systematic biases and improves consistency across evaluations. </li>
    <li>Ensemble methods and multi-model aggregation can reduce individual model biases when the biases are not perfectly correlated across models. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For software artifacts with 4+ bias sources present (e.g., long length, complex structure, inconsistent formatting, domain-specific terminology), implementing structural decomposition (evaluating security, performance, maintainability separately) will improve alignment from ~0.55-0.65 to ~0.75-0.85.</li>
                <li>Providing 3 calibrated reference examples (low/medium/high quality) at the start of evaluation prompts will reduce score variance by 35-45% and improve alignment by 0.10-0.15 correlation points for artifacts with moderate bias presence.</li>
                <li>Evaluating the same artifact from 3 different perspectives (e.g., 'assess as a code reviewer', 'assess as a security auditor', 'assess as a maintenance engineer') and averaging scores will produce 20-30% better alignment than single-perspective evaluation when individual perspectives show < 0.6 correlation with each other.</li>
                <li>For artifacts where length bias and formatting bias are both present, addressing only one bias source will yield minimal improvement (< 0.05 alignment gain), but addressing both will yield 0.15-0.25 alignment gain, demonstrating multiplicative interaction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal decomposition granularity: breaking evaluation into 3-5 sub-tasks may maximize bias mitigation, but further decomposition into 10+ micro-tasks might reintroduce aggregation biases that offset the benefits, creating a U-shaped relationship between decomposition level and alignment.</li>
                <li>Whether calibration anchors need to be domain-specific or if general software quality examples can transfer across different artifact types (e.g., using web application examples to calibrate evaluation of embedded systems code).</li>
                <li>Whether the multiplicative bias model holds when bias sources exceed 6-7 factors, or if there is a saturation effect where additional biases have diminishing marginal impact on alignment degradation.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial mitigation strategies (deliberately introducing counter-biases to offset known biases) could achieve better alignment than neutral mitigation approaches, or if this introduces unpredictable second-order effects.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If alignment degradation with multiple bias sources follows an additive rather than multiplicative pattern (Overall_Alignment = Base - B₁ - B₂ - ... - Bₙ), this would invalidate the core accumulation mechanism and suggest independent rather than compounding bias effects.</li>
                <li>If structural decomposition shows no improvement or worse alignment compared to holistic evaluation, this would challenge the bias isolation hypothesis and suggest that decomposition introduces more problems than it solves.</li>
                <li>If providing calibration anchors has no effect on evaluation consistency or actually increases variance, this would contradict the calibration mechanism and suggest LLMs cannot effectively use reference examples.</li>
                <li>If multi-perspective aggregation produces worse alignment than single-perspective evaluation, this would indicate that perspective diversity introduces noise rather than averaging out biases.</li>
                <li>If artifacts with only 1-2 bias sources show similar alignment to artifacts with 5+ bias sources, this would challenge the threshold-based mitigation requirements.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to identify and quantify the magnitude of individual bias sources in practice, which is necessary for applying the multiplicative model. </li>
    <li>The interaction between different mitigation strategies (e.g., using both decomposition AND calibration simultaneously) is not explicitly modeled - they may have synergistic or interfering effects. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how different LLM architectures, model sizes, or training approaches might have different baseline bias profiles or respond differently to mitigation strategies. </li>
    <li>Temporal effects are not modeled - whether bias accumulation or mitigation effectiveness changes as LLMs are updated or fine-tuned over time. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
