                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dual-Process Theory of LM Arithmetic</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models (LMs) perform arithmetic via two interacting processes: (1) pattern-based retrieval, where the model leverages memorized or frequently seen arithmetic facts and templates, and (2) emergent algorithmic reasoning, where the model composes multi-step symbolic manipulations from its learned representations. The balance between these processes depends on the familiarity, complexity, and context of the arithmetic problem.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is prompted with arithmetic problems that are rare or OOD, accuracy will increase with model scale and chain-of-thought prompting.</li>
                <li>For arithmetic facts seen in training, even small LMs will perform well, but for novel multi-step problems, only large LMs will succeed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on synthetic arithmetic data with novel operations, it may develop emergent reasoning for those operations at sufficient scale.</li>
                <li>There may exist a threshold model size above which algorithmic reasoning for arithmetic becomes robust, regardless of training data frequency.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If small LMs can perform complex, unfamiliar arithmetic as well as large LMs, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LMs never show improved arithmetic with chain-of-thought prompting, the emergent reasoning law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LMs fine-tuned on arithmetic datasets can perform well even on OOD problems, suggesting fine-tuning can override the dual-process balance. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The components are known, but their integration and conditional dominance in arithmetic is novel.</p>
