                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Symbolic-LLM Distillation Theory (HSLDT): Iterative Hypothesis Refinement through Symbolic-LLM Feedback Loops</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the combination of LLMs and symbolic reasoning systems enables iterative refinement of scientific hypotheses by leveraging LLMs' generative capabilities and symbolic systems' logical rigor. LLMs propose candidate hypotheses by synthesizing information from large corpora, while symbolic systems evaluate, formalize, and test these hypotheses, feeding results back to the LLM for further refinement. This feedback loop accelerates the convergence toward robust, generalizable scientific theories.</p>
