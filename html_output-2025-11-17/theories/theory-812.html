                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents can achieve superior task performance and self-improvement by actively and deliberately controlling what, when, and how information is stored, retrieved, and modified in their external and internal memory systems. The theory asserts that such deliberate memory control enables LLM agents to dynamically adapt to task demands, optimize resource usage, and iteratively refine their own cognitive strategies.</p>

    <li>Neural Turing Machines and Differentiable Neural Computers use attention mechanisms to select relevant memory for current tasks. </li>
