                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Functional Stable Coactivation Criterion for Concept Individuation – General Theory (Contextual Modulation Extension)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This extension of the FSCCCI posits that while stable coactivation patterns define concepts, the stability criterion is modulated by context. Concepts are individuated by a core coactivation pattern that is stable across most contexts, but can be flexibly modulated by contextual inputs, allowing for context-sensitive conceptual representations. This theory accounts for both context-invariant and context-dependent aspects of conceptual knowledge, predicting that concepts have a stable 'core' with contextually modifiable 'peripheral' coactivation patterns.</p>
