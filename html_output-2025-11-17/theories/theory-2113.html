                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Synthesis Theory (IRAST) – Theory Quality Optimization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the iterative retrieval-augmented synthesis process in LLMs not only enables theory distillation but also optimizes for theory quality by incorporating explicit evaluation and refinement steps. Through cycles of evidence retrieval, candidate theory generation, and critical evaluation (including self-critique and external feedback), LLMs can converge on theories that maximize explanatory power, predictive accuracy, and evidential grounding.</p>
