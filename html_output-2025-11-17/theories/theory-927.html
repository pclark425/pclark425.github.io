                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-927</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Memory Access Enables Flexible Reasoning in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents equipped with compositional memory access mechanisms—where the agent can dynamically combine, query, and manipulate multiple memory modules or entries—achieve flexible reasoning and adaptive behavior in text games. Such compositionality allows the agent to synthesize new knowledge, resolve ambiguities, and plan multi-step actions by integrating information from disparate memory sources.</p>
