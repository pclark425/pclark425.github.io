                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2009</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Guided Contradiction Resolution</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only aggregate feedback patterns but also iteratively refine extracted laws by identifying and resolving contradictions within reviewer feedback. By leveraging their ability to detect semantic inconsistencies and reconcile divergent viewpoints, LLMs can produce more robust, nuanced, and context-sensitive laws governing peer review feedback.</p>
