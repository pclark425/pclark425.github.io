                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1642</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Simulation Fidelity Boundary Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the fidelity of scientific simulations using LLMs is fundamentally bounded by the interplay between model scale (capacity and training data), alignment (objective and fine-tuning), and prompt/context design. The theory asserts that for any given scientific subdomain, there exists a multidimensional boundary—determined by these three factors—beyond which further improvements in one factor alone yield diminishing or negligible returns in simulation fidelity.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>For a fixed LLM and scientific subdomain, simultaneous improvements in scale, alignment, and prompt/context design are required to push simulation fidelity beyond current plateaus.</li>
                <li>In highly complex subdomains, simulation fidelity will be more sensitive to prompt/context and alignment than to further increases in model scale alone.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel architectures that integrate all three factors (e.g., adaptive alignment based on prompt context) may shift or reshape the simulation fidelity boundary.</li>
                <li>In some subdomains, the boundary may exhibit non-linear or discontinuous behavior, with sudden jumps in fidelity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If simulation fidelity continues to increase indefinitely with improvements in only one factor (scale, alignment, or prompt/context) for a fixed subdomain, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If the boundary location is not reproducible across independent studies for the same subdomain and model, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of user interaction (e.g., iterative or interactive prompting) on the multidimensional boundary is not addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential impact of external tools (e.g., retrieval augmentation) on the boundary is not considered. </li>
