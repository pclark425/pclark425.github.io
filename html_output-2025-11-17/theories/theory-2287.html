                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that actionable feedback is not merely beneficial but is a necessary precondition for iterative improvement in the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories. Without actionable feedback, evaluators' criteria and judgments remain static or divergent, while its presence enables systematic alignment, learning, and convergence toward more reliable and valid evaluation outcomes.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>There may exist a threshold effect, where only feedback above a certain informativeness leads to improvement, while less informative feedback does not.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluators improve reliability or validity in the absence of actionable feedback, the necessity claim is falsified.</li>
                <li>If actionable feedback is provided but evaluators do not converge or improve, the sufficiency of feedback is challenged.</li>
