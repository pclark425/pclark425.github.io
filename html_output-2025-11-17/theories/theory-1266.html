                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximally aligns the structural inductive biases of the model with the salient properties of the graph modality. The theory predicts that such alignment enables more efficient learning, better generalization, and improved transfer across tasks and domains.</p>
