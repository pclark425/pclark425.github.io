                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1600</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Load and Prompt Complexity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is modulated by the cognitive load imposed by prompt complexity, including the number of reasoning steps, ambiguity, and the presence of multi-modal or multi-turn context. As prompt complexity increases beyond the LLM's effective context window and reasoning capacity, simulation accuracy declines, regardless of data alignment. The theory further posits that prompt engineering and context structuring can mitigate these effects up to a threshold.</p>
