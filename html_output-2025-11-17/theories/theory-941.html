                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents (General Theory 2)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the efficiency and effectiveness of memory use in LLM agents for text games is governed by the alignment between the agent's memory architecture and the information flow constraints imposed by the task. Specifically, the theory claims that memory should be structured and accessed in a way that mirrors the causal and informational dependencies of the game, and that mismatches between memory structure and task structure lead to suboptimal performance.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
