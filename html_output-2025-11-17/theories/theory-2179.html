                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Guided Rule Extraction and Empirical Validation for Scientific Prediction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when provided with a large corpus of scholarly literature and a specific scientific query, can systematically extract candidate rules and theories by identifying recurring patterns, causal relationships, and empirical regularities. These extracted rules can then be prioritized for empirical validation, enabling accelerated scientific discovery and refinement of predictive models.</p>
