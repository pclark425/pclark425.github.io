                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Knowledge Graph Belief State Theory for Text-Based Interactive Environments</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that effective planning in text-based interactive environments requires maintaining a probabilistic knowledge graph that represents belief states over entities, relations, and properties, where edge weights and node confidences are derived from LLM uncertainty estimates. The theory posits that LLMs generate not just predictions but also calibrated uncertainty measures that can be mapped to belief distributions over possible world states. These belief states are maintained as weighted knowledge graphs where nodes represent entities and concepts, edges represent relations with associated probabilities, and the graph structure evolves through Bayesian updates as new textual observations are processed. The framework distinguishes between epistemic uncertainty (reducible through information gathering) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness), enabling information-seeking behaviors and risk-aware planning. Planning algorithms operate over this probabilistic symbolic representation using expected utility maximization that accounts for both goal achievement and information gain, selecting actions that are robust to uncertainty about the true world state.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A belief state in a text-based interactive environment can be represented as a probabilistic knowledge graph G = (V, E, P_V, P_E) where V is a set of entity and concept nodes, E is a set of relation edges, P_V assigns probability distributions over node properties (including existence), and P_E assigns probabilities to edge existence and relation types.</li>
                <li>LLM uncertainty about world state elements can be quantified through multiple complementary measures: (1) token-level probability distributions from the softmax layer, (2) semantic entropy across paraphrased queries to capture meaning-level uncertainty, (3) consistency across multiple samples to detect model disagreement, and (4) verbalized confidence scores when the model is prompted to express uncertainty.</li>
                <li>The mapping from LLM outputs to knowledge graph belief states follows a probabilistic extraction process where: entities are extracted with confidence scores derived from LLM uncertainty, relations are identified with likelihood estimates based on extraction confidence, and contradictory information is resolved through Bayesian updating where evidence is weighted by its uncertainty-derived reliability.</li>
                <li>Bayesian updates to the belief state follow the rule: P(G|o_new) ∝ P(o_new|G) * P(G), where o_new is a new observation, G is a graph hypothesis, and the likelihood P(o_new|G) is derived from LLM confidence that the observation would be generated given that graph structure. Multiple graph hypotheses are maintained when uncertainty is high.</li>
                <li>Planning performance in text environments improves when the planner has access to calibrated uncertainty estimates, as this enables: (1) information-seeking actions when epistemic uncertainty is high, (2) risk-aware decision making that avoids actions with uncertain negative consequences, (3) more efficient exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and (4) graceful degradation when forced to act under uncertainty.</li>
                <li>The knowledge graph belief state should maintain multiple hypotheses about ambiguous or uncertain aspects of the world state, with probabilities that sum to 1 for mutually exclusive hypotheses. This enables the system to hedge its bets and recover from initially incorrect interpretations.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty propagates through the knowledge graph according to probabilistic inference rules, where the confidence in derived facts depends on the confidence in the premises and the strength of the inference rule. For example, if A→B with confidence p1 and A is true with confidence p2, then B has confidence at least p1*p2.</li>
                <li>Action selection should maximize expected utility computed over the belief distribution: EU(a) = Σ_G P(G) * U(G, a), where the sum is over graph hypotheses G, P(G) is the belief probability, and U(G, a) is the utility of action a in world state G. Utility accounts for both goal achievement and information gain (reduction in entropy of the belief distribution).</li>
                <li>The system should distinguish between aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in the environment, irreducible) and epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge, reducible through observation), as they require different planning strategies: epistemic uncertainty motivates information gathering, while aleatoric uncertainty requires robust planning.</li>
                <li>Temporal dynamics are handled by maintaining temporal annotations on graph elements, with confidence in facts decaying over time according to domain-specific persistence models (e.g., object locations may change, but object properties typically persist).</li>
                <li>Contradictions in the knowledge graph are resolved by: (1) maintaining multiple hypotheses when evidence is ambiguous, (2) preferring more recent evidence when temporal ordering is clear, (3) preferring higher-confidence evidence when recency is similar, and (4) flagging persistent contradictions as requiring active information gathering.</li>
                <li>The computational complexity of exact inference over the probabilistic knowledge graph is managed through approximate inference methods such as: particle filtering over graph hypotheses, variational approximations to the belief distribution, or Monte Carlo sampling for expected utility computation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs exhibit varying levels of confidence in their predictions, which can be quantified through methods like token probability distributions, ensemble disagreement, and verbalized uncertainty. Larger models show some ability to know what they know, though calibration can degrade with scale. </li>
    <li>Knowledge graphs provide structured symbolic representations that support reasoning and planning in ways that pure neural approaches struggle with, enabling explicit representation of entities, relations, and logical constraints. </li>
    <li>Text-based interactive environments like text games and dialogue systems require maintaining world state representations that update based on textual observations and actions, with graph-based representations showing promise for state tracking. </li>
    <li>Belief state planning under uncertainty is a fundamental problem in AI, traditionally addressed through POMDPs and probabilistic reasoning frameworks that maintain distributions over possible states. </li>
    <li>Recent work has shown that combining symbolic and neural approaches can leverage the strengths of both paradigms, with neuro-symbolic methods showing promise for knowledge representation and reasoning. </li>
    <li>Probabilistic knowledge graphs and uncertain knowledge representation have been studied through frameworks like probabilistic soft logic, Markov logic networks, and probabilistic databases. </li>
    <li>Information-seeking behavior and active learning in dialogue systems benefit from explicit uncertainty representation, enabling systems to ask clarifying questions when confidence is low. </li>
    <li>Bayesian approaches to knowledge graph construction and refinement enable principled updating of beliefs as new evidence is observed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In text-based navigation tasks with ambiguous descriptions (e.g., 'the door' when multiple doors exist), agents using probabilistic knowledge graph belief states will ask clarifying questions more frequently than agents using deterministic representations, leading to 20-40% fewer navigation errors.</li>
                <li>When LLM uncertainty estimates are well-calibrated (calibration error < 0.1), planning algorithms that explicitly account for this uncertainty will achieve 15-30% higher success rates on multi-step text-based tasks compared to algorithms that treat LLM outputs as deterministic.</li>
                <li>Knowledge graph belief states that maintain multiple hypotheses (top-k with k≥3) will recover from initially incorrect interpretations 50-70% more often than single-hypothesis systems when disambiguating evidence is encountered within 5 steps.</li>
                <li>In dialogue-based interactive environments, systems using uncertainty-aware belief states will generate information-seeking behaviors that human evaluators rate as 30-50% more natural compared to systems that always act on the most likely interpretation.</li>
                <li>The correlation between LLM-derived uncertainty and actual error rate will be stronger (Pearson r > 0.6) for entity extraction than for relation extraction, as relations require more contextual reasoning.</li>
                <li>Systems that distinguish epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty will allocate 40-60% more actions to information gathering in high epistemic uncertainty situations, leading to better long-term performance.</li>
                <li>In environments with explicit probabilistic mechanics (e.g., random events), systems that separately model aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty will achieve 20-35% better calibration of their predictions compared to systems that conflate these uncertainty types.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether probabilistic knowledge graph belief states can effectively handle highly dynamic environments where the world state changes every 1-2 steps due to other agents or autonomous processes, or whether the Bayesian update mechanism becomes unstable with frequent contradictory evidence and requires architectural modifications like forgetting mechanisms or change detection.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM uncertainty estimates remain calibrated when the text environment contains adversarial or deliberately misleading information (e.g., unreliable narrators, deceptive agents), and whether the belief state representation can detect and flag such situations through consistency checking or meta-reasoning about source reliability.</li>
                <li>Whether the approach scales to very large, open-world text environments with >10,000 entities and >100,000 relations (e.g., full-scale virtual worlds or extensive knowledge bases), or whether the knowledge graph becomes too large and sparse to maintain effectively, requiring hierarchical or modular graph structures.</li>
                <li>Whether different LLM architectures (e.g., autoregressive GPT-style vs. masked BERT-style, models from 1B to 100B+ parameters, instruction-tuned vs. base models) produce uncertainty estimates that are compatible with the same belief state update mechanisms, or whether architecture-specific calibration and uncertainty extraction methods are required.</li>
                <li>Whether the theory extends to multi-agent text environments where other agents' belief states must also be modeled (theory of mind), creating nested uncertainty about others' knowledge and intentions, and whether this recursive reasoning remains tractable or requires approximations.</li>
                <li>Whether long-horizon planning (>10 steps) remains tractable when accounting for uncertainty propagation through the entire plan, or whether approximations that sacrifice optimality (e.g., replanning, hierarchical planning, or uncertainty pruning) are necessary for practical performance.</li>
                <li>Whether the framework can handle cross-lingual text environments where uncertainty arises not just from world state ambiguity but also from translation uncertainty, and whether uncertainty estimates compose appropriately across language boundaries.</li>
                <li>Whether the probabilistic knowledge graph representation can effectively capture and reason about counterfactual scenarios and hypothetical reasoning (e.g., 'what if I had taken the other path?'), which are important for planning but create additional layers of uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Whether human users can effectively interpret and trust the uncertainty estimates presented by the system, and whether transparency about uncertainty improves or impairs human-AI collaboration in interactive text environments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If planning performance does not improve (or degrades by >5%) when using LLM uncertainty estimates compared to using only the most likely LLM predictions, this would suggest that either the uncertainty estimates are poorly calibrated, the planning algorithm cannot effectively leverage them, or the overhead of probabilistic reasoning outweighs its benefits.</li>
                <li>If the knowledge graph belief state frequently assigns high confidence (>0.8) to incorrect facts while assigning low confidence (<0.5) to correct facts in more than 30% of cases, this would indicate that the uncertainty quantification or belief update mechanisms are fundamentally flawed or that LLM uncertainty is not predictive of correctness.</li>
                <li>If information-seeking actions selected based on uncertainty estimates (e.g., asking clarifying questions) do not reduce uncertainty more effectively than random exploration or fixed heuristics, this would challenge the utility of explicit uncertainty representation for active learning.</li>
                <li>If the system performs worse on tasks where ground truth uncertainty is known (e.g., explicitly probabilistic environments with stated probabilities) compared to deterministic baselines, this would suggest the probabilistic framework adds more noise than signal or that the inference mechanisms are incorrect.</li>
                <li>If Bayesian updates to the belief state lead to increasing rather than decreasing uncertainty over time as more observations are gathered (entropy increases rather than decreases), this would indicate a fundamental problem with the update mechanism, evidence integration, or the presence of systematic contradictions.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of maintaining probabilistic knowledge graphs scales super-linearly (worse than O(n log n)) with environment complexity in practice, making the approach impractical for even moderately complex environments, this would challenge the feasibility of the approach.</li>
                <li>If systems using probabilistic belief states are significantly less robust to distribution shift (e.g., new types of entities or relations not seen during training) compared to end-to-end neural approaches, this would suggest that the symbolic structure is too brittle.</li>
                <li>If the distinction between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty does not lead to measurably different planning behaviors or improved performance, this would question whether this distinction is necessary in practice.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle temporal dynamics and the persistence of facts over time, particularly when the environment state changes due to actions by other agents or autonomous processes. While temporal annotations are mentioned, the specific decay models and update rules for temporal reasoning are not detailed. </li>
    <li>The computational complexity of exact probabilistic inference over large knowledge graphs may be prohibitive, and while the theory mentions approximate inference methods, it does not specify which methods are most appropriate for this domain or provide complexity bounds. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle meta-uncertainty (uncertainty about the uncertainty estimates themselves) or how to detect when LLM uncertainty estimates are systematically miscalibrated, which could lead to poor decisions. </li>
    <li>The integration of commonsense reasoning and world knowledge that goes beyond what is explicitly stated in the text observations is not fully specified in the theory. While COMET is cited, the mechanism for incorporating commonsense inferences into the belief state is unclear. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle different types of relations (causal, temporal, spatial, hierarchical) which may require different probabilistic reasoning mechanisms and have different uncertainty characteristics. </li>
    <li>The framework for utility functions is underspecified - how to balance goal achievement vs. information gain, how to set risk preferences, and how to handle multi-objective scenarios is not detailed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle partial observability at the text level itself (e.g., when descriptions are incomplete or when the agent has limited sensory access), as opposed to uncertainty about interpretation. </li>
    <li>The mechanism for detecting and recovering from systematic errors or model failures (e.g., when the LLM consistently misinterprets a particular type of description) is not specified. </li>
