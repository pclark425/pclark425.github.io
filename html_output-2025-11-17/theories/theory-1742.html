                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Consistency Modeling for Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models (LMs) encode both statistical and semantic regularities in lists. Anomalies are detected as items that disrupt the semantic or structural coherence of the list, as inferred by the model's internal representations and attention patterns. This theory posits that LMs can perform unsupervised anomaly detection by leveraging their learned, implicit understanding of semantic and structural relationships, without explicit rules or supervision.</p>
