                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Decorrelation and Externalization Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through a process of iterative decorrelation and externalization. In each generate-then-reflect cycle, the LLM externalizes its internal representations and error signals, and through reflection, decorrelates its subsequent outputs from prior errors and biases. This process enables the model to progressively reduce error entanglement, leading to more accurate and robust answers over multiple iterations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are prompted to explicitly externalize their error signals and reasoning at each reflection step, the diversity and quality of answers will improve more than with unstructured reflection.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the externalization process is made too explicit or too abstract, it may disrupt the decorrelation process and reduce answer quality.</li>
                <li>There may be a threshold number of reflection cycles beyond which further decorrelation does not yield additional improvements, or may even degrade performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show reduced error correlation or improved answer quality after multiple generate-then-reflect cycles, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If externalization of reasoning does not increase robustness to initial hallucinations, the theory's mechanism is questionable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some tasks may not benefit from decorrelation if the initial answer is already optimal or if errors are not entangled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes known elements but introduces a novel mechanism and predictions.</p>
