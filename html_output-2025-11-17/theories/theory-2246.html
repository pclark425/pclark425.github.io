                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should be dynamically calibrated based on the evolving performance of LLMs, the domain of application, and the feedback from human experts. The calibration process involves iterative adjustment of evaluation criteria weights and thresholds, informed by empirical validation and meta-evaluation of LLM outputs over time.</p>
