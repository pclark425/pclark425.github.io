                <p><strong>Name:</strong> IRAST – General Theory of Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively retrieving relevant evidence fragments and synthesizing them into increasingly abstract, coherent, and predictive theory statements. The process is characterized by cycles of retrieval, evaluation, abstraction, and synthesis, with each iteration refining the emerging theory in response to new evidence and contradictions.</p>
