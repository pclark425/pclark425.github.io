                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2232</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Robustness Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must account for the robustness of the theory across varying contexts, including domain shifts, data perturbations, and changes in scientific paradigms. A theory is considered robust if its core claims and predictions remain valid under reasonable contextual changes, and if it can be adapted or critiqued in light of new evidence or perspectives. This approach emphasizes the dynamic and situated nature of scientific knowledge, especially when generated by LLMs trained on diverse and sometimes inconsistent data.</p>

    <li>LLMs are trained on heterogeneous data and may generate theories that are brittle or context-dependent. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law extends the concept of robustness to the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories, which may be more prone to context-specific errors.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Robustness and generalizability are valued in scientific theory evaluation, but not always formalized for LLM-generated outputs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly requiring contextual robustness as a criterion for LLM-generated theory evaluation is novel.</p>
