                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by integrating hierarchical episodic and semantic memory systems. Episodic memory stores temporally ordered, context-rich experiences, while semantic memory encodes abstracted, generalized knowledge. The agent dynamically selects between episodic recall (for context-specific reasoning) and semantic retrieval (for generalization), and can consolidate episodic traces into semantic knowledge over time. This integration enables both rapid adaptation to new tasks and robust generalization across domains.</p>
