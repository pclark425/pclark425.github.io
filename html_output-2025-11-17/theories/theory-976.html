                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-976</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Abstraction Enables Efficient Generalization in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents for text games can achieve efficient generalization and robust reasoning by organizing memory hierarchically—storing fine-grained experiences at lower levels and abstracted, high-level schemas at higher levels. Hierarchical abstraction allows agents to compress experiences, recognize patterns, and transfer knowledge across diverse game scenarios.</p>
