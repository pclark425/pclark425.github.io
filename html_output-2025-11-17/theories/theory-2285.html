                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that actionable feedback is a necessary precondition for the iterative improvement of evaluation protocols for LLM-generated scientific theories. Without actionable feedback, evaluators and systems are unable to systematically identify, address, and correct deficiencies in their evaluation criteria or processes, leading to stagnation or even degradation in evaluation quality over time.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Iterative processes in scientific peer review and machine learning require feedback to drive improvement; absence of feedback leads to stagnation. </li>
    <li>Meta-evaluation studies show that evaluation rubrics only improve when feedback is provided and acted upon. </li>
    <li>Educational psychology demonstrates that learning and improvement are contingent on feedback that is actionable and specific. </li>
    <li>In software engineering, iterative development cycles without actionable feedback result in repeated errors and lack of progress. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While feedback's role in learning is established, its necessity as a precondition for iterative improvement in LLM evaluation is a novel extension.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The importance of feedback for learning and improvement is well-established in educational psychology and iterative design.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law specifically frames actionable feedback as a necessary condition for the iterative improvement of evaluation protocols for LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Biases in peer review and algorithmic evaluation are only reduced when feedback highlights their presence and suggests corrective actions. </li>
    <li>Studies in algorithmic fairness show that feedback loops are necessary to identify and mitigate bias. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general principle is established, but its explicit application to LLM evaluation and scientific theory assessment is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Feedback loops are known to be important in bias correction in both human and algorithmic systems.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies the principle specifically to the context of LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation, emphasizing actionable feedback as the mechanism.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Evaluation protocols for LLM-generated scientific theories that do not incorporate actionable feedback will show little to no improvement in accuracy or reliability over multiple iterations.</li>
                <li>Introducing structured actionable feedback into an existing evaluation process will result in measurable improvements in evaluation quality metrics (e.g., inter-rater reliability, validity) over time.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The magnitude of improvement in evaluation quality may depend on the specificity and granularity of the actionable feedback provided.</li>
                <li>There may be diminishing returns to actionable feedback if evaluators become desensitized or overwhelmed by feedback volume.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an evaluation process without actionable feedback shows significant iterative improvement, this would challenge the necessity of actionable feedback.</li>
                <li>If actionable feedback is provided but no improvement in evaluation quality is observed, the theory's sufficiency claim would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Instances where improvement occurs due to external factors (e.g., evaluator expertise increase) rather than feedback. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
