                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative, interactive process between human experts and AI systems. The process leverages the complementary strengths of human intuition, domain expertise, and AI's capacity for large-scale consistency and novelty checks, resulting in higher-quality theory assessment than either could achieve alone.</p>
