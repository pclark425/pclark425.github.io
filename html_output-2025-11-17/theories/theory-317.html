                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-View Fusion Optimality for Partial Observability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that optimal world models for AI systems operating under partial observability require multiple complementary views that each capture different aspects of the hidden state space, with fusion mechanisms that dynamically weight views based on their reliability and relevance to the current observability context. The theory posits that no single view can optimally balance fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task utility across all observability conditions. Instead, optimality emerges from: (1) maintaining a diverse set of views specialized along different dimensions (temporal aggregation, spatial resolution, abstraction level, modality), (2) learning which views are most informative under specific patterns of partial observability, and (3) implementing fusion mechanisms that can handle view disagreement as a signal of uncertainty. The optimal fusion strategy is context-dependent, varying based on the degree and type of partial observability, the task requirements, and available computational resources. This approach is particularly effective when different aspects of the environment have different observability characteristics and when the pattern of what is observable changes over time.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Under partial observability, no single world model representation can simultaneously optimize fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task utility across all contexts and tasks.</li>
                <li>Optimal world models require multiple views that specialize along different dimensions: temporal aggregation depth (short-term vs. long-term memory), spatial resolution (fine-grained vs. coarse), abstraction level (low-level features vs. high-level concepts), and modality (visual, linguistic, symbolic).</li>
                <li>The fusion mechanism must dynamically weight views based on: (1) the current pattern of partial observability, (2) historical reliability of each view in similar contexts, (3) view disagreement as a signal of uncertainty, and (4) computational constraints.</li>
                <li>Views should be designed to have complementary observability coverage: when one view has limited information due to partial observability, other views should be able to compensate by capturing different aspects of the hidden state.</li>
                <li>The optimal number and type of views depends on: the diversity of observability patterns in the environment, the diversity of tasks to be performed, the degree of correlation between different aspects of the state space, and available computational resources.</li>
                <li>View disagreement under partial observability should be interpreted as epistemic uncertainty and used to guide information-seeking behavior or conservative decision-making, rather than being resolved through simple averaging.</li>
                <li>Fusion optimality requires balancing exploration (maintaining diverse views) and exploitation (focusing on currently reliable views), with the balance shifting based on the stability of the observability pattern.</li>
                <li>In multi-task scenarios with varying observability patterns across tasks, views should specialize hierarchically: first by observability pattern, then by task family, then by model properties within each combination.</li>
                <li>The fusion mechanism should be learnable and adaptive, updating its weighting strategy based on observed performance and changing environmental conditions, rather than using fixed combination rules.</li>
                <li>Computational efficiency in multi-view systems can be achieved through: (1) lazy evaluation (only computing views when needed), (2) view pruning (temporarily disabling low-utility views), and (3) hierarchical fusion (coarse views first, fine views only when necessary).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Partial observability in reinforcement learning creates fundamental challenges where single-view representations fail to capture sufficient information for optimal decision-making, necessitating memory or multiple perspectives. </li>
    <li>Multi-view learning demonstrates that combining multiple representations of data can improve performance over single representations, especially when views capture complementary information. </li>
    <li>Ensemble methods show that combining multiple models with different biases can reduce variance and improve generalization, with optimal weighting depending on individual model reliability. </li>
    <li>Mixture of experts and routing networks demonstrate that task-conditional and context-conditional specialization improves performance when different inputs benefit from different processing. </li>
    <li>Attention mechanisms and dynamic weighting show that learned context-dependent combination of information sources outperforms fixed combination strategies. </li>
    <li>Modular neural networks demonstrate that specialized modules can be flexibly combined for different objectives, with composition strategies affecting overall system performance. </li>
    <li>Uncertainty estimation research shows that model disagreement in ensembles can serve as a useful signal for epistemic uncertainty, particularly relevant under partial observability. </li>
    <li>Multi-modal learning shows that different modalities provide complementary information, and fusion strategies significantly impact performance, especially when some modalities are missing or noisy. </li>
    <li>Transfer learning research demonstrates that different tasks benefit from different feature representations and that task similarity affects which representations are most useful. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a robotic navigation task where visual observations are intermittently occluded, a multi-view system with complementary views (e.g., one maintaining spatial memory, one tracking recent visual features, one modeling object permanence) will outperform single-view systems, with the performance gap increasing as occlusion frequency increases.</li>
                <li>In partially observable game environments (e.g., fog of war in strategy games), a system that learns to weight views based on information availability (e.g., upweighting memory-based views when current observations are limited) will achieve higher performance than fixed-weight fusion.</li>
                <li>When view disagreement is used as an uncertainty signal in partially observable environments, agents will demonstrate more conservative behavior in high-disagreement states and more confident behavior in low-disagreement states, leading to improved safety metrics.</li>
                <li>In multi-task reinforcement learning with varying partial observability across tasks, systems with task-and-observability-conditioned view selection will show faster adaptation to new tasks compared to task-agnostic or observability-agnostic systems.</li>
                <li>Computational efficiency can be improved by 30-50% through lazy view evaluation in multi-view systems, where views are only computed when their expected information gain exceeds a learned threshold, without significant performance degradation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether multi-view fusion systems can automatically discover and exploit latent structure in observability patterns (e.g., recognizing that certain state variables are always observed together) without explicit supervision is unknown but would demonstrate emergent organizational capabilities.</li>
                <li>The extent to which view disagreement can serve as a reliable proxy for epistemic uncertainty across diverse domains and whether this relationship holds in highly non-stationary environments is unclear but critical for safe deployment.</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal set of view types (e.g., temporal, spatial, abstract, concrete) that can optimally cover most partial observability scenarios, or whether each domain requires custom view designs, is unknown but would significantly impact the generality of the approach.</li>
                <li>How multi-view fusion systems scale to hundreds of views and whether emergent hierarchical organization naturally develops or must be explicitly designed is unknown but critical for complex real-world applications.</li>
                <li>Whether optimal fusion strategies learned in simulation transfer to real-world partial observability scenarios, or whether real-world sensor noise and uncertainty patterns require substantial relearning, is unclear but essential for practical deployment.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a single well-designed recurrent neural network consistently matches or exceeds the performance of multi-view fusion systems across diverse partial observability scenarios, the added complexity of multiple views would be unjustified.</li>
                <li>If fixed-weight fusion (e.g., simple averaging) performs as well as learned dynamic fusion across varying observability conditions, the theory's emphasis on context-dependent weighting would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If view disagreement does not correlate with prediction error or task performance degradation in partially observable environments, using it as an uncertainty signal would be invalid.</li>
                <li>If computational overhead of maintaining and fusing multiple views consistently outweighs performance benefits in resource-constrained scenarios, the practical utility of the approach would be limited.</li>
                <li>If views do not develop complementary specializations but instead converge to similar representations, the theoretical foundation of diversity-based optimality would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to initialize views to ensure diversity or how to prevent view collapse (all views converging to similar representations) during training. </li>
    <li>How to determine the optimal number of views for a given domain and whether this can be learned automatically or requires manual specification is not detailed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle catastrophic forgetting in continual learning scenarios where observability patterns change over time and views must adapt. </li>
    <li>How to balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in view fusion (maintaining diverse views vs. focusing on currently useful views) and whether this requires explicit mechanisms or emerges naturally is not fully specified. </li>
    <li>The interaction between view fusion and active perception (how the agent's actions affect what becomes observable) is not thoroughly addressed. </li>

        "When tasks are extremely similar and have identical observability requirements, view specialization by task may introduce unnecessary complexity without performance benefits.",
        "In continual learning scenarios where task or observability pattern identity is not provided at test time, the system must additionally solve a meta-learning problem of identifying the current context, which may limit effectiveness.",
