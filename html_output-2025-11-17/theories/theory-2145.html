                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HSLDT: Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective distillation of scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by LLMs occurs through an iterative process of abstraction and refinement, where LLMs first generate high-level candidate theories by abstracting patterns across papers, and then refine these theories through cycles of targeted retrieval, contradiction detection, and evidence-based revision. Symbolic reasoning modules can be integrated at each stage to enforce logical consistency and domain validity.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Domains with highly ambiguous or poorly formalized knowledge may not benefit from symbolic constraints. </li>
