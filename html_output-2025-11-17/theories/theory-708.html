                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Pattern Completion and Memorization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging their training on large corpora containing arithmetic expressions, learning to complete patterns and memorize frequent arithmetic facts, rather than by explicit algorithmic computation. This theory posits that the ability of LMs to answer arithmetic queries is a direct function of the frequency and diversity of arithmetic patterns in their training data, and that generalization to novel or rare expressions is limited.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Language models are highly accurate on arithmetic facts (e.g., 2+2=4) that are frequent in training data. </li>
    <li>Performance drops on rare or out-of-distribution arithmetic expressions. </li>
    <li>Carlini et al. (2021) show that LMs can memorize and regurgitate training data, including arithmetic facts. </li>
    <li>Brown et al. (2020) demonstrate that LMs excel at pattern completion for common sequences. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LMs' arithmetic accuracy correlates with the frequency of expressions in their training data. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While memorization is a known LM behavior, applying it as the primary mechanism for arithmetic is a novel framing.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that LMs can memorize frequent patterns and facts from their training data.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly frames arithmetic performance as a direct function of pattern frequency and memorization, not computation.</p>
