            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will generate molecules with desired properties when prompted with novel functional descriptions, even if such molecules are not present in the training data.</li>
                <li>Prompting LLMs with increasingly specific application constraints will yield molecules that are more tailored to those constraints, at the cost of reduced diversity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may generate molecules with emergent properties not explicitly described in the prompt, due to latent structure-function correlations.</li>
                <li>Semantic prompts describing hypothetical or non-natural functions may lead to the discovery of unprecedented chemical motifs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to generate molecules with the specified function when prompted, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce known molecules and cannot generalize to novel functions, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of training data biases on the diversity and novelty of generated molecules is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to handle highly complex or multi-objective prompts is not explained. </li>
