                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (General Formulation 1)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by the intrinsic molecular resilience of neurons—defined by their baseline expression of proteostasis, antioxidant, and synaptic maintenance pathways—and the cohesiveness of their intracellular signaling and metabolic networks. Neurons with high molecular resilience and tightly integrated protective pathways are more resistant to Aβ and tau pathology, while those with fragmented or less robust protective networks are more vulnerable.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Single-cell transcriptomics show that neurons with higher expression of chaperones, autophagy, and antioxidant genes are less likely to accumulate Aβ and tau inclusions. </li>
    <li>Proteomic studies reveal that resilient neurons maintain more stable synaptic and metabolic protein networks under stress. </li>
    <li>Experimental upregulation of proteostasis genes in animal models reduces Aβ and tau accumulation. </li>
    <li>Neurons with robust antioxidant responses show reduced oxidative damage and lower rates of inclusion formation. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the role of individual protective pathways is established, the concept of 'pathway cohesiveness' as a determinant of selective vulnerability is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Previous work has shown that proteostasis and antioxidant pathways are neuroprotective in models of neurodegeneration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit linking of pathway cohesiveness (network integration) with selective resistance at the population level in the visual cortex is novel.</p>
