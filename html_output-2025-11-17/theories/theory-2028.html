                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bilevel LLM-Simulation Theory of Quantitative Law Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be organized into a bilevel simulation architecture to distill quantitative laws from large corpora of scholarly papers. The first level is responsible for harmonizing and structuring scientific knowledge—resolving terminological, notational, and contextual inconsistencies—while the second level performs higher-order reasoning to induce, validate, and formalize quantitative laws. This approach leverages the compositional and abstraction capabilities of LLMs, enabling the discovery of robust, generalizable scientific laws from heterogeneous and noisy literature.</p>
