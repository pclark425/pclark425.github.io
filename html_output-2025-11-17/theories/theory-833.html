                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-833</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Orchestration Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance by orchestrating multiple memory systems in a hierarchical fashion. At the lowest level, programmatic (procedural) memory handles routine operations and short-term dependencies. At intermediate levels, episodic memory stores and retrieves temporally extended experiences. At the highest level, deliberative (strategic) memory enables explicit planning, abstraction, and transfer across tasks. The theory asserts that hierarchical coordination among these memory systems, guided by task structure and agent goals, is essential for robust, scalable, and generalizable problem-solving.</p>
