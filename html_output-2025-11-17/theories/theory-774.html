                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>

                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that sufficiently large and well-trained language models (LMs) develop internal, distributed representations and processes that approximate algorithmic reasoning for arithmetic tasks. These mechanisms are not explicitly programmed but arise as emergent properties from the model's optimization for next-token prediction on diverse data, enabling stepwise, compositional, and generalizable arithmetic computation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is scaled up beyond a certain size, its arithmetic accuracy on multi-step problems will increase disproportionately, especially with chain-of-thought prompting.</li>
                <li>If intermediate reasoning steps are suppressed or removed, the model's arithmetic accuracy will decrease.</li>
                <li>If a large LM is prompted with explicit stepwise reasoning, it will generalize to novel arithmetic tasks better than a small LM.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on a language with no explicit arithmetic expressions, it may still develop emergent arithmetic reasoning if the data is sufficiently large and diverse.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with adversarial arithmetic data (e.g., misleading intermediate steps), it may develop incorrect algorithmic reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on synthetic data with non-standard arithmetic rules, it may develop emergent reasoning for those rules.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If small models (<1B parameters) can perform multi-step arithmetic with chain-of-thought prompting, this would challenge the scaling law.</li>
                <li>If large models fail to generalize to novel arithmetic tasks even with stepwise reasoning, this would contradict the emergent reasoning hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If removing intermediate steps does not reduce arithmetic accuracy, the stepwise reasoning law would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small models show limited improvement with chain-of-thought prompting, suggesting other factors may contribute. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is closely related to existing work but introduces a novel mechanistic explanation for arithmetic reasoning.</p>
