                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Engineering for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by manipulating the quantum vacuum—specifically, by inducing local changes in vacuum energy density using advanced electromagnetic or material technologies—it is possible to create regions of altered spacetime geometry. These regions can act as FTL corridors by effectively reducing the local speed of light or altering causal structure, all within the constraints of current or near-future technology and budgets.</p>
