                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Framework Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework, where each theory is assessed along several orthogonal axes: logical consistency, empirical adequacy, novelty, explanatory power, and ethical/societal impact. The theory predicts that only by integrating these dimensions—using both automated and human evaluators—can the true scientific value of LLM-generated theories be determined.</p>
