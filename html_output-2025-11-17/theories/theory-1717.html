                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid and Retrieval-Augmented LLM Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when combined with retrieval-augmented mechanisms and hybridized with statistical or symbolic anomaly detection modules, can detect anomalies in lists of data by leveraging both learned world knowledge and contextually retrieved information. The LLM acts as a semantic and relational pattern recognizer, while retrieval modules provide grounding in external or historical data, and hybrid modules inject explicit algorithmic or rule-based anomaly criteria. The interplay between these components enables detection of both subtle, context-dependent anomalies and explicit statistical outliers.</p>
