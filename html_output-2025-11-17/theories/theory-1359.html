                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1359</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Process Supervision and Adaptive Task Decomposition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs engage in a dynamic, context-sensitive process of task decomposition and process supervision during self-reflection. Rather than following a fixed hierarchy, the model adaptively determines which parts of its output or reasoning require further decomposition or scrutiny, based on uncertainty, error signals, or feedback from previous iterations. The process supervision is not static but evolves as the model iterates, allowing for flexible, targeted improvements and efficient allocation of reflection resources.</p>
