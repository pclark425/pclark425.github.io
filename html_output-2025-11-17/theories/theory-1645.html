                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Simulation Fidelity Phase Transitions</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the fidelity of LLM-based scientific simulation exhibits phase transitions as a function of model scale, alignment, and prompt/context design. That is, there exist critical thresholds in these factors where simulation fidelity abruptly shifts from low to high (or vice versa), and these thresholds are modulated by the structure and complexity of the scientific subdomain.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For a given scientific subdomain, there will be a sharp increase in simulation fidelity once model scale, alignment, and prompt/context design cross specific thresholds.</li>
                <li>Subdomains with higher compositional complexity will require higher thresholds for phase transitions in simulation fidelity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist subdomains with multiple, nested phase transitions corresponding to different levels of simulation fidelity (e.g., basic recall vs. deep reasoning).</li>
                <li>Novel alignment or prompt techniques could lower the critical thresholds for phase transitions in complex subdomains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If simulation fidelity increases smoothly and continuously with model factors in all subdomains, the phase transition law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If subdomain complexity does not affect the location of phase transitions, the subdomain modulation law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of continual learning or online adaptation on phase transition thresholds is not addressed. </li>
