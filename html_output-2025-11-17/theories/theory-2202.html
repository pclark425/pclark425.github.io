                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when conducted through iterative cycles of human and AI assessment. Each cycle refines the theory by leveraging complementary strengths: AI for breadth and pattern recognition, humans for deep domain expertise and contextual judgment. The process converges toward higher-quality, more reliable scientific theories.</p>
