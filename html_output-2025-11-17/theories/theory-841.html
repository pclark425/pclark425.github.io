                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by tightly coupling memory retrieval and storage to explicit representations of task state, such that memory operations are contextually grounded and dynamically modulated by the agent's evolving understanding of the task.</p>
