                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Network Stress and Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the hierarchical organization of the visual cortex, with its ascending and descending projections, creates gradients of network stress that determine selective vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology. Neurons at key hierarchical nodes (e.g., those integrating feedforward and feedback information) experience greater synaptic and metabolic stress, predisposing them to pathology, while neurons at the periphery or with unidirectional, less integrated roles are more resistant.</p>
