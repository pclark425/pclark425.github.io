                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective and Abstractive Memory Consolidation Theory for Long-Term Coherence in LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve robust long-term coherence and task performance by integrating two core memory processes: (1) reflective memory, which enables the agent to monitor, evaluate, and selectively reinforce or suppress memories based on task relevance and performance feedback; and (2) abstractive memory, which allows the agent to generalize from episodic experiences by forming higher-level schemas and concepts. The interplay between these processes supports both detailed recall and flexible adaptation, enabling LLM agents to maintain context, avoid repetition, and transfer knowledge across tasks and domains.</p>
