                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1240</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that optimally balances information preservation and representational efficiency, minimizing redundancy while retaining all information necessary for downstream tasks. The theory draws on the information bottleneck principle, suggesting that representations should compress the graph as much as possible without losing task-relevant information, thus improving model learning and generalization.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>For tasks requiring implicit or global graph properties, it is unknown whether compressed representations can retain sufficient information.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly compressed representations that retain task-relevant information do not improve model efficiency or generalization, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If verbose representations consistently outperform compact ones, the theory's assumptions would be called into question.</li>

    <li>The theory does not address how to identify task-relevant information in highly multi-task or open-ended settings. </li>
