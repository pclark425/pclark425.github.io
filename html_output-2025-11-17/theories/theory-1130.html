                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1130</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Thresholds and Modularization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models acquire strict logical reasoning abilities through the emergence of modular substructures at critical thresholds of scale, data, or training. These thresholds represent phase transitions, after which the model's internal representations reorganize into specialized modules capable of compositional and multi-step logical inference. The theory further asserts that such modularization is both necessary and sufficient for robust, generalizable logical reasoning, and that the emergence of these modules is abrupt rather than gradual.</p>

                <li>Interventions that enforce modularity (e.g., architectural constraints) will lower the threshold for emergent logical reasoning.</li>
                <li>Ablating or disabling reasoning modules in a post-threshold model will sharply reduce logical reasoning performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist multiple, nested reasoning thresholds corresponding to increasingly complex forms of logic (e.g., propositional, first-order, higher-order).</li>
                <li>Altering the connectivity or depth of emergent modules may enable novel, non-human forms of logical inference.</li>
                <li>Thresholds may depend on data diversity or curriculum, not just model size.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Failure to observe new modules or abrupt changes in internal structure at reasoning thresholds would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that a non-modular, monolithic model can perform strict logical reasoning as robustly as a modular one would falsify the necessity claim.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models show gradual, not abrupt, improvements in reasoning, suggesting a more continuous process. </li>
    <li>Certain LMs with no explicit modularization can perform some logical reasoning, possibly via implicit mechanisms. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
