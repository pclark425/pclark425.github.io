                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Contextual Expectation Theory for LLM-Based List Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs detect anomalies in lists by forming probabilistic expectations for each item based on the contextual co-occurrence statistics and world knowledge encoded in their parameters. Anomalies are detected when the observed item has a low conditional probability given the context of the other items, as estimated by the LLM's internal language model.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an item in a list has a much lower conditional probability than the others, the LLM will flag it as an anomaly.</li>
                <li>If all items in a list have similar high conditional probabilities, the LLM will not flag any as anomalous.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the LLM is presented with a list where all items are rare but equally probable, it may fail to flag any as anomalous, revealing a limitation of probability-based detection.</li>
                <li>If the LLM is exposed to lists with adversarially manipulated context, its probability-based anomaly detection may be subverted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to flag low-probability items as anomalies, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs flag high-probability items as anomalies, this would contradict the theory's assumptions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Anomalies based on non-probabilistic features (e.g., visual formatting, pragmatic context) are not explained by this theory. </li>
