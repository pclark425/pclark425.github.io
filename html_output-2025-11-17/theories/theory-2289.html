                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the presence of actionable feedback is a necessary precondition for the iterative improvement of evaluation protocols for LLM-generated scientific theories. Without actionable feedback, evaluators lack the information required to refine their criteria, processes, or judgments, resulting in stagnation or random drift rather than systematic improvement.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Iterative improvement in educational, organizational, and machine learning contexts consistently requires feedback that can be acted upon; absence of such feedback leads to stagnation. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be a threshold of feedback actionability below which improvement is negligible, and above which improvement accelerates.</li>
                <li>The necessity of actionable feedback may be bypassed in rare cases by highly expert evaluators or extremely simple evaluation tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation protocols improve systematically in the absence of actionable feedback, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If actionable feedback is present but no improvement occurs, the sufficiency of feedback for improvement is questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Improvement due to external factors such as evaluator expertise, motivation, or unrelated training, independent of feedback. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
