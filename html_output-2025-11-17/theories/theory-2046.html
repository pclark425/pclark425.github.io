                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Consensus Law Refinement in LLMs via Cross-Document Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine candidate quantitative laws by cross-referencing, comparing, and reconciling conflicting or complementary evidence from multiple scholarly sources, leading to the emergence of consensus laws that are robust to outliers and inconsistencies in the literature.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to identify systematic biases or errors in the literature and correct for them in the distilled laws.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially discover new, more robust forms of existing laws by reconciling conflicting evidence from different domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to discount outlier or erroneous evidence and produce spurious laws, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve law accuracy or robustness with increased corpus size or diversity, the theory's assumptions would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of adversarial or systematically biased literature on consensus law formation is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of explicit uncertainty quantification in the consensus process is not explained. </li>
