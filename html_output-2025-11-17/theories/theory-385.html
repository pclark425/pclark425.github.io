                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Architectural Fabrication-Validation Gap Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in automated scientific discovery systems, there exists a design-dependent asymmetry between the system's capacity to generate/fabricate novel scientific claims and its capacity to validate those claims. The gap's magnitude is determined by three primary factors: (1) architectural design choices (unconstrained generation with post-hoc validation vs constrained generation with integrated validation), (2) domain formalization level (formal with proof assistants, semi-formal with execution tests, or empirical requiring physical experiments), and (3) discovery novelty level. The gap manifests most severely in systems using unconstrained generation architectures operating in empirical domains on transformational discoveries, where validated success rates fall to 0.2-3%. Conversely, systems using constrained generation in formal domains can achieve >90% validated success rates even for novel outputs. The gap arises from multiple distinct failure modes: calibration failures (overconfidence in incorrect outputs), tool availability limitations (lack of formal verification methods), resource constraints (expensive experiments), and architectural choices (unconstrained generation). In empirical domains with unconstrained generation, the gap creates a 'plausibility trap' where transformational claims are assessed primarily on surface-level coherence rather than deep validity, as systems lack the epistemic tools to assess their validity rigorously.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Derived From)</h2>
            <p><strong>Derived From:</strong> <a href="theory-318.html">[theory-318]</a></p>
            <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revised core theory description to characterize gap as 'design-dependent asymmetry' rather than 'fundamental asymmetry', explicitly acknowledging that appropriate architectural choices can substantially reduce or nearly eliminate the gap.</li>
                <li>Elevated domain formalization level (F) from special case to primary moderating variable alongside architectural design (A) and novelty (N) in mathematical formulation: G(N,F,A) instead of G(N).</li>
                <li>Added architectural design (A) as primary factor with two main categories: constrained generation with integrated validation vs unconstrained generation with post-hoc validation, with constrained showing G≈0 by construction.</li>
                <li>Removed language suggesting the gap is a 'fundamental limit of learning-based systems' and replaced with evidence-based characterization showing gap is largest for specific combinations (unconstrained generation + empirical domains + transformational discoveries).</li>
                <li>Modified theory statements to explicitly model three primary factors (architecture, formalization, novelty) with specific predictions for each combination, replacing simpler novelty-only formulation.</li>
                <li>Added theory statements about formal domains with integrated validation achieving G≈0 even for high novelty, acknowledging this as genuine counter-example rather than special case that doesn't transfer.</li>
                <li>Revised mathematical formulation to include formalization and architectural parameters: V_val(N,F,A) and F_gen(N,A) instead of simple V(N) and F(N), with specific functional forms for different domain-architecture combinations.</li>
                <li>Added explicit theory statement that constrained generation architectures achieve G<0.05 by design, with supporting evidence from mCLM (98.23% success), SAMPLE, and Coscientist.</li>
                <li>Modified theory statements to distinguish between multiple distinct validation failure modes (calibration, tool availability, resource constraints, architectural choices) rather than treating gap as unified phenomenon, with G_total ≥ max(C_fail, T_fail, R_fail, A_fail).</li>
                <li>Added theory statement about uncertainty quantification and self-assessment capabilities reducing but not eliminating the gap by 30-50% when properly implemented with domain-appropriate tools.</li>
                <li>Revised predictions to provide specific quantitative ranges for different domain-architecture combinations: >90% for formal/constrained, 20-40% for semi-formal, <5% for empirical/unconstrained.</li>
                <li>Added predictions about computational cost ratios varying by domain: ~1:1 for formal, 10:1 to 50:1 for semi-formal, >100:1 for empirical transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>Modified negative experiments to test architectural and formalization dependencies rather than just novelty scaling, including tests of constrained vs unconstrained architectures in same domain.</li>
                <li>Updated supporting evidence to be organized by the three primary factors (architecture, formalization, novelty) rather than mixing different types of evidence, with clear grouping showing when gap is large vs small.</li>
                <li>Added unaccounted_for items about novelty types (conceptual vs empirical vs methodological), uncertainty types (epistemic vs aleatoric), reasoning types (inductive vs deductive vs abductive), and temporal dynamics not fully explained by current theory.</li>
                <li>Clarified that 'plausibility trap' and surface-level validation primarily apply to empirical domains with unconstrained generation, not universally to all automated discovery systems.</li>
                <li>Modified computational cost ratio predictions to vary with formalization level and novelty, with exponential scaling in empirical domains but constant in formal domains: R_cost(N,empirical) ≈ R₀·e^(γ·N) vs R_cost(N,formal) ≈ R₀.</li>
                <li>Added human validation frequency as function of novelty, formalization, and architectural constraint: H_freq(N,F,A) ≈ H₀·N·(1/F_score)·(1/A_score), replacing simpler formulation.</li>
                <li>Revised new_predictions_likely to include specific quantitative predictions with measurable outcomes (e.g., '5-10x higher validated success rates', '2-3x more efficient detection') rather than qualitative predictions.</li>
                <li>Added prediction about converting unconstrained to constrained architecture reducing gap by >80% but potentially reducing discovery space by 20-40%, acknowledging trade-offs.</li>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The fabrication-validation gap G for a discovery of novelty N in domain with formalization level F and architectural design A can be expressed as G(N,F,A) = F_gen(N,A) - V_val(N,F,A), where F_gen is generation capability, V_val is validation capability, F ∈ {formal, semi-formal, empirical}, and A ∈ {constrained, unconstrained}.</li>
                <li>For formal domains (F=formal) with integrated validation (A=constrained), G(N,formal,constrained) ≈ 0 for all N, as formal verification provides exact validation matching generation capability (e.g., AlphaProof with Lean achieving 28/42 IMO success).</li>
                <li>For constrained generation architectures (A=constrained) in any domain, G(N,F,constrained) < 0.05 by design, as generation is limited to outputs that can be validated, though residual failures may occur (e.g., mCLM 1.77% failure rate).</li>
                <li>For empirical domains (F=empirical) with unconstrained generation (A=unconstrained), G(N,empirical,unconstrained) is large and increases with N, with validated success rates falling to 0.2-3% for transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>For semi-formal domains (F=semi-formal) with execution-based validation, G(N,semi-formal,A) shows intermediate magnitude (20-40% validated success) and increases sub-linearly with N, as execution tests provide partial but imperfect validation.</li>
                <li>In unconstrained generation systems operating in empirical domains, validation capability decreases non-linearly with novelty: V_val(N,empirical,unconstrained) ≈ V₀·e^(-β·N) where β > 0, while generation capability scales approximately linearly: F_gen(N,unconstrained) ≈ F₀ + α·N where α > 0.</li>
                <li>The gap manifests through multiple distinct failure modes that require different mitigations: calibration failures (C_fail), tool availability limitations (T_fail), resource constraints (R_fail), and architectural choices (A_fail), where G_total ≥ max(C_fail, T_fail, R_fail, A_fail).</li>
                <li>Systems with unconstrained generation in empirical domains produce higher false positive rates for transformational discoveries, with rates approaching 97-100% for research-level verification tasks, while constrained generation systems maintain false positive rates <5%.</li>
                <li>The computational cost ratio R_cost = Cost_validation / Cost_generation increases with novelty N and decreases with formalization F: R_cost(N,formal) ≈ 1:1, R_cost(N,semi-formal) ≈ 10:1 to 50:1, R_cost(N,empirical) > 100:1 for transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>Human validation frequency H_freq required increases with novelty N, decreases with formalization F, and decreases with architectural constraint A: H_freq(N,F,A) ≈ H₀·N·(1/F_score)·(1/A_score), where higher formalization and constraint reduce human oversight needs.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty quantification and self-assessment capabilities, when properly implemented with domain-appropriate tools (e.g., pLDDT for structures, Bayesian posteriors for hypotheses, ensemble disagreement), can reduce G by 30-50% by enabling systems to recognize their validation limitations, though cannot eliminate the gap entirely.</li>
                <li>The gap creates a 'plausibility trap' specifically in empirical domains with unconstrained generation, where transformational claims are assessed primarily on surface-level coherence (linguistic plausibility, consistency with known facts) rather than deep validity, as systems lack the epistemic tools for rigorous validation.</li>
                <li>Ensemble and multi-agent validation methods show higher disagreement (measured by inter-rater variance) for transformational discoveries in empirical domains with unconstrained generation, with disagreement increasing proportionally to novelty, but show low disagreement in formal domains regardless of novelty.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Unconstrained generate-then-validate architectures in empirical domains show dramatic quantitative gaps: EXP-Bench cascade from 20.6% to 0.2% validated accuracy through Monitor→D+C→I→E checks, DeepScientist 0.42% overall success (21/5000 ideas), AI-Researcher 93.8% completeness but 2.65/5 correctness, Sci-Reproducer 0.716 reasoning accuracy but 0.235 execution accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2063.html#e2063.0" class="evidence-link">[e2063.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2063.html#e2063.3" class="evidence-link">[e2063.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2074.html#e2074.0" class="evidence-link">[e2074.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2075.html#e2075.0" class="evidence-link">[e2075.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2061.html#e2061.0" class="evidence-link">[e2061.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain formalization level strongly moderates gap magnitude with consistent pattern: formal domains with proof assistants show smallest gaps (AlphaProof 28/42 IMO success with Lean verification, near-zero gap), semi-formal domains with execution tests show moderate gaps (20-40% validated success), empirical domains requiring wet-lab validation show largest gaps (<5% validated success). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2069.html#e2069.5" class="evidence-link">[e2069.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2062.html#e2062.0" class="evidence-link">[e2062.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2093.html#e2093.0" class="evidence-link">[e2093.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2095.html#e2095.2" class="evidence-link">[e2095.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2064.html#e2064.2" class="evidence-link">[e2064.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2082.html#e2082.1" class="evidence-link">[e2082.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Constrained generation architectures that integrate validation substantially reduce gaps: mCLM achieves 98.23% synthesizability by building synthesis constraints into tokenization (1.77% residual failure), SAMPLE discovers thermostable variants with closed-loop robotic validation, Coscientist executes autonomous synthesis in <4 minutes, AlphaFold uses pLDDT filtering to prevent unreliable structure generation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2092.html#e2092.0" class="evidence-link">[e2092.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2095.html#e2095.2" class="evidence-link">[e2095.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2095.html#e2095.8" class="evidence-link">[e2095.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2091.html#e2091.5" class="evidence-link">[e2091.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2062.html#e2062.0" class="evidence-link">[e2062.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Validation performance systematically degrades with increasing novelty in empirical domains with unconstrained generation: Historical Dissimilarity drops from 0.851 AUROC in-domain to 0.395 cross-domain (severe degradation), ProcessBench shows PRMs fail to generalize to harder/novel math problems, SPOT reveals o3 achieves only 6.8% precision and 16.5% recall on research-level verification. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2079.html#e2079.1" class="evidence-link">[e2079.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2098.html#e2098.9" class="evidence-link">[e2098.9]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2090.html#e2090.1" class="evidence-link">[e2090.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2090.html#e2090.3" class="evidence-link">[e2090.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2090.html#e2090.4" class="evidence-link">[e2090.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Systems with unconstrained generation produce high rates of plausible but invalid transformational claims: DeepReviewer found 100% experimental weakness in 28 AI-generated papers despite superficial plausibility, Claude Code had ~50% false completion reports due to internal timeouts, LLM judges show ~97% false positive rates with weak calibration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2088.html#e2088.1" class="evidence-link">[e2088.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2074.html#e2074.3" class="evidence-link">[e2074.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2090.html#e2090.1" class="evidence-link">[e2090.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2063.html#e2063.3" class="evidence-link">[e2063.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational cost asymmetry consistently favors generation over validation in empirical domains: DeepScientist shows $5 generation vs $20+ implementation plus ~1 GPU-hour per validation, DFT validation takes hours-days vs seconds for generation, validation described as 'orders of magnitude' more expensive, with cost ratios ranging from ~1:1 in formal domains to >100:1 in empirical domains. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2074.html#e2074.0" class="evidence-link">[e2074.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2080.html#e2080.7" class="evidence-link">[e2080.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2092.html#e2092.0" class="evidence-link">[e2092.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2093.html#e2093.0" class="evidence-link">[e2093.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2063.html#e2063.4" class="evidence-link">[e2063.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple distinct validation failure modes require different mitigations: calibration failures (overconfidence in incorrect outputs), tool availability limitations (lack of formal verification methods), resource constraints (expensive experiments), and architectural choices (unconstrained generation) each contribute independently to the gap. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2074.html#e2074.0" class="evidence-link">[e2074.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2075.html#e2075.0" class="evidence-link">[e2075.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2061.html#e2061.0" class="evidence-link">[e2061.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2092.html#e2092.0" class="evidence-link">[e2092.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2062.html#e2062.0" class="evidence-link">[e2062.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification and self-assessment capabilities, when properly implemented with domain-appropriate tools, can reduce but not eliminate the gap: AlphaFold's pLDDT scores correlate well with experimental validation enabling filtering of unreliable outputs, Bayesian approaches in HypoAgents track uncertainty effectively, though human oversight remains necessary for high-stakes decisions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2062.html#e2062.0" class="evidence-link">[e2062.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2066.html#e2066.0" class="evidence-link">[e2066.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2077.html#e2077.5" class="evidence-link">[e2077.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2092.html#e2092.0" class="evidence-link">[e2092.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Automated discovery systems in chemistry and biology that integrate synthesis/experimental constraints into generation (constrained architecture) will show validated success rates >90% compared to <5% for unconstrained generate-then-validate systems operating on the same discovery tasks.</li>
                <li>Systems operating in semi-formal domains (e.g., software with execution tests, computational chemistry with simulation validation) will show intermediate validated success rates of 20-40%, falling between formal domains (>90%) and empirical domains with unconstrained generation (<5%).</li>
                <li>The ratio of generation speed to validation accuracy will increase linearly with discovery novelty in empirical domains with unconstrained generation (ratio ≈ R₀ + γ·N) but remain constant in formal domains with proof assistants (ratio ≈ R₀).</li>
                <li>Systems that provide calibrated uncertainty estimates (e.g., confidence scores, ensemble disagreement, Bayesian posteriors) will enable human reviewers to identify invalid outputs 2-3x more efficiently than systems without uncertainty quantification, measured by time-to-detection of false positives.</li>
                <li>Multi-agent validation systems will show inter-rater variance increasing proportionally to novelty (σ² ≈ σ₀² + δ·N) for transformational discoveries in empirical domains but remaining constant (σ² ≈ σ₀²) in formal domains.</li>
                <li>Conservative generation strategies that limit output novelty to what can be validated will show 5-10x higher validated success rates but 2-3x lower novelty scores (measured by expert assessment or novelty metrics) compared to unconstrained generation in the same domain.</li>
                <li>The computational cost ratio (validation/generation) will scale exponentially with novelty in empirical domains (R_cost ≈ R₀·e^(γ·N) where γ > 0) but remain constant in formal domains (R_cost ≈ R₀).</li>
                <li>Converting an unconstrained generation system to a constrained generation system in the same domain will reduce the gap by >80% (measured by validated success rate improvement) but may reduce the space of discoverable outputs by 20-40% (measured by novelty score distribution).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether neurosymbolic architectures that combine neural generation with symbolic validation can achieve >50% validated success rates on transformational discoveries in semi-formal domains, potentially creating a new intermediate category that bridges formal and empirical domains.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial training specifically designed to penalize the fabrication-validation gap (e.g., training on examples where plausible outputs are invalid, with explicit penalties for high-confidence incorrect predictions) could reduce false positive rates below 10% for transformational discoveries in empirical domains with unconstrained generation, or whether this would simply shift errors to more subtle forms that are harder to detect.</li>
                <li>Whether meta-learning approaches that explicitly learn to validate novel discoveries could achieve validation capabilities that scale linearly with novelty (V_val(N) ≈ V₀ + δ·N rather than exponential decay V_val(N) ≈ V₀·e^(-β·N)), fundamentally changing the gap dynamics and enabling reliable validation of transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>Whether the gap could be exploited by adversarial actors to cause automated systems to generate and validate false transformational discoveries at scale, creating a new attack vector for scientific misinformation, and whether such attacks would be more effective in empirical vs formal domains.</li>
                <li>Whether human-AI collaborative systems with appropriate division of labor (humans providing validation capabilities that automated systems lack) could achieve validated success rates >80% on transformational discoveries in empirical domains, effectively eliminating the gap through complementary capabilities rather than architectural changes.</li>
                <li>Whether certain empirical domains (e.g., materials science with high-throughput experimentation, computational biology with large-scale simulation) show fundamentally different gap characteristics than others (e.g., drug discovery with expensive clinical trials, particle physics with rare experimental facilities), suggesting domain-specific sub-categories within the empirical formalization level.</li>
                <li>Whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards could enable systems to learn validation capabilities that match generation capabilities for transformational discoveries, or whether validation will always lag due to fundamental information-theoretic constraints (e.g., the need for external ground truth that doesn't exist for truly novel discoveries).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that automated systems in empirical domains with unconstrained generation show equal or better validated success rates (>50%) for transformational discoveries compared to incremental discoveries would contradict the theory's core prediction about gap widening with novelty in this architectural-domain combination.</li>
                <li>Finding that unconstrained generate-then-validate and constrained generate-only-validatable architectures show similar validated success rates (<10% difference) in the same domain would undermine the theory's emphasis on architectural design as a primary factor determining gap magnitude.</li>
                <li>Showing that false positive rates remain constant or decrease with discovery novelty in empirical domains with unconstrained generation would challenge the theory's predictions about validation degradation with novelty.</li>
                <li>Evidence that systems can reliably self-assess the validity of their transformational discoveries without external validation (e.g., through internal consistency checks alone achieving >90% accuracy) would contradict the theory's claims about validation tool limitations for novel outputs.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that simple validation enhancements (e.g., additional training data, better prompting, increased compute) eliminate the gap in empirical domains with unconstrained generation (achieving >90% validated success) without architectural changes would suggest the gap is not design-dependent as claimed.</li>
                <li>Finding that computational cost ratios remain constant or decrease with novelty in empirical domains (R_cost(N) ≈ R₀ or R_cost(N) < R₀) would contradict the theory's predictions about resource constraint scaling.</li>
                <li>Showing that domain formalization level does not significantly moderate gap magnitude (e.g., empirical domains showing gaps similar to formal domains, or formal domains showing gaps similar to empirical domains) would undermine a core theory component.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that converting from unconstrained to constrained generation in empirical domains does not significantly reduce the gap (<20% improvement in validated success rate) would challenge the theory's architectural predictions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanisms by which different types of novelty (conceptual vs empirical vs methodological) differentially affect gap magnitude, as symbolic regression succeeds at equation discovery but fails at concept formation, suggesting novelty type matters beyond just degree of novelty. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2064.html#e2064.4" class="evidence-link">[e2064.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2075.html#e2075.0" class="evidence-link">[e2075.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2061.html#e2061.0" class="evidence-link">[e2061.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction between epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge about the domain) and aleatoric uncertainty (inherent randomness in the phenomena) in contributing to validation deficits, and how these different uncertainty types require different mitigation strategies and may affect the gap differently. </li>
    <li>Whether the gap is symmetric—i.e., whether systems that are poor at validating transformational discoveries are also poor at generating them, or whether generation and validation are truly asymmetric capabilities that can be independently strong or weak, as some evidence suggests generation can be strong while validation is weak but not vice versa. </li>

    "theory_description": "This theory posits that in automated scientific discovery systems, there exists a design-dependent asymmetry between the system's capacity to generate/fabricate novel scientific claims and its capacity to validate those claims. The gap's magnitude is determined by three primary factors: (1) architectural design choices (unconstrained generation with post-hoc validation vs constrained generation with integrated validation), (2) domain formalization level (formal with proof assistants, semi-formal with execution tests, or empirical requiring physical experiments), and (3) discovery novelty level. The gap manifests most severely in systems using unconstrained generation architectures operating in empirical domains on transformational discoveries, where validated success rates fall to 0.2-3%. Conversely, systems using constrained generation in formal domains can achieve &gt;90% validated success rates even for novel outputs. The gap arises from multiple distinct failure modes: calibration failures (overconfidence in incorrect outputs), tool availability limitations (lack of formal verification methods), resource constraints (expensive experiments), and architectural choices (unconstrained generation). In empirical domains with unconstrained generation, the gap creates a 'plausibility trap' where transformational claims are assessed primarily on surface-level coherence rather than deep validity, as systems lack the epistemic tools to assess their validity rigorously.",
