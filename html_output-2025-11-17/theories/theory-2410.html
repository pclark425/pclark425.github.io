                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Microenvironmental Susceptibility Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is determined by the interplay between local microenvironmental factors (such as vascularization, glial reactivity, and extracellular matrix composition) and intrinsic neuronal properties. Neurons in microenvironments with high metabolic support, efficient waste clearance, and anti-inflammatory glial phenotypes are more resistant, while those in hypoxic, pro-inflammatory, or poorly supported niches are more vulnerable.</p>
