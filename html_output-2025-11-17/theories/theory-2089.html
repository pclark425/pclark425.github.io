                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Quantitative Law Discovery via LLM-Driven Semantic Aggregation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can induce emergent quantitative laws by semantically aggregating, aligning, and abstracting patterns of quantitative relationships described in natural language, tables, and equations. The LLM's internal representations enable it to map disparate expressions of similar phenomena, resolve terminological and notational inconsistencies, and synthesize candidate laws that generalize across studies.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If an LLM is exposed to a large, diverse set of papers describing the same physical law in different forms (e.g., Ohm's law in text, tables, and equations), it will be able to synthesize a generalized, canonical form of the law.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize entirely novel quantitative laws that have not been explicitly stated in any single paper, by aggregating partial relationships across many sources.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially identify higher-order or non-linear relationships (e.g., power laws, sigmoidal relationships) that are only implicit in the literature, not explicitly described.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to propose corrections to existing quantitative laws by identifying systematic discrepancies across studies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to synthesize a correct quantitative law when given a corpus where the law is redundantly and consistently described, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot align semantically equivalent quantitative relationships across modalities (e.g., text and tables), the theory's cross-modal synthesis claim would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently hallucinate or misinterpret quantitative relationships, the theory's assumptions about semantic aggregation would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle conflicting or erroneous quantitative relationships in the literature. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for uncertainty quantification or confidence estimation in the synthesized laws. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends known LLM capabilities to the emergent synthesis of quantitative laws, which is not yet established in the literature.</p>
