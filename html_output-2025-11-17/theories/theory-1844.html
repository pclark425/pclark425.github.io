                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1844</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Contextual Alignment Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ability of LLMs to accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries depends on their alignment with the meta-context of scientific progress, including trends, funding, collaboration networks, and sociotechnical factors. LLMs that can retrieve and reason over meta-contextual data (e.g., citation networks, grant databases, preprint trends) can better anticipate the likelihood and timing of discoveries, as these factors often precede and predict scientific breakthroughs.</p>
