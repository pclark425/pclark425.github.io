                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Emergent Cross-Domain Law Synthesizers</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that large language models, when exposed to sufficiently broad and diverse scientific corpora and equipped with mechanisms for cross-domain retrieval and synthesis, can generate emergent qualitative laws that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. These emergent laws arise from the LLM's ability to recognize analogies, patterns, and causal relationships across disparate fields, especially when guided by entity-centric knowledge stores, citation graphs, and iterative multi-perspective evaluation. The theory predicts that such cross-domain law synthesis is most effective when LLMs are augmented with retrieval, entity linking, and iterative refinement, and that the resulting laws may be novel, non-obvious, and impactful.</p>
