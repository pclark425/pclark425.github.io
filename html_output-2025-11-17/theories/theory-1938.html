                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Format Validity Collapse Threshold Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that there exists a threshold in prompt formatting complexity and ambiguity, beyond which LLMs experience a sharp, nonlinear collapse in output validity. The theory posits that LLMs can tolerate a certain degree of prompt complexity or ambiguity, but once a critical threshold is crossed—determined by the model's training distribution, architecture, and context window—output validity rapidly degrades, often irreversibly within a single generation.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Once LLMs begin to degenerate after prompt overload, they rarely recover within the same output. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs, once derailed by ambiguous or overloaded prompts, tend to persist in invalid or off-topic output until the end of the response. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The irreversibility aspect is a new theoretical abstraction.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to struggle to recover from early errors.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the irreversibility of collapse as a function of prompt format threshold crossing.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompt complexity is gradually increased, LLM output validity will remain stable until a critical point, after which it will drop sharply.</li>
                <li>Reducing prompt complexity below the threshold will restore output validity, but only for new generations, not within a degenerated output.</li>
                <li>Different LLMs will have different threshold values T, depending on their architecture and training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist prompt formats that allow LLMs to recover from collapse mid-generation if the format shifts back below the threshold.</li>
                <li>Different LLM architectures may have different threshold behaviors, with some exhibiting multiple collapse points.</li>
                <li>Prompt engineering techniques that dynamically adjust complexity may allow for partial or full recovery within a single generation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If output validity degrades gradually rather than sharply as prompt complexity increases, the threshold law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can recover output validity within a single generation after collapse, the irreversibility law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If some LLMs do not exhibit any threshold behavior regardless of prompt complexity, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs show partial recovery from degeneration within a single output, possibly due to self-correction mechanisms. </li>
