                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1604</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cumulative Error Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is fundamentally limited by the accumulation of small errors at each inferential or generative step. As the number of steps required to simulate a process increases, the probability of compounding errors grows, leading to a nonlinear decrease in overall simulation accuracy, especially in subdomains requiring long, multi-step reasoning chains.</p>
