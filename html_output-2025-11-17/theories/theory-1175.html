                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Conditional Chemical Synthesis Theory (General: Iterative Prompt-Driven Optimization)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be used in an iterative, closed-loop process where user prompts, model outputs, and feedback (either human or automated) are used to optimize chemical structures and synthetic routes for specific applications. The LLM acts as an adaptive agent, refining its outputs based on feedback to converge on optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex, multi-objective chemical design problems.</p>
