                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by synthesizing patterns of evidence, trends, and expert consensus present in their training data. The LLM's internal representations encode latent variables that reflect the likelihood of future events, allowing them to generate probability estimates that are grounded in the distributional properties of the scientific literature and discourse.</p>
