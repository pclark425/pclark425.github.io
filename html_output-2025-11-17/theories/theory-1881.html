                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format in which a problem is presented to a large language model (LLM) modulates the alignment between the model's internal cognitive representations and the task requirements, thereby affecting performance. Specifically, formats that more closely match the LLM's pretraining distribution or that reduce ambiguity in task intent lead to higher performance, while formats that are misaligned or ambiguous reduce performance.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform better on tasks that are formatted similarly to their pretraining data, such as question-answer pairs or conversational prompts. </li>
    <li>Performance drops when tasks are presented in unfamiliar or nonstandard formats. </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering studies show that reformatting prompts to match pretraining data (e.g., using Q&A or dialogue) improves accuracy. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting, which mimics stepwise reasoning found in some pretraining data, increases LLM reasoning performance. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained on code perform better on code-related tasks when the prompt format matches code documentation or code comment styles. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prompt engineering is well-studied, the explicit framing of performance as a function of distributional alignment is a novel abstraction.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that LLMs are sensitive to prompt format and that prompt engineering can improve performance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the relationship as a conditional alignment between presentation format and pretraining distribution, and predicts maximal performance at high alignment.</p>

                <li>Can LLMs learn to ignore misleading format cues if trained with adversarially formatted data?</li>

                <li>If reducing ambiguity in the prompt does not lead to increased accuracy or consistency, the theory would be called into question.</li>
