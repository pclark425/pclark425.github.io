                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2275</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluation Integrity and Contamination Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the integrity of evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories is fundamentally shaped by the risk of contamination—defined as the leakage of prior knowledge, biases, or expectations from evaluators, training data, or the evaluation process itself—into both the generation and assessment of new scientific theories. The theory formalizes how contamination can undermine the objectivity, novelty, and reliability of scientific theory evaluation, and proposes laws governing the conditions under which evaluation integrity is preserved or compromised.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation integrity is not compromised despite known contamination, the contamination propagation law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If blind protocols do not improve evaluation reliability, the integrity preservation law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of adversarial evaluators or intentional contamination. </li>
    <li>The role of implicit, unconscious biases in evaluators is not fully captured. </li>
