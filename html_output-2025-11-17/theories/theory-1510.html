                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Grounded Conceptual Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is functionally represented in the brain as distributed, multimodal patterns that integrate perceptual, motor, affective, and linguistic information. Concepts are not amodal symbols, but are grounded in the systems that support perception and action, with flexible recruitment of relevant modalities depending on context and task demands. The representational format is thus inherently context-sensitive and dynamically constructed from modality-specific traces.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing grounded cognition theories, but emphasizes dynamic, context-driven integration.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Grounded and embodied cognition theories propose multimodal conceptual representations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the context-sensitive integration of modalities at the functional level.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Conceptual processing of action words will be impaired by disruption of motor cortex, but not for abstract words.</li>
                <li>Changing task context (e.g., visual vs. auditory focus) will shift the neural activation patterns for the same concept.</li>
                <li>Patients with selective sensory/motor deficits will show corresponding conceptual impairments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training in a new modality (e.g., learning sign language) will alter the multimodal representation of relevant concepts.</li>
                <li>Artificially enhancing activity in a modality-specific area will bias conceptual processing toward that modality.</li>
                <li>Cross-modal priming effects will emerge for abstract concepts after extensive multimodal training.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual processing is unaffected by disruption of modality-specific areas, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate which features of a concept are activated, the theory is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If amodal, context-invariant representations suffice for all conceptual tasks, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how multimodal traces are integrated into a unified concept. </li>
    <li>The representation of highly abstract concepts with minimal sensory/motor content is not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and formalizes grounded cognition principles at the functional representational level.</p>
