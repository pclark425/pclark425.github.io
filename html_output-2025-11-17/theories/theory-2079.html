                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2079</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM-Human Co-Discovery of Quantitative Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most robust quantitative law discovery from scholarly literature emerges from an iterative, interactive process between LLMs and human experts. LLMs generate candidate laws from large-scale data extraction and synthesis, while humans provide domain-specific validation, correction, and hypothesis refinement, resulting in a feedback loop that accelerates and improves scientific discovery.</p>
