                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Activity Patterns Drive Selective Vulnerability to Amyloid-β and Tau in Visual Cortex</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their network connectivity and activity patterns. Highly connected, metabolically active neurons are more susceptible to pathology due to increased synaptic activity, calcium influx, and metabolic demand, which promote amyloid-β production and tau hyperphosphorylation, while sparsely connected or less active neurons are more resistant.</p>
