                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Hypothesis Testing and Law Validation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can not only extract candidate quantitative laws from the literature, but also perform automated hypothesis testing and validation by cross-referencing extracted laws with empirical data and reported results, thus filtering out spurious or weakly supported laws and elevating robust, reproducible ones.</p>
