                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1570</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Spacetime Topology Manipulation (ESTM)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by inducing controlled, transient changes in spacetime topology—such as creating micro-wormholes or shortcuts—using high-intensity electromagnetic fields and quantum coherence effects, all within the reach of near-future technology and budgets. The approach leverages the emergent, collective behavior of quantum fields and spacetime at mesoscopic scales, rather than requiring Planck-scale energies or exotic matter.</p>

                <li>Quantum coherence may enable stabilization of topological features long enough for practical FTL transit.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Failure to observe any topological or metric changes under intense, coherent fields would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If quantum coherence does not enhance the stability of engineered spacetime features, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If all observed effects remain within the predictions of standard QED and general relativity, the theory would be unsupported.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>No direct evidence exists for controlled, macroscopic spacetime topology manipulation. </li>
    <li>The energy and coherence requirements for stabilizing topological features are not fully quantified. </li>
