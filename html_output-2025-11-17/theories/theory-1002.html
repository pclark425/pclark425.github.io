                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Architectures as the Foundation for Long-Horizon Reasoning in LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the integration of both episodic (short-term, contextually local) and semantic (long-term, abstracted) memory systems within LLM agents enables robust long-horizon reasoning and generalization in text-based game environments. The hybridization allows agents to flexibly retrieve, update, and abstract information, supporting both immediate action selection and the formation of generalized strategies across diverse tasks.</p>
