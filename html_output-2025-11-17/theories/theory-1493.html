                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Compositional Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented at a functional level as structured, compositional entities. Concepts are encoded as hierarchically organized structures, where complex concepts are built from simpler sub-concepts via explicit compositional rules. This enables flexible generalization, systematicity, and productivity in conceptual reasoning, allowing the brain to represent an open-ended set of concepts from a finite set of primitives and combinatorial operations.</p>

    <li>Neural evidence for hierarchical processing in prefrontal and temporal cortices during complex reasoning. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing work but generalizes hierarchical structure as a core property of all conceptual knowledge.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hierarchical structure is a key idea in linguistics, cognitive science, and neural models (e.g., Pinker, 1999; Badre, 2008).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that hierarchical structure is a universal property of conceptual representation at the functional level, not just in language or action planning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel combinations of familiar concepts will be rapidly understood and represented as structured compositions in behavioral and neural measures.</li>
                <li>Disruption of hierarchical processing regions (e.g., via TMS) will impair understanding of complex, but not simple, concepts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new, artificial compositional rule is introduced (e.g., in a constructed language), the brain will recruit similar hierarchical processing mechanisms as for natural concepts.</li>
                <li>In individuals with atypical conceptual development (e.g., autism), the degree of hierarchical structure in conceptual representation may be reduced or altered.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If humans cannot generalize to novel concept combinations, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If neural evidence fails to show hierarchical or compositional activation patterns for complex concepts, the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the nature of the primitive elements or the exact compositional rules used. </li>
    <li>It does not address how non-compositional or holistic concepts (e.g., 'gestalt' concepts) are represented. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and generalizes existing principles, making it closely-related-to-existing but with a novel scope.</p>
