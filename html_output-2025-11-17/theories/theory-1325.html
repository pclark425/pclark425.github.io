                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Control Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted for self-reflection, engage in a form of meta-cognitive control, selectively invoking internal mechanisms (such as attention, retrieval, or reasoning modules) to monitor, evaluate, and adapt their own outputs. This process mimics aspects of human meta-cognition, enabling the model to dynamically adjust its generative process for improved answer quality.</p>
