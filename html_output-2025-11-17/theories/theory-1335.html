                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Self-Alignment through Iterative Output Conditioning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models improve answer quality during generate-then-reflect cycles by progressively aligning their outputs to an internally constructed context, which incorporates both the original prompt and the model's own prior outputs and critiques. This process enables the model to condition its next response on a richer, self-augmented context, leading to more accurate and coherent answers.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be an optimal number of reflection cycles for maximal answer quality, beyond which performance plateaus or degrades.</li>
                <li>Contextual self-alignment may enable models to resolve ambiguities or contradictions in prompts that would otherwise be unsolvable in a single pass.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models do not improve or become more consistent when given their own prior outputs and reflections as context, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If context augmentation leads to increased hallucination or error propagation, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where context window limitations prevent effective context augmentation. </li>
    <li>Tasks where prior outputs introduce noise or bias, reducing answer quality. </li>
