                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Structured Inductive Biases in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities for spatial puzzle games, such as Sudoku, through structured inductive biases encoded in their architecture and training data. These biases enable the models to internalize and apply abstract rules and constraints, allowing them to generalize to novel puzzles and perform multi-step reasoning without explicit programming.</p>
