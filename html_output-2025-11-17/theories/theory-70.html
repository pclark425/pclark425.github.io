                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Knowledge Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how scientific procedural knowledge transfers across different experimental domains and contexts, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The success and efficiency of procedural knowledge transfer across domains is strongly influenced by the degree and manner of domain knowledge integration. Domain knowledge can be integrated at multiple levels: (1) hard constraints (physical laws, causal relationships, feasibility bounds), (2) soft priors (semantic relationships, typical patterns, domain ontologies), (3) evaluation criteria (domain-appropriate metrics and validation), and (4) interpretability mechanisms (domain-specific explanatory frameworks). The value of explicit domain knowledge integration varies systematically with: (a) the strength of domain constraints, (b) the availability of training data, (c) the consequences of errors, (d) the need for interpretability, and (e) the degree of domain shift. In highly constrained domains with limited data and high error costs, methods providing explicit mechanisms for domain knowledge integration substantially outperform purely data-driven approaches. However, as data quantity increases and constraints weaken, the relative advantage of explicit knowledge integration diminishes, and data-driven methods may achieve comparable or superior performance. The theory predicts a continuum of optimal integration strategies rather than a binary choice, with the optimal point depending on domain characteristics and resource availability.</p>

                <li>There exists a continuum of optimal integration strategies, from minimal (data-driven) to maximal (heavily constrained), with the optimal point depending on domain characteristics</li>
                <li>As data quantity increases, the relative advantage of explicit domain knowledge integration diminishes, but may remain important for interpretability and safety-critical applications</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether large language models trained on sufficient scientific text can learn to integrate domain knowledge implicitly without explicit encoding mechanisms, matching or exceeding explicitly-encoded approaches</li>
                <li>Whether automated knowledge extraction from scientific literature can replace manual domain knowledge integration while maintaining accuracy and reliability</li>
