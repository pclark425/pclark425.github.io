                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that prompting large language models (LLMs) with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps, combined with domain-specific knowledge, systematically improves both the interpretability of LLM outputs and their ability to classify and explain anomaly types in list-based data. The theory asserts that this dual prompting approach enables LLMs to decompose anomaly detection into transparent, modular steps, facilitating robust generalization to novel anomaly types and domains.</p>
