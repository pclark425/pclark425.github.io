                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Graph-Text Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective way to convert graphs into text for language model training is through hierarchical representations that encode both local (node/edge-level) and global (subgraph/whole-graph) structures. By organizing graph information into nested or multi-level textual segments, language models can learn to reason about both micro- and macro-level graph properties, leading to improved generalization and graph understanding.</p>
