                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Specialization and Fine-Tuning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs' ability to accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries is significantly enhanced by domain-specific fine-tuning on relevant scientific literature, which shifts the model's internal representation and output distributions toward the target domain. However, this specialization yields diminishing returns beyond a certain scale and is limited by the quality, recency, and diversity of the fine-tuning corpus. Calibration and generalizability to other domains may be reduced as specialization increases.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fine-tuning a general-purpose LLM on a large corpus of up-to-date literature in a new scientific field (e.g., quantum computing) will yield improved forecasting accuracy for future discoveries in that field compared to the base model.</li>
                <li>The marginal gain in forecasting accuracy from additional fine-tuning data will decrease as the corpus size increases, with a plateau beyond a certain point.</li>
                <li>A highly specialized LLM (e.g., BrainGPT) will underperform on forecasting tasks outside its fine-tuned domain compared to a generalist LLM.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An LLM fine-tuned on a highly interdisciplinary corpus (spanning multiple scientific domains) could achieve both high in-domain and cross-domain forecasting accuracy, potentially surpassing both specialist and generalist models.</li>
                <li>There exists an optimal level of domain specialization that maximizes forecasting accuracy and calibration across both in-domain and out-of-domain scientific discovery tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If domain-specific fine-tuning does not improve forecasting accuracy for future discoveries in the target domain, the domain specialization law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If increasing the size of the fine-tuning corpus continues to yield large improvements without diminishing returns, the diminishing returns law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If highly specialized LLMs generalize as well as or better than generalist models to other domains, the specialization-generalization tradeoff law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some prompt-based interventions (e.g., superforecasting strategies) can improve accuracy even without domain fine-tuning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5704.html#e5704.0" class="evidence-link">[e5704.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5790.html#e5790.1" class="evidence-link">[e5790.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5790.html#e5790.2" class="evidence-link">[e5790.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5706.html#e5706.2" class="evidence-link">[e5706.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Retrieval augmentation can sometimes compensate for lack of domain fine-tuning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5823.html#e5823.0" class="evidence-link">[e5823.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5792.html#e5792.2" class="evidence-link">[e5792.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5792.html#e5792.3" class="evidence-link">[e5792.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5706.html#e5706.4" class="evidence-link">[e5706.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Ensembling multiple diverse LLMs (even without domain fine-tuning) can achieve accuracy comparable to human crowds. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5790.html#e5790.0" class="evidence-link">[e5790.0]</a> </li>
