                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Network Integration Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective resistance or vulnerability of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by the intrinsic cohesiveness and integration of their molecular and signaling pathway networks. Neurons with highly interconnected, redundant, and robust proteostasis, stress response, and metabolic pathways are more resistant to proteopathic stress, while those with fragmented or weakly integrated networks are more vulnerable.</p>
