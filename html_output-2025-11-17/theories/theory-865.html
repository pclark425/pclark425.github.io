                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Coordination Theory for LLM Agents: Hierarchical Memory Orchestration Hypothesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents achieve superior task performance by orchestrating memory access and manipulation at multiple hierarchical levels—short-term (context window), mid-term (episodic/retrieved), and long-term (external/tool-based)—with explicit mechanisms for information promotion, demotion, and consolidation across these levels. The theory posits that hierarchical orchestration enables efficient information flow, reduces cognitive overload, and supports both rapid adaptation and long-term knowledge accumulation.</p>
