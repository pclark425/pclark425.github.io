                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relational Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models can detect anomalies in lists by leveraging their ability to model not only statistical regularities, but also the contextual and relational dependencies between list elements. Anomalies are detected when an item's relationship to its context (preceding and/or following items) is inconsistent with the learned relational patterns.</p>
