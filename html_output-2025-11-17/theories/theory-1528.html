                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1528</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Nonlocality-Driven Information Transfer for FTL Navigation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by exploiting quantum nonlocality and entanglement, it is possible to transfer navigational information and control signals instantaneously between distant points, enabling FTL coordination and remote piloting of spacecraft. While not moving matter FTL, this approach allows for effective FTL navigation, decision-making, and possibly the remote assembly or reconfiguration of modular spacecraft using quantum communication networks, all within realistic technological and budgetary constraints.</p>
