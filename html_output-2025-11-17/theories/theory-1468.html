                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuous spectrum from modal (sensory-motor grounded) to amodal (abstract, symbolic) formats, and that the brain can dynamically hybridize these formats depending on context, task demands, and learning history. Rather than being fixed, the representational format of a concept is fluid, allowing for real-time integration of perceptual and abstract information to optimize cognitive efficiency and flexibility.</p>

    <li>Neuroimaging and behavioral studies show that some concepts activate sensory-motor regions (modal), while others activate abstract, heteromodal regions (amodal), and many activate both to varying degrees. </li>

<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows co-activation of sensory-motor and prefrontal regions during tasks requiring both perceptual and abstract reasoning. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends prior dual-systems models by proposing real-time, context-sensitive hybridization rather than static or parallel processing.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Some models allow for both modal and amodal representations, but typically as separate systems.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law that the brain can dynamically hybridize these formats in real time, rather than switching or segregating them, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks that require both perceptual and abstract reasoning will show simultaneous activation of sensory-motor and heteromodal cortical regions.</li>
                <li>Training participants to flexibly switch between imagery and abstraction will increase the degree of hybridization in neural representations.</li>
                <li>Concepts with high context variability (e.g., 'game') will show more dynamic shifts along the continuum than concrete, context-invariant concepts (e.g., 'rock').</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pharmacological modulation of prefrontal or sensory-motor regions will selectively bias the hybridization process, potentially improving or impairing task performance depending on the task's demands.</li>
                <li>Developmental or clinical populations with impaired flexibility (e.g., autism, schizophrenia) will show reduced dynamic hybridization and less optimal task performance.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks trained with hybrid representational objectives will better mimic human conceptual flexibility than those trained with only modal or amodal objectives.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts are found to be represented exclusively in either modal or amodal formats, with no evidence of a continuum or hybridization, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If task demands do not modulate the degree of hybridization in neural or behavioral measures, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise neural mechanisms that enable real-time hybridization are not specified. </li>
    <li>Some highly automatic or reflexive concepts may not show evidence of hybridization or continuum placement. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory synthesizes and extends prior work by formalizing the continuum and proposing real-time hybridization as a core property.</p>
