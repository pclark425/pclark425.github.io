                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Empirical Rule Synthesis and Feature Abstraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly literature, can autonomously abstract salient features and synthesize empirical rules—including quantitative laws—by identifying, generalizing, and recombining patterns of relationships, variables, and outcomes described in the text. The process leverages the LLM's ability to perform analogical reasoning, cross-domain mapping, and latent variable inference, enabling the discovery of both explicit and implicit scientific laws.</p>
