                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Trajectory Inference Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can infer the probability of future scientific discoveries by modeling latent trajectories of scientific progress embedded in their training data. By recognizing patterns of hypothesis evolution, citation networks, and the temporal dynamics of research focus, LLMs can extrapolate the likely direction and timing of future breakthroughs, even in the absence of explicit consensus.</p>
