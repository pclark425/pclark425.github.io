                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Salience-Driven Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games achieve optimal performance by dynamically prioritizing and retrieving memories based on contextual relevance and salience, rather than static or exhaustive recall. The agent should employ mechanisms to assess the importance of past events, objects, and facts in light of the current goal and state, enabling efficient memory usage and reducing cognitive overload.</p>
