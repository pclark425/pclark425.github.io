                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering via Quantum Vacuum Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by engineering the quantum vacuum at macroscopic scales—using advanced metamaterials, Casimir-like effects, or novel field configurations—it is possible to locally alter the spacetime metric, enabling effective faster-than-light (FTL) travel without requiring unattainable negative energy densities. The approach leverages the demonstrated ability to manipulate vacuum energy at small scales and extrapolates to larger, engineered structures, potentially within the reach of current or near-future technology and budgets.</p>
