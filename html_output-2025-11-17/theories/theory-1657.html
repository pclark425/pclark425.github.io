                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Simulation Fidelity: Alignment of LLM Reasoning with Scientific Formalism</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the fidelity of LLM-based scientific simulation is determined by the alignment between the LLM's internal reasoning processes and the formal structures of the scientific subdomain. Tool augmentation acts as a bridge, but only if the LLM can correctly map between natural language, formal representations, and tool interfaces.</p>
