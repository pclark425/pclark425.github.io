                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Law of Feedback Loop and Syntax/Error Reporting in Code-Generating LLM Simulators</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific code simulators is fundamentally governed by the structure and quality of the feedback loop between the LLM and its environment, particularly the granularity, clarity, and informativeness of syntax and error reporting. The theory asserts that the more precise and actionable the feedback, the more efficiently the LLM can converge to correct, domain-appropriate code, regardless of the scientific subdomain.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In highly novel or poorly documented scientific subdomains, the saturation point may be much lower or higher than in well-established domains.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs continue to improve accuracy indefinitely with more feedback cycles, the saturation law would be falsified.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs hallucinate plausible but incorrect code despite detailed feedback are not fully explained. </li>
