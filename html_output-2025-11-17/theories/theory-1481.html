                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization (General Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuum from modal (sensory-motor grounded) to amodal (abstract, symbolic) formats, with dynamic hybridization mechanisms allowing flexible integration and transformation between these formats depending on context, task demands, and learning history. Rather than being strictly segregated, modal and amodal representations are functionally interconvertible, and the brain can dynamically recruit, blend, or transform these representations to optimize conceptual processing.</p>
