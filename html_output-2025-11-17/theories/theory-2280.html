                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Metrics Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional metric space, where each dimension captures a distinct aspect of scientific value (e.g., logical consistency, empirical adequacy, novelty, explanatory power, falsifiability, and ethical/societal impact). The overall evaluation is a function of these dimensions, and trade-offs between them are explicitly modeled. This approach enables more nuanced and transparent assessment of LLM-generated theories, and can be adapted to different scientific domains.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Novel, high-impact theories may emerge that score highly on some dimensions but poorly on others, challenging traditional evaluation norms.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If multi-dimensional evaluation does not improve the quality or impact of accepted theories, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If explicit trade-off modeling leads to less consensus or more confusion among evaluators, the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to resolve conflicts when a theory scores extremely high on one dimension but very low on another (e.g., highly novel but empirically weak). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
