                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Abstraction Theory for Graph-to-Text Conversion</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that abstracts graph structure into semantically meaningful textual units, mapping subgraphs or motifs to natural language phrases or templates. By leveraging semantic abstraction, language models can better align graph structure with linguistic patterns, improving both interpretability and downstream performance.</p>
