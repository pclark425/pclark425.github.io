                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by dynamically prioritizing, retrieving, and updating memory traces based on contextual relevance and salience. The agent should employ mechanisms to assess the importance of past events or knowledge for the current decision, allowing for efficient memory usage, reduced interference, and improved task performance.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If agents with random or exhaustive memory access outperform those with contextual relevance and salience-driven mechanisms, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If salience-based pruning leads to loss of essential information and degraded performance, the theory's assumptions are challenged.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some text games may have non-obvious dependencies, making salience estimation difficult. </li>
    <li>Games with highly dynamic or adversarial environments may require additional mechanisms beyond salience and relevance. </li>
