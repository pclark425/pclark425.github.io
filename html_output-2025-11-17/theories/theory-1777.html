                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Language Model Semantic Coherence Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models encode not only statistical but also semantic and syntactic regularities. This theory posits that LMs can detect anomalies in lists by identifying items that break semantic coherence, even when statistical likelihood is not dramatically reduced. Anomalies are thus detected through disruptions in the latent semantic space, as inferred by the LM's internal representations.</p>
