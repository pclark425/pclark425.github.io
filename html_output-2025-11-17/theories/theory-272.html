                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Symbolic-Probabilistic Bridging Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that effective world models for text-based environments require a bidirectional mapping between symbolic representations (discrete states, actions, and relations) and probabilistic distributions derived from LLM uncertainty. The bridge operates through three core mechanisms: (1) Probabilistic Symbol Grounding, where symbolic predicates are associated with confidence distributions from LLM outputs (including token probabilities, ensemble disagreement, and semantic consistency measures); (2) Uncertainty-Aware State Abstraction, where continuous uncertainty estimates guide the granularity of symbolic state representations through adaptive partitioning; and (3) Confidence-Weighted Planning, where symbolic planning operators are weighted by propagated uncertainty from the LLM, with explicit uncertainty accumulation through operator chains. The theory posits that this integration enables more robust planning by maintaining interpretability while accounting for epistemic uncertainty inherent in language-based world modeling. Critically, the bridge is bidirectional: symbolic structure provides constraints that reduce the hypothesis space for probabilistic inference, while uncertainty metrics guide when and how symbolic abstractions should be refined or coarsened.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Symbolic predicates in world models should be annotated with probability distributions derived from multiple uncertainty sources: LLM token probabilities, ensemble disagreement metrics, and semantic consistency scores across multiple LLM queries.</li>
                <li>The granularity of symbolic state abstraction should be dynamically adjusted based on LLM uncertainty through an adaptive partitioning mechanism: high-confidence regions (uncertainty below threshold τ_coarse) permit coarser abstractions while uncertain regions (uncertainty above threshold τ_fine) require finer-grained symbolic distinctions.</li>
                <li>Planning operators in symbolic domains should carry confidence weights computed through uncertainty propagation: if precondition predicates have uncertainties u_1, ..., u_n, the operator's confidence is computed as a function f(u_1, ..., u_n) that accounts for both conjunction and disjunction of preconditions.</li>
                <li>When multiple symbolic interpretations of a text state are plausible (with probabilities above threshold τ_multi), the world model should maintain a belief distribution over symbolic states rather than committing to a single maximum-likelihood interpretation.</li>
                <li>The bridge between symbolic and probabilistic representations is bidirectional: symbolic structure constrains probabilistic inference by limiting the hypothesis space and providing structural priors, while uncertainty guides symbolic abstraction by identifying where refinement or coarsening is needed.</li>
                <li>Plan quality in uncertain environments should be measured by expected utility under the belief distribution over symbolic states rather than optimality under a single symbolic state, with explicit risk-sensitive planning when uncertainty is high.</li>
                <li>Symbolic predicates that consistently exhibit high LLM uncertainty (above threshold τ_info) should trigger active information gathering actions (e.g., examining objects, asking clarifying questions) before planning proceeds.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of maintaining probabilistic annotations on symbolic structures is justified when it prevents catastrophic planning failures due to unmodeled uncertainty, particularly in safety-critical or irreversible action scenarios.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty should accumulate through operator chains according to propagation rules that account for both epistemic uncertainty (reducible through information gathering) and the structure of causal dependencies in the planning domain.</li>
                <li>Calibration of LLM uncertainty estimates should be monitored and adjusted based on observed prediction accuracy in the specific text environment domain, with recalibration triggered when calibration error exceeds acceptable bounds.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs exhibit calibrated uncertainty that correlates with prediction accuracy in various tasks, suggesting their uncertainty estimates contain meaningful information for decision-making. This calibration can be elicited through various prompting strategies. </li>
    <li>Symbolic planning methods provide interpretable and verifiable solutions but struggle with uncertainty and partial observability in real-world environments. </li>
    <li>Hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches have shown promise in combining learning with structured reasoning, though most do not explicitly model uncertainty propagation through symbolic structures. </li>
    <li>Text-based environments present unique challenges where world state must be inferred from natural language descriptions with inherent ambiguity, requiring agents to build and maintain world models from linguistic input. </li>
    <li>Probabilistic planning methods like POMDPs can handle uncertainty but suffer from computational intractability and lack interpretability in high-dimensional spaces, particularly when state spaces are large. </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification in neural models can be achieved through multiple complementary methods including ensemble disagreement, which provides diversity-based uncertainty estimates. </li>
    <li>Abstraction in planning reduces computational complexity by grouping similar states, but determining appropriate abstraction levels remains challenging. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In text-based navigation tasks with ambiguous room descriptions, plans generated with uncertainty-weighted symbolic operators will exhibit 15-30% higher success rates than purely symbolic plans that ignore uncertainty.</li>
                <li>World models that dynamically adjust symbolic granularity based on LLM confidence will require 20-40% fewer symbolic predicates while maintaining equivalent planning performance compared to fixed fine-grained models.</li>
                <li>When LLM uncertainty about a symbolic predicate exceeds threshold τ_info = 0.3 (on a 0-1 scale), incorporating information-gathering actions into plans will improve overall task success rates by 10-25%.</li>
                <li>Symbolic plans annotated with propagated uncertainty estimates will correctly identify high-risk action sequences (those with >50% failure probability) with precision >0.7 and recall >0.6 before execution.</li>
                <li>In multi-step planning scenarios (>5 steps), uncertainty accumulation through operator chains will correctly identify when replanning is necessary with accuracy >75% compared to executing plans without uncertainty monitoring.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the optimal balance between symbolic structure and probabilistic flexibility remains constant across different text environment domains (e.g., cooking vs. navigation vs. social interaction) or requires domain-specific calibration of thresholds τ_coarse, τ_fine, τ_multi, and τ_info.</li>
                <li>Whether uncertainty-aware symbolic planning can scale to environments with hundreds of objects and relations while maintaining real-time planning performance (<1 second per planning episode), or whether approximations are necessary.</li>
                <li>Whether the bridging mechanism can be extended to handle not just epistemic uncertainty (knowledge gaps reducible through information gathering) but also aleatoric uncertainty (inherent stochasticity in environment dynamics) in text environments with non-deterministic outcomes.</li>
                <li>Whether symbolic-probabilistic bridges trained on one LLM's uncertainty estimates (e.g., GPT-4) can transfer to different LLMs (e.g., Claude, Llama) with different calibration properties, or whether per-model recalibration is necessary.</li>
                <li>Whether the theory can be extended to multi-agent settings where different agents have different uncertainty estimates about shared symbolic predicates, and how to aggregate or negotiate these uncertainties.</li>
                <li>Whether continuous refinement of the symbolic-probabilistic bridge through interaction experience leads to emergent hierarchical abstractions that weren't explicitly programmed, potentially discovering novel state abstractions.</li>
                <li>Whether the computational overhead of maintaining belief distributions over multiple symbolic interpretations provides sufficient benefit to justify the cost in resource-constrained deployment scenarios (e.g., mobile devices, real-time systems).</li>
                <li>Whether the theory's mechanisms can be extended to handle temporal reasoning where symbolic predicates have time-varying uncertainty that must be predicted into the future for effective planning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If plans generated with uncertainty-weighted operators perform no better (or worse) than plans ignoring uncertainty in highly ambiguous text environments, this would challenge the utility of the confidence-weighted planning mechanism.</li>
                <li>If LLM uncertainty estimates show no correlation (Pearson r < 0.3) with actual symbolic predicate truth values when evaluated in ground-truth annotated text environments, the foundation of probabilistic symbol grounding would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If computational overhead of maintaining probabilistic annotations makes planning intractable (>10x slower) even for small domains (<20 objects, <10 predicates), the practical viability of the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If symbolic abstraction granularity adjusted by uncertainty performs worse than fixed fine-grained representations across multiple domains, the uncertainty-aware abstraction principle would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty propagation through planning operators systematically over-estimates (by >50%) or under-estimates (by >50%) actual plan failure rates, the confidence-weighted planning mechanism would need fundamental revision.</li>
                <li>If maintaining belief distributions over multiple symbolic interpretations provides no advantage (success rate difference <5%) over committing to the maximum likelihood interpretation, the multi-interpretation aspect would be unnecessary overhead.</li>
                <li>If the bidirectional bridge provides no benefit over unidirectional mappings (either symbolic-to-probabilistic or probabilistic-to-symbolic alone), the core theoretical claim would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If information-gathering actions triggered by high uncertainty do not improve plan success rates compared to proceeding with uncertain information, the active information gathering principle would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle temporal dynamics where symbolic predicates change over time with time-varying uncertainty, particularly in environments with complex temporal dependencies. </li>
    <li>The optimal functional form for combining multiple sources of uncertainty (token probabilities, ensemble disagreement, semantic consistency) into unified confidence estimates remains underspecified, and may require learning or domain-specific tuning. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle contradictory information from different parts of text descriptions that lead to inconsistent symbolic interpretations, requiring conflict resolution mechanisms. </li>
    <li>Mechanisms for learning or adapting the bridging functions themselves from experience are not fully elaborated, including how thresholds and propagation functions should be optimized. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle cases where the symbolic vocabulary itself is uncertain or must be discovered from text, rather than being predefined. </li>
    <li>The interaction between uncertainty-aware planning and exploration strategies in reinforcement learning settings is not fully addressed. </li>
