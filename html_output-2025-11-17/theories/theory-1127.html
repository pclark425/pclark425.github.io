                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Contextual Constraint and Decoupling for Logical Consistency in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that strict logical reasoning in language models is best achieved when the model's generative process is contextually constrained and decoupled from non-logical associations. By minimizing the influence of irrelevant context, world knowledge, or linguistic priors, and maximizing the salience of logical structure, LMs can maintain logical consistency and avoid common reasoning errors.</p>
