                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Feedback-Driven Optimization in LLM Chemical Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when coupled with iterative feedback mechanisms (such as property predictors or human-in-the-loop evaluation), can progressively refine generated molecules toward optimal fit for specific applications. The LLM acts as a generator, while the feedback loop acts as a selection and guidance mechanism, enabling the synthesis of novel chemicals that satisfy complex, multi-objective constraints.</p>
