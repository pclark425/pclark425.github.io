                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Literature-LLM Law Refinement Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine candidate quantitative laws by comparing, evaluating, and reconciling equations and models extracted from multiple scholarly sources. Through cycles of synthesis, critique, and revision, the LLM converges on robust, consensus quantitative laws that best explain the collective evidence.</p>
