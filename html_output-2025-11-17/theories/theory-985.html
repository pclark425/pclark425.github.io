                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance-Gated Memory Access for Efficient LLM Agent Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games achieve optimal task performance by employing a relevance-gated memory access mechanism, wherein only contextually relevant memory entries (facts, events, or schemas) are retrieved and used for reasoning and action selection. This selective retrieval is dynamically modulated by the agent's current goal, environment state, and uncertainty, enabling efficient use of memory resources and reducing distraction from irrelevant information.</p>
