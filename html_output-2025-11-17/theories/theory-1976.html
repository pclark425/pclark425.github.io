                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be guided to distill increasingly accurate and generalizable qualitative laws from scholarly papers through iterative, feedback-driven prompting. By systematically varying prompts, incorporating user or expert feedback, and leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, LLMs can refine candidate laws, resolve ambiguities, and converge on robust scientific statements that capture the underlying regularities in the literature.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prompt engineering has been shown to direct LLMs to perform specific extraction and synthesis tasks. </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate structured outputs (e.g., laws, rules) when prompted appropriately. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting enables LLMs to reason through complex tasks and produce more interpretable outputs. </li>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to extract and summarize key findings from scientific literature when given explicit instructions. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prompt engineering and extraction tasks are established, their systematic application to law distillation from scholarly corpora is a new theoretical extension.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt engineering is a well-established method for controlling LLM outputs, and LLMs have been used for information extraction and summarization.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of prompt-driven law extraction as a systematic, iterative process for distilling qualitative scientific laws is novel.</p>
