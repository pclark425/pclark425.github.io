                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy (Emergent Dynamics Generalization)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that self-reflection efficacy in language models is an emergent property that arises only when the model's internal representations and reasoning abilities cross a critical threshold, which is itself a function of both the model's scale and the diversity of its training data. Below this threshold, self-reflection is ineffective or even detrimental; above it, iterative self-reflection can yield rapid, nonlinear improvements in answer quality, especially for tasks requiring abstraction or error correction.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Below the threshold, additional rounds of self-reflection will not improve and may worsen answer quality.</li>
                <li>Increasing training data diversity can lower the required model size for emergent self-reflection efficacy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be multiple, task-specific thresholds for different types of self-reflection (e.g., error correction vs. abstraction).</li>
                <li>The critical threshold may shift with changes in model architecture or training objectives.</li>
                <li>Hybrid models (e.g., with retrieval or tool use) may exhibit emergent self-reflection at lower scales.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If small models with limited data diversity show nonlinear gains from self-reflection, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If large models with narrow training data fail to benefit from self-reflection, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection is always beneficial regardless of model scale, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of fine-tuning on specific tasks in shifting the threshold is not explicitly modeled. </li>
    <li>The role of external feedback (e.g., human-in-the-loop) in enabling sub-threshold models to benefit is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
