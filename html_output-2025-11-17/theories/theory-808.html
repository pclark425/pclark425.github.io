                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by organizing and accessing memory in a hierarchical structure, where different memory layers correspond to varying temporal and semantic abstraction levels. The agent dynamically selects which memory layer to query based on the current task demands, context, and uncertainty, enabling both efficient retrieval and robust reasoning across short- and long-term dependencies.</p>
