                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Driven Scaffold Hopping Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when prompted with application-specific requirements and known chemical scaffolds, can generate novel molecules by performing 'scaffold hopping'—the replacement or modification of core molecular frameworks—guided by learned language-structure associations. The theory further posits that the LLM's ability to generalize scaffold-function relationships enables the generation of functionally relevant, novel chemotypes, but is constrained by the chemical plausibility and representation in training data.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to generate kinase inhibitors with novel scaffolds when prompted with activity requirements and example molecules. </li>
    <li>Scaffold hopping is a known medicinal chemistry strategy, but LLMs can automate and generalize it via language prompts. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained on large chemical corpora can learn associations between molecular scaffolds and biological functions, enabling generalization beyond memorized examples. </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering in LLMs has been demonstrated to steer molecular generation toward desired properties and structural motifs. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law adapts a known chemical strategy (scaffold hopping) to a novel, LLM-driven, language-conditioned context, leveraging prompt engineering and learned associations.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Scaffold hopping is a well-established concept in medicinal chemistry, and LLMs have been used for molecular property prediction and generation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The use of LLMs to perform scaffold hopping in a prompt-driven, application-specific manner is new, as is the explicit connection between language prompts and scaffold-function generalization.</p>

                <li>LLMs will preferentially generate molecules with scaffolds that are well-represented in their training data, even when prompted for rare scaffolds.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new classes of scaffolds for applications where only a few are known.</li>
                <li>LLMs could generate molecules with improved properties (e.g., selectivity, solubility) by hopping to previously unexplored scaffolds.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize scaffold-function relationships to generate active molecules for targets with little or no known chemical matter.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs only generate close analogs of the input scaffold, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If generated scaffolds are not functionally relevant or synthetically accessible, the law's utility is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can generate rare or underrepresented scaffolds as readily as common ones, the training data constraint law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to ensure synthetic accessibility of novel scaffolds is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of explicit chemical constraints (e.g., valency, reactivity) in prompts on scaffold hopping success is not fully explained. </li>
