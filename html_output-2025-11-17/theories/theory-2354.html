                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2354</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bidirectional Feedback Loop Theory of Gut–Brain–Vascular Interactions in AD</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease arises from a self-reinforcing feedback loop between gut microbiota dysbiosis, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction. Gut dysbiosis initiates systemic inflammation and BBB disruption, which allows neuroinflammatory mediators and microbial products to enter the CNS. Neuroinflammation and AD pathology further alter gut function and microbiota composition via neural and humoral signaling, perpetuating the cycle. This loop amplifies disease progression and offers multiple points for early detection and intervention.</p>
