                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2327</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Homeostatic Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease (AD) results from a progressive failure of the brain's dynamic homeostatic mechanisms, including proteostasis, synaptic scaling, and glial regulation. The breakdown of these adaptive systems leads to runaway accumulation of pathological proteins, synaptic dysfunction, and ultimately neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying breakdowns in homeostatic feedback loops, measurable via dynamic biomarkers (e.g., stress response, synaptic plasticity assays).</p>

                <li>Some individuals may compensate for homeostatic failure via alternative adaptive mechanisms, delaying disease.</li>

                <li>Demonstrating that static biomarkers outperform dynamic ones in early detection would call the detection law into question.</li>
