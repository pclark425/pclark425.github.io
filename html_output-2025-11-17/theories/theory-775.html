                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Distributed Pattern Matching and Memorization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models perform arithmetic primarily through distributed pattern matching and memorization of frequently observed arithmetic expressions and their results. Rather than learning explicit algorithms, LMs leverage their vast training data to interpolate and extrapolate from memorized patterns, with generalization limited by the diversity and frequency of arithmetic examples in the data.</p>

                <li>If accuracy does not correlate with pattern frequency in the training data, the theory would be called into question.</li>
