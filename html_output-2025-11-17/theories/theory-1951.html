                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented LLM Distillation Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when augmented with iterative retrieval mechanisms over large corpora of scholarly papers, can autonomously distill qualitative scientific laws by repeatedly querying, synthesizing, and refining candidate laws based on retrieved evidence, feedback, and self-consistency checks. The process leverages the LLM's ability to generalize across diverse textual evidence and to iteratively improve the abstraction and accuracy of distilled laws.</p>

                <li>Iterative retrieval-augmented LLMs may identify cross-domain laws that are not apparent to human researchers.</li>
                <li>The abstraction level of distilled laws may surpass current human meta-analyses, leading to new scientific paradigms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize qualitative laws across domains despite access to diverse evidence, the emergent law abstraction law would be challenged.</li>
