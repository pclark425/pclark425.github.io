                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can map the semantic content of scientific text to underlying mathematical structures, enabling the automated extraction, normalization, and discovery of quantitative laws even when those laws are expressed in diverse linguistic or notational forms across the literature.</p>
