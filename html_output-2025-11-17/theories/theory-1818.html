                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1818</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Consensus Theory of LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by modeling the emergent consensus of the scientific community as reflected in their training data. The LLM's outputs reflect a weighted average of explicit and implicit community beliefs, with higher accuracy in fields where consensus is strong and well-documented.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>LLMs' probability estimates will shift as the documented consensus in the literature changes.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to identify areas of scientific consensus and controversy based on the variance in their probability estimates.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to detect emerging consensus before it is formally recognized by the expert community.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to forecast the resolution of scientific controversies by modeling shifts in consensus.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify hidden consensus in subfields that are not apparent to human experts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs provide high-accuracy probability estimates in fields with little or no consensus, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' estimates do not track changes in consensus over time, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' estimates are equally accurate in both high- and low-consensus fields, the consensus-accuracy link is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may not account for rapid shifts in consensus that occur after their training cutoff. </li>
    <li>LLMs may be influenced by publication bias or echo chambers in the literature. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work formalizes the consensus-accuracy relationship for LLM scientific forecasting.</p>
