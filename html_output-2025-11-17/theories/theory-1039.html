                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1039</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Representation and Reasoning in Language Models for Spatial Puzzles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs construct and manipulate hierarchical internal representations of spatial puzzles, enabling them to perform multi-level reasoning (from local constraints to global structure) and solve complex spatial tasks. These representations are dynamically constructed from input prompts and allow the model to coordinate local and global reasoning steps.</p>

            <ol>
