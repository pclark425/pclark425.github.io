                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Thresholds and Modularization Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) exhibit emergent logical reasoning capabilities only when their internal representations and computational resources surpass certain critical thresholds, and that these capabilities are best supported by the spontaneous or explicit modularization of reasoning subcomponents within the model. The theory further asserts that modularization—whether architectural, representational, or functional—enables the decomposition and recombination of logical operations, facilitating strict logical reasoning beyond the capabilities of monolithic or entangled representations.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroscientific and cognitive science evidence suggests modularity is key to human logical reasoning. </li>
    <li>Architectures with explicit modularization (e.g., neural module networks, Mixture-of-Experts) show improved compositional and logical reasoning. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While modularity is known to aid compositionality, the claim that it is necessary for strict logical reasoning in LMs is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Modular neural architectures and their benefits for compositionality are known.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The assertion that modularization is a necessary (not just beneficial) condition for strict logical reasoning in LMs is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is scaled just below the reasoning threshold, it will fail at strict logical reasoning tasks, but a small increase in capacity or data will yield a sudden jump in performance.</li>
                <li>Introducing explicit modularization (e.g., via architectural changes or training objectives) into a sub-threshold LM will enable compositional logical reasoning even if the model is not much larger.</li>
                <li>Prompt-based modularization (e.g., chain-of-thought) will improve logical reasoning in models near the threshold.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is forced to entangle all internal representations (e.g., via regularization), it will be unable to perform strict logical reasoning even above the usual threshold.</li>
                <li>There exists a universal reasoning threshold (in terms of parameter count or representational capacity) that applies across all LM architectures for strict logical reasoning.</li>
                <li>Hybrid models with both modular and monolithic components may show intermediate reasoning abilities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a monolithic (non-modular) LM that performs strict logical reasoning below the predicted threshold would falsify the threshold law.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that a modularized LM below the threshold cannot perform strict logical reasoning would challenge the necessity of modularization.</li>
                <li>Observing gradual, rather than abrupt, improvements in logical reasoning as model scale increases would challenge the threshold law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small-scale LMs with heavy prompt engineering or external tools can perform limited logical reasoning, which may not fit the threshold law. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and extends existing ideas, but the joint necessity and formalization for strict logical reasoning is new.</p>
