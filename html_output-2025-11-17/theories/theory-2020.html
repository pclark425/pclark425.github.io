                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Quantitative Law Synthesis via Multimodal Scholarly Integration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize new quantitative scientific laws by integrating and reasoning over multimodal content (text, tables, equations, figures) from large corpora of scholarly papers. The LLM's ability to semantically align and abstract across modalities and papers enables the discovery of both explicit and implicit quantitative relationships, even when these are distributed or only partially represented in individual sources.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to aggregate and synthesize information from multiple documents to answer complex queries. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will be able to reconstruct a known quantitative law (e.g., Michaelis-Menten kinetics) from a set of papers where the law is only implicit and distributed across text, tables, and equations.</li>
                <li>Given a corpus of papers with partial or fragmented quantitative relationships, LLMs will synthesize a complete, unified law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover previously unrecognized quantitative laws by integrating evidence from disparate subfields (e.g., linking biochemistry and pharmacology).</li>
                <li>LLMs may propose new, testable quantitative relationships that have not been explicitly described in any single paper.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to synthesize known laws from distributed evidence, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot integrate information across modalities to generate candidate laws, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to handle highly complex, noisy, or poorly formatted multimodal data is not fully established. </li>
    <li>LLMs may struggle with domain-specific notation or highly specialized figures. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
