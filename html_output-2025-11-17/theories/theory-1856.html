                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Emergent Bayesian Aggregators for Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs function as emergent Bayesian aggregators, implicitly combining prior knowledge and new evidence from their training data to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries. The LLM's outputs can be interpreted as posterior probabilities, where the model's prior is shaped by historical scientific trends and its likelihood function is determined by the recency, quality, and consensus of new evidence.</p>
