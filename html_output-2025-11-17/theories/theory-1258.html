                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information-Preserving Graph-to-Text Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximally preserves the structural, semantic, and relational information of the original graph, while mapping it into a linear sequence that is both unambiguous and efficiently learnable by language models. Such representations should enable reversible mapping (text-to-graph and graph-to-text) and support generalization to unseen graph structures.</p>
