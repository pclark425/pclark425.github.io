                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries is fundamentally constrained by the degree of epistemic alignment between the LLM's internal knowledge representation and the current state of human scientific knowledge. The closer the LLM's learned distribution is to the true distribution of scientific knowledge and discovery processes, the more accurate its probability estimates will be.</p>
