                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory (Interactional Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the emergence of strict logical reasoning in language models is not solely a function of model size, but results from a critical interaction between model scale, training data logical density, and architectural inductive biases. Only when all three factors surpass their respective thresholds does robust logical reasoning emerge.</p>
