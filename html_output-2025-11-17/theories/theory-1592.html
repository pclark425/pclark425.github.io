                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Hyper-Fast Soliton Transport via Engineered Plasma and Electromagnetic Fields</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by configuring a plasma medium with tailored electromagnetic fields, it is possible to create a moving region of altered spacetime—mediated by a positive-energy soliton—that can carry a payload at effective superluminal speeds. Unlike previous FTL proposals requiring negative energy, this approach leverages nonlinear plasma dynamics and soliton stability to achieve metric engineering with only positive energy densities, potentially enabling FTL travel within the constraints of known physics.</p>
