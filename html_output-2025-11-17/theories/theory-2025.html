                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bilevel LLM-Simulation Theory of Quantitative Law Distillation (Generalized Robustness Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the bilevel LLM-simulation framework by positing that the two-level structure not only enables emergent law discovery, but also confers robustness to noise, redundancy, and inconsistency in the input corpus. The first level acts as a denoising and normalization filter, extracting and harmonizing variables and relationships, while the second level performs robust scientific reasoning and law abstraction. This architecture is hypothesized to yield quantitative laws that are more resilient to input errors and more generalizable across domains.</p>

                <li>The architecture may enable the discovery of laws in domains previously considered too noisy or unstructured for automated law distillation.</li>

                <li>If normalization at the first level does not improve law abstraction accuracy, the theory's mechanism is called into question.</li>
