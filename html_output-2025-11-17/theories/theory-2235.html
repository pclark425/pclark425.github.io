                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should be grounded in a meta-evaluative framework that integrates three core dimensions: (1) epistemic soundness (logical consistency, empirical adequacy, and explanatory power), (2) generative novelty (theory's ability to generate new, testable predictions beyond its training data), and (3) communicative transparency (clarity, traceability, and interpretability of the theory's reasoning process). The theory asserts that only by jointly considering these dimensions can evaluators reliably distinguish between genuinely valuable, creative scientific contributions and plausible-sounding but shallow or spurious outputs from LLMs.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Epistemic soundness is a core criterion in philosophy of science (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos). </li>
    <li>Generative novelty is essential for scientific progress and is a key criterion for theory evaluation (Popper's falsifiability, Lakatos' research programs). </li>
    <li>Communicative transparency is critical for interpretability and trust in AI-generated outputs (Doshi-Velez & Kim, 2017). </li>
    <li>LLMs can produce plausible but ungrounded or untestable theories, necessitating multi-dimensional evaluation. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law synthesizes established evaluation criteria into a unified, meta-evaluative framework tailored for LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Each dimension (epistemic soundness, novelty, transparency) is individually recognized in scientific and AI evaluation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit requirement to jointly and systematically apply all three dimensions to LLM-generated scientific theories is novel.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law adapts established feedback mechanisms to the context of LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Feedback and peer review are standard in scientific practice; RLHF is used in LLM training.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Mandating explicit, dimension-specific feedback for LLM-generated scientific theories is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories evaluated with all three dimensions will be more reliable and useful than those evaluated with only one or two.</li>
                <li>Explicit, structured feedback will improve the quality of subsequent LLM-generated theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal weighting of the three dimensions may vary by scientific domain and could lead to new evaluation paradigms.</li>
                <li>Some highly novel theories may initially score poorly on epistemic soundness but later prove valuable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If theories evaluated with only one or two dimensions outperform those evaluated with all three, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If explicit feedback does not improve LLM theory generation, the feedback law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve trade-offs between dimensions (e.g., novelty vs. soundness). </li>
