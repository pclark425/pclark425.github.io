                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when augmented with retrieval mechanisms that access up-to-date and domain-specific scientific corpora, can synthesize distributed evidence and reason probabilistically to estimate the likelihood of future real-world scientific discoveries. The theory asserts that the combination of retrieval and probabilistic reasoning enables LLMs to overcome knowledge cutoffs, identify latent trends, and generate calibrated forecasts about scientific progress.</p>
