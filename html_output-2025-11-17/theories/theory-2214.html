                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should be a dynamic, iterative process involving adversarial stress-testing, continual benchmarking against evolving standards, and the use of synthetic counterfactuals to probe robustness, generalizability, and resistance to manipulation or overfitting to training data artifacts.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Adversarial testing is a standard method in AI safety and robustness research to uncover hidden failure modes. </li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adversarial stress-testing may reveal new, unanticipated classes of LLM-specific scientific errors.</li>
                <li>Dynamic benchmarking may lead to the discovery of emergent properties in LLM-generated theories not present in human-generated theories.</li>
                <li>Synthetic counterfactuals may sometimes produce false positives, incorrectly flagging robust theories as flawed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If adversarial stress-testing fails to reveal any new errors compared to standard evaluation, the necessity of this approach is called into question.</li>
                <li>If dynamic benchmarking does not improve error detection rates over static benchmarks, its value is questionable.</li>
                <li>If synthetic counterfactuals consistently misidentify robust theories as flawed, the approach may be unreliable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to generate meaningful adversarial or counterfactual examples in highly abstract or theoretical domains. </li>
    <li>The approach may not account for the cost or feasibility of continual benchmarking in resource-limited settings. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory adapts and extends existing AI evaluation practices to the new context of LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation.</p>
