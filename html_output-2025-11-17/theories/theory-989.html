                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Representations Enable Efficient Exploration and Task Decomposition in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hierarchical memory representations—organizing knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., rooms, objects, quests, subgoals)—can more efficiently explore text game environments and decompose complex tasks. Hierarchical memory allows agents to reason about high-level strategies and low-level actions, improving sample efficiency and adaptability.</p>
