                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Law of Syntax/Error Reporting Mismatch-Induced Hallucination in LLM Simulators</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when there is a mismatch between the syntax or error reporting conventions expected by the LLM (based on its training data) and those present in the target scientific subdomain, the LLM is more likely to hallucinate plausible but incorrect code or error messages. This effect is especially pronounced in domains with custom DSLs or non-standard error reporting.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical evidence shows LLMs hallucinate error messages or code in unfamiliar scientific DSLs or with non-standard error reporting. </li>
    <li>Benchmarks such as SWE-bench and BigCode show LLMs generate plausible but incorrect error messages when presented with code from domains with custom syntax or error reporting. </li>
    <li>Studies (e.g., Liu et al. 2023; Chen et al. 2021) report increased hallucination rates in LLMs when generating code for scientific subdomains with non-standard conventions. </li>
    <li>Ablation studies demonstrate that fine-tuning on domain-specific syntax and error reporting reduces hallucination rates. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained primarily on Python or JavaScript often hallucinate error messages when tasked with generating code for scientific DSLs such as Stan, Modelica, or custom simulation languages. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The explicit link between syntax/error reporting mismatch and hallucination in LLM simulators is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLM hallucination is a known phenomenon, especially in unfamiliar domains.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law ties hallucination rates specifically to syntax/error reporting mismatches and lack of domain adaptation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific syntax and error reporting will reduce hallucination rates.</li>
                <li>Introducing synthetic mismatches in error reporting will increase hallucination rates in LLM simulators.</li>
                <li>LLMs will hallucinate less when provided with explicit documentation or examples of the target domain's error reporting conventions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In domains with rapidly evolving syntax or error conventions, LLMs may develop new forms of hallucination not seen in training data.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to hybrid error reporting (mixing standard and non-standard), the net effect on hallucination rates is unpredictable.</li>
                <li>LLMs with meta-learning capabilities may self-correct hallucinations over time in the presence of feedback, but the rate and stability of this adaptation is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not increase hallucination rates when exposed to unfamiliar syntax or error reporting, the law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If domain adaptation does not reduce hallucination rates, the law's explanatory power is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs hallucinate at the same rate in both familiar and unfamiliar syntax/error reporting settings, the law is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs hallucinate despite domain adaptation are not explained. </li>
    <li>LLMs that perform robustly in unfamiliar domains due to memorization or overfitting are not fully accounted for. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While hallucination is well-studied, the specific mechanism involving syntax/error reporting mismatch and its mitigation via adaptation is not formalized in prior work.</p>
