                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Prompt and Demonstration Structure as a Limiting Factor in LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The structure, specificity, and relevance of prompts and in-context demonstrations provided to LLMs are primary determinants of simulation accuracy, especially in few-shot and chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. The effectiveness of LLMs in scientific simulation is not only a function of model scale or augmentation, but is fundamentally constrained by the alignment between the prompt/demonstration structure and the cognitive or procedural structure of the target scientific task. Poorly structured or misaligned prompts can negate the benefits of scale or augmentation, while well-structured, domain-specific prompts can enable even smaller or less-capable models to achieve high accuracy.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In COMMUNITYLM, using a short or ambiguous prompt ('X') yields poor/ambiguous outputs and low accuracy (~70%), while a longer, more structured prompt yields 97% accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5651.html#e5651.0" class="evidence-link">[e5651.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In MolecularGPT, using more than 2 low-similarity demonstrations or unordered examples degrades performance, showing that irrelevant or noisy demonstrations harm accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5680.html#e5680.0" class="evidence-link">[e5680.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In psycholinguistic simulation, smaller models or poorly validated prompts produce high rates of invalid or undifferentiated outputs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5682.html#e5682.1" class="evidence-link">[e5682.1]</a> </li>
    <li>In user simulation (USi), lack of semantic control or missing information-need in the prompt leads to hallucination and topic drift. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5615.html#e5615.0" class="evidence-link">[e5615.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In ChatGPT-based user satisfaction prediction, zero-shot prompts without examples yield much lower accuracy than few-shot prompts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5590.html#e5590.0" class="evidence-link">[e5590.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In LLM4Doc, prompt engineering is required to elicit detailed, correct technical answers from GPT-4+RAG; without it, answers are incomplete or incorrect. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5666.html#e5666.3" class="evidence-link">[e5666.3]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law extends prompt engineering from a performance booster to a necessary condition for high-accuracy simulation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt sensitivity is recognized, but the explicit limitation law and its generalization to simulation accuracy is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that prompt-task misalignment imposes a hard ceiling on simulation accuracy, regardless of model scale or augmentation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new scientific simulation task is attempted with a prompt structure that closely matches the task's cognitive steps (e.g., stepwise reasoning for multi-step math), even a smaller LLM will outperform a larger LLM with a generic prompt.</li>
                <li>If irrelevant or noisy demonstrations are included in few-shot prompts, simulation accuracy will decrease, even for large LLMs.</li>
                <li>If prompt engineering is used to explicitly match the procedural structure of a new domain (e.g., chain-of-thought for multi-step chemistry), accuracy will increase over generic prompting.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained to automatically infer and generate optimal prompt structures for unseen tasks, they may achieve high simulation accuracy without human prompt engineering.</li>
                <li>If prompt structure is dynamically adapted during multi-turn simulation (e.g., via feedback from tool outputs), accuracy may surpass static prompt approaches.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are given adversarially misaligned prompts, accuracy may drop below that of much smaller models with aligned prompts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a generic or misaligned prompt yields high simulation accuracy on a complex, multi-step scientific task, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If adding more demonstrations (regardless of relevance) always increases accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If prompt structure has no effect on simulation accuracy across a range of tasks and models, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some tasks (e.g., those with strong pretraining coverage or requiring only shallow pattern matching) may be less sensitive to prompt structure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5682.html#e5682.0" class="evidence-link">[e5682.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5651.html#e5651.2" class="evidence-link">[e5651.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5593.html#e5593.0" class="evidence-link">[e5593.0]</a> </li>
    <li>In some cases, tool augmentation or retrieval may compensate for poor prompt structure, especially if the tool provides strong intermediate supervision. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.0" class="evidence-link">[e5509.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5672.html#e5672.0" class="evidence-link">[e5672.0]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prompt engineering is widely recognized, this theory formalizes its role as a necessary condition for high-accuracy simulation and generalizes its impact across scientific subdomains.</p>
