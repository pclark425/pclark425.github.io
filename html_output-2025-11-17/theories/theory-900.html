                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by maintaining a hierarchical memory system that separates and dynamically integrates episodic (event-based, context-specific) and semantic (generalized, abstracted) memories. The agent should use episodic memory to track recent, contextually relevant events and semantic memory to store and retrieve generalized knowledge, with mechanisms for abstraction, consolidation, and context-sensitive retrieval.</p>
