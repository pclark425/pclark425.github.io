                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Multi-Stage Decorrelation and Error Correction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when language models engage in iterative self-reflection (i.e., generate-then-reflect cycles), each stage acts to decorrelate the current output from prior biases and errors, while simultaneously applying error correction mechanisms. The process is analogous to multi-stage signal denoising, where each reflection pass reduces the influence of initial generation artifacts and amplifies signals aligned with correctness, coherence, and task objectives. The theory frames self-reflection as a sequence of transformations that progressively reduce error and increase answer quality through both explicit and implicit error detection and correction.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is prompted to reflect and revise its answer multiple times, the final output will be less similar to the initial output and more accurate on average.</li>
                <li>Introducing explicit error-spotting steps between generations will further accelerate answer quality improvement.</li>
                <li>The magnitude of improvement per iteration will decrease as the number of iterations increases, approaching a plateau.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There exists an optimal number of reflection stages beyond which further iterations may introduce new errors or degrade performance.</li>
                <li>If reflection is performed with adversarial or misleading self-critique, the process may amplify errors rather than correct them.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of iterative self-reflection may depend on the diversity of reflection strategies used at each stage.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative self-reflection does not reduce correlation with initial errors or does not improve answer quality, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If models fail to identify or correct errors even when explicitly prompted to reflect, the error correction law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If repeated reflection leads to increased hallucination or error rates, the theory's assumptions about error reduction are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection leads to overcorrection or new types of errors (e.g., hallucinations introduced by reflection). </li>
    <li>Scenarios where the model's initial output is already optimal and further reflection degrades performance. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and extends existing ideas, but the formalization and explicit decorrelation/error correction framing is new.</p>
