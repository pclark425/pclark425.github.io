                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Terminological Drift and Simulation Error Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is systematically and negatively impacted when the subdomain's terminology has evolved or diverged from the LLM's training cutoff. The greater the terminological drift, the higher the likelihood and magnitude of simulation error, especially in rapidly evolving fields. The theory also considers the LLM's ability to adapt via context or retrieval augmentation, and identifies exceptions and boundary conditions.</p>

                <li>If updating terminology in the LLM's training data or via retrieval does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs infer new terminology from context or analogical reasoning, maintaining accuracy despite drift. </li>
