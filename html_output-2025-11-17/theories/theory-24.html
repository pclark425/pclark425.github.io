                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Instruction tuning and explicit prompting techniques (including chain-of-thought and step-by-step reasoning) enhance LLM performance on theory-of-mind (ToM) and multi-step reasoning tasks by providing explicit guides that help decompose complex inferences. The effectiveness of these scaffolds is influenced by prompt complexity and model architecture. Recent approaches such as dynamic reasoning action selection (e.g., DOTS) and internalized chain-of-thought mechanisms (e.g., OpenAI's o1-preview) indicate that adaptive, integrated reasoning can further improve performance while potentially reducing the need for external explicit prompts. However, explicit prompts may sometimes obscure error signals such as hallucination cues and may not fully overcome challenges in multi-agent interactions.</p>
