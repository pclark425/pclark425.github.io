                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-696</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Statistical Pattern Matching Theory of Arithmetic in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging statistical regularities in the training data, rather than by explicit algorithmic computation. The models learn to associate input patterns (e.g., '12 + 7 =') with output patterns (e.g., '19') through exposure to many similar examples, and generalize to new cases by interpolating or extrapolating from these learned associations. Arithmetic performance is thus a function of the density and diversity of arithmetic examples in the training data, as well as the model's capacity to memorize and generalize such patterns.</p>
