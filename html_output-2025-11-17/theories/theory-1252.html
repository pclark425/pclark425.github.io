                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Multimodal Alignment Principle for Graph-to-Text</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that ideal graph-to-text representations are achieved when alignment occurs at multiple hierarchical levels: from local (node/edge) to global (subgraph/discourse) structures, and across modalities (semantic, syntactic, pragmatic). The principle asserts that hierarchical alignment enables compositionality, robustness, and transferability in language model training.</p>
