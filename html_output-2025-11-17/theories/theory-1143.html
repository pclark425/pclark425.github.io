                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Symbolic-Subsymbolic Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve optimal strict logical reasoning when they integrate symbolic representations (explicit logic symbols, rules, and structures) with subsymbolic distributed representations (embeddings, neural activations). The LM must be able to translate between these two forms, using symbolic structures for manipulation and inference, and subsymbolic representations for generalization and language understanding.</p>
