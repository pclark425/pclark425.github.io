                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal-Conceptual Mapping Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the likelihood of future scientific discoveries by constructing internal causal-conceptual maps that represent dependencies between scientific concepts, methods, and open questions. By simulating the propagation of knowledge and the closure of conceptual gaps, LLMs can assign probabilities to the resolution of specific scientific unknowns.</p>
