                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2268</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Epistemic Traceability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should include a meta-epistemic traceability component, in which the provenance, reasoning steps, and data sources used by the LLM are explicitly documented and auditable. This traceability enables evaluators to assess not only the content of the theory but also the epistemic reliability of its generation process, supporting transparency, reproducibility, and trust.</p>
