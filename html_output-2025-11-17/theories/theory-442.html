                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured State Memory Superiority Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory when solving text games, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In partially observable text-based environments, agents that maintain explicit structured representations of world state (particularly knowledge graphs encoding entities, relations, and spatial structure) achieve superior performance compared to agents relying solely on implicit sequential memory (RNNs) or unstructured episodic buffers. This superiority manifests in faster convergence, better generalization, and more effective action selection, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and long-horizon planning. However, the benefits are contingent on extraction quality, graph construction methods, and task characteristics, with diminishing returns in short-horizon or fully-observable settings.</p>

                <li>An agent using a knowledge graph with learned entity extraction will outperform one using hand-crafted extraction rules on novel text game domains with unfamiliar vocabulary</li>
                <li>Combining knowledge graph memory with graph attention networks will enable better multi-hop reasoning than flat graph embeddings in games requiring complex spatial reasoning</li>
                <li>Knowledge graphs that explicitly encode temporal information (when facts were observed) will improve performance on tasks requiring reasoning about state changes over time</li>
                <li>Agents using hierarchically-structured knowledge graphs (with subgraph partitioning) will show better sample efficiency than flat graph representations in complex multi-room environments</li>
                <li>Knowledge graph memory combined with intrinsic motivation for graph expansion will accelerate exploration in sparse-reward environments</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether knowledge graph memory can be effectively transferred across fundamentally different game genres (e.g., from fantasy adventure to science fiction) without catastrophic forgetting</li>
                <li>Whether very large knowledge graphs (>10,000 nodes) will continue to show performance benefits or will suffer from retrieval noise and attention dilution</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid memory systems combining knowledge graphs with episodic trajectory memory will show multiplicative or merely additive benefits</li>
                <li>Whether learned graph construction methods (end-to-end differentiable) will outperform pipeline approaches (extract-then-encode) when sufficient training data is available</li>
                <li>Whether knowledge graphs can effectively handle highly dynamic environments where entity properties change frequently within episodes</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding text games where unstructured full-history memory consistently outperforms knowledge graph memory would challenge the theory</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that knowledge graph construction overhead negates performance benefits in short-horizon tasks would limit the theory's scope</li>
                <li>Showing that implicit RNN memory with sufficient capacity matches knowledge graph performance would question the necessity of explicit structure</li>
                <li>Finding cases where graph-based memory fails to generalize to unseen game instances while simpler memory succeeds would challenge the generalization claims</li>
