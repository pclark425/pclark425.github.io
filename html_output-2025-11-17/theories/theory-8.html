                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models improve arithmetic and mathematical reasoning performance by integrating external symbolic solvers or programmatic interpreters that execute generated code or formal expressions. This hybrid approach offloads precise calculation to deterministic tools, mitigating common errors in multi-step arithmetic and complex calculations that pure language modeling struggles with.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Offloading arithmetic calculations to external symbolic or programmatic tools reduces errors caused by approximate token prediction.</li>
                <li>LLMs can learn to generate correct programmatic or formal language representations of arithmetic problems to interface with external tools.</li>
                <li>Integration with external tools enables smaller or mid-sized models to achieve performance comparable to or exceeding larger pure LLMs.</li>
                <li>Prompting strategies that encourage programmatic decomposition of problems improve the quality of generated code and final answers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>PAL combines Codex with a Python interpreter to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on arithmetic word problems, outperforming larger models without external tools. <a href="../results/extraction-result-25.html#e25.0" class="evidence-link">[e25.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MathPrompter uses Python's eval() to compute and verify generated expressions, significantly improving accuracy on arithmetic datasets. <a href="../results/extraction-result-24.html#e24.0" class="evidence-link">[e24.0]</a> </li>
    <li>SYRELM architecture uses a symbolic solver with GPT-J 6B to translate natural language problems into formal expressions, improving accuracy by over 30 points on SVAMP. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PaLM 540B uses an external calculator to augment predictions, though with limited performance gains (~5%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-33.html#e33.0" class="evidence-link">[e33.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combining LLMs with more powerful symbolic solvers or verified arithmetic engines will further improve accuracy on complex arithmetic tasks.</li>
                <li>Smaller LLMs integrated with symbolic tools can outperform larger LLMs without such integration on multi-step arithmetic problems.</li>
                <li>Prompting methods that explicitly instruct LLMs to generate verifiable code or formal expressions will enhance reliability and reduce hallucinations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether fully end-to-end training of LLMs jointly with symbolic solvers can yield better arithmetic reasoning than modular integration is unknown.</li>
                <li>The extent to which external tool integration can generalize to other domains of mathematical reasoning beyond arithmetic remains to be seen.</li>
                <li>Whether symbolic tool integration can overcome fundamental limitations of LLMs in commonsense or contextual reasoning is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If integration with external symbolic or programmatic tools does not improve arithmetic accuracy compared to pure LLM approaches, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate syntactically correct or semantically valid code/formal expressions reliably, the utility of tool integration would be limited.</li>
                <li>If external tool integration introduces new failure modes or errors that offset accuracy gains, the theory's benefits would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs achieve high arithmetic accuracy without external tools, indicating that tool integration is not strictly necessary for all cases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-21.html#e21.0" class="evidence-link">[e21.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> </li>
    <li>External tool integration does not fully solve challenges related to ambiguous language or complex reasoning beyond arithmetic. <a href="../results/extraction-result-25.html#e25.0" class="evidence-link">[e25.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> </li>
