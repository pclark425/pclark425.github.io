                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Predictive Mirrors of Scientific Discourse Dynamics</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by virtue of their training on temporally ordered scientific literature and discourse, internalize the dynamics of scientific debate, consensus formation, and discovery. Their probability estimates for future discoveries reflect not only static priors but also the temporal evolution and momentum of scientific fields, allowing them to act as predictive mirrors of ongoing scientific discourse.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will assign higher probabilities to discoveries in fields with rapidly increasing publication rates and positive experimental results.</li>
                <li>LLMs' probability estimates will be less confident (higher variance) in fields with ongoing, unresolved scientific controversies.</li>
                <li>LLMs can identify emerging consensus in scientific fields before it is formalized in review articles.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to predict the timing of paradigm shifts by detecting inflection points in discourse momentum.</li>
                <li>LLMs could forecast the resolution of scientific controversies by modeling the convergence of discourse.</li>
                <li>LLMs may anticipate the emergence of new scientific subfields based on discourse patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates do not track with the momentum of scientific discourse (e.g., publication rates, positive results), the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs show no increase in uncertainty for polarized fields, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between fields with stable consensus and those with active debate, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may not capture non-textual signals of scientific momentum, such as funding trends or informal communications. </li>
    <li>LLMs may lag in reflecting real-time shifts in discourse due to training data update delays. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
