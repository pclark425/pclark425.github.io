                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, perform a form of emergent meta-optimization. Through self-reflection, the model identifies and corrects its own errors, biases, or inconsistencies by leveraging its internal representations and prior outputs, effectively simulating a higher-order learning process without explicit parameter updates.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that models can identify flaws in their own outputs when prompted to reflect, even without external feedback. </li>
    <li>Reflection prompts lead to improved answer quality in multi-step reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Self-Refine and similar frameworks demonstrate that models can critique and revise their own outputs, indicating the presence of an internal error-detection mechanism. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to self-consistency and chain-of-thought, this law formalizes the process as an emergent error signal extraction, which is not explicitly described in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Self-consistency and chain-of-thought prompting have been shown to improve model outputs via multiple passes.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of self-reflection as an error signal extraction process, akin to meta-optimization, is novel.</p>
