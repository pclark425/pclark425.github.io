                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Human-LLM Co-Distillation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective distillation of scientific theories from large scholarly corpora occurs through an interactive, iterative process in which human experts and LLMs collaborate. LLMs surface candidate theories, patterns, and evidence, while humans guide, critique, and refine the process, leveraging complementary strengths: LLMs' scale and pattern recognition, and humans' domain expertise and critical reasoning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Human-LLM co-distillation may enable the discovery of theories that neither party could generate independently.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If human-LLM collaboration does not outperform LLMs or humans alone in theory distillation, the theory is undermined.</li>
