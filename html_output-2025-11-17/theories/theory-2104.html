                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Conceptual Mapping Theory for LLM-Driven Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can construct emergent conceptual maps of scientific domains by identifying, clustering, and relating key concepts, hypotheses, and evidence across large scholarly corpora. These conceptual maps enable the LLM to distill theories by tracing the strongest, most interconnected pathways between evidence and explanatory statements, allowing for the discovery of both consensus and novel theoretical frameworks.</p>
