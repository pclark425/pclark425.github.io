                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scientific peer review texts, can identify, abstract, and synthesize emergent qualitative laws governing reviewer feedback. The LLMs achieve this by semantically aggregating patterns, contradictions, and consensus across reviews, enabling the distillation of generalizable principles that underlie the peer review process.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize and generalize from large text corpora, including scientific literature and reviews, identifying common themes and principles. </li>
    <li>Meta-analyses and systematic reviews in science rely on aggregating qualitative feedback to extract generalizable insights, a process LLMs can automate at scale. </li>
    <li>Recent work shows LLMs can extract and synthesize best practices from unstructured scientific text, including reviewer comments. </li>
    <li>LLMs have been used to identify and cluster thematic content in peer review datasets, revealing underlying feedback structures. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on LLM summarization and meta-analysis, the theory's focus on emergent law extraction from peer review feedback is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to summarize and extract themes from large text corpora, and meta-analyses aggregate qualitative feedback.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of LLMs as agents that can distill emergent, generalizable laws from the semantic aggregation of reviewer feedback is novel.</p>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law builds on existing consensus measurement but extends it to automated, cross-disciplinary law extraction by LLMs.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Consensus measurement in peer review and LLMs' ability to summarize consensus are established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The use of LLMs to formalize and distill consensus laws from reviewer feedback across disciplines is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>LLMs could reveal that certain feedback laws are only emergent at large scale and are invisible in small-sample manual analyses.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs trained on large peer review corpora fail to extract any generalizable laws, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce laws that are inconsistent with established peer review principles or fail to match human expert synthesis, the theory's validity is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM biases or training data limitations on the accuracy of extracted laws is not fully explained. </li>
