                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Weighting Theory of Multidimensional Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the relative importance (weight) of each evaluation dimension (empirical, conceptual, methodological, communicative) in LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation is context-dependent and dynamically adjusted based on the domain, purpose, and available evidence. The theory predicts that evaluators (human or automated) implicitly or explicitly reweight dimensions in response to field norms, data scarcity, or novelty.</p>
