                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Deliberative and Programmatic Memory Control Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal task-solving in LLM agents emerges from the dynamic interplay between deliberative (explicit, goal-driven) and programmatic (automatic, rule-based) memory control processes. Deliberative control allows agents to strategically select, retrieve, and manipulate memories in response to task demands, while programmatic control ensures efficient, scalable, and robust memory management through automated routines such as pruning, compression, and indexing. The theory predicts that agents leveraging both forms of control will outperform those relying on only one, especially in complex, long-horizon, or resource-constrained environments.</p>
