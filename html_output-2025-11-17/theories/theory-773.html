                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models, when sufficiently scaled and exposed to diverse data, can develop internal representations that approximate algorithmic procedures for arithmetic, enabling limited generalization beyond memorized patterns. This emergent reasoning is facilitated by architectural depth, attention mechanisms, and exposure to step-by-step reasoning in training data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If a language model is scaled up in size and trained on more diverse arithmetic reasoning data, its generalization to novel arithmetic expressions will improve.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If a model is scaled beyond current sizes, it may develop near-perfect generalization to all basic arithmetic operations.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on synthetic arithmetic languages, it may develop algorithmic reasoning transferable to natural language arithmetic.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing model size and data diversity does not improve arithmetic generalization, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If models with chain-of-thought training do not outperform those without on novel arithmetic, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small models show limited generalization on simple arithmetic, suggesting that scale is not the only factor. </li>
