                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Cell-Type-Specific Proteostasis and Stress Response</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by intrinsic differences in their molecular proteostasis networks and stress response pathways. Neurons with robust expression of molecular chaperones, efficient autophagy/lysosomal systems, and enhanced antioxidant defenses are more resilient to proteotoxic stress, while those with weaker proteostasis capacity are more susceptible to Aβ/tau accumulation and toxicity.</p>
