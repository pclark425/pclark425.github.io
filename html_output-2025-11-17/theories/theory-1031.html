                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1031</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Token-Level Probabilistic Reasoning for Spatial Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs solve spatial puzzles by performing token-level probabilistic reasoning, where each token prediction is influenced by the likelihood of satisfying all known constraints. The model's next-token distribution is shaped by both local context (e.g., row, column, box in Sudoku) and global puzzle structure, enabling the model to incrementally build valid solutions through probabilistic inference.</p>
