                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective and robust evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is achieved through protocols that combine iterative self-refinement (including self-critique, verification, and revision), actionable feedback, and human-in-the-loop oversight. Iterative refinement (e.g., SELF-REFINE, CoVe, self-critique & revise) not only improves the quality and factuality of generated theories but also enhances the reliability and calibration of their evaluation, especially when actionable feedback and human expert review are integrated at key stages. The theory further claims that such protocols are robust to model-specific biases, can adapt to new domains and tasks, and are necessary for high-stakes or open-ended scientific ideation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an iterative, self-refining evaluation protocol is applied to LLM-generated scientific theories, the quality and factuality of both the theories and their evaluations will improve with each iteration, with most gains in the first few rounds.</li>
                <li>If actionable feedback is replaced with generic or absent feedback in an iterative protocol, the improvement in evaluation quality will be significantly reduced or eliminated.</li>
                <li>If human expert review is included at key stages, the alignment of evaluation scores with human judgments will increase, especially in subjective or open-ended domains.</li>
                <li>If iterative, self-refining protocols are applied to new scientific domains, they will adapt and maintain improvement trends, provided feedback and review criteria are updated for the new domain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative, self-refining, human-in-the-loop protocols are scaled to fully autonomous scientific discovery (with minimal human intervention), they may enable LLMs to generate and evaluate novel scientific theories at or above human expert level.</li>
                <li>If such protocols are applied to domains with little or no prior human expertise (e.g., new scientific frontiers), they may still produce robust and reliable evaluations, potentially leading to discoveries beyond current human knowledge.</li>
                <li>If bias and domain adaptation are fully realized, these protocols may enable cross-domain transfer of evaluation criteria, allowing LLMs to evaluate scientific theories in entirely new fields with minimal retraining.</li>
                <li>If iterative refinement is combined with advanced uncertainty estimation and self-critique, LLMs may autonomously flag and correct their own hallucinations in scientific theory generation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative, self-refining protocols do not improve evaluation quality or factuality over single-pass evaluation, the iterative refinement law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If actionable feedback does not outperform generic or absent feedback in improving evaluation quality, the actionable feedback law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If human-in-the-loop oversight does not increase robustness or alignment in subjective domains, the human-in-the-loop law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If iterative, self-refining, human-in-the-loop protocols fail to reduce bias or adapt to new domains, the bias and domain adaptivity law would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some domains with objective, automated ground truth may not benefit from iterative or human-in-the-loop protocols, as automated metrics (e.g., strict accuracy, test-case average) suffice. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6108.html#e6108.1" class="evidence-link">[e6108.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6108.html#e6108.2" class="evidence-link">[e6108.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6123.html#e6123.1" class="evidence-link">[e6123.1]</a> </li>
