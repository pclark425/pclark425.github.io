                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness and Modality Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the synthesis of novel chemicals by LLMs is governed by the interplay between the stability of their internal chemical representations and their ability to integrate information from multiple data modalities. The theory posits that only when both factors are optimized can LLMs generalize to unseen chemical spaces and align generated molecules with complex, real-world application requirements.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs lacking either robust representations or modality integration will fail to generalize to new chemical spaces or satisfy complex design constraints.</li>
                <li>Enhancing modality integration (e.g., by adding property tables or application prompts) will improve constraint satisfaction in generated molecules.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be diminishing returns to modality integration beyond a certain point, or negative transfer if irrelevant modalities are included.</li>
                <li>The optimal balance between representation robustness and modality integration may depend on the specific chemical domain or application.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with weak modality integration can satisfy complex, multi-constraint design tasks, the law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models with low representation robustness generalize well to unseen chemical spaces, the law is falsified.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of explicit symbolic reasoning or external knowledge graphs is not considered. </li>
    <li>The impact of pretraining objectives and data augmentation strategies on robustness and integration is not explicitly modeled. </li>
