                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory (Cognitive Resource Limitation Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant of the Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory proposes that the bottleneck arises not only from representational mismatch, but also from cognitive resource limitations inherent in neural architectures. Specifically, the theory posits that language models have limited capacity to maintain, manipulate, and update explicit symbolic states over multiple reasoning steps, leading to rapid degradation of logical consistency and increased error rates as logical depth increases.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing the explicit symbolic state capacity (e.g., via external memory or symbolic modules) will mitigate the degradation in logical accuracy with depth.</li>
                <li>Tasks with shallow logical depth will not exhibit the same rapid error increase as deep reasoning tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist neural architectures that can internally represent and maintain symbolic states over many steps, but it is unclear if such architectures are feasible or trainable at scale.</li>
                <li>Hybrid neuro-symbolic models may exhibit a threshold effect, where logical accuracy remains high up to a certain depth, then drops sharply.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model without explicit symbolic state tracking maintains high logical accuracy over arbitrarily deep reasoning chains, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If increasing symbolic state capacity does not improve logical reasoning performance, the theory's resource limitation claim would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show improved logical reasoning with scale, suggesting that capacity may be partially addressable by model size alone. </li>
