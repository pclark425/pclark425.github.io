                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1695</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relational Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models (LMs) detect anomalies in lists not only by identifying statistical outliers, but by modeling the contextual and relational dependencies among list elements. Anomalies are identified as items that violate learned relational or logical constraints, even if their surface statistics are not rare. The theory emphasizes the LM's ability to internalize and enforce implicit rules governing list structure, enabling detection of subtle or non-obvious anomalies.</p>
