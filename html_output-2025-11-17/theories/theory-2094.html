                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2094</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM-Human Co-Discovery of Quantitative Laws</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective use of LLMs for distilling quantitative laws from scholarly papers arises from an iterative, interactive process between LLMs and human experts. LLMs generate candidate laws by synthesizing across large corpora, while humans provide critical evaluation, correction, and domain-specific insight, resulting in a feedback loop that accelerates the discovery and validation of robust, generalizable quantitative laws.</p>
