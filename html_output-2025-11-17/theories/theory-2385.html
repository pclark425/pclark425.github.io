                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory: Activity-Dependent Propagation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is driven by their network connectivity in combination with their activity-dependent synaptic properties. Neurons that are both highly connected and exhibit high levels of synaptic activity are more likely to facilitate the trans-synaptic propagation of pathological proteins, leading to selective vulnerability.</p>
