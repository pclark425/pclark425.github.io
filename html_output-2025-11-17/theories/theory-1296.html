                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1296</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Motif-Driven Locality Enhancement Theory for Hard Graph Problems</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that encoding local graph motifs—recurring, small subgraph patterns—within graph-to-text representations enhances the ability of language models to solve hard graph problems. By explicitly representing motifs, the theory claims that LMs can more efficiently learn and reason about local graph structure, which is often critical for solving combinatorial and structural graph tasks. The theory further asserts that motif-driven representations improve both sample efficiency and generalization, especially for problems where local structure is predictive of global properties.</p>
