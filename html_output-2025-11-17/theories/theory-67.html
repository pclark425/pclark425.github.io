                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Alignment as Spatial Grounding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models encode and utilize spatial, procedural, and object-relational knowledge for embodied planning tasks without direct sensory input, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models acquire spatial and object-relational knowledge for embodied tasks through alignment with multimodal representations, even without direct sensory input at inference time. Pretraining on paired image-text data (CLIP-style) or fine-tuning with multimodal supervision creates shared embedding spaces where linguistic and spatial/visual concepts are aligned. This alignment enables: (1) zero-shot transfer of spatial reasoning from vision to language, (2) grounding of spatial language through visual similarity, (3) compositional generalization by combining aligned concepts, and (4) implicit spatial priors encoded in the alignment. The quality of spatial reasoning depends on: alignment strength, coverage of spatial concepts in training data, the structure of the shared embedding space, and the type of spatial knowledge required (perceptual attributes vs relational reasoning vs metric precision). Models can leverage this alignment even when operating purely on text by accessing the spatially-grounded regions of the embedding space. However, alignment-based spatial knowledge has limitations: it may be insufficient for precise metric reasoning, can be outperformed by text-only models on certain relational tasks, and shows varying effectiveness across different spatial reference frames and relation types.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Multimodal alignment during pretraining creates shared embedding spaces that encode spatial and object-relational knowledge accessible to language models</li>
                <li>The strength of alignment determines spatial reasoning capability: stronger alignment enables better zero-shot transfer and generalization, particularly for perceptual attributes</li>
                <li>Spatial knowledge can be accessed through language alone by leveraging the spatially-grounded regions of aligned embedding spaces</li>
                <li>Explicit spatial alignment objectives (e.g., MSE between object and text embeddings with spatial features, spatial self-attention with pairwise spatial features) improve situated reasoning beyond general multimodal pretraining</li>
                <li>Coverage of spatial concepts in multimodal training data determines the scope of spatial knowledge: underrepresented spatial relations will be poorly grounded</li>
                <li>Compositional spatial reasoning emerges from combining aligned concepts in the embedding space</li>
                <li>The geometry of embedding spaces (distances, angles) reflects spatial relationships in the physical world, and can be specialized through spatial task supervision</li>
                <li>Alignment-based spatial knowledge is most effective for perceptual attributes (color, shape) and semantic grounding, but may be insufficient for precise metric reasoning or complex relational inference</li>
                <li>Different types of spatial knowledge (perceptual vs relational vs metric) benefit differently from multimodal alignment, with perceptual attributes showing strongest gains</li>
                <li>Multimodal alignment quality varies by spatial reference frame: egocentric spatial understanding requires explicit situated alignment beyond general image-text pairing</li>
                <li>Text-only models pretrained on image captions can sometimes outperform multimodal models on relational spatial reasoning, suggesting alignment is not always the optimal approach</li>
                <li>Alignment enables cross-modal transfer (e.g., 2D images to 3D point clouds) through shared embedding spaces guided by multimodal pretraining</li>
            </ol>

            <ol>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal embedding space geometry for spatial reasoning or whether different geometries favor different spatial tasks (e.g., Euclidean vs hyperbolic spaces for hierarchical spatial relations)</li>
                <li>Whether spatial knowledge acquired through multimodal alignment can match the precision of explicit coordinate-based representations for metric spatial reasoning tasks</li>
                <li>Whether alignment-based spatial knowledge transfers across different sensory modalities (e.g., vision to touch to proprioception) with equal effectiveness</li>
                <li>Whether the benefits of multimodal alignment saturate with scale or continue to improve with larger models and more data, and at what point text-only approaches might become competitive</li>
                <li>Whether alignment quality for different spatial relation types (topological, directional, distance) can be independently optimized or whether they are fundamentally coupled</li>
                <li>Whether alignment-based spatial knowledge can support counterfactual spatial reasoning (e.g., 'what if this object were moved here?') or is limited to observed spatial configurations</li>
                <li>Whether the superiority of caption-pretrained models over VLMs on certain spatial tasks indicates a fundamental limitation of multimodal alignment or a training data/architecture issue</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that models without multimodal pretraining can achieve equal spatial reasoning through text-only training would challenge the necessity of alignment for spatial knowledge</li>
                <li>Finding that explicit spatial alignment objectives provide no benefit over general multimodal pretraining would question the specificity assumption</li>
                <li>Showing that embedding space geometry does not reflect spatial relationships would challenge the geometric grounding assumption</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that multimodal alignment does not enable zero-shot transfer to novel spatial concepts would question the generalization claim</li>
                <li>Finding that text-only models consistently outperform multimodal models on spatial reasoning tasks would challenge the core premise that alignment provides spatial grounding</li>
                <li>Showing that alignment quality does not correlate with downstream spatial reasoning performance would question the causal relationship</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that models with strong alignment fail on basic spatial reasoning tasks at rates similar to unaligned models would challenge the sufficiency of alignment</li>
                <li>Finding that explicit coordinate representations always outperform alignment-based approaches would suggest alignment is not the primary mechanism for spatial reasoning</li>
