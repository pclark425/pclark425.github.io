                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1163</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Preference-Driven Logical Abstraction and Error Correction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that preference optimization, when combined with targeted exposure to hard negatives, enables language models to abstract general logical rules and develop internal error-correction mechanisms. The process encourages the model to not only select correct reasoning chains but also to internalize patterns of logical fallacies, leading to improved generalization and resilience to novel logical errors.</p>
