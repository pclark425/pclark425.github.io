                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can iteratively refine and synthesize candidate quantitative laws by aggregating, evaluating, and reconciling conflicting or partial evidence from large numbers of scholarly sources. Through a process analogous to scientific peer review and consensus-building, the LLM can converge on robust, consensus quantitative laws that best explain the aggregated data, even in the presence of noise, contradictions, or incomplete information.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will flag outlier or anomalous results as less influential in the consensus law extraction process.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to resolve longstanding scientific controversies by synthesizing a consensus law from conflicting literature.</li>
                <li>LLMs could identify when no consensus law is possible due to irreconcilable contradictions, flagging areas for further research.</li>
                <li>LLMs may outperform traditional meta-analyses in speed and breadth of law extraction, but the accuracy and reliability of such laws is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to converge on a consensus law when provided with noisy or conflicting data, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to refine their quantitative law proposals in response to new evidence, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently reinforce incorrect or spurious consensus due to overrepresentation of flawed studies, the theory's assumptions would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of systematic biases in the literature (e.g., publication bias, selective reporting) on the LLM's consensus law extraction is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of LLMs' own training data and pre-existing biases on the law extraction process is not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
