                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be used in an iterative process to distill qualitative laws from scholarly papers by generating, testing, and refining candidate hypotheses based on extracted evidence, with each iteration improving the abstraction and generality of the resulting laws.</p>
