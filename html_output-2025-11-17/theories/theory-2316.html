                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2316</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Failure and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where age-related and genetic impairments in protein quality control (including autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system, and chaperone function) lead to the accumulation and prion-like propagation of misfolded amyloid-beta and tau. The spread of these aggregates through neural circuits drives neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying proteostatic stress markers and aggregate seeds in peripheral fluids.</p>
