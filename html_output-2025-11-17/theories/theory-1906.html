                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1906</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Dynamic Cognitive Load Regulator</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the format of a prompt dynamically regulates the cognitive load experienced by an LLM during problem solving. Well-structured prompts reduce extraneous cognitive load by clarifying task requirements, sequencing information, and minimizing ambiguity, thereby freeing up model capacity for intrinsic and germane processing. Conversely, poorly structured or ambiguous prompts increase cognitive load, leading to more frequent errors, shallow reasoning, or reliance on heuristics. The theory predicts that prompt format can be optimized to match the LLM's processing capabilities, maximizing performance on tasks of varying complexity.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

    <li>LLMs are more likely to make errors or default to generic responses when prompts are ambiguous or overloaded. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law synthesizes prompt engineering failures with cognitive load theory, extending the analogy to LLMs.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt ambiguity and overload are known to reduce LLM performance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The formalization of prompt-induced cognitive overload as a mechanistic constraint on LLM reasoning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompt formats are optimized to minimize ambiguity and extraneous information, LLMs will show improved accuracy and reduced hallucination rates on complex tasks.</li>
                <li>If prompts are intentionally overloaded with irrelevant or ambiguous information, LLMs will show increased error rates and more generic outputs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit cognitive load regulation signals (e.g., meta-prompts about task complexity), they may develop adaptive strategies for handling overloaded prompts.</li>
                <li>If prompt format is dynamically adjusted in real-time based on LLM output quality, performance may surpass static prompt optimization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well regardless of prompt ambiguity or overload, the theory's claim about cognitive load regulation is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs do not show increased error rates with overloaded prompts, the cognitive load overload law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may sometimes perform well on ambiguous prompts due to memorization or overfitting to common patterns. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
