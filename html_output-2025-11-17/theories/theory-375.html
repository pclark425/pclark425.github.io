                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-375</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Actuator Dynamics Transfer Requirements</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about sim-to-real transfer for scientific discovery agents that specifies environment fidelity requirements and skill-transfer conditions from virtual labs to real robotics labs, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For tasks involving dynamic motion or high-frequency control, the fidelity of actuator modeling significantly impacts sim-to-real transfer success. The required modeling depth depends on: (1) task dynamics (quasi-static vs dynamic), (2) control mode (position vs torque vs impedance), (3) control frequency, and (4) whether low-level controllers abstract actuator details. Critical actuator properties include: torque/force limits and saturation, electrical/mechanical dynamics (motor constants, gear ratios, transmission efficiency), control latencies and delays (typically 5-50ms), friction and backlash, and for compliant tasks, backdrivability and transmission efficiency. Complete omission of actuator dynamics causes transfer failure for locomotion and high-speed manipulation, but tasks using operational-space control or position control with low-level PD controllers can succeed with simplified actuator models. System identification of key actuator parameters from encoder-only data (20-40 seconds of excitation covering control bandwidth typically sufficient) can enable zero-shot transfer. Physics-based actuator models with compact parameterizations (5-10 parameters) outperform learned neural network models, requiring less data, no torque sensors, and providing better generalization. Actuator parameter randomization can improve robustness when accurate identification is not feasible, but accurate physics-based identification eliminates the need for randomization and achieves superior transfer. Accurate actuator modeling also enables energy-efficient policies with 30%+ reductions in cost-of-transport. In-air actuator identification (without contact) can be sufficient for contact-rich locomotion, suggesting actuator modeling can be decoupled from contact modeling.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For locomotion tasks with control frequencies >20Hz, omission of actuator torque limits and saturation causes transfer failure or large performance degradation (>50% performance drop)</li>
                <li>Control latencies >5-10ms must be explicitly modeled or compensated for in tasks with control frequencies >20Hz; unmodeled latencies cause instability or oscillations</li>
                <li>Motor electrical dynamics (back-EMF, resistance, battery voltage effects) must be modeled for tasks requiring precise torque control at high frequencies or high-speed performance; at low speeds (<1 m/s) and within policy bandwidth (<25 Hz), inner current loops can be treated as unit-gain torque sources, but voltage/current limits must still be modeled</li>
                <li>Gear transmission efficiency and backdrivability must be modeled for compliant locomotion on torque-sensorless robots; omission causes joint oscillations and falls</li>
                <li>System identification of 3-5 key actuator parameters (friction, damping, torque limits, transmission efficiency, inertia, delay) from 20-40 seconds of excitation data covering control bandwidth (up to Nyquist frequency) is sufficient for many dynamic tasks</li>
                <li>Physics-based actuator models with compact parameterizations (5-10 parameters) outperform learned neural network models, requiring less data (encoder-only vs torque-instrumented), no torque sensors, and providing better generalization across control gains and trajectories</li>
                <li>Encoder-only data (joint positions and velocities) is sufficient for effective actuator system identification; torque sensors are not necessary for successful transfer in many cases</li>
                <li>Quasi-static tasks (motion time >1s per action, control frequency <5Hz) can succeed with position control and approximate actuator modeling, achieving >80% success rates</li>
                <li>Operational-space control (OSC) or end-effector space control can abstract away detailed actuator dynamics for manipulation tasks, but requires accurate system identification of robot dynamics (gravity, inertia, joint damping)</li>
                <li>Actuator parameter randomization (±10-20% torque limits, ±10ms latency, ±20% motor strength) improves robustness when accurate system identification is not feasible, but accurate physics-based identification eliminates the need for randomization and achieves superior transfer performance</li>
                <li>High inference frequency (>50Hz) can compensate for simplified actuator models in some tasks by enabling reactive control, particularly when low-level controllers provide high-bandwidth torque tracking</li>
                <li>For soft/pneumatic actuators, pressure dynamics, chamber geometry, second-order mechanical dynamics (M_eq, C_n, K_n), pump dynamics, hysteresis, and speed-dependent uncertainty must be modeled; Monte Carlo randomization with σ_ζ ~ 0.05-0.12 and σ_ωn ~ 0.055-0.1 across actuation speeds is required for accurate transfer</li>
                <li>Action history (5-10 past actions) in observations can help policies learn to compensate for unmodeled actuator dynamics and delays</li>
                <li>In-air actuator identification (without contact) can be sufficient for contact-rich locomotion tasks; actuator modeling can be decoupled from contact modeling and is often the more critical factor for locomotion transfer success</li>
                <li>Accurate actuator modeling including electrical losses (Joule heating) and mechanical dissipation enables energy-efficient policies with 30%+ reductions in cost-of-transport compared to policies trained without accurate actuator models</li>
                <li>CMA-ES and massively-parallel evolutionary optimization (with thousands of parallel environments) are effective system identification methods for actuator parameters, alongside trajectory optimization and gradient-based approaches; convergence typically requires 10-24 hours with 4000+ parallel environments</li>

    "theory_description": "For tasks involving dynamic motion or high-frequency control, the fidelity of actuator modeling significantly impacts sim-to-real transfer success. The required modeling depth depends on: (1) task dynamics (quasi-static vs dynamic), (2) control mode (position vs torque vs impedance), (3) control frequency, and (4) whether low-level controllers abstract actuator details. Critical actuator properties include: torque/force limits and saturation, electrical/mechanical dynamics (motor constants, gear ratios, transmission efficiency), control latencies and delays (typically 5-50ms), friction and backlash, and for compliant tasks, backdrivability and transmission efficiency. Complete omission of actuator dynamics causes transfer failure for locomotion and high-speed manipulation, but tasks using operational-space control or position control with low-level PD controllers can succeed with simplified actuator models. System identification of key actuator parameters from encoder-only data (20-40 seconds of excitation covering control bandwidth typically sufficient) can enable zero-shot transfer. Physics-based actuator models with compact parameterizations (5-10 parameters) outperform learned neural network models, requiring less data, no torque sensors, and providing better generalization. Actuator parameter randomization can improve robustness when accurate identification is not feasible, but accurate physics-based identification eliminates the need for randomization and achieves superior transfer. Accurate actuator modeling also enables energy-efficient policies with 30%+ reductions in cost-of-transport. In-air actuator identification (without contact) can be sufficient for contact-rich locomotion, suggesting actuator modeling can be decoupled from contact modeling.",
