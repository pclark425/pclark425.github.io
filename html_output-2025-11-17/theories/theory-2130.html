                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2130</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HMOT: Hierarchical Modular Orchestration for Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective use of LLMs for distilling scientific theories from large corpora is achieved through a hierarchical modular orchestration. In this framework, LLMs are organized into specialized modules (e.g., evidence extraction, contradiction detection, abstraction, synthesis) that operate at different levels of abstraction. The orchestration dynamically routes information between modules based on the complexity and ambiguity of the input, enabling both broad synthesis and deep, focused analysis. The theory asserts that this hierarchical, modular approach maximizes both the comprehensiveness and faithfulness of the distilled theories.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Hierarchical orchestration may enable the discovery of emergent scientific concepts not present in the original literature.</li>
                <li>Dynamic specialization could reveal new forms of scientific contradiction or consensus previously unrecognized.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If monolithic LLMs perform as well as or better than modular, hierarchical systems, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical routing does not improve theory faithfulness or comprehensiveness, the theory is weakened.</li>
