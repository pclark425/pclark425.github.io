                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Driven Internal Simulation: LLMs as Implicit Symbolic Solvers for Spatial Puzzles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that large language models (LLMs) solve spatial puzzles by internally simulating the stepwise application of symbolic rules, such as constraint propagation and candidate elimination, using their sequence modeling capabilities. The LLM encodes the puzzle state and, through autoregressive generation, simulates the effect of applying symbolic rules, effectively acting as an implicit symbolic solver. This process is guided by learned priors over valid moves and solution strategies, allowing the LLM to generalize to novel puzzles and explain its reasoning in natural language.</p>
