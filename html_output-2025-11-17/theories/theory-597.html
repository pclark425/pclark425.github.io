                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs), when exposed to spatially-structured puzzle data (such as Sudoku, chess, or spatial VQA), can synthesize and internalize algorithmic reasoning procedures—such as constraint propagation, search, or state tracking—if and only if their architecture or training regime provides sufficient inductive bias to represent and compose relational or spatial dependencies. The emergence of such reasoning is not guaranteed by scale or data alone, but is critically dependent on the model's ability to represent and propagate structured information (e.g., via recurrence, message passing, or explicit memory).</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new spatial puzzle (e.g., a novel constraint-satisfaction problem) is presented to a language model with a relational or recurrent inductive bias, the model will be able to learn and generalize solution strategies after sufficient training, even if the puzzle structure is novel.</li>
                <li>If a feedforward-only or shallow model is trained on a spatial puzzle with permuted or randomized spatial encoding, its test accuracy will drop to near chance, regardless of training set size.</li>
                <li>If a model with explicit relational or memory-based bias is trained on spatial puzzles with increasing size (e.g., larger Sudoku boards), it will generalize better than a model without such bias.</li>
                <li>If a VLM is trained with explicit region-level or depth-aware spatial supervision, it will outperform a contrastive-only VLM on spatial VQA tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a sufficiently large transformer LM is trained with a curriculum of increasingly complex spatial puzzles, but without explicit relational or memory modules, it may eventually develop emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities—though this is not guaranteed and may require orders of magnitude more data or compute.</li>
                <li>If a hybrid model with both relational and non-relational pathways is trained, it may learn to route spatial reasoning through the relational pathway and pattern-matching through the non-relational pathway, leading to interpretable modularity in internal representations.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with both symbolic and neural components, the division of labor between modules may shift as the complexity of spatial reasoning increases.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on spatial puzzles with adversarially designed distractor patterns, the necessity of structured bias for generalization will become even more pronounced.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model with explicit relational or recurrent bias fails to generalize to permuted or larger spatial puzzles after sufficient training, this would challenge the necessity or sufficiency of structured bias for emergent reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a feedforward-only model achieves high test accuracy on spatial puzzles with permuted encodings, this would contradict the law that structured bias is required for generalization.</li>
                <li>If a VLM trained only with contrastive objectives achieves human-level accuracy on tightly controlled spatial reasoning benchmarks, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If a large LLM without explicit relational bias can solve multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks as well as or better than models with such bias, this would call the theory into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) show partial spatial reasoning in zero-shot settings, even without explicit relational modules, suggesting that scale and data diversity may partially compensate for lack of bias. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4855.html#e4855.4" class="evidence-link">[e4855.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4832.html#e4832.0" class="evidence-link">[e4832.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4835.html#e4835.1" class="evidence-link">[e4835.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5064.html#e5064.1" class="evidence-link">[e5064.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain neuro-symbolic pipelines (e.g., LLM-to-ASP, GPT-3+ASP) achieve high accuracy by offloading reasoning to external solvers, which is not explained by this theory focused on end-to-end neural models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5065.html#e5065.2" class="evidence-link">[e5065.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4866.html#e4866.4" class="evidence-link">[e4866.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5072.html#e5072.0" class="evidence-link">[e5072.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5072.html#e5072.3" class="evidence-link">[e5072.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Some models (e.g., BLIP, X-VLM, SpatialVLM) achieve strong spatial VQA performance via multi-grained or region-aware architectures, but the precise contribution of inductive bias versus data scale is not fully disentangled. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5059.html#e5059.0" class="evidence-link">[e5059.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5053.html#e5053.0" class="evidence-link">[e5053.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4838.html#e4838.0" class="evidence-link">[e4838.0]</a> </li>
