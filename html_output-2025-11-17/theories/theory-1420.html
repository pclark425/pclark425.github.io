                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, perform a form of internal self-optimization. Each reflection step acts as a meta-cognitive process, allowing the model to identify and correct errors, refine reasoning, and reallocate representational resources, leading to improved answer quality over successive iterations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection cycles are extended indefinitely, the model may begin to overfit to its own prior outputs, potentially degrading answer quality.</li>
                <li>Introducing adversarial or misleading reflection prompts may cause the model to reinforce errors rather than correct them.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve with additional reflection cycles, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If models fail to identify or correct errors in their own outputs during reflection, the meta-cognitive error correction law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection cycles introduce new errors or hallucinations not present in the initial output. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
