                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is represented along a continuum from modal (sensory-motor grounded) to amodal (abstract, symbolic) formats, and that the brain dynamically hybridizes these formats depending on context, task demands, and learning history. Rather than being strictly segregated, modal and amodal representations interact and blend, allowing flexible conceptual processing that can draw on both perceptual detail and abstract structure as needed.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially inducing hybridization (e.g., via neurostimulation) will improve performance on tasks requiring flexible conceptual use.</li>
                <li>Individuals with atypical connectivity (e.g., in autism) will show altered patterns of hybridization and conceptual flexibility.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts are found to be represented exclusively in either modal or amodal formats, the continuum and hybridization claims would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the recruitment of modal and amodal regions, the dynamic aspect of the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
