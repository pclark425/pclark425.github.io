                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Refinement and Contradiction Resolution in LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill robust scientific theories from large scholarly corpora by iteratively refining candidate theories and resolving contradictions through internal consistency checks and cross-source validation. The process leverages the LLM's ability to detect inconsistencies, weigh evidence, and update or discard hypotheses, leading to more accurate and reliable theoretical frameworks.</p>
