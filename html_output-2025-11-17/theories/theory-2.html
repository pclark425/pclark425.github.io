                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory explains that the slot-based episodic memory module in the Memory Recall Agent (MRA) enables efficient storage and retrieval of past experiences using a key-value structure, which significantly improves the agent's ability to generalize to holdout data and perform tasks requiring long-term dependencies such as Transitive Inference and Goal Navigation.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Slot-based episodic memory stores discrete experiences as key-value pairs, facilitating efficient retrieval during task execution.</li>
                <li>The combination of working memory (LSTM) and episodic memory allows the agent to handle both immediate context and long-term dependencies.</li>
                <li>Episodic memory updates occur without gradient flow, maintaining computational efficiency while preserving memory integrity.</li>
                <li>Generalization to holdout tasks improves when episodic memory is used, especially for tasks requiring inference over temporally distant events.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>MRA's slot-based episodic memory combined with LSTM working memory leads to superhuman scores on memory tasks and better generalization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1.html#e1.0" class="evidence-link">[e1.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing the number of slots in episodic memory will improve performance on tasks with longer temporal dependencies.</li>
                <li>Disabling the episodic memory module will reduce the agent's ability to perform transitive inference tasks.</li>
                <li>Using a key-value retrieval mechanism will outperform simple recurrent memory in tasks requiring recall of specific past events.</li>
                <li>Training the episodic memory with reinforcement learning updates will maintain or improve computational efficiency compared to gradient-based updates.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the slot-based episodic memory can be extended to handle hierarchical or compositional memories for more complex reasoning.</li>
                <li>If episodic memory can be adapted to store abstracted summaries of experiences rather than raw events to improve scalability.</li>
                <li>Whether episodic memory mechanisms can be combined with external knowledge bases to enhance reasoning in text games.</li>
                <li>If episodic memory retrieval can be optimized to prioritize more relevant past experiences dynamically during task execution.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Testing MRA performance on memory tasks with episodic memory disabled to see if generalization and long-term dependency handling degrade.</li>
                <li>Replacing slot-based episodic memory with a simple buffer to evaluate if retrieval efficiency and task performance decline.</li>
                <li>Measuring computational cost differences when episodic memory updates use gradient flow versus no gradient flow.</li>
                <li>Evaluating if increasing episodic memory slots beyond a certain point yields diminishing returns or performance degradation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact nature of the key-value structure and how keys are generated or selected is not fully described. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1.html#e1.0" class="evidence-link">[e1.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Limitations in fully generalizing outside training sets on more challenging tasks suggest episodic memory alone is insufficient. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1.html#e1.0" class="evidence-link">[e1.0]</a> </li>
