                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that uncertainty in probabilistic symbolic world models propagates through distinct hierarchical levels of abstraction, with each level requiring different propagation mechanisms. The theory posits that uncertainty at level N influences level N+1 through three distinct channels: (1) direct propagation where low-level uncertainty bounds constrain high-level predictions, (2) aggregation effects where multiple uncertain low-level states combine to produce high-level uncertainty, and (3) emergent uncertainty that arises from the abstraction process itself, independent of lower-level uncertainty. The theory further proposes that LLM-based world models exhibit level-specific uncertainty characteristics: token-level uncertainty at the lowest level, entity-state uncertainty at the symbolic level, action-outcome uncertainty at the planning level, and goal-achievability uncertainty at the highest strategic level. Effective planning requires propagating uncertainty upward through these levels while maintaining computational tractability through selective propagation of only decision-relevant uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Uncertainty propagates through hierarchical levels via three distinct mechanisms: direct propagation, aggregation, and emergent abstraction uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Each hierarchical level in a symbolic world model exhibits characteristic uncertainty patterns: token-level (linguistic), entity-state (symbolic), action-outcome (tactical), and goal-achievability (strategic).</li>
                <li>Higher levels of abstraction accumulate uncertainty from lower levels but also generate new uncertainty specific to the abstraction process.</li>
                <li>Effective uncertainty propagation requires level-specific propagation functions that account for the semantic relationships between adjacent levels.</li>
                <li>Computational tractability in hierarchical planning requires selective propagation where only decision-relevant uncertainty is maintained across levels.</li>
                <li>The rate of uncertainty growth across hierarchical levels depends on the branching factor and the correlation structure between lower-level uncertain elements.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty at level N+1 is bounded by the worst-case propagation from level N but may be tighter when lower-level uncertainties are negatively correlated or cancel out.</li>
                <li>LLM-based world models require explicit uncertainty propagation mechanisms because implicit uncertainty in token distributions does not naturally propagate to symbolic planning levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Neural network confidence calibration varies across different architectural layers and abstraction levels, with deeper layers showing different calibration properties than shallow layers. </li>
    <li>LLMs exhibit varying levels of uncertainty and calibration across different types of reasoning tasks, with more abstract reasoning showing different uncertainty patterns than concrete factual recall. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical Bayesian models demonstrate that uncertainty at different levels of a hierarchy can be modeled with level-specific parameters and propagation rules. </li>
    <li>Abstraction in planning systems can introduce new sources of uncertainty beyond those present in ground-level representations. </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification in deep learning shows that different layers capture different types of uncertainty, with early layers capturing aleatoric uncertainty and later layers capturing epistemic uncertainty. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Planning systems that explicitly model uncertainty at each hierarchical level will make more robust decisions than systems that only track uncertainty at a single level.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of uncertainty propagation will grow super-linearly with the number of hierarchical levels unless selective propagation strategies are employed.</li>
                <li>In domains with high correlation between low-level uncertainties, aggregation to higher levels will reduce relative uncertainty compared to domains with independent uncertainties.</li>
                <li>LLM-based planners that propagate token-level uncertainty to action-level uncertainty will exhibit better calibration in their action selection than those that treat LLM outputs as deterministic.</li>
                <li>Systems that model emergent abstraction uncertainty will be better calibrated at high levels than systems that only propagate lower-level uncertainty upward.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the three-channel propagation model (direct, aggregation, emergent) is sufficient to capture all uncertainty propagation phenomena in complex hierarchical world models, or whether additional channels exist, remains unknown.</li>
                <li>The extent to which uncertainty propagation patterns learned in one domain transfer to hierarchically similar domains with different semantics is unclear and could have major implications for transfer learning in planning systems.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial inputs could exploit specific levels of the hierarchy to inject uncertainty that propagates catastrophically to higher levels is unknown but has critical safety implications.</li>
                <li>The optimal number of hierarchical levels for balancing uncertainty propagation accuracy against computational cost may vary dramatically across domains in ways that are difficult to predict a priori.</li>
                <li>Whether quantum-inspired uncertainty propagation methods could provide computational advantages for hierarchical planning in large state spaces is an open question with potentially transformative implications.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If planning performance does not improve when using multi-level uncertainty propagation compared to single-level uncertainty tracking, this would challenge the core premise of the theory.</li>
                <li>If emergent abstraction uncertainty is negligible compared to propagated lower-level uncertainty across diverse domains, this would question the need for the three-channel model.</li>
                <li>If computational costs of full hierarchical uncertainty propagation prove prohibitive even with selective propagation strategies, this would limit the practical applicability of the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based planners show no improvement in calibration when propagating token-level uncertainty versus treating outputs as deterministic, this would challenge the theory's applicability to LLM-based systems.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty at different hierarchical levels shows no consistent patterns across tasks and domains, this would question the existence of level-specific uncertainty characteristics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to determine the optimal granularity of hierarchical levels for a given domain or task. </li>
    <li>The interaction between uncertainty propagation and active information gathering (where the agent can reduce uncertainty through exploration) is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for temporal dynamics where uncertainty may change over time as the world model is updated with new observations. </li>
    <li>How to handle cycles or non-tree-structured hierarchies in uncertainty propagation is not specified. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to propagate uncertainty when multiple hierarchical decompositions of the same problem exist simultaneously. </li>
