                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Law of Structure-Aware Demonstration Retrieval in Molecular Property Prediction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the retrieval of demonstrations for in-context learning by LLMs in molecular property prediction is most effective when it is structure-aware, i.e., when the selection of demonstrations is guided by molecular structural similarity (including substructure, scaffold, and global features) between the query and the demonstrations. Structure-aware retrieval enables LLMs to leverage relevant chemical context, leading to higher prediction accuracy, especially for properties that are sensitive to molecular structure.</p>
