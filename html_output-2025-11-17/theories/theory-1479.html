                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1479</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Compositionality Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains is fundamentally compositional and dynamic: concepts are constructed on-the-fly from reusable, lower-level primitives (features, roles, relations) via flexible binding operations. Rather than storing fixed, static concept representations, the brain dynamically assembles conceptual structures in response to task demands, context, and goals. This compositionality enables infinite productivity from finite resources and supports rapid adaptation to novel situations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial neural networks with dynamic binding mechanisms will show human-like productivity in open-ended concept learning.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If novel concepts are represented as static, holistic patterns rather than dynamically assembled, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If the number of representational primitives is not finite or if productivity is not observed, the theory would be called into question.</li>
