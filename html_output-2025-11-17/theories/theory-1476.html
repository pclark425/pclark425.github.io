                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1476</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextualized Dynamic Embedding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented as high-dimensional, context-sensitive embeddings, where each concept is encoded as a dynamic vector in a conceptual space. The position and structure of each embedding is modulated in real time by task demands, context, and recent experience, allowing for flexible adaptation, context-dependent meaning, and rapid updating. The representational format is fundamentally dynamic and distributed, with no fixed symbolic structure, but with the capacity to instantiate temporary structure via context-driven attractor dynamics.</p>
