                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Memory Enables Generalization, Continual Learning, and Robustness in Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that retrieval-augmented memory—where agents store and retrieve relevant past experiences, skills, or knowledge via similarity search or structured queries—enables language model agents to generalize to new tasks, continually learn from experience, and robustly adapt to distributional shifts. By integrating retrieved memories into the agent's context or reasoning process, agents can analogize from prior solutions, avoid repeated mistakes, and transfer knowledge across domains, outperforming purely parametric or context-only models.</p>
