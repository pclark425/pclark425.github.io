                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance-Gated Memory Retrieval for Efficient LLM Text Game Play</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by employing a relevance-gated retrieval mechanism. The agent maintains a large, potentially unbounded memory store, but at each decision point, it selectively retrieves only those memory elements most relevant to the current context, as determined by a learned or adaptive relevance function. This enables efficient reasoning, reduces distraction from irrelevant details, and supports long-horizon planning.</p>
