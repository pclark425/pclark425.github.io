                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Iterative Symbolic Law Discovery via Program Synthesis and Simulation Feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models, when coupled with program synthesis and iterative feedback from simulation or data-driven evaluation, can discover explicit, interpretable symbolic laws (e.g., equations, code representations) that govern scientific phenomena. The LLM acts as a generator of candidate symbolic expressions or programs, which are then externally evaluated for fitness (e.g., via simulation, loss minimization, or empirical data fit). Feedback from this evaluation is used to iteratively refine the LLM's proposals, enabling the discovery of novel, high-fidelity, and generalizable scientific laws, even in domains where the forward process is complex or simulation-coupled.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-driven program synthesis pipelines, when coupled with simulation or empirical feedback, will discover explicit symbolic laws that outperform classical symbolic regression methods on complex or simulation-coupled tasks.</li>
                <li>Iterative feedback from simulation or data evaluation will enable LLMs to refine candidate laws to achieve high empirical fit and interpretability, even in OOD settings.</li>
                <li>LLM-based symbolic law discovery will be more sample- and compute-efficient than traditional evolutionary or brute-force symbolic regression approaches.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-driven pipelines may discover fundamentally new scientific laws or mechanisms not present in existing literature or datasets.</li>
                <li>The integration of LLMs with program synthesis and simulation feedback may enable autonomous discovery of cross-domain or multi-physics laws.</li>
                <li>LLM-driven symbolic law discovery may generalize to domains with highly nonlinear, stochastic, or partially observed systems, provided appropriate feedback mechanisms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-driven program synthesis pipelines fail to discover explicit symbolic laws that match or exceed baseline performance on complex or simulation-coupled tasks, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If iterative feedback does not improve the quality or generalizability of LLM-generated laws, the feedback loop law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLM-generated laws are consistently less interpretable or less accurate than those produced by classical symbolic regression, the theory's claims are weakened.</li>
