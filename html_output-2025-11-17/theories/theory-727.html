<ol>
    <li>LLMs are highly accurate on arithmetic facts that are common in their training data (e.g., single-digit addition, multiplication tables). </li>
    <li>Performance drops sharply for rare or out-of-distribution arithmetic queries. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Closely related to existing work on memorization in LLMs, but its explicit application to arithmetic is a focused extension.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Pattern completion and memorization are well-known properties of neural language models.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies these properties specifically to arithmetic, suggesting that most correct answers are due to memorization rather than computation.</p>
