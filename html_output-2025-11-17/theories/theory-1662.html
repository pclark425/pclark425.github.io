                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators for scientific subdomains is determined by the degree of epistemic alignment between the LLM's internal representations (as shaped by its training data and architecture) and the explicit and implicit knowledge structures of the target subdomain. High alignment enables accurate simulation, while misalignment leads to systematic errors or hallucinations.</p>

    <li>LLMs hallucinate plausible-sounding but incorrect facts in subdomains with sparse or misrepresented training data. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is fine-tuned on a subdomain's primary literature and ontologies, its simulation accuracy in that subdomain will increase.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is exposed to a synthetic corpus designed to epistemically align with a novel subdomain, it will achieve high simulation accuracy even with minimal real-world data.</li>
                <li>If epistemic alignment is measured quantitatively (e.g., via representational similarity analysis), it will correlate strongly with simulation accuracy across subdomains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM with low epistemic alignment to a subdomain achieves high simulation accuracy, this theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If increasing epistemic alignment (via data or architecture) does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Cases where LLMs perform well in subdomains with little explicit training data but high overlap in reasoning patterns. </li>
