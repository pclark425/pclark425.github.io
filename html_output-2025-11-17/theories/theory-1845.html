                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented and Ensemble Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can most accurately estimate the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries when they (1) augment their internal knowledge with targeted retrieval of up-to-date, high-novelty external information, and (2) employ ensemble reasoning—aggregating multiple, diverse chains of thought, including both consensus and outlier perspectives. The theory asserts that the combination of these two mechanisms enables LLMs to overcome limitations of static training data and single-path reasoning, thereby improving their predictive accuracy for scientific breakthroughs.</p>
