                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Automated discovery systems evaluated on fixed benchmarks exhibit a characteristic performance trajectory: initial rapid improvement (incremental discoveries), followed by saturation where further improvements require transformational changes to the system or benchmark. However, benchmark saturation alone is insufficient to characterize discoveries as transformational or incremental. The relationship between benchmark performance and genuine discovery depends critically on: (1) whether the benchmark tests memorization vs. generalization, (2) whether performance transfers to out-of-distribution scenarios, (3) whether the benchmark has objective ground truth vs. proxy metrics, and (4) whether validation extends beyond computational benchmarks to experimental/real-world validation. Systems achieving near-perfect performance on well-designed benchmarks with strong OOD generalization are more likely to represent transformational capabilities, while those saturating benchmarks through memorization or overfitting represent incremental progress at best.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems approaching 100% performance on established benchmarks are at risk of overfitting to benchmark-specific features rather than discovering general principles, unless accompanied by strong out-of-distribution generalization.</li>
                <li>Benchmark saturation creates pressure to develop new, harder benchmarks that better distinguish incremental from transformational capabilities, as evidenced by the creation of custom benchmarks to avoid memorization.</li>
                <li>The transformational characterization of a system should be based on: (1) performance across multiple diverse benchmarks, (2) out-of-distribution generalization, (3) transfer to real-world validation, and (4) ability to produce interpretable, verifiable outputs.</li>
                <li>Systems that achieve high performance through memorization of training data (detectable via perplexity analysis, lack of OOD generalization, or failure on novel benchmark variants) should not be characterized as making transformational discoveries.</li>
                <li>The gap between benchmark performance and real-world validation increases as benchmarks become saturated, particularly when benchmarks use proxy metrics rather than direct experimental validation.</li>
                <li>Benchmark design quality critically affects saturation dynamics: well-designed benchmarks with diverse test cases, OOD evaluation, and anti-memorization features better distinguish genuine discovery from overfitting.</li>
                <li>Cross-benchmark validation (testing on multiple independent benchmarks for the same capability) provides stronger evidence for transformational vs incremental characterization than single-benchmark saturation.</li>
                <li>The rate of performance improvement on benchmarks follows a characteristic curve: rapid initial gains (incremental improvements), followed by diminishing returns as saturation approaches, with transformational advances required to break through saturation plateaus.</li>
            </ol>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems that saturate one benchmark will show degraded performance on newly designed benchmarks that test the same underlying capabilities in different ways, with the degree of degradation inversely proportional to the generality of the learned principles.</li>
                <li>The rate of benchmark saturation will accelerate as more powerful automated systems are developed, requiring continuous benchmark innovation and increasingly sophisticated anti-memorization techniques.</li>
                <li>Systems with high benchmark performance but poor out-of-distribution generalization are likely memorizing rather than discovering principles, and this can be detected through systematic OOD testing and perplexity analysis.</li>
                <li>Benchmarks that include explicit OOD test sets and anti-memorization design will show larger performance gaps between incremental and transformational systems than traditional benchmarks.</li>
                <li>Systems achieving >95% performance on well-designed benchmarks with strong OOD generalization are more likely to produce discoveries that validate in real-world applications than systems with similar in-distribution performance but weak OOD generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exist 'universal benchmarks' that cannot be saturated without genuine transformational discovery, or whether all benchmarks are eventually vulnerable to sophisticated memorization and overfitting strategies.</li>
                <li>Whether benchmark saturation in one domain (e.g., protein structure prediction) predicts saturation timelines in related domains (e.g., RNA structure prediction, protein-ligand binding), or whether domain-specific factors dominate.</li>
                <li>Whether the memorization-vs-discovery distinction can be reliably detected through benchmark performance alone, or whether it fundamentally requires external validation through real-world experiments or novel problem instances.</li>
                <li>Whether automated systems can be designed to self-detect when they are memorizing vs discovering, and whether such self-awareness would enable more reliable characterization of incremental vs transformational capabilities.</li>
                <li>Whether the relationship between benchmark saturation and real-world discovery impact follows predictable patterns across scientific domains, or whether each domain requires domain-specific validation approaches.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding systems that saturate benchmarks through memorization but still make genuine transformational discoveries (validated through independent experimental work) would challenge the theory's core premise about memorization vs discovery.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that benchmark performance perfectly predicts real-world discovery impact across multiple domains would contradict the theory's claim about the benchmark-reality gap.</li>
                <li>Showing that out-of-distribution performance does not decline after benchmark saturation would question the overfitting concern and suggest saturation reflects genuine mastery.</li>
                <li>Finding cases where systems with poor benchmark performance make transformational discoveries would challenge the theory's assumption that benchmark performance is a useful signal.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that benchmark design quality has no effect on the memorization-vs-discovery distinction would undermine the theory's emphasis on benchmark design.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of benchmark design quality in determining saturation dynamics and the memorization-vs-discovery distinction </li>
    <li>How benchmark diversity and cross-benchmark validation affect the reliability of transformational vs incremental characterizations </li>
    <li>The interaction between benchmark saturation and system architecture (e.g., whether certain architectures are more prone to memorization) </li>
    <li>The temporal dynamics of benchmark saturation (how quickly different types of systems saturate different types of benchmarks) </li>
    <li>The relationship between computational benchmark performance and experimental validation success rates across different scientific domains </li>
