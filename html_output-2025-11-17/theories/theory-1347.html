                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Self-Reflection and Adaptive Strategy Formation in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, through repeated generate-then-reflect cycles, develop a hierarchical structure of self-reflective processes. At each level, the LLM not only corrects surface-level errors but also adapts its strategies for reflection and correction, leading to the emergence of higher-order meta-cognitive abilities and adaptive learning behaviors.</p>
