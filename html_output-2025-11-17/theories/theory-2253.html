                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires the alignment of multiple, distinct evaluative dimensions—such as factual accuracy, logical coherence, novelty, predictive power, and ethical considerations—each of which can be independently assessed and weighted. The overall evaluation is a function of the alignment and interaction among these dimensions, rather than a unidimensional or sequential process.</p>

    <li>Meta-analyses of scientific review processes show that different reviewers may emphasize different criteria, but all major frameworks include multiple dimensions. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While weighted scoring exists, the explicit modeling of alignment among dimensions as a factor in aggregation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Weighted aggregation is used in some evaluation settings, but the explicit focus on alignment and the function governing aggregation is not formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the aggregation as a function of both weights and the degree of alignment (i.e., how well the dimensions cohere or reinforce each other).</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new evaluation dimension (e.g., interpretability) is added and weighted highly, overall evaluation outcomes will shift, even if other scores remain constant.</li>
                <li>If two theories are equally accurate but one is more novel, the one with higher novelty will be rated higher if novelty is weighted more in the aggregation function.</li>
                <li>If evaluators are instructed to ignore a dimension, the overall evaluation will become less sensitive to that aspect, potentially missing critical flaws.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluators disagree on the relative importance (weights) of dimensions, the alignment function may predict increased variance in overall scores, potentially leading to lower consensus.</li>
                <li>If a theory scores highly on all but one dimension (e.g., ethical risk), the overall evaluation may be nonlinearly penalized, depending on the alignment function's sensitivity to outlier dimensions.</li>
                <li>If new, unforeseen dimensions emerge (e.g., societal impact), the theory predicts that evaluation frameworks will need to adapt by incorporating and aligning these new dimensions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluators consistently ignore one dimension (e.g., novelty) and it does not affect overall scores, the theory's claim of multidimensional alignment is challenged.</li>
                <li>If overall evaluation outcomes are identical regardless of how dimensions are weighted or aligned, the theory's aggregation law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If a single-criterion evaluation (e.g., accuracy-only) produces results indistinguishable from multidimensional evaluation, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The influence of social or political factors on evaluation outcomes is not explicitly modeled. </li>
    <li>The possibility that some dimensions are not truly independent, but interact in complex, nonlinear ways, is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes existing practices into a formal explanatory and predictive framework, which is not present in the literature.</p>
