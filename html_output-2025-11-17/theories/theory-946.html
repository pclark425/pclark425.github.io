                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents: General Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the utility of memory for LLM agents in text games is fundamentally determined by the structure of the task, including its temporal dependencies, state observability, and the degree of partial observability. The theory asserts that optimal memory strategies are not universal, but must be adapted to the specific demands of the task structure, with memory being most beneficial in tasks with long-term dependencies, high partial observability, or non-Markovian state transitions.</p>
