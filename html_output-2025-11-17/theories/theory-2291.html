                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Actionable Feedback as a Necessary Condition for Iterative Evaluation Improvement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that actionable feedback is a necessary precondition for the iterative improvement of evaluation protocols for LLM-generated scientific theories. Without actionable feedback, evaluation processes stagnate, failing to adapt to new types of errors or omissions introduced by LLMs. The theory further asserts that the presence of actionable feedback enables evaluators to systematically identify, address, and reduce evaluation blind spots over successive iterations.</p>

            <ol>
