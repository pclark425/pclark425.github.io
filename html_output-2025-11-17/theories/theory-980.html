                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Compression Theory for LLM Agent Memory in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal memory usage in text games by dynamically selecting, compressing, and prioritizing information based on contextual relevance to current and anticipated goals. The agent's memory system acts as an adaptive filter, retaining only information that is likely to influence future decision-making, thereby maximizing efficiency and minimizing distraction or overload.</p>
