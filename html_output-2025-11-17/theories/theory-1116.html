                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory: General Capacity-Complexity Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models exhibit a sharp, emergent threshold in their ability to perform strict logical reasoning, determined by the interplay between the model's internal representational capacity and the logical complexity of the task or prompt. Below this threshold, reasoning is reliable and systematic; above it, performance degrades rapidly and unpredictably. The threshold is not a smooth function but an emergent property arising from the collective behavior of the model's parameters and training data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For any LLM, there exists a measurable logical complexity threshold above which performance on strict logical reasoning tasks drops sharply.</li>
                <li>Increasing model capacity (parameters, data, or training steps) will raise the threshold, enabling more complex reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hybrid models (e.g., LLMs with symbolic modules) may exhibit multiple or shifted thresholds.</li>
                <li>Thresholds may be modulated by architectural innovations (e.g., attention mechanisms, memory augmentation) in unpredictable ways.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model can perform strict logical reasoning on tasks far above its predicted threshold, the law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If performance degrades smoothly rather than abruptly, the threshold hypothesis is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models show inconsistent performance near the threshold, possibly due to stochasticity or training artifacts. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
