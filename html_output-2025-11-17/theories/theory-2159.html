                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Abstraction and Consensus Formation in LLM-Based Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when guided by mission-focused instructions, perform theory distillation through a process of hierarchical abstraction—first extracting low-level facts and relationships, then synthesizing mid-level patterns, and finally abstracting high-level, consensus scientific laws. The process is iterative and consensus-driven, allowing the LLM to reconcile conflicting evidence and produce robust, generalizable theories.</p>
