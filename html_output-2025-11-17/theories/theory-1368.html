                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Internal Representation Alignment through Reflective Re-encoding</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that during generate-then-reflect cycles, language models internally re-encode their own outputs, aligning their latent representations with higher-level task objectives. Reflection acts as a mechanism for the model to reconcile discrepancies between its initial output and the desired answer, leading to a progressive alignment of internal states with external feedback, even in the absence of explicit gradient updates.</p>

                <li>If answer quality does not improve despite changes in internal representations, the link between alignment and performance is called into question.</li>
