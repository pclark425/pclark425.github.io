                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Functional Stable Coactivation Criterion for Concept Individuation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that a concept is functionally individuated by the presence of a stable, recurring pattern of coactivation across multiple cognitive tasks and contexts. The representational format is defined not by the specific neural substrate, but by the reproducibility and functional stability of coactivation patterns that uniquely identify a concept, regardless of sensory modality or task demands. This criterion allows for cross-modal and cross-task generalization, and provides a functional, rather than anatomical, basis for concept individuation.</p>

    <li>Concept decoding is possible across visual, auditory, and linguistic tasks, indicating a modality-independent functional pattern. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law extends existing ideas of amodal representation by formalizing the functional stability criterion.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cross-modal generalization is discussed in the context of amodal semantic hubs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between functional stability and individuation, and the criterion for generalization, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Concepts with highly stable coactivation patterns will be more robust to task and modality changes.</li>
                <li>Disruption of stable coactivation patterns (e.g., via TMS) will impair concept access across multiple tasks.</li>
                <li>Concepts lacking stable coactivation patterns will show poor generalization across modalities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial neural networks trained to maximize coactivation stability will develop human-like concept individuation.</li>
                <li>Concepts with inherently unstable or context-dependent coactivation patterns may resist individuation, leading to fuzzy or overlapping conceptual boundaries.</li>
                <li>Developmental changes in coactivation stability may predict the emergence of new concepts in children.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be individuated without any stable coactivation pattern, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If stable coactivation patterns do not predict concept generalization across tasks or modalities, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If different concepts share identical stable coactivation patterns, the individuation criterion would fail.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how coactivation patterns are initially formed or how stability is achieved. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain how concepts with overlapping features are functionally separated. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory formalizes a functional, rather than anatomical, criterion for concept individuation, extending distributed representation theories.</p>
