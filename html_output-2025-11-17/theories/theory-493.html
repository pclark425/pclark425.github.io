                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Scaling and Prompting Limitations Law for Strict Logical Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that increasing language model size and using chain-of-thought or self-consistency prompting alone are insufficient to achieve robust, faithful, and deep logical reasoning. While scaling and prompting can yield improvements on shallow or pattern-matched tasks, their benefits saturate or diminish for multi-step, compositional, or out-of-distribution logical reasoning. Robust logical reasoning requires architectural, training, or neuro-symbolic interventions beyond mere scale or prompting.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Gopher scaling analysis shows that performance scaling with model size on logic-based tasks is significantly worse than for other natural language tasks; even the largest 280B model performed only 13.6% above chance on average across 38 multi-choice logic tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3503.html#e3503.5" class="evidence-link">[e3503.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-LogiEval shows that average accuracy falls from ~68% at depth-1 to ~43% at depth-5 for classical and non-classical logic, even for top proprietary models (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, etc.). <a href="../results/extraction-result-3430.html#e3430.7" class="evidence-link">[e3430.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Open-source models (e.g., Orca-2-13B, Yi-34B) show depth-dependent decline, and larger size does not guarantee better performance on deep logic tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3430.html#e3430.4" class="evidence-link">[e3430.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3430.html#e3430.5" class="evidence-link">[e3430.5]</a> </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Chain-of-thought and self-consistency prompting yield large gains for arithmetic and shallow reasoning, but performance on deep or OOD logic tasks remains limited (e.g., PaLM-540B CoT on GSM8K: 56.5% -> self-consistency 74.4%, but on Multi-LogiEval, accuracy drops sharply with depth). <a href="../results/extraction-result-3513.html#e3513.0" class="evidence-link">[e3513.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3430.html#e3430.7" class="evidence-link">[e3430.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Ablations show that prompt design and scale matter, but even with optimal prompting, deep logical reasoning is not achieved (e.g., Zero-shot-CoT improves accuracy on logical tasks but does not close the gap to neuro-symbolic or modular methods). <a href="../results/extraction-result-3537.html#e3537.5" class="evidence-link">[e3537.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3537.html#e3537.7" class="evidence-link">[e3537.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3438.html#e3438.0" class="evidence-link">[e3438.0]</a> </li>
    <li>CoT and self-consistency do not guarantee faithfulness or robustness; models can produce plausible but incorrect chains, and performance is sensitive to prompt and exemplar choice. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3438.html#e3438.0" class="evidence-link">[e3438.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3438.html#e3438.2" class="evidence-link">[e3438.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3523.html#e3523.6" class="evidence-link">[e3523.6]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new, larger LLM is trained without architectural or neuro-symbolic interventions, its performance on deep or multi-step logical reasoning tasks will plateau or increase only marginally compared to smaller models.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought or self-consistency prompting is applied to a base LLM on a new deep logic benchmark, accuracy will improve over direct prompting but will not reach the levels of modular or neuro-symbolic systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new pretraining objective or data regime is developed that specifically targets logical reasoning, it is unknown whether scaling alone could then yield robust deep logical reasoning.</li>
                <li>If a new prompting paradigm is invented that can elicit algorithmic reasoning from LLMs, it is unknown whether it could overcome the current limitations of scale and prompting.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a scaled-up LLM (e.g., >1T parameters) achieves near-perfect accuracy on deep, multi-step logical reasoning tasks without architectural or neuro-symbolic interventions, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought or self-consistency prompting alone enables robust, faithful, and deep logical reasoning on new benchmarks, the theory's claims would be weakened.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some open-source models (e.g., Mistral-7B) outperform larger models on deep logic tasks, suggesting that training data and architecture can sometimes compensate for lack of scale. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3430.html#e3430.3" class="evidence-link">[e3430.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Instruction tuning and targeted fine-tuning (e.g., LogicT5, Flan-T5-Large) can yield improvements on logic tasks, but the boundary between scale, data, and architecture is not always clear. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3412.html#e3412.6" class="evidence-link">[e3412.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3454.html#e3454.7" class="evidence-link">[e3454.7]</a> </li>
