                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Salience-Gated Memory Retrieval Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games should employ a memory retrieval mechanism that is dynamically gated by contextual relevance and salience, such that only the most pertinent memories (from both short- and long-term stores) are retrieved and used for decision-making at each step. The agent should learn to assign and update salience scores to memory traces based on task demands, recency, and predicted utility, enabling efficient and adaptive memory usage.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Salience-gated retrieval may lead to catastrophic forgetting if important but low-salience memories are pruned too aggressively.</li>
                <li>Emergent behaviors such as memory chunking or meta-memory strategies may arise in agents with adaptive salience updating.</li>
                <li>Agents may develop implicit strategies for memory compression or abstraction not explicitly programmed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with uniform memory retrieval perform as well as those with salience-gated retrieval, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If adaptive salience updating does not improve performance in non-stationary or complex text games, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If agents with salience-gated retrieval consistently miss critical information, the theory's assumptions about salience assignment would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of memory interference or false salience assignment is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for handling conflicting or ambiguous salience signals. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
