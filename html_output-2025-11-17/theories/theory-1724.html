                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven List Pattern and Distributional Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can detect anomalies in lists by modeling the expected statistical and semantic distributions of items, leveraging their exposure to large-scale data. By comparing the observed distribution of list items to learned priors, LLMs can flag items or patterns that deviate significantly from expected norms, even in the absence of explicit relational or external reference information.</p>
