                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM Literature-Driven Feature Rule Synthesis in Molecular Sciences</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to vast corpora of molecular science literature, can autonomously extract, abstract, and synthesize both qualitative and quantitative feature–property rules. These rules relate molecular features (such as functional groups, topology, or electronic structure) to experimentally measured or computed properties (e.g., reactivity, solubility, thermodynamics), enabling the generation of new, testable scientific laws and predictive models. The process leverages the LLM's ability to integrate heterogeneous, distributed, and sometimes implicit knowledge from the literature, surpassing traditional manual curation and rule derivation.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to extract and recombine scientific relationships from text, including in chemistry and materials science. </li>
    <li>Feature–property relationships are often described in literature in both explicit and implicit forms. </li>
    <li>Manual curation of such rules is labor-intensive and limited in scope. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While LLMs are used for information extraction, their use for autonomous abstraction and formalization of scientific rules is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs have been shown to extract relationships and knowledge from scientific text, and feature–property relationships are a core focus in molecular sciences.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law proposes that LLMs can autonomously abstract and formalize these relationships as scientific rules, not just extract them.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have been used to extract and recombine numerical relationships from scientific text. </li>
    <li>Quantitative feature–property equations are often derived from curated datasets, but literature contains a broader range of such data. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover new molecular features or descriptors relevant to property prediction that are not currently used in the field.</li>
                <li>LLM-synthesized rules may reveal non-linear or higher-order feature interactions not captured by current models.</li>
                <li>LLMs may uncover cross-domain feature–property relationships (e.g., linking electronic structure to biological activity) that are not currently recognized.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate accurate or novel feature–property rules from literature, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLM-extracted rules do not generalize to new molecular classes, the theory's generalizability claim would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently misinterpret or hallucinate relationships, the theory's validity would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of inconsistent or incomplete reporting of feature–property data in literature on LLM-synthesized rules is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential biases in the literature (e.g., overrepresentation of certain molecular classes) may affect the generality of LLM-derived rules. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is somewhat related to existing work in LLM-based information extraction and property prediction, but the direct, literature-driven synthesis and formalization of scientific rules is a novel integration.</p>
