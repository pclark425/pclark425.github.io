                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Attention Redistribution Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to reflect, dynamically redistribute their internal attention and representational resources. Reflection prompts act as meta-instructions, causing the model to reweight previously under-attended knowledge and reasoning paths, thereby enabling the surfacing of relevant but initially overlooked information.</p>
