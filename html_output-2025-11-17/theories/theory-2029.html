                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bilevel LLM-Simulation Theory of Quantitative Law Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be organized in a bilevel architecture to distill quantitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers. The first level extracts and structures candidate quantitative relationships and relevant variables from text, while the second level simulates scientific reasoning processes—such as hypothesis generation, model comparison, and validation—across the extracted data to formalize robust, generalizable quantitative laws.</p>
