                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1799</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) equipped with retrieval mechanisms can synthesize internal knowledge and external evidence to generate probabilistic forecasts about future scientific discoveries. The LLM's internal representations serve as a prior, while retrieved evidence acts as an updating mechanism, enabling the model to reason about likelihoods in a manner analogous to—but not limited by—Bayesian inference. The theory further asserts that the quality and diversity of retrieved evidence, as well as the LLM's reasoning architecture, fundamentally determine the accuracy and calibration of its probabilistic outputs.</p>
