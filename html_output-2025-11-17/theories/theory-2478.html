                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Topology-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position within the mesoscale connectivity topology of the cortical network. Neurons that serve as hubs, bridges, or bottlenecks in the network are more exposed to trans-synaptic spread of pathological proteins and are subject to higher cumulative synaptic input, making them more susceptible to pathology.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity of a neuron (e.g., via optogenetic synaptogenesis) will increase its vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Rewiring the network to reduce bottlenecks will alter the spatial pattern of pathology accumulation.</li>
                <li>Hub neurons with enhanced proteostasis mechanisms may resist pathology despite high connectivity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If hub or bridge neurons do not show increased vulnerability or do not facilitate pathology spread, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If pathology spreads independently of network topology, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If altering network topology does not affect vulnerability patterns, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with high connectivity may remain resistant due to intrinsic molecular defenses. </li>
    <li>Pathology may also be influenced by local glial environment or vascular factors not captured by network topology. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
