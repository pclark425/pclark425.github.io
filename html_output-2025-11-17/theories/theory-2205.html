                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the quality and reliability of scientific theories generated by large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally determined by the dynamic coupling between the generative process of the LLM and the evaluative processes (human or automated) that assess, filter, and refine these outputs. The theory asserts that effective evaluation is not a static, post-hoc activity, but an interactive, iterative process that shapes the generative trajectory of the LLM, leading to emergent properties in the resulting scientific theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is coupled with a real-time, interactive evaluator (human or automated), the resulting scientific theories will be more accurate and robust than those generated in a single-pass, evaluation-after-generation mode.</li>
                <li>Increasing the frequency and depth of evaluator feedback during LLM generation will correlate with higher scientific validity of the output.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Emergent properties such as creativity or paradigm shifts may arise from tightly coupled LLM-evaluator systems, potentially exceeding the capabilities of either alone.</li>
                <li>There may exist optimal coupling regimes (e.g., feedback frequency, granularity) that maximize theory novelty without sacrificing validity, but the location of these optima is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-generated theories evaluated only post-hoc (without iterative feedback) are as valid and novel as those generated with tightly coupled evaluation, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If increasing evaluator-LLM coupling does not improve theory quality, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs generate valid scientific theories without any evaluator intervention (e.g., by chance or due to pretraining). </li>
