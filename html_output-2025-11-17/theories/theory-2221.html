                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative, Human-in-the-Loop, and Self-Refining Evaluation Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust and accurate when conducted through an iterative process that combines automated metrics, structured human feedback, and self-refinement cycles. The process leverages the complementary strengths of LLMs (speed, breadth, consistency) and human experts (domain knowledge, intuition, critical reasoning) to converge on more reliable and insightful scientific assessments. The theory further asserts that the evaluation process itself can be adaptively improved over time by learning from discrepancies between automated and human judgments.</p>
