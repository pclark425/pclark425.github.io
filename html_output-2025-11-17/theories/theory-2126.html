                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Modular Orchestration Theory (HMOT) of LLM-driven Scientific Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can most effectively distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by orchestrating a hybrid, modular workflow. In this workflow, LLMs decompose the distillation process into specialized modules (e.g., retrieval, summarization, abstraction, synthesis, validation), each optimized for a sub-task, and coordinate their outputs through explicit orchestration mechanisms. The theory asserts that such modular orchestration, when guided by explicit scientific reasoning objectives and feedback loops, enables the emergence of higher-level, novel scientific theories that are both faithful to the literature and capable of generalization.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated improved performance when tasks are broken into subtasks, e.g., chain-of-thought prompting, tool use, and modular pipelines in scientific NLP. </li>
    <li>Complex scientific reasoning requires different cognitive operations (retrieval, abstraction, synthesis) that are not optimally performed by a monolithic model. </li>
    <li>Human scientific workflows are often modular, with different experts or tools handling different stages of theory development. </li>
