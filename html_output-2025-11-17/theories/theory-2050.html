                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill quantitative laws from scholarly literature by combining symbolic reasoning (e.g., equation parsing, variable mapping) with statistical inference (e.g., regression, parameter estimation), allowing for robust extraction and validation of scientific laws even in the presence of noisy or incomplete data.</p>
