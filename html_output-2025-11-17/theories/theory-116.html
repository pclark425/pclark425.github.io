                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-as-Probabilistic-World-Model Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large Language Models can serve as effective probabilistic world models for text-based planning when three conditions are met: (1) uncertainty is explicitly quantified through multiple sampling (typically 5-10 samples) and aggregated into confidence scores or belief distributions, (2) the LLM world model is embedded within a principled planning algorithm (MCTS, SMC, or probabilistic programming) that can handle stochastic transitions, and (3) rewards or objectives combine LLM-derived confidence with task-specific signals. This approach is most effective for domains requiring commonsense knowledge, spatial reasoning, or semantic understanding where formal symbolic models are unavailable or incomplete. However, LLMs as world models have critical limitations: they are unreliable for deterministic single-step state prediction (achieving only ~68-70% accuracy), require structured search to overcome prediction errors, and need additional scaffolding (grammar constraints, code execution, or iterative correction) for reliable operation. The key insight is that LLMs provide useful probabilistic priors and transition distributions when properly sampled and integrated into planning, but should not be used for direct deterministic simulation. Performance scales with: (a) number of samples used for uncertainty quantification, (b) quality of the planning algorithm, (c) availability of verification mechanisms, and (d) domain alignment with LLM training data.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs sampled multiple times (typically 5-10 samples) provide more reliable world models than single samples, with confidence quantified by sample agreement</li>
                <li>LLM world models should be embedded in principled planning algorithms (MCTS with UCT, SMC with importance weighting, or probabilistic programs) rather than used for direct simulation</li>
                <li>Confidence scores derived from multiple LLM samples (e.g., proportion of most frequent output) correlate with prediction accuracy and should inform planning decisions</li>
                <li>LLMs achieve only 68-70% accuracy on deterministic single-step state prediction but can achieve >90% success when integrated with planning algorithms</li>
                <li>Combining LLM-derived probabilistic beliefs with structured search (MCTS, SMC) overcomes individual prediction errors through exploration and backpropagation</li>
                <li>LLM world models are most valuable for domains requiring commonsense knowledge, spatial reasoning, or semantic understanding unavailable in formal models</li>
                <li>Performance of LLM world models scales with: (a) number of samples for uncertainty quantification, (b) quality of planning algorithm, (c) availability of verification mechanisms</li>
                <li>Grammar constraints or code execution can improve LLM world model reliability by enforcing structural validity</li>
                <li>LLM world models require explicit uncertainty quantification mechanisms (sampling, confidence scores, importance weights) to be effective</li>
                <li>Action likelihood (log-probability) from LLMs provides useful heuristic guidance but is insufficient alone for reliable planning</li>
