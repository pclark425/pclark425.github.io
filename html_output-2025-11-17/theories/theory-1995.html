                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1995</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Discovery via Cross-Document Relational Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when trained or prompted to synthesize across multiple biomedical abstracts, can discover emergent gene–disease association laws that are not present in any single document but arise from the cross-document relational structure. The LLM's ability to align, compare, and integrate evidence from disparate sources enables the abstraction of higher-order association laws, including those involving indirect, multi-step, or conditional relationships.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will identify gene–disease associations that are not present in any single abstract but are supported by multi-step evidence across multiple abstracts.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to synthesize association laws involving complex, higher-order relationships (e.g., gene–gene–disease triads) that are not explicitly described in any document.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially identify novel therapeutic targets by abstracting indirect gene–disease associations from distributed evidence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to abstract emergent association laws from cross-document evidence, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot synthesize indirect associations despite the presence of multi-step relational paths, the indirect association synthesis law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Associations that require integration of non-textual data (e.g., figures, tables) are not accounted for by the theory. </li>
    <li>Emergent associations that depend on domain-specific background knowledge not present in the corpus may be missed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on multi-hop reasoning, the theory formalizes emergent law abstraction as a predictable property of LLM-driven synthesis.</p>
