                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Preference-Hard Negative Feedback Loop for Logical Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that robust multi-step logical reasoning in language models emerges from an iterative feedback loop: preference optimization guides the model toward preferred (logically valid) reasoning chains, while hard negative sampling continuously challenges the model with new, more difficult incorrect chains. This dynamic process creates a curriculum that adapts to the model's current weaknesses, driving continual improvement in logical discrimination and reasoning depth.</p>

                <li>The process may induce phase transitions in reasoning ability, where sudden leaps in logical competence occur.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative hard negative generation does not improve logical reasoning over static hard negatives, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the feedback loop leads to catastrophic forgetting or instability, the theory's assumptions about continual improvement are undermined.</li>
                <li>If models trained with this method do not outperform those trained with only preference optimization or only adversarial data, the theory is weakened.</li>

    <li>The role of external knowledge and world models in logical reasoning is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of model architecture and scale on the effectiveness of the feedback loop is not specified. </li>
