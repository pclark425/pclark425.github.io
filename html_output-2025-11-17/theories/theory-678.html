                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Actionable Feedback as a Necessary Condition for Iterative Evaluation Improvement</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that in iterative refinement protocols for LLM-generated scientific theories (such as SELF-REFINE and self-critique & revise), the presence of actionable, specific feedback is a necessary (not merely sufficient) condition for significant improvement in output quality. The magnitude of improvement in evaluation quality is monotonically correlated with the specificity and actionability of the feedback provided. Generic or absent feedback leads to minimal or no improvement, and in some cases, can even degrade performance. This theory is supported by ablation studies and empirical results across multiple domains, but may have exceptions in tasks with highly objective, automated ground truth.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Ablation studies in SELF-REFINE show that actionable feedback yields the largest improvements in refinement and evaluation quality, while generic or absent feedback leads to smaller or no gains. For example, in code optimization, actionable feedback led to 27.5% improvement, generic to 26.0%, and no feedback to 24.8%. In sentiment reversal, actionable feedback led to 43.2%, generic to 31.2%, and no feedback to 0%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6122.html#e6122.4" class="evidence-link">[e6122.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Self-critique & revise protocols in LLMs (PaLM-2 on TruthfulQA) show that iterative self-critique and revision, which is inherently actionable, consistently improves accuracy and calibration over non-iterative or non-actionable approaches. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6157.html#e6157.11" class="evidence-link">[e6157.11]</a> </li>
    <li>Iteration-wise improvement analysis in SELF-REFINE shows that most gains occur in early iterations with actionable feedback, and that improvements plateau or reverse when feedback is not actionable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6122.html#e6122.5" class="evidence-link">[e6122.5]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While prior work has empirically demonstrated the benefit of actionable feedback, the necessity and monotonicity of this relationship is newly formalized here as a law.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Empirical ablations have shown that actionable feedback is beneficial for iterative improvement in LLM outputs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes that actionable feedback is a necessary (not just sufficient) condition for significant improvement in iterative evaluation, and that generic or absent feedback is insufficient.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If generic or absent feedback yields equal or greater improvement than actionable feedback in iterative protocols, the actionable feedback necessity law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If the correlation between feedback quality and improvement is not monotonic (e.g., generic feedback sometimes outperforms actionable feedback), the feedback quality-improvement correlation law would be challenged.</li>
