                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when equipped with retrieval and iterative self-consistency checking, can autonomously validate and refine candidate qualitative laws by comparing them against retrieved evidence and their own prior outputs, leading to a convergence on self-consistent, evidence-supported laws.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with self-consistency checking do not outperform those without in law distillation, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If convergence does not occur or leads to incorrect laws, the convergence law would be called into question.</li>
