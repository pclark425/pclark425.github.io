                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance and Temporal Abstraction Theory for LLM Agent Memory in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents should structure their memory around contextual relevance and temporal abstraction. By dynamically prioritizing memories based on their relevance to the current context and abstracting over time to form higher-level representations, agents can efficiently solve tasks that require both immediate recall and long-term planning.</p>
