                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bidirectional Learning Progress with Reweighting Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This specific theory proposes that optimal curriculum learning in compositional environments requires dynamically combining and reweighting two complementary progress signals: forward learning progress (FLP) and backward learning progress (BLP). Forward learning progress measures the rate of skill acquisition when building from mastered prerequisites toward more complex skills, capturing bottom-up learning momentum. Backward learning progress measures the rate at which goal-relevant skill gaps are being closed, capturing top-down goal-driven learning. The theory proposes that curriculum priority P(T) for task T should be computed as P(T) = α(t)·FLP(T) + (1-α(t))·BLP(T), where α(t) is a dynamic reweighting parameter that shifts based on learning phase, goal proximity, and progress stagnation. The reweighting function α(t) should increase (favoring forward progress) when: (1) the agent is far from goal competence, (2) forward progress is high and backward progress is low, or (3) goal tasks are too difficult to provide meaningful learning signal. Conversely, α(t) should decrease (favoring backward progress) when: (1) the agent approaches goal competence, (2) forward progress stagnates while goals remain unachieved, or (3) clear skill gaps for goal achievement are identified. This bidirectional approach with dynamic reweighting prevents both aimless exploration (pure forward) and premature specialization (pure backward), enabling efficient compositional learning.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Curriculum priority should be computed as a weighted combination of forward learning progress (FLP) and backward learning progress (BLP): P(T) = α(t)·FLP(T) + (1-α(t))·BLP(T).</li>
                <li>Forward learning progress FLP(T) for task T measures the rate of competence improvement on T relative to recent training history, capturing bottom-up learning momentum.</li>
                <li>Backward learning progress BLP(T) for task T measures how much training on T reduces the skill gap for achieving target goals, capturing top-down goal relevance.</li>
                <li>The reweighting parameter α(t) should be dynamic and context-dependent, not fixed throughout training.</li>
                <li>α(t) should increase (favor forward progress) when the agent is far from goal competence, as broad skill building is more important than goal-specific training.</li>
                <li>α(t) should decrease (favor backward progress) when the agent approaches goal competence but has not yet achieved it, as goal-directed refinement becomes more important.</li>
                <li>α(t) should increase when forward progress is high but backward progress is low, indicating productive exploration that should be encouraged.</li>
                <li>α(t) should decrease when forward progress stagnates while goals remain unachieved, indicating the need for goal-directed focus.</li>
                <li>α(t) should increase when goal tasks are too difficult to provide meaningful learning signal, as attempting them would be unproductive.</li>
                <li>The bidirectional approach prevents aimless exploration (pure forward, α=1) and premature specialization (pure backward, α=0).</li>
                <li>Tasks with high combined priority P(T) should receive more training samples or longer training time in the curriculum.</li>
                <li>The reweighting mechanism should be responsive to learning dynamics, updating α(t) based on recent progress measurements rather than fixed schedules.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Learning progress signals have been shown to be effective intrinsic motivation mechanisms for curriculum learning. </li>
    <li>Goal-conditioned learning and hindsight approaches demonstrate the value of backward reasoning from goals. </li>
    <li>Curriculum learning benefits from both prerequisite structure (forward) and goal relevance (backward). </li>
    <li>Dynamic task selection based on learning progress outperforms static curricula. </li>
    <li>Multi-objective optimization can balance competing learning objectives through dynamic weighting. </li>
    <li>Compositional task learning benefits from understanding both part-whole relationships (forward) and goal decomposition (backward). </li>
    <li>Learning can stagnate when curriculum is either too exploratory or too narrowly goal-focused. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bidirectional curricula with dynamic reweighting will achieve target goals faster than pure forward (prerequisite-driven) or pure backward (goal-driven) curricula.</li>
                <li>The optimal α(t) trajectory will show a general decreasing trend (more forward early, more backward late) but with local fluctuations based on progress dynamics.</li>
                <li>Tasks that score high on both FLP and BLP simultaneously will be particularly effective curriculum choices, as they combine learning momentum with goal relevance.</li>
                <li>In domains with clear prerequisite structure, α(t) will start higher (more forward-weighted) than in domains with flat skill structure.</li>
                <li>When multiple goals are present, the backward component will naturally balance attention across goals based on their skill gap profiles.</li>
                <li>Learning curves under bidirectional reweighting will show fewer plateaus than fixed-weight approaches, as the system can shift focus when progress stagnates.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal functional form for α(t) that works across different domains and task structures, or whether it must be domain-specific.</li>
                <li>Whether the bidirectional approach scales effectively to very large task spaces (thousands of tasks) where computing both FLP and BLP for all tasks may be computationally expensive.</li>
                <li>Whether the theory extends to continual learning settings where new goals are introduced after initial training, requiring re-calibration of the bidirectional balance.</li>
                <li>Whether human learners naturally employ a similar bidirectional reweighting strategy, and if so, whether the optimal α(t) dynamics match human learning patterns.</li>
                <li>Whether the approach can handle goals that require creative skill combinations not present in the prerequisite structure, where backward signals might be misleading.</li>
                <li>Whether there are task domains where pure forward or pure backward approaches are actually optimal, making bidirectional reweighting unnecessary or harmful.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If fixed α (no reweighting) performs as well as dynamic α(t), this would challenge the need for dynamic reweighting.</li>
                <li>If pure forward (α=1) or pure backward (α=0) curricula achieve goals as quickly as bidirectional approaches, this would undermine the core premise.</li>
                <li>If the optimal α(t) shows no systematic relationship to learning phase, goal proximity, or progress dynamics, this would invalidate the proposed reweighting rules.</li>
                <li>If random task selection performs comparably to bidirectional priority-based selection, this would question the value of computing FLP and BLP.</li>
                <li>If removing either the forward or backward component (using only one signal) shows no performance degradation, this would suggest one signal is redundant.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of computing and reweighting bidirectional signals outweighs the learning efficiency gains, this would limit practical applicability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the exact functional form for computing FLP(T) and BLP(T), leaving implementation details underspecified. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to initialize α(0) at the start of training when no progress history is available. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify the timescale or frequency at which α(t) should be updated (every episode, every batch, every epoch, etc.). </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle multiple competing goals with different priorities or importance weights. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle negative transfer, where training on high-priority tasks might interfere with previously learned skills. </li>
