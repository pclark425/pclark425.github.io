                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Knowledge Diffusion Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs estimate the likelihood of future scientific discoveries by modeling the diffusion of knowledge and the propagation of research trends across scientific communities. By tracking the emergence, spread, and convergence of concepts, LLMs can assign probabilities to discoveries based on the current state and velocity of knowledge diffusion.</p>
