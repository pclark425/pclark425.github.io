                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization (Functional Integration Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant emphasizes that the modal–amodal continuum is not just a property of individual concepts, but emerges from the functional integration of distributed brain systems. Conceptual knowledge arises from the coordinated activity of modality-specific (e.g., visual, motor) and amodal (e.g., prefrontal, anterior temporal) systems, with the degree of integration and the balance of modal/amodal content dynamically determined by current goals, context, and prior learning. This integration enables flexible, context-sensitive conceptual processing and supports both grounded and abstract reasoning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Functional connectivity between modal and amodal regions will increase during tasks requiring integration of perceptual and abstract features.</li>
                <li>Disruption of either modal or amodal regions will impair conceptual processing, especially when integration is required.</li>
                <li>Training that emphasizes integration (e.g., using both imagery and abstract reasoning) will enhance conceptual flexibility.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Individual differences in the ability to integrate modal and amodal features will predict conceptual creativity and problem-solving.</li>
                <li>Developmental changes in integration capacity will correlate with the emergence of abstract reasoning abilities.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks that implement dynamic integration will better model human conceptual flexibility.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If functional connectivity between modal and amodal regions does not change with task demands, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If conceptual processing can proceed normally with only modal or only amodal regions active, the integration hypothesis would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the precise neural mechanisms underlying dynamic integration. </li>
    <li>It is unclear how integration is initiated for novel or unfamiliar concepts. </li>
