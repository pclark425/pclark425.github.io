                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1793</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Forecasting Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by identifying 'information bottlenecks'—areas in the scientific literature where progress is constrained by missing, ambiguous, or highly-cited but unresolved concepts. The LLM's ability to model the flow of information and detect these bottlenecks allows it to assign higher probabilities to discoveries that would relieve such constraints, as these are historically the loci of major breakthroughs.</p>
