                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Latent Knowledge Extrapolation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by leveraging emergent latent knowledge representations and extrapolating from patterns of past scientific progress, as encoded in their internal weights. This enables LLMs to generalize beyond explicit statements and predict the likelihood of discoveries based on trends, analogies, and implicit cues.</p>
