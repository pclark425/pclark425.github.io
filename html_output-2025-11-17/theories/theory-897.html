                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Consolidation Law for Personalized Dialogue Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents should organize and consolidate memories in a hierarchical structure, where lower-level episodic memories are abstracted into higher-level semantic schemas based on their frequency, co-occurrence, and relevance to user goals. This enables efficient recall, generalization, and adaptation to evolving user needs.</p>
