                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextualized Conceptual Workspace Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is represented in brains as context-sensitive, dynamically-assembled 'workspaces' that integrate multiple representational formats (symbolic, analog, and sensory-motor) on demand. Rather than being stored in a fixed format, conceptual representations are constructed in real time by recruiting and binding relevant features, relations, and exemplars according to current goals and context. This enables flexible abstraction, rapid adaptation to novel situations, and the integration of perceptual, linguistic, and action-based information.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows task-dependent recruitment of different brain regions for the same concept depending on context (e.g., action vs. perception). </li>
    <li>Behavioral evidence indicates that conceptual representations are flexibly modulated by task demands and context. </li>
    <li>Patients with selective deficits (e.g., semantic dementia, apraxia) show context-dependent impairments in conceptual use. </li>
    <li>The Global Workspace Theory and related models posit dynamic assembly of information for conscious access. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While dynamic integration is discussed in consciousness and semantic models, the explicit claim that conceptual representations are always contextually constructed is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Global Workspace Theory and some models of semantic cognition propose dynamic integration of information.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law specifies that conceptual representations themselves are not fixed but are constructed on demand from multiple representational formats.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>fMRI studies show that the neural pattern for a concept (e.g., 'apple') changes depending on whether the context is eating, shopping, or drawing. </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and interference effects demonstrate that context modulates which features of a concept are accessed. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context effects are known, the explicit law-like statement that context drives feature recruitment in conceptual representation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context effects in semantic memory are well-documented; some models allow for context-dependent activation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the principle that context actively determines the feature composition of conceptual representations at the functional level.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The neural signature of a concept will systematically vary with task context, even for the same word or object.</li>
                <li>Patients with impaired context integration (e.g., frontal lobe damage) will show less flexible conceptual representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially manipulating context (e.g., via priming or virtual reality) will induce predictable shifts in the neural and behavioral expression of conceptual knowledge.</li>
                <li>Training AI systems to assemble conceptual representations on demand from multiple formats will yield more human-like flexibility and generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual representations are found to be fixed and invariant across contexts, this theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context manipulations do not alter the neural or behavioral expression of concepts, the theory's core claim would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The mechanisms by which the brain determines which features to recruit in novel or ambiguous contexts are not fully specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends prior work by making explicit, testable claims about the dynamic, context-driven assembly of conceptual representations.</p>
