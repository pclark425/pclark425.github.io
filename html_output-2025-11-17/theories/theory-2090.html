                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement via LLM-Guided Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill candidate quantitative laws from scholarly corpora, but can iteratively refine these laws by simulating hypothesis testing, error analysis, and cross-validation against additional data or studies. The LLM acts as a meta-analyst, proposing, testing, and updating quantitative laws in a manner analogous to the scientific method, thereby converging on more robust and generalizable laws over time.</p>
