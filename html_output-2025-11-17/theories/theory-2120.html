                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can distill scientific theories from large corpora by leveraging explicit and implicit constraints—such as logical consistency, empirical support, and domain ontologies—to filter, rank, and compose candidate theory statements. The process ensures that the resulting theories are coherent, empirically grounded, and interoperable with existing scientific knowledge structures.</p>
