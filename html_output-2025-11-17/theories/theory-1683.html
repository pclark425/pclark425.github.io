                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1683</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Load and Context Window Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is fundamentally constrained by the cognitive load imposed by the complexity and length of the simulation task relative to the model's effective context window and working memory. As the number of interacting entities, procedural steps, or required cross-references increases, simulation accuracy declines nonlinearly once the task exceeds the model's context or reasoning capacity.</p>

                <li>Increasing the context window of an LLM will improve simulation accuracy for longer or more complex scientific tasks, up to a point.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are augmented with external memory or retrieval mechanisms, simulation accuracy may scale with task complexity beyond current context window limits.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs maintain high simulation accuracy on tasks far exceeding their context window or entity complexity, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If simulation accuracy does not decline with increased procedural or entity complexity, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may use implicit summarization or abstraction to handle longer or more complex tasks than expected. </li>
