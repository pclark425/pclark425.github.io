                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Alignment and Compactness Principle for Graph-to-Text Representations (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximizes the alignment between the structural semantics of the graph and the linguistic semantics of the target text, while minimizing representational redundancy (compactness). The theory asserts that such representations enable more efficient and accurate learning by large language models, as they facilitate the transfer of relational and attribute information from the graph to the text domain in a manner that is both information-preserving and cognitively plausible.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that representations which closely mirror the semantic structure of the graph in the text (e.g., AMR-to-text, structured data-to-text) yield better performance in text generation and comprehension tasks. </li>
    <li>Compact representations reduce overfitting and improve model efficiency, as seen in neural machine translation and summarization literature. </li>
    <li>Overly verbose or redundant representations can lead to increased model confusion and lower generalization, as observed in ablation studies on data-to-text systems. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While alignment and compactness have been discussed separately, their joint optimization as a principle for ideal graph-to-text representations is not present in existing literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that semantic alignment and compactness individually improve model performance in various multimodal and structured-to-text tasks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation of a tradeoff law that jointly optimizes both alignment and compactness for graph-to-text representations is novel.</p>
