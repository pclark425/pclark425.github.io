                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Relational Pattern Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can detect anomalies in lists by learning and applying relational and structural patterns, not just statistical or semantic regularities. The LLM infers higher-order relationships (e.g., analogies, sequences, hierarchies) among list items and flags those that violate these inferred patterns, even when statistical or semantic cues are weak.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a list encodes a novel or abstract relational pattern not seen in training, the LLM's ability to detect anomalies will be unpredictable.</li>
                <li>If a list contains items that fit multiple overlapping relational patterns, the LLM may be uncertain or inconsistent in anomaly detection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the LLM fails to flag items that violate clear relational or hierarchical patterns, the theory's assumptions are challenged.</li>
                <li>If the LLM flags as anomalous items that fit the relational pattern, the theory's predictive power is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
