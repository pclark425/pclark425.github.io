                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Circuit Augmentation Theory of Arithmetic Fine-Tuning (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models acquire and refine arithmetic capabilities through the emergence and augmentation of specialized latent circuits during fine-tuning. These circuits are not explicitly programmed but arise from the model's internal representations, and are selectively strengthened or reconfigured when the model is exposed to arithmetic tasks. The theory asserts that arithmetic fine-tuning does not simply reinforce memorization, but actively reorganizes and augments the model's latent computational pathways to support generalizable arithmetic reasoning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Fine-tuning on arithmetic in one language (e.g., English) will induce latent circuit changes that partially transfer to arithmetic in another language (e.g., French), even if the numerals are different.</li>
                <li>There exists a threshold of model size below which latent circuit augmentation fails to generalize, resulting in brittle or non-systematic arithmetic performance.</li>
                <li>Latent circuit augmentation may enable transfer to related symbolic reasoning tasks beyond arithmetic, such as logic puzzles or algebra.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If fine-tuning on arithmetic does not result in any measurable change in the activation or connectivity of specific model components, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If models with no pre-existing emergent arithmetic ability can be fine-tuned to high performance without any observable circuit augmentation, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If ablation of putative arithmetic circuits does not impair arithmetic performance, the theory would be undermined.</li>
