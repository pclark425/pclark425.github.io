                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Iterative Distillation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models (LLMs), when combined with retrieval, multi-agent orchestration, and structured knowledge representations (such as knowledge graphs), enable the iterative distillation of qualitative scientific laws and heuristics from large scholarly corpora. This process is enhanced by integrating entity-centric knowledge stores, feedback/refinement loops, and human-aligned evaluation criteria, resulting in the surfacing of novel, cross-domain, and empirically grounded scientific rules and hypotheses.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Applying iterative retrieval-augmented LLM pipelines to new scientific domains (e.g., environmental science, economics) will yield more novel and cross-disciplinary hypotheses than direct LLM prompting.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative retrieval-augmented LLM pipelines do not outperform direct LLM prompting in novelty, clarity, or validity across multiple domains, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If cross-domain entity augmentation fails to increase the rate of non-trivial or creative hypotheses in controlled experiments, the cross-domain linkage law would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLM hallucination and over-reliance on pretraining corpus can still produce plausible but incorrect or ungrounded outputs, even with retrieval and feedback. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3787.html#e3787.0" class="evidence-link">[e3787.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3789.html#e3789.0" class="evidence-link">[e3789.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3629.html#e3629.3" class="evidence-link">[e3629.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3780.html#e3780.0" class="evidence-link">[e3780.0]</a> </li>
