                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Providing large language models with detailed, algorithmic prompting that specifies step-by-step instructions enables them to learn and execute arithmetic algorithms more effectively than few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting alone. This approach reduces systematic errors and improves out-of-distribution generalization on arithmetic tasks. Additionally, the effectiveness of algorithmic prompting is influenced by factors such as training data composition, data representation formats, and prompt optimization techniques. Iterative and feedback-based prompting methods further enhance error correction and reasoning robustness. While algorithmic prompting significantly improves arithmetic performance, it may not fully replace external tool integration for all complex arithmetic tasks. Emerging evidence also suggests that algorithmic prompting strategies can potentially be automated or learned by models themselves, reducing the need for manual prompt engineering.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Performance degradation in GPT-3.5 and Claude models on complex or longer arithmetic tasks despite chain-of-thought prompting indicates limitations in algorithmic prompting alone to fully overcome systematic errors and generalization challenges. <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.0" class="evidence-link">[e53.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-53.html#e53.1" class="evidence-link">[e53.1]</a> </li>
