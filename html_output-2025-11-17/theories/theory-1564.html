                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering for Realistic Positive-Energy FTL Propulsion</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by engineering spacetime metrics outside the Natário class, it is possible to realize FTL travel using only positive-energy densities and currently accessible (or near-future) technology. The theory emphasizes the use of advanced matter configurations, electromagnetic field manipulation, and precise control of spacetime curvature to create stable, traversable warp bubbles that do not require exotic negative energy.</p>
