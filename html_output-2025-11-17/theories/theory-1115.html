                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of language models to perform strict logical reasoning emerges as a phase transition phenomenon, where a sharp qualitative change in reasoning ability occurs once a composite capacity metric (a function of model size, logical data exposure, and architectural expressivity) crosses a critical value.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The exact form of the composite capacity metric may differ for different logical systems or tasks.</li>
                <li>Hybrid models (e.g., with symbolic modules) may exhibit multiple phase transitions or none at all.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If logical reasoning performance increases smoothly rather than abruptly, the phase transition framing is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models with subcritical composite capacity can perform strict logical reasoning, the theory is falsified.</li>
