                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) can accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by aligning their internal knowledge representations with the evolving epistemic landscape of science. This alignment is achieved through exposure to vast, temporally-ordered scientific corpora, enabling LLMs to internalize the implicit structure, trends, and gaps in current scientific understanding. The LLM's probabilistic outputs reflect the degree of epistemic consensus, uncertainty, and momentum toward specific discoveries, as encoded in the data.</p>
