                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative, interactive process between human experts and AI systems. The process involves initial automated screening (for coherence, plausibility, and novelty), followed by expert review, with feedback loops that refine both the evaluation criteria and the LLM's generative process. This co-evaluation approach is hypothesized to maximize both the reliability and the creative potential of LLM-generated science.</p>
