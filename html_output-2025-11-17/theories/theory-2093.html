                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can be systematically used to distill quantitative laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by leveraging their ability to perform semantic abstraction, cross-document synthesis, and pattern recognition. LLMs can identify recurring mathematical relationships, abstract variable correspondences, and generalize across diverse experimental contexts, enabling the automated or semi-automated discovery of new or unified scientific laws.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover genuinely novel quantitative laws not previously recognized by human scientists.</li>
                <li>LLMs could reveal hidden, higher-order relationships that require synthesis across disparate scientific domains.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize or synthesize across contextually diverse quantitative relationships, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce known laws without abstraction or unification, the theory's claims of novel law discovery would be undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the potential for LLMs to propagate or amplify errors present in the source literature. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for LLMs to validate the physical plausibility of synthesized laws. </li>
