                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Empirical Rule Synthesis and Feature Abstraction Theory (General Causal-Iterative Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when iteratively exposed to scholarly corpora and provided with feedback (either human or automated), can refine their abstraction of empirical features and synthesis of quantitative laws through a causal-inference-like process. The LLM's internal representations evolve to better capture causal and correlational structures, enabling the generation of increasingly accurate and generalizable empirical rules.</p>

                <li>Iterative feedback may enable LLMs to develop domain-agnostic representations of causality applicable across scientific fields.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative feedback does not improve LLM performance in empirical law synthesis, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between causal and correlational relationships even after refinement, the theory's causal induction law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' inferred causal laws do not generalize to new data, the theory's predictive power is limited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of feedback quality and type (human vs. automated) on LLM refinement is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The scalability of iterative refinement for very large corpora is not discussed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
