                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLMs can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can approach or match human-level accuracy in forecasting the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries when (a) their knowledge is augmented with up-to-date, relevant external information via retrieval, and (b) their outputs are aggregated across diverse models or prompt variants (ensembling). This combination mitigates knowledge cut-off limitations, model-specific biases, and over/underconfidence, and enables LLMs to produce calibrated, competitive probabilistic forecasts for real-world events.</p>

<ol>
    <li>A retrieval-augmented LM forecasting system with optimized prompting and fine-tuning achieves Brier scores close to human crowd aggregate and outperforms zero-shot/scratchpad LLMs. Ablation studies show that removing retrieval degrades performance (Brier 0.179 with retrieval+fine-tuning vs 0.206 without retrieval). <a href="../results/extraction-result-3737.html#e3737.0" class="evidence-link">[e3737.0]</a> </li>

    <li>PaLM 2 forecasting experiments show that a news-grounded pipeline (retrieval of NYT/Hacker News) performs comparably to the best direct prompt, and that lack of retrieval limits performance on post-cutoff events. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3643.html#e3643.0" class="evidence-link">[e3643.0]</a> </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Zero-shot/scratchpad LLMs (including GPT-4, Claude-2, Llama-2, Mistral, Gemini, etc.) perform at or near random on post-cutoff forecasting questions, underperforming human crowds. Best baseline GPT-4-1106-Preview Brier ~0.208 vs human crowd 0.149. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3737.html#e3737.1" class="evidence-link">[e3737.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3721.html#e3721.0" class="evidence-link">[e3721.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Schoenegger et al. (2023) found that out-of-the-box LLMs performed poorly, barely above random guessing, on forecasting tournament questions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3643.html#e3643.2" class="evidence-link">[e3643.2]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new forecasting benchmark is constructed with events after the LLMs' knowledge cut-off, retrieval-augmented LLMs will outperform non-retrieval LLMs and approach human crowd accuracy.</li>
                <li>Aggregating forecasts from a diverse set of LLMs (including open-source and proprietary models) will yield more accurate and better-calibrated probability estimates than any single model, especially on out-of-domain or ambiguous questions.</li>
                <li>If retrieval is removed from a previously high-performing LLM forecasting pipeline, accuracy and calibration will drop to near random or below human crowd levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If retrieval-augmented and ensemble LLMs are applied to forecasting the probability of highly novel, low-frequency scientific breakthroughs (e.g., first detection of extraterrestrial life), their aggregate forecasts will be as well-calibrated as human expert crowds, even in the absence of historical precedent.</li>
                <li>In domains where relevant external information is sparse or ambiguous, ensemble LLMs may outperform human crowds by integrating weak signals across models, but may also fail if all models share the same blind spots.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are fine-tuned on model-generated reasonings that outperform the crowd, and then ensembled, the resulting system may surpass human crowd accuracy even on highly uncertain or unprecedented events.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If retrieval-augmented LLMs do not outperform non-retrieval LLMs on a new, post-cutoff forecasting benchmark, the retrieval augmentation law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If ensemble aggregation fails to improve over the best individual LLM or introduces new biases (e.g., acquiescence), the ensemble aggregation law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If a single LLM with up-to-date retrieval is consistently outperformed by the human crowd or by a naive baseline, the theory's sufficiency is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where retrieval fails to provide relevant or high-quality information, leading to poor LLM performance despite augmentation. For example, the retrieval-augmented system's performance depends on having at least 5 relevant articles; otherwise, it underperforms the crowd. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3737.html#e3737.0" class="evidence-link">[e3737.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Forecasting tasks where all LLMs share the same pre-training biases or knowledge gaps, limiting the benefit of ensembling. For example, if all models are trained on similar data, ensemble diversity may be insufficient. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3722.html#e3722.0" class="evidence-link">[e3722.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3737.html#e3737.1" class="evidence-link">[e3737.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Some domains (e.g., highly technical or non-public scientific discoveries) may lack retrievable information, limiting the benefit of retrieval augmentation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3737.html#e3737.0" class="evidence-link">[e3737.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3643.html#e3643.0" class="evidence-link">[e3643.0]</a> </li>
