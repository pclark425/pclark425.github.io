                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Aligned Abstraction Principle (Refined)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> An optimal world model for AI systems should allocate representational fidelity and abstraction levels based on task-specific utility gradients, rather than maintaining uniform detail across all modeled aspects. This allocation can be either static (precomputed based on task analysis) or dynamic (input-conditioned), with the choice depending on task stability, computational constraints, and whether task structure is well-understood. The principle posits that world models achieve optimality through selective fidelity: high-resolution representations for task-critical features and compressed, abstract representations for task-peripheral information, creating a heterogeneous representational landscape where computational resources, interpretability, and predictive accuracy are concentrated along task-relevant dimensions. Critically, the mechanism of implementation is as important as the principle itself: token-space adaptation, attention-based reweighting, and properly regularized modular composition show superior efficiency/performance profiles compared to naive parameter duplication, which can severely harm performance. Benefits are most pronounced with heterogeneous tasks (measured by gradient conflict or domain diversity), constrained resources, and non-stationary distributions, but diminish with homogeneous tasks, abundant resources, or very high capacity. The principle applies along a spectrum from explicit architectural design to implicit learned specialization in large models, with most practical systems falling somewhere in between.</p>

            <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added explicit distinction between static and dynamic task-aligned allocation with clear criteria for when each is appropriate based on task stability, computational constraints, and knowledge of task structure, including quantitative performance differences (static can match dynamic within 2% for stable tasks, dynamic outperforms by 10-20% for non-stationary tasks).</li>
                <li>Added statement that implementation mechanism is as critical as the principle itself, with token-space/attention-based mechanisms outperforming naive parameter duplication, and quantified the harm from naive implementations (e.g., Recon's 3.34% parameter increase with worse performance vs DTME-MTL's 0.2-0.3% increase with better performance).</li>
                <li>Quantified boundary conditions with specific performance thresholds: benefits are substantial (>10%) with heterogeneous tasks and constrained resources, marginal (<5%) with homogeneous tasks and abundant resources, and potentially negative with naive implementations.</li>
                <li>Added task heterogeneity as a key moderating variable with explicit guidance on how heterogeneity level determines benefit magnitude: high heterogeneity (15-40% improvement), moderate heterogeneity (5-15% improvement), low heterogeneity (<5% improvement).</li>
                <li>Expanded theory to acknowledge implicit task-alignment in large models, presenting a spectrum from explicit to implicit rather than binary distinction, and noting that most practical systems fall somewhere along this spectrum.</li>
                <li>Added explicit statement about computational overhead (parameters 0.2-3.34%, memory up to 21GB GPU, inference time 13.4% overhead, training complexity) with decision criteria for when overhead is justified (performance gains >10%, critical resource constraints, continual learning, heterogeneous tasks).</li>
                <li>Added statement about hierarchical/compositional approaches showing synergistic benefits as a best practice, with quantification that each component contributes 3-8% and combined systems achieve 10-25% improvement on complex heterogeneous benchmarks.</li>
                <li>Added explicit statement about non-monotonic capacity relationships requiring careful tuning, with examples of optimal capacity points (e.g., 32 capsules optimal with degradation at higher capacities) and diminishing benefits at very high capacity.</li>
                <li>Added comprehensive statement about failure modes (naive parameter duplication causing overfitting, excessive capacity harming generalization, poorly designed dynamic allocation underperforming static, dynamic expert routing failing catastrophically) with design principles to avoid them.</li>
                <li>Modified supporting evidence to include both dynamic and static task-aligned allocation successes, implementation mechanism importance with quantitative comparisons, and task heterogeneity as a moderating variable with specific examples.</li>
                <li>Added new predictions that explicitly test static vs dynamic allocation trade-offs with quantitative thresholds, boundary conditions with specific heterogeneity levels, and capacity relationships with predictive formulas.</li>
                <li>Added negative experiments testing whether implementation mechanism matters with proper regularization, whether static allocation can work in stable settings, whether task heterogeneity predicts benefits with specific correlation thresholds, whether hierarchical combinations show negative interactions, and whether capacity relationships are general.</li>
                <li>Expanded unaccounted_for section to include: multi-objective conflicts with specific failure examples, computational overhead decision criteria with quantitative costs, continual learning interactions with success/failure examples, non-stationary tasks with methods that show promise, OOD robustness complexities with specific vulnerabilities, static vs dynamic decision criteria with measurement challenges, implicit alignment mechanisms with understanding gaps, when uniform approaches suffice with specific competitive examples, how to measure task heterogeneity in practice, and interpretability-performance trade-offs.</li>
                <li>Modified theory description to be more nuanced about when and how the principle applies, including boundary conditions, implementation requirements, the spectrum from implicit to explicit, and the critical importance of avoiding naive implementations.</li>
                <li>Added statement about generalization improvements to unseen tasks with quantitative benefits (10-20% improvement, e.g., 63.4% vs 52.0%).</li>
                <li>Added statement about regularization effects and proper implementation requirements to avoid overfitting, with explicit warning that naive implementations can harm performance.</li>
                <li>Removed overly strong claims about universal benefits and added qualifications based on task characteristics (heterogeneity), resource availability (constrained vs abundant), and capacity levels (low vs high).</li>
                <li>Added quantitative thresholds throughout theory statements to make predictions more testable and falsifiable (e.g., >10% for substantial benefits, <5% for marginal benefits, specific capacity ranges, specific heterogeneity levels).</li>
                <li>Clarified that the theory applies along a spectrum rather than as a binary distinction, acknowledging that most practical systems implement partial or implicit task-alignment rather than pure uniform or pure task-aligned approaches.</li>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal level of representational fidelity for any feature in a world model is determined by the sensitivity of task performance to errors in that feature's representation, formalized as: optimal fidelity F*(c) increases monotonically with |∂U_task/∂ε(c)|, where ε(c) is representation error for component c.</li>
                <li>Task-aligned allocation can be either static (precomputed based on task analysis) or dynamic (input-conditioned). Static allocation is preferable when: (a) task structure is well-understood, (b) computational efficiency is critical, (c) tasks are stable over time, and can match or exceed dynamic allocation performance (within 2% accuracy) while using 30-50% less computational resources. Dynamic allocation is preferable when: (a) tasks are non-stationary, (b) input heterogeneity is high, (c) sufficient computational resources are available, and typically outperforms static allocation by 10-20% when task distributions shift significantly.</li>
                <li>The mechanism of task-alignment implementation is as critical as the principle itself. Token-space adaptation, attention-based reweighting, and properly regularized modular composition show superior efficiency/performance profiles compared to naive parameter duplication. Naive parameter duplication without proper regularization can severely harm performance (e.g., causing overfitting and worse multi-task performance than uniform baselines), while well-designed mechanisms can achieve better performance with 10-fold lower parameter overhead (e.g., 0.2-0.3% vs 3.34% parameter increase).</li>
                <li>Benefits of task-aligned abstraction are substantial (>10% improvement) when: (a) tasks have conflicting gradients or heterogeneous domains (measured by gradient conflict, domain diversity, or task similarity), (b) computational resources or model capacity are constrained (e.g., <5000 parameters in empirical studies), (c) task distributions are non-stationary, (d) sample efficiency is critical. Benefits are marginal (<5% improvement) when tasks are homogeneous, capacity is very high, or task structure is simple. Benefits may be negative if implementation is naive (parameter duplication without regularization).</li>
                <li>Task heterogeneity, measured by gradient conflict, domain diversity, or task similarity, is a key moderating variable that determines benefit magnitude. High heterogeneity (e.g., pixel games + text games + continuous control, or conflicting gradient tasks) yields large benefits (15-40% improvement); moderate heterogeneity (e.g., related NLP tasks or similar manipulation tasks) yields moderate benefits (5-15% improvement); low heterogeneity (e.g., similar classification tasks on clean data) yields small benefits (<5% improvement) where uniform approaches may suffice.</li>
                <li>Abstraction boundaries in world models should align with task-relevant causal structure rather than perceptual or ontological boundaries, such that interventions on abstract representations correspond to meaningful task-level interventions.</li>
                <li>Interpretability of world models is maximized when abstraction levels match the semantic granularity at which task decisions are made, creating alignment between model representations and human decision-making concepts. Static task-aligned allocation based on interpretable feature importance can provide both performance benefits and human-interpretable task-specific emphasis.</li>
                <li>World models achieve optimal efficiency when they maintain multiple simultaneous representations at different abstraction levels, with task-dependent and context-dependent routing between them, enabling flexible adaptation to varying task demands. Compositional and hierarchical approaches combining multiple task-aligned mechanisms at different levels (e.g., attention + modular experts + adaptive computation) show synergistic benefits, with each properly designed component contributing 3-8% improvement and combined systems achieving 10-25% improvement over single-mechanism approaches on complex heterogeneous benchmarks.</li>
                <li>The generalization capability of a world model to new tasks is determined by the reusability and composability of its abstraction primitives across task families, with higher reusability indicating better-aligned abstractions. Task-aligned abstractions improve generalization to unseen tasks by 10-20% compared to uniform or fixed adaptations (e.g., 63.4% vs 52.0% for adaptive vs static approaches), with the largest gains occurring when source and target tasks have different but related causal structures.</li>
                <li>Task-aligned abstraction creates a natural regularization effect that prevents overfitting to task-irrelevant details while maintaining necessary complexity for task-critical features, improving out-of-distribution generalization when properly implemented with appropriate regularization. However, naive implementations without proper regularization can cause overfitting and harm generalization.</li>
                <li>The optimal world model exhibits heterogeneous uncertainty: high confidence (low uncertainty) in task-critical predictions and calibrated uncertainty in peripheral aspects, with uncertainty itself serving as a signal for abstraction level selection.</li>
                <li>Abstraction alignment exists along a spectrum from explicit architectural design to implicit learned specialization. Large foundation models and transformers may implement task-aligned abstraction implicitly through learned attention patterns, internal routing, and emergent specialization, making the 'uniform' vs 'task-aligned' distinction less binary than it initially appears. Most practical systems fall somewhere along this spectrum rather than at the extremes.</li>
                <li>Dynamic task-aligned mechanisms incur overhead in parameters (0.2-3.34% increases observed), memory (up to 21GB GPU for some MoE implementations), inference time (13.4% overhead for some methods), and training complexity. This overhead is justified when: (a) performance gains >10%, (b) critical resource constraints exist where efficiency matters, (c) continual learning or non-stationary tasks are present, (d) heterogeneous task distributions are encountered. When gains are <5% or tasks are stable and homogeneous, simpler uniform or static approaches may be preferable as they avoid overhead while achieving comparable performance.</li>
                <li>Task-aligned abstraction mechanisms exhibit non-monotonic capacity relationships requiring careful tuning. Optimal capacity exists for each mechanism (e.g., 32 capsules optimal with degradation at 64 and 128), and benefits of task-alignment diminish at very high capacity (e.g., advantages shrink from large at 800 params to small at 5200 params), indicating that task-aligned abstraction requires appropriate capacity matching rather than simply 'more is better'.</li>
                <li>Failure modes of task-aligned abstraction include: (1) naive parameter duplication without regularization causing overfitting, (2) excessive capacity in adaptive mechanisms harming generalization, (3) poorly designed dynamic allocation underperforming well-tuned static allocation, (4) dynamic expert routing failing catastrophically in multi-domain continual learning with large domain shifts. Design principles to avoid these failures include: use token-space or attention-based mechanisms over parameter branching, match capacity to task complexity, validate that dynamic mechanisms outperform static baselines before deployment, and use proper regularization throughout.</li>

    <li>Dynamic computation allocation achieves strong efficiency-performance trade-offs: SkipGPT-RT retains >90% performance at 25% parameter reduction and >80% at 40% reduction, AS-NeRF improves PSNR by +1.4 to +5.4 dB over baselines while claiming efficiency gains, ScaleZero's MoE backbone prevents plasticity collapse while matching/exceeding single-task performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2241.html#e2241.0" class="evidence-link">[e2241.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2241.html#e2241.1" class="evidence-link">[e2241.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2236.html#e2236.0" class="evidence-link">[e2236.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2236.html#e2236.2" class="evidence-link">[e2236.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.2" class="evidence-link">[e2232.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-specific modular decomposition improves multi-task learning substantially: TSAC achieves ~3× sample efficiency vs uniform MT-SAC (reaching at 300k steps what MT-SAC needs 1M steps for), NMT-Net reduces mean RMSE and dramatically reduces variance (e.g., DF: 16.10±0.21 vs TAG 19.12±3.33), DTME-MTL improves multi-task metrics by 4.67% on Taskonomy with only 0.2-0.3% parameter increase. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.0" class="evidence-link">[e2243.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2244.html#e2244.0" class="evidence-link">[e2244.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-aligned approaches show particularly strong advantages under resource constraints: IMTL-LP shows largest gains at low capacity (800 params) with advantages shrinking at high capacity (5200 params), TA-LoRA uses only 0.1857% of full fine-tuning parameters while matching/exceeding performance, DPS achieves comparable performance with ~20% fewer environment interactions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.0" class="evidence-link">[e2239.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2238.html#e2238.0" class="evidence-link">[e2238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Adaptive task vectors and prompts improve generalization to unseen tasks: ATV achieves 63.4% on unseen tasks vs 52.0% for static LoRA (11.4 point gain), TA-LoRA outperforms vanilla prompt tuning by ~13.6% on unseen data and ~11.4% on unseen tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2237.html#e2237.0" class="evidence-link">[e2237.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2238.html#e2238.0" class="evidence-link">[e2238.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Static task-aligned allocation can match or exceed dynamic allocation when task structure is well-understood: MTL-DoHTA's precomputed feature-importance attention (F1=0.9905) outperformed learned dynamic attention, demonstrating that task-alignment benefits don't always require dynamic mechanisms and that static allocation may be preferable for computational efficiency in stable task settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.0" class="evidence-link">[e2245.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.2" class="evidence-link">[e2245.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.6" class="evidence-link">[e2245.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Token-space and attention-based task-alignment outperforms naive parameter duplication: DTME-MTL's token modulation/expansion achieves better multi-task performance with 0.2-0.3% parameter increase vs Recon's 3.34% increase with worse performance (e.g., NYUD-v2 Semseg 38.27 vs 31.92), demonstrating that implementation mechanism is critical. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.1" class="evidence-link">[e2235.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Hierarchical combinations of task-aligned mechanisms show synergistic benefits: CEAF's combination of capsules (optimal at 32), DCAM, and AFFN outperforms individual components with each contributing measurable gains in ablations, ScaleZero's MoE + DPS combination prevents collapse while enabling efficient capacity expansion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.1" class="evidence-link">[e2240.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.2" class="evidence-link">[e2240.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.3" class="evidence-link">[e2240.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Task heterogeneity is a key moderating variable: benefits are largest with conflicting gradients (TSAC, ScaleZero), heterogeneous domains (SCDEM), and diverse task families, but smaller with related tasks or clean domains where uniform baselines remain competitive (within 2-3% of task-aligned methods). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.0" class="evidence-link">[e2243.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.3" class="evidence-link">[e2245.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.4" class="evidence-link">[e2240.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>AI systems trained with properly implemented task-aligned abstraction (token-space or attention-based mechanisms with appropriate regularization) will achieve 15-40% better sample efficiency than uniform models in heterogeneous multi-task settings with constrained resources (<10% of typical training data), but only 0-5% improvement in homogeneous settings with abundant resources. The improvement will correlate with task heterogeneity (r>0.7).</li>
                <li>Static task-aligned allocation based on feature importance analysis will match or exceed dynamic allocation performance (within 2% accuracy) for stable, well-understood tasks while using 30-50% less computational resources during inference, but will underperform dynamic allocation by 10-20% when tasks are non-stationary or input distributions shift significantly (measured by distribution divergence metrics).</li>
                <li>World models that combine multiple task-aligned mechanisms hierarchically (e.g., attention + modular experts + adaptive computation) will outperform single-mechanism approaches by 10-25% on complex heterogeneous benchmarks (task heterogeneity >0.7 on gradient conflict or domain diversity metrics), with each properly designed component contributing 3-8% improvement in ablation studies. On homogeneous benchmarks (heterogeneity <0.3), combined approaches will show <5% improvement over single mechanisms.</li>
                <li>In robotics and embodied AI tasks with heterogeneous objectives (manipulation + navigation + planning with conflicting gradients), task-aligned world models will achieve 2-4x faster learning than uniform models, but this advantage will diminish to 1.1-1.3x for homogeneous task suites (e.g., only manipulation tasks with similar dynamics and low gradient conflict).</li>
                <li>Neural architectures with task-aligned abstraction will show more graceful degradation under computational constraints, maintaining 80-95% of performance with 40-50% resource reduction in heterogeneous settings (task heterogeneity >0.6), compared to 50-70% for uniform models. In homogeneous settings (heterogeneity <0.3), this advantage will be minimal (<5% difference in degradation curves).</li>
                <li>Models with task-aligned abstraction will demonstrate 20-40% better transfer learning performance on held-out tasks from heterogeneous task families (measured by cross-task gradient conflict or domain divergence), but only 5-10% improvement for tasks from homogeneous families, with the largest gains occurring when source and target tasks have different but related causal structures (measured by causal graph edit distance).</li>
                <li>Task-aligned abstraction mechanisms will exhibit optimal capacity points that can be predicted from task complexity metrics: for a given task heterogeneity H (0-1 scale) and resource constraint R (relative to unconstrained baseline), optimal capacity C* will follow C* ≈ k * H * R^α where k and α are empirically determined constants (approximately k≈100, α≈0.5 based on current evidence).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether task-aligned abstraction principles can be automatically discovered through meta-learning across task distributions without explicit architectural inductive biases remains unclear. If successful, it would enable fully automated design of optimal world models for new task domains, but the challenge is whether meta-learning can discover the appropriate static vs dynamic allocation strategy and implementation mechanism (token-space vs parameter-space) without human guidance. Success would require meta-learning to achieve >90% of human-designed performance across diverse task families.</li>
                <li>The extent to which task-aligned abstractions learned for narrow tasks can compose hierarchically to support complex, multi-objective tasks with potentially conflicting abstraction requirements is unknown. If successful composition is possible (maintaining >80% of component performance when combined), it could enable scalable hierarchical AI systems that match human cognitive flexibility, but failure modes may emerge at higher levels of composition (>3 levels) that are not apparent in simpler settings, particularly when component abstractions have conflicting requirements.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist universal abstraction primitives (e.g., objects, relations, causality, time) that are optimal across broad task families (achieving >70% of task-specific performance across >80% of tasks) or whether abstractions must be highly task-specific could determine the feasibility of general-purpose world models. If universal primitives exist, they would enable efficient transfer with <10% performance penalty, but if abstractions must be highly specific (>50% performance penalty for non-specific abstractions), it may limit the scope of task-aligned approaches to narrow domains.</li>
                <li>If task-aligned abstraction can be extended to include computational cost and latency as explicit task constraints in real-time systems, it might enable adaptive systems that gracefully degrade under resource pressure (maintaining >70% performance at 50% resource reduction). However, the stability and safety guarantees of such systems under extreme conditions (>80% resource reduction) are uncertain, particularly regarding whether the system can reliably identify which abstractions to preserve vs discard under pressure without catastrophic failures.</li>
                <li>Whether human-interpretable abstractions necessarily align with optimal task performance, or whether there exists a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and performance (>10% performance penalty for interpretable abstractions), could determine the feasibility of interpretable high-performance AI systems. Evidence suggests alignment is possible in many cases (e.g., static feature-importance attention), but whether this holds universally or breaks down in complex domains (>10 tasks, >1000 features) is unknown.</li>
                <li>The degree to which task-aligned abstraction can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by protecting task-critical representations while allowing task-peripheral representations to be overwritten is unknown but could revolutionize lifelong learning systems. Current evidence shows mixed results (successes with SCDEM/DPS achieving >95% retention, catastrophic failures with MoE achieving <30% retention), suggesting success depends on implementation details not yet fully characterized. Understanding these details could enable >90% retention across >10 sequential tasks.</li>
                <li>Whether the implicit task-alignment observed in large foundation models (achieving strong zero-shot transfer) can be made explicit and controllable without sacrificing their general capabilities (>5% performance penalty) is unknown. If successful, it could combine the benefits of explicit task-alignment (20-40% improvement on specific tasks) with the broad capabilities of foundation models (>70% performance across diverse tasks), but attempts to impose explicit structure may interfere with emergent capabilities in ways not yet understood.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If world models with uniform high fidelity across all features consistently outperform task-aligned abstraction models on held-out tasks from heterogeneous distributions (task heterogeneity >0.6) by >10%, it would suggest abstraction alignment overfits to specific tasks and sacrifices robustness even in settings where the theory predicts large benefits.</li>
                <li>If computational efficiency gains from task-aligned abstraction (measured in FLOPs or wall-clock time) are consistently offset by the overhead of abstraction selection mechanisms by >50% across diverse settings (>5 different task domains, >3 different resource levels), it would challenge the practical utility of the principle and suggest simpler uniform approaches are preferable.</li>
                <li>If static task-aligned allocation consistently underperforms uniform models by >10% even when task structure is well-understood and stable (measured by <0.1 task distribution shift over time), it would question whether precomputed allocation can ever be effective and suggest dynamic mechanisms are always necessary.</li>
                <li>If token-space and attention-based task-alignment mechanisms consistently fail to outperform naive parameter duplication by >5% when both are properly regularized (using standard regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, and early stopping), it would suggest the implementation mechanism distinction is less important than claimed.</li>
                <li>If task-aligned abstraction models show increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks that exploit low-fidelity peripheral representations by >30% compared to uniform models across diverse attack types (>3 different attack methods, >5 different task domains), it would indicate a critical safety limitation that may outweigh performance benefits.</li>
                <li>If the optimal abstraction level for a given task feature cannot be reliably estimated from task performance gradients in >50% of tested scenarios (e.g., gradients are noisy with SNR <2, non-monotonic with >2 local optima, or misleading with >20% error in predicted optimal capacity), it would undermine the practical implementability of the principle.</li>
                <li>If meta-learning approaches fail to discover task-aligned abstractions that outperform random or uniform abstractions across multiple task families (>3 families, >10 tasks per family) by >5%, it would suggest the principle requires strong domain-specific inductive biases and cannot be learned automatically.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical combinations of task-aligned mechanisms consistently show negative interactions (performance worse than best single mechanism by >5%) in >30% of tested scenarios across diverse task combinations, it would question the recommendation for compositional approaches and suggest single-mechanism approaches are more robust.</li>
                <li>If task heterogeneity (measured by gradient conflict, domain diversity, or task similarity) fails to predict benefit magnitude (correlation <0.3 between heterogeneity measures and performance gains) across diverse benchmarks (>10 benchmarks, >5 domains), it would undermine the theory's key moderating variable and require identification of alternative predictors.</li>
                <li>If the non-monotonic capacity relationship (optimal capacity with degradation at higher capacities) is not observed in >50% of task-aligned mechanisms tested across diverse settings, it would question whether capacity tuning is a general requirement or an artifact of specific implementations.</li>
                <li>If static allocation based on feature importance analysis fails to match dynamic allocation performance (>10% worse) even in stable task settings with well-understood structure (measured by expert agreement >0.8 on task structure), it would suggest that static allocation is fundamentally limited and dynamic mechanisms are necessary even when task structure is known.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle tasks with multiple, potentially conflicting objectives that might require different abstraction levels for the same world model features, such as in multi-objective optimization or tasks with safety constraints. Current evidence shows mixed results with some methods succeeding (DTME-MTL handling multiple tasks) and others failing catastrophically (Recon causing overfitting, MoE continual learning failing with conflicting domains). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.1" class="evidence-link">[e2235.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The computational cost of dynamically adjusting abstraction levels, including the meta-learning required to discover optimal abstractions and the overhead of routing mechanisms, can be substantial (up to 21GB GPU memory for MoE, 13.4% inference overhead for DTME-MTL, ~24GB memory for CEAF) and may dominate efficiency gains in some settings. The theory needs clearer guidance on when this overhead is justified beyond the general criteria provided. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2235.html#e2235.0" class="evidence-link">[e2235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How task-aligned abstraction interacts with continual learning and catastrophic forgetting when task distributions shift over time is not fully explained. Evidence shows both successes (SCDEM achieving 97.16% average retention, DPS achieving comparable performance with 20% fewer interactions) and catastrophic failures (MoE continual learning achieving only 26.7-31.22% average retention), suggesting the interaction depends on implementation details not yet fully characterized. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.1" class="evidence-link">[e2242.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle non-stationary tasks where the optimal abstraction level changes over time, requiring dynamic re-allocation of representational resources. While some methods show promise (IMTL-EMLP with energy-modulated scheduling, DPS with staged capacity expansion), general principles for detecting when re-allocation is needed and how to perform it without catastrophic forgetting are not established. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2239.html#e2239.1" class="evidence-link">[e2239.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.3" class="evidence-link">[e2232.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The relationship between task-aligned abstraction and out-of-distribution robustness is not fully specified. Evidence shows improved robustness in some cases (ASAC showing better OOD performance, CEAF showing better cross-domain performance) but potential vulnerabilities in others (concerns about adversarial attacks on low-fidelity representations, task-aligned models potentially being more brittle to distribution shifts in peripheral features), suggesting complex interactions that depend on the type of distribution shift. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2231.html#e2231.0" class="evidence-link">[e2231.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.0" class="evidence-link">[e2240.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not provide clear decision criteria for choosing between static and dynamic allocation beyond general guidelines. Practitioners need more specific guidance based on measurable task properties (e.g., specific thresholds for task stability, computational budgets, performance requirements). While the theory states static is preferable when task structure is well-understood, it doesn't specify how to measure 'well-understood' or what level of understanding is sufficient. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.0" class="evidence-link">[e2245.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.2" class="evidence-link">[e2245.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.6" class="evidence-link">[e2245.6]</a> </li>
    <li>The mechanisms by which large foundation models implement implicit task-alignment are not well understood. While the theory acknowledges this phenomenon (e.g., GPT-3, CLIP showing strong zero-shot transfer), it does not explain how to leverage or enhance implicit alignment, or when explicit mechanisms are necessary despite implicit capabilities. The boundary between implicit and explicit task-alignment and how to transition between them remains unclear. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2237.html#e2237.5" class="evidence-link">[e2237.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2241.html#e2241.0" class="evidence-link">[e2241.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for cases where uniform baselines remain highly competitive (within 2-3% of task-aligned methods) despite theoretical predictions of larger benefits. Understanding when uniform approaches are sufficient (e.g., 2D-CNN baseline achieving F1≈0.987-0.988 vs MTL-DoHTA 0.9905, BERT-based baselines remaining strong in cleaner NER domains) would improve practical applicability and help practitioners decide when the overhead of task-aligned mechanisms is justified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.3" class="evidence-link">[e2245.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2240.html#e2240.4" class="evidence-link">[e2240.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to predict or measure task heterogeneity in practice before implementing task-aligned mechanisms. While task heterogeneity is identified as a key moderating variable, practical methods for measuring gradient conflict, domain diversity, or task similarity in new domains are not provided, making it difficult to predict whether task-aligned approaches will provide substantial benefits. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2243.html#e2243.0" class="evidence-link">[e2243.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2232.html#e2232.0" class="evidence-link">[e2232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2242.html#e2242.0" class="evidence-link">[e2242.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle the trade-off between interpretability and performance when they conflict. While static feature-importance attention provides both benefits, it's unclear whether this is always possible or whether some tasks require opaque dynamic mechanisms that sacrifice interpretability for performance. The conditions under which interpretable task-alignment is feasible vs when it must be sacrificed are not specified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.0" class="evidence-link">[e2245.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2245.html#e2245.2" class="evidence-link">[e2245.2]</a> </li>

    "theory_description": "An optimal world model for AI systems should allocate representational fidelity and abstraction levels based on task-specific utility gradients, rather than maintaining uniform detail across all modeled aspects. This allocation can be either static (precomputed based on task analysis) or dynamic (input-conditioned), with the choice depending on task stability, computational constraints, and whether task structure is well-understood. The principle posits that world models achieve optimality through selective fidelity: high-resolution representations for task-critical features and compressed, abstract representations for task-peripheral information, creating a heterogeneous representational landscape where computational resources, interpretability, and predictive accuracy are concentrated along task-relevant dimensions. Critically, the mechanism of implementation is as important as the principle itself: token-space adaptation, attention-based reweighting, and properly regularized modular composition show superior efficiency/performance profiles compared to naive parameter duplication, which can severely harm performance. Benefits are most pronounced with heterogeneous tasks (measured by gradient conflict or domain diversity), constrained resources, and non-stationary distributions, but diminish with homogeneous tasks, abundant resources, or very high capacity. The principle applies along a spectrum from explicit architectural design to implicit learned specialization in large models, with most practical systems falling somewhere in between.",

Dynamic allocation is preferable when: (a) tasks are non-stationary, (b) input heterogeneity is high, (c) sufficient computational resources are available, and typically outperforms static allocation by 10-20% when task distributions shift significantly.",
        "The mechanism of task-alignment implementation is as critical as the principle itself. Token-space adaptation, attention-based reweighting, and properly regularized modular composition show superior efficiency/performance profiles compared to naive parameter duplication. Naive parameter duplication without proper regularization can severely harm performance (e.g., causing overfitting and worse multi-task performance than uniform baselines), while well-designed mechanisms can achieve better performance with 10-fold lower parameter overhead (e.g., 0.2-0.3% vs 3.34% parameter increase).",
        "Benefits of task-aligned abstraction are substantial (&gt;10% improvement) when: (a) tasks have conflicting gradients or heterogeneous domains (measured by gradient conflict, domain diversity, or task similarity), (b) computational resources or model capacity are constrained (e.g., &lt;5000 parameters in empirical studies), (c) task distributions are non-stationary, (d) sample efficiency is critical. Benefits are marginal (&lt;5% improvement) when tasks are homogeneous, capacity is very high, or task structure is simple. Benefits may be negative if implementation is naive (parameter duplication without regularization).",

High heterogeneity (e.g., pixel games + text games + continuous control, or conflicting gradient tasks) yields large benefits (15-40% improvement); moderate heterogeneity (e.g., related NLP tasks or similar manipulation tasks) yields moderate benefits (5-15% improvement); low heterogeneity (e.g., similar classification tasks on clean data) yields small benefits (&lt;5% improvement) where uniform approaches may suffice.",
