                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HSLDT: Emergent Consensus Theory Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse set of scholarly papers, can identify and distill emergent scientific theories by detecting consensus patterns—recurring relationships, claims, and explanatory frameworks—across the literature. The process is enhanced by symbolic aggregation of extracted claims, enabling the LLM to filter noise and outliers, and to surface the most widely supported and generalizable scientific laws.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In emerging fields, consensus extraction may surface novel but weakly supported theories that later become foundational.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-symbolic systems fail to recover known scientific consensus from large corpora, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If noise and outlier claims persist in distilled theories, the noise filtering law is called into question.</li>
