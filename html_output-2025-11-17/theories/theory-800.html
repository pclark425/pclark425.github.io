                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Layered and Dynamic Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal task performance in LLM agents arises from a layered memory architecture, where different memory types (short-term, working, episodic, semantic, and external) interact dynamically. The architecture enables agents to flexibly allocate, retrieve, and update information based on task demands, context, and resource constraints, supporting both immediate reasoning and long-term adaptation.</p>
