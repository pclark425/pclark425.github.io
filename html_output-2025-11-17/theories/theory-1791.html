                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Knowledge Aggregation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by aggregating and synthesizing latent knowledge embedded in the scientific literature, including implicit hypotheses, converging lines of evidence, and patterns of unresolved questions. By leveraging their ability to model semantic, logical, and contextual relationships across vast corpora, LLMs can infer the likelihood of imminent discoveries based on the density, diversity, and convergence of supporting evidence, even when such discoveries have not yet been explicitly made.</p>
