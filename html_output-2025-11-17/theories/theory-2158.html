                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Hierarchical Abstraction in LLM-Based Scientific Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when guided by mission-focused instructions, perform theory distillation through a process of hierarchical abstraction: extracting atomic facts, synthesizing them into mid-level patterns, and finally abstracting high-level scientific laws. This multi-level process enables LLMs to handle complexity, ambiguity, and scale in scholarly corpora, resulting in robust, generalizable scientific theories.</p>
