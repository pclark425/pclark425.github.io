                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on vast corpora of chemical literature and molecular representations, can learn a latent, language-based mapping of chemical space. This mapping enables LLMs to generate novel chemical structures tailored to specific applications by leveraging semantic, syntactic, and contextual cues from both natural language and chemical notation.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
