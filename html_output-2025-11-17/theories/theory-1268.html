                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structural Inductive Bias and Modality Adaptation Theory: General Law of Graph-to-Text Representation Alignment</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the effectiveness of converting graphs into text for language model training is governed by the alignment between the structural inductive biases of the language model and the modality adaptation strategies used in the representation. Specifically, representations that preserve salient graph structures (such as node connectivity, edge types, and subgraph motifs) in a linguistically coherent and model-compatible manner enable more efficient learning and generalization.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Graph-to-text models that linearize graphs while preserving local neighborhoods and edge types outperform those that flatten or randomize structure. </li>
    <li>Language models pretrained on natural language benefit from representations that mimic natural syntactic and semantic patterns. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that preserving graph motifs (e.g., cycles, chains) in text improves downstream performance. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes empirical findings and theoretical insights, making explicit the role of inductive bias alignment in representation design.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that structure-preserving linearizations and natural language-like representations improve model performance, but the explicit link to inductive bias alignment is not formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the necessity of aligning graph-to-text representations with the inductive biases of the target language model for optimal learning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Representations that disrupt salient graph structures (e.g., random node order, omitted edge types) will degrade language model performance.</li>
                <li>Language models with different inductive biases (e.g., transformers vs. RNNs) will prefer different graph-to-text representation strategies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For highly irregular or non-linguistic graphs, the optimal representation may require hybrid or learned adaptation strategies.</li>
                <li>If a language model is pretrained on synthetic graph-structured text, it may develop new inductive biases that alter optimal representation design.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models trained on structure-disrupting representations outperform those with structure-preserving representations, the law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If language models show no difference in performance across representations with varying degrees of inductive bias alignment, the law would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some graph properties (e.g., global connectivity, spectral features) may not be easily encoded in text and are not addressed by the law. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory generalizes and formalizes scattered empirical findings into a unified principle of representation-model alignment.</p>
