                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates empirical testability, internal logical coherence, novelty relative to existing knowledge, and explanatory power. The framework asserts that only by considering all these dimensions in concert can the scientific value of LLM-generated theories be robustly assessed, mitigating risks of plausible-sounding but vacuous or redundant outputs.</p>

    <li>Scientific theories are traditionally evaluated on empirical testability, logical coherence, novelty, and explanatory power (Kuhn, Popper, Lakatos). </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate plausible but redundant or tautological statements, necessitating explicit novelty and explanatory checks. </li>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If multi-criteria evaluation does not reduce the rate of trivial or tautological LLM-generated theories compared to single-criterion evaluation, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If human experts consistently reject theories that pass all four criteria, the framework's sufficiency is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The framework does not specify how to operationalize or quantify each criterion, which may be non-trivial in practice. </li>
    <li>Does not address the potential for LLMs to generate theories that are adversarially optimized to pass all criteria without genuine scientific value. </li>
