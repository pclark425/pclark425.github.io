                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Assisted Curriculum Design with Human Oversight Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as effective assistants in human-led curriculum design processes when properly scaffolded through user interfaces and interaction paradigms that balance automation with human control. The effectiveness stems from: (1) LLMs' ability to generate diverse content and suggestions based on curriculum structure and constraints; (2) human oversight that provides quality control, domain expertise, and pedagogical judgment; (3) interface design that reduces prompt-engineering burden while maintaining user agency. The theory posits that LLM-assisted curriculum design with appropriate UI scaffolding (predefined commands, direct manipulation, structured outputs) achieves better usability, lower cognitive workload, and higher-quality outputs compared to unstructured LLM interaction (chat interfaces) or manual design without LLM assistance. Success depends on: interface design quality, the balance between automation and human control, domain-specific prompt engineering, and the integration of human expertise for validation and refinement. This approach is particularly suited for domains where curriculum quality requires human judgment (educational content, pedagogical appropriateness) rather than purely verifiable outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-assisted curriculum design with structured UI scaffolding (predefined commands, direct manipulation, constrained outputs) will achieve significantly better usability (>15 SUS points) and lower cognitive workload (>25% reduction) compared to unstructured chat interfaces.</li>
                <li>Curriculum-conditioned LLM generation (providing hierarchical curriculum structure, learning objectives, and constraints) will produce higher-quality outputs than naive LLM prompting, as measured by expert evaluation and alignment metrics.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of LLM-assisted curriculum design depends critically on interface design: predefined task-specific commands outperform open/flexible commands, which in turn outperform pure chat interfaces.</li>
                <li>Human oversight and validation remain essential for curriculum quality: LLM assistance augments but does not replace human expertise in pedagogical judgment, domain knowledge, and quality control.</li>
                <li>LLM-assisted approaches are most valuable in domains requiring human judgment (educational content, pedagogical appropriateness) rather than purely verifiable outcomes (where automated methods may suffice).</li>
                <li>Reducing prompt-engineering burden through UI design (curated commands, automatic context inclusion, structured outputs) significantly improves user experience and output quality compared to requiring users to craft prompts manually.</li>
                <li>LLM-assisted curriculum design requires substantial upfront engineering: prompt template design, command curation, output format specification, and integration of domain-specific constraints.</li>
                <li>The balance between automation and human control is critical: too much automation reduces user agency and trust, while too little automation fails to reduce workload sufficiently.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>UI Predefined (LLM-assisted with curated commands) achieved highest usability (SUS 86.75) and lowest workload (NASA RTLX 2.25) compared to open commands (SUS 70.75, RTLX 3.00) and ChatGPT-style interface (SUS 69.00, RTLX 3.30), demonstrating proper UI scaffolding significantly improves LLM-assisted curriculum design. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.0" class="evidence-link">[e2032.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.1" class="evidence-link">[e2032.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.2" class="evidence-link">[e2032.2]</a> </li>
    <li>COGENT (curriculum-conditioned LLM generation with human-defined structure) achieved higher curriculum alignment than both baseline LLM prompting and human-written passages when evaluated by expert teachers, showing LLM assistance with proper constraints can match or exceed human-only approaches. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.0" class="evidence-link">[e2031.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DirectGPT and SPROUT (prior work on LLM-assisted authoring with direct manipulation) reported improved task completion times and user satisfaction compared to traditional chat interfaces, supporting the value of UI design in LLM-assisted workflows. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.6" class="evidence-link">[e2032.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.7" class="evidence-link">[e2032.7]</a> </li>
    <li>COGENT BASE (naive LLM prompting without curriculum conditioning) frequently exceeded target readability levels and produced poorly calibrated outputs, demonstrating that LLM assistance requires careful prompt engineering and structural constraints to be effective. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.1" class="evidence-link">[e2031.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Human expert evaluation of COGENT outputs showed experts rated curriculum-conditioned LLM passages higher than baseline LLM and comparable to or better than human-written passages, validating that LLM assistance with proper scaffolding can produce expert-approved curriculum content. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.0" class="evidence-link">[e2031.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.4" class="evidence-link">[e2031.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In educational curriculum design tasks, LLM-assisted interfaces with predefined commands will achieve 20-30% faster task completion times and 15-25 point higher SUS scores compared to chat-based interfaces.</li>
                <li>Expert educators using LLM-assisted curriculum design tools will rate their outputs as higher quality (>0.5 points on 5-point scale) compared to manual design alone, when given equivalent time budgets.</li>
                <li>LLM-assisted curriculum design with curriculum-structure conditioning will produce outputs that meet target readability and complexity constraints 80-90% of the time, compared to 40-60% for unconditioned LLM prompting.</li>
                <li>Users of LLM-assisted curriculum design tools will report higher satisfaction and lower frustration when using interfaces with direct manipulation and structured outputs compared to pure text-based interaction.</li>
                <li>The learning curve for LLM-assisted curriculum design tools will be steeper for open/flexible command interfaces compared to predefined command interfaces, with users requiring 2-3x more time to achieve proficiency.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether LLM-assisted curriculum design can scale to very large curricula (>100 topics, >1000 learning objectives) while maintaining usability and output quality is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM-assisted curriculum design tools can effectively support collaborative curriculum development (multiple educators working together) or whether they are primarily suited for individual use is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether long-term use of LLM-assisted curriculum design tools leads to skill degradation in manual curriculum design or whether it enhances human expertise through exposure to diverse examples is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM-assisted curriculum design can effectively handle culturally diverse or non-Western educational contexts, or whether it reflects biases from predominantly Western training data, is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether combining LLM-assisted curriculum design with automated assessment tools (e.g., learning analytics, student performance prediction) produces synergistic improvements in curriculum quality is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether students learning from LLM-assisted curricula show different learning outcomes compared to traditional human-designed curricula, and whether any differences are positive or negative, is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If manual curriculum design by experts consistently produces higher-quality outputs than LLM-assisted design in controlled studies with equivalent time budgets, this would challenge the utility of LLM assistance.</li>
                <li>If users report no significant reduction in cognitive workload or improvement in usability when using LLM-assisted tools compared to manual design tools, this would challenge the value proposition.</li>
                <li>If LLM-assisted curricula show systematic biases (cultural, demographic, content) that require extensive human correction, negating time savings, this would challenge the efficiency claims.</li>
                <li>If the learning curve for LLM-assisted tools is so steep that users require extensive training (>10 hours) to achieve proficiency, this would challenge the accessibility claims.</li>
                <li>If LLM-assisted outputs require as much human editing and refinement as starting from scratch, this would challenge the productivity claims.</li>
                <li>If removing UI scaffolding (predefined commands, structured outputs) and using pure chat interfaces produces equivalent quality outputs with equivalent user satisfaction, this would challenge the importance of interface design.</li>
                <li>If automated rule-based curriculum generation tools (without LLMs) achieve equivalent or better results in terms of quality, usability, and efficiency, this would challenge the specific value of LLM assistance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify optimal command set design: how many commands, what granularity, how to organize them, or how to balance coverage vs. simplicity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.0" class="evidence-link">[e2032.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle LLM errors and quality issues in interactive settings: when to show confidence scores, how to support error correction, whether to allow regeneration. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.1" class="evidence-link">[e2031.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how much prompt engineering and template design is required upfront, or how to maintain and update prompts as LLMs evolve. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.0" class="evidence-link">[e2031.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2032.html#e2032.0" class="evidence-link">[e2032.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address long-term effects: whether repeated use leads to over-reliance on LLM suggestions, skill degradation, or enhanced expertise. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to evaluate curriculum quality in domains without clear metrics: what constitutes 'better' curriculum design when pedagogical effectiveness is hard to measure. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.0" class="evidence-link">[e2031.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address collaborative use cases: how multiple users should interact with LLM-assisted tools, how to handle conflicting suggestions, or how to support team-based curriculum development. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle domain-specific requirements: what customization is needed for different subjects, grade levels, or educational contexts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2031.html#e2031.0" class="evidence-link">[e2031.0]</a> </li>
