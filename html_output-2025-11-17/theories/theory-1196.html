                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Probabilistic Chemical Design Engines</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by learning the joint probability distributions of chemical structures and their associated properties from large datasets, can probabilistically sample and optimize novel chemicals for specific applications. The LLM's internal representations encode not only chemical syntax but also property correlations, enabling the generation of molecules with desired features through probabilistic inference and conditional sampling.</p>
