                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Pattern Completion via Statistical Memorization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models perform arithmetic primarily by leveraging statistical regularities and memorized patterns from their training data, rather than by executing true algorithmic computation. Arithmetic performance is thus a byproduct of exposure to frequent arithmetic expressions and their results, and generalization is limited to patterns seen during training.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are tested on arithmetic expressions with number lengths or formats not seen in training, performance will drop sharply.</li>
                <li>If arithmetic facts are artificially overrepresented in training, LLMs will perform better on those facts.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are prompted with arithmetic queries in a novel syntactic form, accuracy will decrease.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit algorithmic explanations, their performance on novel arithmetic may improve, challenging the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to a curriculum of increasingly complex arithmetic, it is unknown whether they will develop algorithmic abstraction or continue to rely on memorization.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are fine-tuned on a small set of algorithmic rules, it is unclear whether this will generalize to all arithmetic cases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs generalize perfectly to novel arithmetic expressions, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can perform arithmetic in entirely novel formats (e.g., new bases) without exposure, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can explain their stepwise reasoning for arithmetic in a way that matches algorithmic computation, this would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial generalization to longer numbers, suggesting some abstraction beyond memorization. </li>
    <li>Certain prompting strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought) can improve arithmetic performance beyond what would be expected from memorization alone. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
