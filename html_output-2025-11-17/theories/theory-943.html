                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents (General Theory 2)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the efficiency and effectiveness of memory use in LLM agents for text games is governed by the alignment between the agent's memory architecture and the causal/temporal graph of the task. Specifically, memory is most useful when it enables the agent to reconstruct or reason over the latent state transitions that are not directly observable in the current context, and less useful when the task is fully observable or the relevant information is always present in the immediate context.</p>
