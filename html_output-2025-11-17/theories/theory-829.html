                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Deliberative and Programmatic Memory Control Theory for LLM Agents (General - Emergent Coordination)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the coordination between deliberative and programmatic memory control in LLM agents is not statically defined, but emerges dynamically as a function of task complexity, uncertainty, and agent experience. The theory asserts that LLM agents can learn to modulate the balance between explicit (deliberative) and implicit (programmatic) memory processes, leading to emergent strategies that optimize both efficiency and adaptability across a wide range of tasks.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Meta-learning and reinforcement learning studies show that agents can learn to allocate cognitive resources adaptively based on task demands. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to meta-learning and cognitive flexibility, the explicit emergence of hybrid memory control in LLM agents is a new theoretical contribution.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Adaptive resource allocation and meta-learning are established in cognitive science and machine learning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law's focus on emergent, learned modulation between deliberative and programmatic memory in LLM agents is novel.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM agents do not show any adaptive modulation of memory control in response to task complexity or uncertainty, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If emergent memory control strategies do not improve performance or adaptability, the theory's core claim would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain how to prevent maladaptive or pathological emergent memory control strategies (e.g., overfitting to deliberative or programmatic modes). </li>
