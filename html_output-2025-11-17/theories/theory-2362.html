                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2362</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple, interacting biological networks—genetic, metabolic, vascular, immune, and neural—whose dysregulation leads to a self-reinforcing cascade of neurodegeneration. Rather than a single causative agent, AD is the emergent result of network failures, with early disruptions in one domain (e.g., vascular or metabolic) amplifying dysfunction in others (e.g., immune, synaptic), ultimately manifesting as cognitive decline. Detection is most effective when it targets multi-modal network signatures rather than isolated biomarkers.</p>
