                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Prompt-Driven Law Extraction and Validation in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be systematically guided to extract, refine, and validate quantitative laws from scholarly corpora through iterative, prompt-driven processes. By leveraging chain-of-thought reasoning, self-consistency checks, and external validation (e.g., with held-out data), LLMs can converge on robust, generalizable quantitative laws, even in the presence of noisy or incomplete data.</p>
