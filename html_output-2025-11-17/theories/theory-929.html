                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Control Enables Robust Long-Horizon Planning in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM text game agents equipped with hierarchical memory control—where high-level controllers manage the allocation, retrieval, and consolidation of lower-level memory modules—achieve robust long-horizon planning and error recovery. By dynamically prioritizing relevant memories and abstracting over sequences of events, such agents can maintain coherent strategies, recover from mistakes, and adapt to evolving game states.</p>
