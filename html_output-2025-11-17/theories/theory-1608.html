                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Task-Tool Alignment and Modular Augmentation in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is determined by the degree of alignment between the simulation task's requirements and the capabilities of both the LLM and any modular augmentation tools. Modular augmentation—where LLMs are systematically integrated with external, domain-specific tools—can compensate for LLM limitations, but only when the task-tool alignment is high and the integration is seamless. The theory further asserts that the granularity of modular decomposition and the compatibility of interfaces between LLMs and tools are critical mediators of simulation accuracy.</p>
