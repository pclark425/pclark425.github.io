                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as a Mechanism for Inductive Bias Modulation in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the format of a prompt acts as a modulator of the LLM's inductive biases, selectively activating or suppressing certain reasoning heuristics and decomposition strategies. The prompt format interacts with the LLM's internal representations, effectively steering the model toward particular solution spaces and influencing both the efficiency and accuracy of problem solving.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show preferential activation of heuristics in response to prompt cues, the inductive bias activation law is undermined.</li>
