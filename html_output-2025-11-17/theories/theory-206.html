                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Calibration and Fine-tuning Effectiveness Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about alignment between proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, Likert-style) and expert human review for software development artifacts, including necessary conditions for high agreement, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The effectiveness of calibration and fine-tuning strategies for improving LLM-as-judge alignment follows predictable patterns based on the type of misalignment being addressed and the intervention method used. The theory distinguishes between four primary types of misalignment: (1) Systematic biases (position, length, style, verbosity) - best addressed by post-hoc calibration (e.g., position swapping, length control via GLM) or training-time augmentation (e.g., swap augmentation), achieving 8-15 percentage point improvements; (2) Domain knowledge gaps - best addressed by fine-tuning on domain-specific data (1K-10K examples for 80% of maximum improvement) or in-context learning with domain examples; (3) Rubric misunderstanding - best addressed by in-context learning with 3-5 examples (10-20 percentage point improvements) or explicit criteria repetition; (4) Reasoning errors - best addressed by chain-of-thought prompting (5-15 percentage point improvements), reference-guided evaluation, or modular agentic approaches. The theory predicts diminishing returns from multiple interventions: the first well-targeted intervention provides the largest improvement (typically 50-70% of achievable gains), the second complementary intervention provides 20-30%, and subsequent interventions provide progressively smaller gains (<10% each). Training-time interventions are 1.5-2x more effective than post-hoc calibration but 10-100x more expensive. Multi-agent and committee-based approaches can provide additional 5-10 percentage point improvements by incorporating diverse perspectives. The theory also predicts that calibration effectiveness varies with model capability, with stronger base models showing better response to calibration.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The first well-targeted calibration intervention typically provides 50-70% of the total achievable improvement in alignment</li>
                <li>The second complementary calibration intervention typically provides 20-30% of the total achievable improvement</li>
                <li>Subsequent calibration interventions provide progressively diminishing returns, typically <10% each</li>
                <li>Post-hoc calibration methods (position swapping, length control) can recover 50-80% of bias-induced alignment loss without retraining</li>
                <li>Training-time interventions (swap augmentation, reference drop, fine-tuning) are 1.5-2x more effective than post-hoc calibration but 10-100x more expensive in terms of computational cost</li>
                <li>In-context learning with 3-5 examples is most effective for rubric misunderstanding, providing 10-20 percentage point improvements</li>
                <li>Chain-of-thought prompting is most effective for reasoning-intensive tasks, providing 5-15 percentage point improvements</li>
                <li>Domain-specific fine-tuning requires 1K-10K examples to achieve 80% of maximum improvement, with logarithmic returns beyond 10K examples</li>
                <li>Combining complementary strategies (e.g., position calibration + length control) yields approximately additive improvements (within 80-120% of sum)</li>
                <li>Combining redundant strategies (e.g., multiple position calibration methods) yields strongly diminishing returns (<50% of sum)</li>
                <li>The optimal calibration strategy depends on identifying and addressing the dominant error mode first - this provides maximum improvement per unit effort</li>
                <li>Multi-agent and committee-based approaches provide additional 5-10 percentage point improvements beyond single-agent calibration by incorporating diverse perspectives</li>
                <li>Modular agentic approaches (with explicit context selection) can provide 20-30 percentage point improvements over simple LLM-as-judge for complex evaluation tasks</li>
                <li>Stronger base models (e.g., GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5) show better response to calibration interventions, with 20-50% larger improvements from the same calibration strategy</li>
                <li>Calibration effectiveness varies by task type: objective tasks (relevance, formatting) show larger improvements (15-25 pp) than subjective tasks (likability, style) (5-10 pp)</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning on human judgments can achieve 80-90% of maximum possible alignment with 1K-10K examples for most tasks</li>
                <li>Cross-domain transfer of calibration strategies is limited: strategies effective for one domain may provide only 30-60% of their original benefit in new domains</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal sequence for applying multiple calibration strategies or if order doesn't matter significantly</li>
                <li>Whether calibration strategies that work for one model family (e.g., GPT) transfer effectively to other families (e.g., Claude, Llama) with similar effectiveness</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial training against known biases creates more robust judges or introduces new, harder-to-detect vulnerabilities</li>

                <li>Finding that combining complementary strategies yields less than 50% of additive improvements would challenge the independence assumption</li>
                <li>Showing that calibration strategies effective for one task consistently harm performance on other tasks would challenge the generalizability assumption</li>
                <li>Finding that the order of applying calibration strategies significantly affects final performance would challenge the commutative assumption</li>

    <li>The optimal amount of fine-tuning data for different task types and complexity levels is not precisely specified </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how calibration strategies interact with different prompting strategies (e.g., zero-shot vs few-shot vs chain-of-thought) </li>
    <li>The long-term stability of calibration improvements is not addressed - whether calibration degrades over time or with distribution shift </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to balance multiple competing objectives (e.g., reducing position bias while maintaining consistency) </li>
    <li>The cost-benefit trade-offs for different calibration strategies in production settings are not quantified </li>
