                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Loop Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that self-reflection in LLMs operates as a meta-cognitive loop, where the model recursively evaluates and modifies its own outputs using internalized heuristics and error signals. The effectiveness of this loop is determined by the model's capacity for self-monitoring, the granularity of its internal representations, and the affordances of the task. The process is analogous to human metacognition, but is constrained by the model's training data and architecture.</p>
