                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Formulation 2)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance or vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the degree of integration and feedback within their molecular signaling and metabolic pathways. Neurons with tightly integrated, highly feedback-regulated networks (including antioxidant, mitochondrial, and synaptic signaling pathways) are more capable of compensating for proteotoxic stress, while those with loosely connected or poorly regulated pathways are more susceptible to pathological aggregation.</p>

            <ol>

            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with highly integrated feedback in antioxidant and mitochondrial pathways are not more resistant to Aβ and tau pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
