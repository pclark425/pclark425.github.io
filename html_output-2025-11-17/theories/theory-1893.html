                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1893</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as a High-Dimensional Control Signal Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format of a prompt acts as a high-dimensional control signal that modulates the internal computational trajectory of a large language model (LLM). The prompt's structure, explicitness, and formatting features (such as stepwise instructions, lists, or question-answer pairs) systematically bias the activation patterns and information flow within the model, thereby shaping the model's reasoning strategies, memory retrieval, and error profiles.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is reformatted from unstructured to stepwise, the LLM will show increased accuracy on multi-step reasoning tasks.</li>
                <li>If a prompt is presented as a bullet-point list, the LLM will produce more structured, list-like outputs and fewer omission errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel, hybrid prompt format is introduced (e.g., combining stepwise and QA), the LLM may develop emergent reasoning strategies not seen with standard formats.</li>
                <li>If prompt format is adversarially manipulated, the LLM may exhibit new classes of systematic errors or reasoning failures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM internal activations and outputs do not change with prompt format, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If error profiles remain constant across prompt formats, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of prompt format on LLMs with architectures other than transformers is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of pretraining data distribution in mediating prompt format effects is not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is somewhat related to existing work but introduces a new, control-theoretic perspective.</p>
