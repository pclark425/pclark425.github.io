                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1373</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Emergence in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that through repeated generate-then-reflect cycles, language models develop emergent meta-cognitive behaviors, such as self-monitoring, uncertainty estimation, and adaptive strategy selection. These behaviors arise not from explicit programming, but from the model's exposure to diverse tasks and reflection prompts, enabling it to simulate forms of self-awareness and strategic reasoning.</p>
