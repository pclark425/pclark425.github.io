                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Driven Memory Retrieval Optimization in Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language model agents can maximize task performance by dynamically optimizing their memory retrieval strategies based on the current task's structure, complexity, and feedback. The agent should learn to select, prioritize, and retrieve memory entries that are most relevant to the current subgoal, context, and expected reward, using meta-cognitive signals to guide retrieval and update policies.</p>
