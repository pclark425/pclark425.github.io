                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Unlabeled Learning Effectiveness in Imbalanced Scientific Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the relationship between scientific problem characteristics (including data availability, data structure, problem complexity, domain maturity, and mechanistic understanding requirements) and the applicability, effectiveness, and impact potential of different AI methodologies and approaches, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For scientific detection tasks with extreme class imbalance (rare events, anomalies) where negative examples are difficult to define or label exhaustively, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning frameworks substantially outperform standard supervised learning. The advantage is most pronounced when: (1) positive examples are well-defined but rare (<1% of data), (2) the unlabeled set contains both positives and negatives, and (3) the decision boundary is complex. PU learning with appropriate loss functions and confidence weighting enables effective learning from small positive sets.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When positive examples are rare (<1% of data) and well-defined, but negative examples are ambiguous or expensive to label, PU learning outperforms standard supervised learning by 30-100% in detection metrics.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of PU learning increases with the degree of class imbalance: at 1:100 ratios, PU learning shows modest gains; at 1:10,000 ratios, gains can exceed 2x in recall.</li>
                <li>PU learning requires careful calibration of the class prior (proportion of positives in unlabeled data) for optimal performance; misestimation degrades performance.</li>
                <li>Combining PU learning with representation regularization (e.g., autoencoder reconstruction) improves generalization when positive examples are very limited (<250).</li>
                <li>PU learning is most effective when the positive class has coherent structure that can be learned from few examples, rather than being highly heterogeneous.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Topaz PU-CNN for particle picking in cryoEM increased particle yields by 1.72x over manual picks <a href="../results/extraction-result-2323.html#e2323.2" class="evidence-link">[e2323.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2352.html#e2352.3" class="evidence-link">[e2352.3]</a> </li>
    <li>PU learning treats unlabeled regions appropriately rather than as negatives, enabling learning from small positive sets <a href="../results/extraction-result-2323.html#e2323.2" class="evidence-link">[e2323.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Autoencoder regularization improves PU-CNN generalization in very-low-label regimes (N≤250) <a href="../results/extraction-result-2352.html#e2352.3" class="evidence-link">[e2352.3]</a> </li>
    <li>GE-binomial loss for PU learning provides theoretical guarantees and practical benefits <a href="../results/extraction-result-2352.html#e2352.3" class="evidence-link">[e2352.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Unsupervised outlier detection methods (isolation forest, unsupervised RF) are used for anomaly discovery in astronomy <a href="../results/extraction-result-2328.html#e2328.9" class="evidence-link">[e2328.9]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For rare astronomical transient detection with 100 confirmed examples and 10 million unlabeled light curves, a PU learning classifier will achieve 40-60% higher recall at fixed precision compared to a standard supervised classifier trained on the same positives plus randomly sampled negatives.</li>
                <li>In drug discovery screening for rare active compounds (hit rate <0.1%), a PU learning model will identify 1.5-2x more true actives in the top 1000 predictions compared to a standard classifier.</li>
                <li>For detecting rare disease subtypes in medical imaging with 50 positive cases and 100,000 unlabeled scans, PU learning will achieve 30-50% higher sensitivity at 95% specificity compared to standard supervised learning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether PU learning can effectively handle cases where the positive class is highly heterogeneous (multiple subtypes) without explicit subtype labels.</li>
                <li>If there exists an optimal ratio of labeled positives to unlabeled examples for PU learning, or if more unlabeled data always helps.</li>
                <li>Whether PU learning can be effectively combined with active learning to iteratively select the most informative unlabeled examples for labeling.</li>
                <li>If deep PU learning methods can match or exceed shallow methods (e.g., PU random forests) across all imbalance ratios and data types.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding detection tasks where standard supervised learning with balanced sampling matches or exceeds PU learning performance would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that PU learning fails when class imbalance is moderate (1:10 to 1:100) would limit its applicability range.</li>
                <li>Showing that PU learning is highly sensitive to class prior misestimation in practical applications would reduce its robustness.</li>
            </ol>
