                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Threshold Disruption Model of the Gut Microbiota–Neuroinflammation–Vascular Axis in AD</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease is triggered when cumulative disruptions in the gut microbiota, neuroinflammatory state, and vascular integrity surpass a critical threshold. Below this threshold, compensatory mechanisms maintain homeostasis; above it, a cascade of pathological events is initiated, leading to irreversible neurodegeneration. The model predicts that early detection of sub-threshold changes across all three axes can identify individuals at imminent risk, and that multi-modal interventions before threshold crossing can prevent AD onset.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>AD risk is increased when multiple risk factors (gut dysbiosis, inflammation, vascular dysfunction) are present together, even if each alone is subclinical. </li>
    <li>Longitudinal studies show that individuals with mild but combined disruptions in gut, immune, and vascular markers are more likely to develop AD. </li>
    <li>Animal models demonstrate that combined low-level insults across these axes can trigger AD-like pathology, while single insults do not. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While risk factor accumulation is recognized, the quantitative threshold across these three axes is a new synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Individual risk factors for AD are known, and additive/multiplicative risk models exist.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit threshold model integrating all three axes quantitatively is novel.</p>
