                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Epistemic Evaluation Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories requires a meta-epistemic framework that integrates both traditional scientific criteria (empirical adequacy, internal consistency, falsifiability) and LLM-specific criteria (transparency of reasoning, traceability of knowledge sources, and resistance to synthetic plausibility). Only by combining these dimensions can evaluators reliably distinguish between genuinely valuable scientific contributions and superficially plausible but ultimately flawed outputs.</p>

                <li>If an LLM-generated theory is evaluated using only traditional scientific criteria, some superficially plausible but ungrounded theories will be rated highly.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The integration of LLM-specific criteria may inadvertently filter out genuinely novel but unconventional theories that lack clear traceability.</li>
                <li>Some LLM-generated theories may pass all evaluation criteria but still contain subtle, undetectable errors due to training data biases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-generated theories evaluated with both traditional and LLM-specific criteria still result in a high rate of false positives, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If synthetic plausibility is not a significant problem in practice, the need for LLM-specific criteria may be overstated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of evaluator expertise and bias on the effectiveness of combined evaluation criteria is not addressed. </li>
