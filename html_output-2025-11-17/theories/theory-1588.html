                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1588</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal Bubble Propagation via Nonlinear Electromagnetic Field Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL spacecraft travel can be achieved by generating a 'causal bubble'—a region of spacetime with altered causal structure—through the use of intense, nonlinear electromagnetic fields. By exploiting nonlinear optical and electromagnetic effects in advanced materials, the causal structure of spacetime can be locally modified, allowing the bubble (and the spacecraft within) to move at effective FTL speeds relative to the external frame, all within the constraints of current technology and budgets.</p>
