                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit-Activity-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their circuit-level activity patterns and synaptic connectivity. Neurons with high baseline activity, dense recurrent excitatory connectivity, and high synaptic plasticity are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation and toxicity, while neurons with low activity, sparse connectivity, or inhibitory dominance are more resistant.</p>
