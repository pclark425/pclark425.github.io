                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1131</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Modularization and Reasoning Phase Transition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models develop strict logical reasoning capabilities through a hierarchical modularization process, where lower-level modules specialize in atomic logical operations and higher-level modules coordinate these to perform complex reasoning. The transition to strict logical reasoning is characterized as a phase transition, with qualitative changes in model behavior and internal structure occurring at specific points in model scaling or training.</p>

            <ol>

            <ol>
                <li>Failure to observe new modules or qualitative changes in internal structure at the reasoning phase transition would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that a flat (non-hierarchical) modular model can perform multi-level strict logical reasoning would falsify the necessity of hierarchy.</li>

    <li>Some models may show gradual, not abrupt, improvements in reasoning, suggesting a more continuous process. </li>
