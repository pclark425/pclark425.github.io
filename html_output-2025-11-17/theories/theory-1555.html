                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1555</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Relativistic Network Hopping</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that a network of synchronized, high-energy nodes (such as satellites or ground stations) can create a series of local spacetime distortions, allowing a spacecraft to 'hop' between them at effective FTL speeds. Each node generates a transient, localized metric distortion (e.g., via intense electromagnetic pulses or mass redistribution), and the spacecraft is transferred from one node to the next in a sequence, such that the cumulative travel time is less than that of a light signal traversing the same path in normal spacetime. This approach leverages current or near-future technology and distributed infrastructure, and aims to minimize the energy requirements by distributing the metric engineering across many nodes.</p>

                <li>No cumulative instabilities or causality paradoxes will arise from repeated metric hopping, even as the number of hops increases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no reduction in travel time is observed despite synchronized metric distortions, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If cumulative metric distortions lead to destructive interference, instability, or causality violations, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If the energy requirements for even a single hop remain prohibitive despite network distribution, the theory's viability is challenged.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>No experimental evidence exists for macroscopic metric hopping using current technology. </li>
