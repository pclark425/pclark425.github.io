                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Generative Simulation Theory for LM-based Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models can be used to generate plausible continuations or completions of lists. By comparing actual list items to LM-generated samples, anomalies can be detected as items that are unlikely to be generated by the LM, indicating deviation from the learned generative process.</p>
