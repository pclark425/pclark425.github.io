                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates logical coherence, empirical adequacy, novelty, and epistemic utility. The theory asserts that only by systematically assessing these dimensions—each with explicit, operationalizable criteria—can the scientific value of LLM-generated theories be robustly determined.</p>

                <li>If a theory that is not novel is rated as highly novel, the novelty law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
