                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of scientific theories generated by large language models (LLMs) is best understood as a process of multidimensional alignment, where candidate theories are assessed along several orthogonal axes: empirical adequacy, conceptual coherence, methodological transparency, and epistemic novelty. The theory asserts that only when a candidate theory achieves sufficient alignment across these dimensions can it be considered robust and valuable for scientific progress.</p>
