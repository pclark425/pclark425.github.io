                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1237</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Text-Driven Molecular Synthesis via Conditional Generative Modeling</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when trained as conditional generative models on paired text and molecular data, can synthesize novel chemicals by conditioning the generation process on natural language descriptions of desired properties or applications. The model learns to map semantic content in text to structural features in molecules, enabling the design of new compounds tailored to user-specified requirements.</p>
