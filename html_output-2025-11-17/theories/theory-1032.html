                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) solve spatial puzzle games, such as Sudoku, by leveraging emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities that arise from structured inductive biases encoded during pretraining. These biases, shaped by exposure to structured data and language, enable the model to simulate constraint satisfaction and search processes, even without explicit programming for such tasks.</p>
