                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Projection Synergy Theory of Selective Vulnerability</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by the synergy between their intrinsic activity levels and the pathological state of their projection targets. Neurons with high baseline activity that project to regions with high amyloid/tau burden are most susceptible, due to increased metabolic demand and enhanced trans-synaptic spread of toxic proteins.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing activity in neurons projecting to healthy regions will not increase vulnerability unless the target becomes pathological.</li>
                <li>Blocking synaptic transmission in projections to pathological regions will reduce vulnerability even if intrinsic activity remains high.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If high-activity neurons projecting to pathological regions do not show increased vulnerability, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If reducing activity or blocking projections does not alter vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Molecular factors (e.g., gene expression, proteostasis) may independently modulate vulnerability. </li>
