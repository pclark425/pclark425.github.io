                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by navigating a high-dimensional semantic embedding space, where both chemical structures and application requirements are represented as language-derived vectors. The LLM generates candidate molecules by searching for structures whose embeddings are optimally aligned with the semantic representation of the application objective.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If embedding similarity does not correlate with property match or application relevance, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate molecules with embeddings close to novel application objectives, the theory's generative claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If the embedding space is not chemically meaningful (e.g., does not reflect property gradients), the theory's mechanism fails.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of embedding space dimensionality and structure on chemical diversity and novelty is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential for embedding collapse or loss of chemical validity in high-dimensional navigation is not explained. </li>
