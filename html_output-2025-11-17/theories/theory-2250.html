                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2250</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most effective when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The process alternates between automated, large-scale screening and targeted human review, with feedback loops that refine both the evaluation criteria and the LLM's generative process.</p>
