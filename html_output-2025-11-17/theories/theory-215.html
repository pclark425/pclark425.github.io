                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Action-Space Constraint via Memory Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents can dramatically reduce the computational burden of action selection in text games by maintaining structured memory of action validity patterns learned from experience. The core mechanism involves storing associations between contextual features (location types, object categories, game states) and valid action templates or specific actions. When the agent encounters a new situation, it retrieves relevant constraints from memory based on contextual similarity, filtering the action space before evaluation. This approach operates on multiple levels: (1) template-level memory stores which action templates (e.g., 'take X', 'open X with Y') are valid in different context categories, (2) object-level memory stores which specific objects can fill template slots in different contexts, and (3) state-level memory stores which actions become available or unavailable after certain game state transitions. By leveraging these memory structures, agents can constrain action spaces from potentially thousands of possibilities to a manageable set of contextually-appropriate candidates, improving both sample efficiency and decision quality.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Action validity patterns in text games exhibit sufficient regularity across contexts that they can be learned and stored in memory for future retrieval.</li>
                <li>Memory-based action-space constraint reduces the effective action space size by a factor proportional to the consistency of action validity patterns across similar contexts.</li>
                <li>The benefit of memory-based constraint increases with the size of the total action space and the degree of contextual regularity in action validity.</li>
                <li>Retrieval from action constraint memory is more computationally efficient than evaluating all possible actions when the action space is large.</li>
                <li>Memory-based constraint enables generalization: actions learned as valid in one context can be correctly predicted as valid in similar novel contexts.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of memory-based constraint depends on the quality of context representation - better context representations enable more accurate retrieval of relevant constraints.</li>
                <li>Multi-level memory structures (template-level, object-level, state-level) provide complementary constraints that can be combined for maximum action-space reduction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Text games have extremely large action spaces, often with hundreds to thousands of possible actions at each step, making exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive. </li>
    <li>Action validity in text games follows systematic patterns based on context, with certain actions only being valid in specific locations or game states. </li>
    <li>Text game actions typically follow template structures with verbs and argument slots that can be filled with different objects, suggesting template-based organization is natural. </li>
    <li>Agents that use admissible action lists (when provided by the game) perform significantly better than those that must generate actions from scratch, demonstrating the value of action-space constraint. </li>
    <li>Human players naturally learn which actions are possible in different game contexts and use this knowledge to constrain their action selection. </li>
    <li>Memory-augmented neural networks have shown success in tasks requiring retrieval of relevant past information to inform current decisions. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents using memory-based action constraint will achieve higher sample efficiency (fewer steps to solve games) compared to agents without such memory, especially in games with large action spaces.</li>
                <li>The performance advantage of memory-based constraint will be most pronounced in the middle stages of learning, after sufficient experience has been gathered but before complete mastery.</li>
                <li>Memory-based constraint will reduce the number of invalid actions attempted by agents, leading to fewer wasted interactions with the game environment.</li>
                <li>Agents will show faster adaptation to new areas of a game that share contextual similarities with previously explored areas.</li>
                <li>The size of the constrained action space will be significantly smaller than the full action space (by at least 50-90% in typical text games) while maintaining high recall of valid actions (>90%).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether memory-based constraint can enable zero-shot transfer to entirely new games by recognizing analogous contexts (e.g., 'kitchen' contexts across different games).</li>
                <li>Whether hierarchical memory structures that organize constraints at multiple levels of abstraction (from specific to general) would provide better performance than flat memory structures.</li>
                <li>Whether memory-based constraint could enable agents to infer novel valid actions by analogical reasoning (e.g., if 'unlock door with key' is valid, perhaps 'unlock chest with key' is also valid).</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal memory structure varies significantly across different game genres or whether a universal structure can be effective across all text games.</li>
                <li>Whether memory-based constraint could facilitate natural language understanding by providing expectations about action affordances that help disambiguate object references and spatial descriptions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If memory-based constraint performs no better than random action filtering in games where action validity is highly irregular or context-independent, this would challenge the theory's assumption of learnable patterns.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of memory retrieval and context matching exceeds the cost of evaluating all actions directly, this would challenge the practical utility of the approach.</li>
                <li>If agents cannot learn sufficiently accurate context representations from game text to enable effective memory retrieval, the entire approach would fail.</li>
                <li>If memory-based constraint leads to premature convergence on suboptimal action sets (missing valid actions that would lead to better solutions), this would challenge the theory's assumption that constraint improves decision quality.</li>
                <li>If the memory requirements for storing action constraints grow faster than the benefits they provide (e.g., requiring more memory than storing a full policy), this would challenge the scalability of the approach.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify the optimal granularity of context categories - whether fine-grained contexts (e.g., 'kitchen with stove') or coarse-grained contexts (e.g., 'indoor location') are more effective. </li>
    <li>How to handle dynamic action spaces where new action templates become available during gameplay (e.g., learning magic spells) is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to balance exploration (trying actions not suggested by memory) versus exploitation (using memory constraints) during learning. </li>
    <li>How to handle contradictory information in memory (e.g., an action that was invalid in one context but valid in a seemingly similar context) is not fully specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
