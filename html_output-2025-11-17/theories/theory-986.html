                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with structured and interpretable memory representations—such as explicit world models, object inventories, and event/action logs—can perform model-based planning, efficient exploration, and rapid error recovery in text games. The structure and interpretability of memory allow the agent to simulate possible futures, reason about consequences, adapt to unexpected events, and communicate its reasoning to humans.</p>
