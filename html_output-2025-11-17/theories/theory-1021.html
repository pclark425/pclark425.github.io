                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Structured Memory and Reasoning Modules are Essential for Overcoming Partial Observability and Enabling Efficient Planning in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents require explicit, structured memory and reasoning modules to overcome the inherent partial observability and long-term dependencies in text games. By maintaining a persistent, structured representation of the game world and leveraging explicit reasoning over this memory, agents can plan efficiently, resolve ambiguities, and adapt to dynamic environments, leading to superior performance compared to agents relying solely on unstructured or short-term memory.</p>
