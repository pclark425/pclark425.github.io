                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cross-Domain Law Extraction via Latent Relational Mapping</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can extract qualitative laws that are not only present within a single scientific domain, but also those that are latent across multiple domains, by mapping semantically similar relational structures and aligning them into unified law statements. This cross-domain mapping enables the discovery of more general, abstract laws that transcend disciplinary boundaries.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to transfer knowledge and analogize between domains, as seen in cross-disciplinary question answering and analogy tasks. </li>
    <li>Foundation models (including LLMs) have been shown to generalize across tasks and domains, suggesting the ability to align relational patterns that are not explicitly labeled as such. </li>
    <li>Analogical reasoning is a core capability of LLMs, as evidenced by their performance on analogy benchmarks and their ability to generate analogies between disparate scientific concepts. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs can generate law-like statements that abstract over both physical and biological systems when prompted with cross-domain corpora. </li>
    <li>LLMs can identify and align relational structures even when terminology differs, as shown in experiments with paraphrased or synonym-rich corpora. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to transfer learning and analogy, the focus on law extraction via latent mapping and the explicit mechanism for cross-domain law abstraction is a novel theoretical contribution.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Transfer learning and analogy-making in LLMs is established, and LLMs have been shown to generalize across domains.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit use of latent relational mapping for the purpose of cross-domain law extraction, resulting in unified law statements that transcend disciplinary boundaries, is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will be able to generate law-like statements that apply to both physical and biological systems when exposed to corpora from both domains.</li>
                <li>Cross-domain law extraction will be more successful when relational patterns are semantically aligned, even if terminology differs.</li>
                <li>LLMs will produce more abstract, general laws when trained or prompted with multi-domain corpora than with single-domain corpora.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely novel, cross-disciplinary laws that have not been previously recognized by human scientists.</li>
                <li>The process may fail in domains with fundamentally incompatible ontologies or relational structures.</li>
                <li>LLMs may generate cross-domain laws that are valid but non-intuitive or difficult for humans to interpret.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate cross-domain law statements despite clear relational similarities, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate spurious or nonsensical cross-domain laws, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to align relational patterns when terminology is varied but structure is preserved, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of LLMs' ability to align highly abstract or deeply implicit relational patterns are not fully understood. </li>
    <li>The impact of training data biases on the quality and generality of extracted cross-domain laws is not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to analogy and transfer, the law-centric, cross-domain mapping process and its application to scientific law extraction is a new theoretical contribution.</p>
