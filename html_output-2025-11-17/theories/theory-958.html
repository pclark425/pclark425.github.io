                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Episodic-Working Memory Synergy Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal performance in text games by LLM agents arises from a synergistic interaction between episodic memory (for storing and retrieving past, contextually relevant experiences) and working memory (for maintaining and manipulating current, short-term information). The agent must dynamically allocate, retrieve, and update both memory types based on the evolving game context, enabling flexible adaptation, efficient exploration, and robust handling of partial observability.</p>
