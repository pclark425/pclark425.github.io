                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Context-Action Horizon Mismatch Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory explaining the dissociation between strong QA performance and weak interactive procedural performance in LLM-based agents, and the architectural/training interventions required to close the gap, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs have finite context windows that create a fundamental mismatch with long-horizon interactive tasks, but this mismatch is more nuanced than simple capacity limits. This theory posits that: (1) QA tasks typically fit within context windows (question + answer span), while interactive tasks may require tracking state, decisions, and outcomes over hundreds or thousands of steps, (2) Context window limitations force truncation or compression of history, potentially losing critical information for decision-making, (3) Models lack built-in mechanisms to selectively retain important information, compress redundant details, and organize information hierarchically, (4) Long-horizon tasks require not just memory capacity but also memory management strategies including hierarchical abstraction, selective retention, and temporal organization, (5) Simply increasing context window size is insufficient without corresponding improvements in attention mechanisms and information organization. The theory predicts that interventions addressing both capacity and organization (external memory with retrieval, hierarchical planning, state compression, skill libraries) will show greater benefits on longer-horizon tasks, with the benefit magnitude correlating with task horizon length and information density.</p>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adding external memory will provide greater absolute performance gains on tasks with 100+ steps compared to tasks with 10-20 steps, with the gain magnitude correlating with horizon length</li>
                <li>Models with larger context windows (e.g., 100K tokens) will show better performance on long-horizon tasks than models with smaller windows (e.g., 4K tokens), holding other factors constant</li>
                <li>Hierarchical planning approaches will show greater benefits on tasks with natural hierarchical structure (e.g., software development, multi-day travel planning) compared to flat sequential tasks</li>
                <li>State compression techniques (e.g., summarization, abstraction) will improve performance on long-horizon tasks with high information redundancy more than on tasks with unique information at each step</li>
                <li>The performance gap between short-horizon (5-10 steps) and long-horizon (50+ steps) tasks will be larger for models without memory mechanisms compared to models with memory</li>
                <li>Skill libraries will show greater benefits on tasks requiring repeated similar actions (e.g., Minecraft crafting) compared to tasks with unique actions at each step</li>
                <li>Memory retrieval quality (precision/recall of relevant past information) will be a stronger predictor of long-horizon performance than raw memory capacity</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring backtracking or exploration will benefit more from explicit search-based memory (e.g., tree search) than from simple episodic memory</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether future models with very large context windows (millions of tokens) combined with improved attention mechanisms will eliminate the need for external memory on most practical tasks, or whether memory management will remain necessary</li>
                <li>The optimal strategy for selective information retention in long-horizon tasks: whether learned compression, rule-based filtering, or hybrid approaches will prove most effective</li>
                <li>Whether learned memory management strategies (e.g., what to store, when to retrieve) will transfer across different task domains or require task-specific tuning</li>
                <li>The extent to which hierarchical abstraction can compress arbitrarily long-horizon tasks into manageable representations, or whether there are fundamental limits</li>
                <li>Whether there are fundamental computational limits to how long a horizon can be effectively managed even with optimal external memory and retrieval, or whether the problem is purely one of engineering</li>
                <li>Whether biological memory mechanisms (e.g., consolidation, forgetting curves, associative retrieval) will provide better models for LLM memory than current approaches</li>
                <li>The interaction between memory capacity, retrieval quality, and planning depth: whether improvements in one dimension can compensate for limitations in others</li>
                <li>Whether multi-agent architectures with distributed memory will scale better to very long horizons than single-agent architectures with centralized memory</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating that external memory provides no benefit on long-horizon tasks (50+ steps) would challenge the context-horizon mismatch hypothesis</li>
                <li>Showing that larger context windows (e.g., 100K vs 4K tokens) do not improve long-horizon performance would question the importance of context capacity limitations</li>
                <li>Finding that hierarchical planning provides no benefit over flat planning on tasks with natural hierarchical structure would challenge the value of abstraction for horizon management</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that state compression consistently degrades rather than improves performance on long-horizon tasks would question the utility of information reduction</li>
                <li>Showing that short-horizon (5-10 steps) and long-horizon (50+ steps) tasks show similar performance gaps across models would challenge the horizon-specific nature of the problem</li>
                <li>Finding that memory retrieval quality has no correlation with long-horizon task performance would question the importance of selective retention</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that skill libraries provide no benefit on tasks with repeated actions would challenge the compositional memory hypothesis</li>
                <li>Showing that models with perfect memory of all past steps still fail on long-horizon tasks would suggest factors beyond memory capacity are primary</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some long-horizon tasks show reasonable performance without explicit memory mechanisms (e.g., LATS achieving 92.7% on HumanEval with GPT-4 using only search-based implicit memory) <a href="../results/extraction-result-944.html#e944.1" class="evidence-link">[e944.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-944.html#e944.2" class="evidence-link">[e944.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal memory architecture varies across tasks in complex ways that aren't fully explained by task horizon alone (e.g., symbolic memory for ChatDB, episodic for Reflexion, skill library for Voyager) <a href="../results/extraction-result-913.html#e913.0" class="evidence-link">[e913.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-821.html#e821.1" class="evidence-link">[e821.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-912.html#e912.4" class="evidence-link">[e912.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Some memory interventions show inconsistent benefits across different task types (e.g., MemPrompt showing small gains on some tasks but not others) <a href="../results/extraction-result-903.html#e903.2" class="evidence-link">[e903.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction between memory and other factors (e.g., tool quality, planning ability, error recovery) is complex and not fully captured by horizon length alone <a href="../results/extraction-result-816.html#e816.0" class="evidence-link">[e816.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-844.html#e844.0" class="evidence-link">[e844.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some tasks with moderate horizons (20-30 steps) show larger performance gaps than some longer-horizon tasks, suggesting task complexity and information density matter beyond raw step count <a href="../results/extraction-result-822.html#e822.0" class="evidence-link">[e822.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-909.html#e909.1" class="evidence-link">[e909.1]</a> </li>
