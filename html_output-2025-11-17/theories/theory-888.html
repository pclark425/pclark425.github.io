                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically integrating episodic (event-specific) and semantic (generalized) memories in a hierarchical fashion. The agent maintains both detailed records of specific experiences and abstracted knowledge, and adaptively retrieves and combines these based on task demands, context, and uncertainty.</p>
