                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Reflective-Abstractive Memory Architecture for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal long-term task performance and coherence by organizing memory into a hierarchy, where lower levels store episodic details, intermediate levels perform abstraction and schema formation, and higher levels engage in reflective evaluation and meta-memory operations. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient retrieval, flexible adaptation, and robust handling of both specific and generalizable knowledge.</p>
