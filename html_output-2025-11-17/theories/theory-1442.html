                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as a Dynamic Error Correction Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that self-reflection in LLMs operates as a dynamic, iterative error correction process, where each reflection step serves to identify, amplify, and correct errors in the model's prior outputs. The effectiveness of this process depends on the model's ability to propagate error signals through its internal representations and the task's affordance for decomposing errors into correctable subcomponents.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introducing explicit error localization mechanisms (e.g., intermediate step labeling) will increase the gains from reflection in multi-step tasks.</li>
                <li>Tasks with hidden or implicit intermediate steps will show less improvement from reflection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained to hallucinate plausible intermediate steps, reflection may amplify rather than correct errors.</li>
                <li>Reflection may enable models to self-discover new intermediate representations that facilitate error correction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models without error localization mechanisms show large gains from reflection on multi-step tasks, this theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If masking intermediate errors does not reduce reflection efficacy, the theory would be called into question.</li>

    <li>Cases where reflection leads to creative but incorrect intermediate steps that are not present in the original reasoning. </li>
