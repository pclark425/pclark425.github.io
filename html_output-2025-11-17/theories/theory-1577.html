                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hyperwave/Hypertube FTL Communication via Planck-Scale Microbubbles: General Framework</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that faster-than-light (FTL) communication and, by extension, FTL spacecraft travel can be achieved by engineering and manipulating Planck-scale microbubbles—localized, transient distortions of spacetime at the Planck length. These microbubbles act as conduits (hypertubes) for hyperwave propagation, allowing information and potentially matter to traverse spacetime at superluminal speeds. The theory posits that by generating, stabilizing, and linking these microbubbles, a spacecraft can create a continuous hypertube, effectively bypassing the light-speed limit imposed by conventional spacetime.</p>
