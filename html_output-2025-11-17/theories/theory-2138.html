                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abductive Synthesis for LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora by iteratively generating, evaluating, and refining candidate explanations using abductive reasoning. The process involves the LLM proposing hypotheses, testing them against extracted evidence, and revising them in cycles, leading to increasingly accurate and comprehensive theories.</p>
