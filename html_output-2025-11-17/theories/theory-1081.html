                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1081</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Global Rule Encoding via Distributed Representations in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when trained on spatial puzzles with global constraints, develop distributed internal representations that encode global spatial rules implicitly. These representations emerge not from explicit spatial modules, but from the model's need to satisfy global constraints during training, resulting in the ability to reason about spatial relationships and constraints across the entire input.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Distributed global rule encoding may enable transfer to spatial puzzles with different but related constraint structures.</li>
                <li>Altering the architecture to restrict attention span may reduce the model's ability to enforce global constraints.</li>
                <li>Distributed representations may allow for compositional generalization to more complex spatial puzzles.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If distributed representations do not encode global rules (as shown by probing or ablation), the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If attention maps do not reflect global constraint relationships, the theory would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If models with restricted attention perform equally well on global spatial puzzles, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how distributed representations are formed during training. </li>
    <li>It does not address whether distributed encoding is necessary or merely sufficient for global rule enforcement. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory builds on known properties of neural networks but applies them in a new context of global spatial rule abstraction in language models.</p>
