                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Inference and Expected Free Energy Theory for Hybrid Systems</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about hybrid declarative-imperative reasoning systems and their emergent properties.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that hybrid declarative-imperative reasoning systems can be understood through the Active Inference framework, where behavior emerges from minimizing Expected Free Energy (EFE). In hybrid systems, EFE naturally decomposes into two components that map onto the two reasoning modes: (1) Pragmatic value - computed by the imperative subsystem to achieve goals through procedural actions, and (2) Epistemic value - computed to reduce uncertainty in the declarative knowledge base through information-gathering actions. The theory posits that the declarative component maintains probabilistic beliefs over world states and generates predictions, while the imperative component selects actions that minimize EFE by balancing exploitation (achieving goals via pragmatic value) and exploration (reducing uncertainty via epistemic value). The coupling between subsystems occurs through a precision-weighted prediction error mechanism: declarative predictions generate expected observations, imperative actions produce actual observations, and the mismatch drives both belief updating in the declarative system and policy selection in the imperative system. This creates a dynamic equilibrium where the system naturally transitions between exploitation and exploration based on the relative precision of declarative beliefs. The theory predicts that hybrid systems will exhibit superior performance compared to pure systems because they can explicitly represent and minimize both pragmatic and epistemic uncertainty, leading to more efficient learning and goal achievement.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In hybrid declarative-imperative systems, the Expected Free Energy G(π) for policy π decomposes as: G(π) = -E_Q[ln P(o|s)] + D_KL[Q(s|π)||P(s|C)], where the first term represents pragmatic value (expected log-likelihood of observations given preferences) and the second term represents epistemic value (information gain about states).</li>
                <li>The declarative subsystem maintains a generative model P(o,s) and computes posterior beliefs Q(s|o) over hidden states s given observations o, while the imperative subsystem selects policies π that minimize expected free energy.</li>
                <li>Action selection in the imperative component follows: π* = argmin_π G(π), where policies that reduce uncertainty in declarative beliefs (high epistemic value) are favored when precision of declarative predictions is low.</li>
                <li>The coupling between declarative and imperative components is mediated by precision-weighted prediction errors: ε = γ(o_actual - o_predicted), where γ represents the precision (inverse variance) of declarative predictions.</li>
                <li>When declarative belief precision is high (low uncertainty), the system operates primarily in exploitation mode with pragmatic value dominating policy selection; when precision is low (high uncertainty), epistemic value dominates, driving exploration.</li>
                <li>The system exhibits a natural exploration-exploitation trade-off without explicit mechanisms, emerging from the relative weighting of pragmatic and epistemic components of EFE based on current belief precision.</li>
                <li>Declarative belief updating follows variational inference: Q*(s) = argmin_Q F(Q), where F is variational free energy, while imperative policy selection minimizes expected free energy: π* = argmin_π E_Q[G(π,τ)] over future time horizons τ.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Active Inference provides a unified framework for perception, action, and learning based on minimizing variational free energy and expected free energy. </li>
    <li>Expected Free Energy decomposes into pragmatic value (expected reward or goal achievement) and epistemic value (expected information gain or uncertainty reduction). </li>
    <li>Biological agents balance exploration and exploitation through uncertainty-driven behavior consistent with epistemic value maximization. </li>
    <li>Precision-weighting of prediction errors is a fundamental mechanism in predictive coding and active inference for balancing different sources of information. </li>
    <li>Hybrid systems combining symbolic and subsymbolic reasoning show advantages in learning efficiency and generalization. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hybrid systems implementing EFE minimization will automatically exhibit exploration behavior when encountering novel situations (low declarative precision) without requiring explicit exploration bonuses or epsilon-greedy strategies.</li>
                <li>The ratio of exploration to exploitation actions will be inversely proportional to the precision of declarative beliefs, measurable as the inverse of entropy H(Q(s)) of the belief distribution.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems will show faster learning curves than pure imperative systems (e.g., model-free RL) in sparse reward environments because epistemic value drives information gathering even without immediate rewards.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing the precision parameter γ in the declarative component will cause the system to shift toward exploitation, while decreasing it will increase exploration, providing a natural mechanism for controlling the exploration-exploitation balance.</li>
                <li>In multi-task learning scenarios, hybrid EFE systems will show positive transfer between tasks that share declarative structure, as epistemic value gained in one task reduces uncertainty relevant to other tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If two hybrid EFE systems interact in a shared environment, they might develop emergent communication protocols to share declarative knowledge, thereby reducing each other's epistemic uncertainty more efficiently than individual exploration, but the stability and efficiency of such protocols is unknown.</li>
                <li>In hierarchical hybrid systems with multiple levels of declarative-imperative coupling, EFE minimization might propagate across levels in unexpected ways, potentially creating emergent goal structures or meta-learning behaviors not explicitly programmed.</li>
                <li>The theory predicts that hybrid systems might exhibit 'epistemic phase transitions' where small changes in environmental complexity cause sudden shifts between exploration-dominated and exploitation-dominated regimes, but whether these transitions are smooth or catastrophic is unclear.</li>
                <li>If the declarative component can represent counterfactual scenarios, the system might engage in 'mental exploration' (planning) that reduces epistemic uncertainty without physical actions, potentially leading to dramatically more sample-efficient learning, but the computational tractability and effectiveness of this approach at scale is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a hybrid system with EFE minimization does not show increased exploration when declarative uncertainty is high (low precision), this would challenge the precision-weighted coupling mechanism.</li>
                <li>If artificially fixing the exploration-exploitation balance (e.g., with epsilon-greedy) produces better performance than EFE-driven balance, this would question whether EFE decomposition provides optimal behavior.</li>
                <li>If the system does not show faster learning than model-free methods in sparse reward environments, this would challenge the claim that epistemic value provides advantages in such settings.</li>
                <li>If removing the declarative component and using only imperative learning with intrinsic motivation produces equivalent performance, this would suggest the hybrid architecture is not necessary for the predicted benefits.</li>
                <li>If the precision parameter γ does not reliably control exploration-exploitation balance as predicted, this would challenge the precision-weighting mechanism of the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how the precision parameter γ should be learned or adapted over time, though meta-learning approaches are possible. </li>
    <li>The computational complexity of computing Expected Free Energy over long time horizons in large state spaces is not addressed, which may limit practical applicability. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle conflicts between declarative and imperative components when they suggest different actions, beyond the EFE minimization framework. </li>
    <li>The mechanism for determining the appropriate time horizon τ for EFE computation is not specified and may require domain-specific tuning. </li>
