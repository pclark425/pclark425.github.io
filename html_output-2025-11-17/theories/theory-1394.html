                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Multi-Stage Error Decorrelation in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when language models engage in iterative self-reflection, each stage acts to decorrelate the current output from the error patterns of previous outputs. Through a process analogous to multi-stage error correction in signal processing, the model identifies, isolates, and reduces the influence of prior error modes, leading to progressive improvement in answer quality. The process is not merely error correction, but a systematic reduction of error correlation across iterations, resulting in more robust and accurate outputs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
