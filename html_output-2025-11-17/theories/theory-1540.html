                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Engineering for Effective Metric Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by manipulating the quantum vacuum using advanced, but plausible, electromagnetic or material technologies, it is possible to induce local changes in the effective metric of spacetime. These changes can create regions where the effective speed of light is increased, allowing FTL travel for spacecraft within these engineered domains, without violating causality or requiring negative energy densities.</p>
