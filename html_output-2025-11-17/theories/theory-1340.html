                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, perform a form of self-optimization by recursively evaluating and modifying their outputs. Through each iteration, the model leverages both its prior outputs and internal representations to identify errors, inconsistencies, or suboptimal reasoning, and then generates improved responses. This process is analogous to a form of meta-cognition, where the model acts as both generator and critic, leading to emergent improvements in answer quality and reasoning depth.</p>
