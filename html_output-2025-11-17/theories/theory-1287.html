                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1287</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that optimally balances semantic completeness with representational efficiency, following the information bottleneck principle. The representation should retain all information relevant to the downstream tasks (sufficient statistics) while minimizing irrelevant or redundant details, thus maximizing both model performance and training efficiency.</p>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models trained on highly compressed, task-specific representations consistently underperform compared to those trained on full representations, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If adding irrelevant information to the representation improves model performance, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of representation compression on model interpretability and robustness is not directly addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for the potential benefits of redundancy in representations for error correction. </li>
