                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most robust way to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories is through an iterative adversarial process, where both human and machine-generated counterexamples, refinements, and falsification attempts are systematically incorporated. The process continues until the theory is either falsified or reaches a stable, adversarially robust form.</p>
