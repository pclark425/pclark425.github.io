                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Thresholds and Modularization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models develop the capacity for strict logical reasoning only after surpassing certain critical thresholds in representational capacity and training data diversity. At these thresholds, the model's internal architecture spontaneously modularizes, with distinct subnetworks or neuron groups specializing for different logical operations and reasoning strategies. This modularization is both a necessary and sufficient condition for robust, compositional logical reasoning, and is triggered by the interaction of model scale, data complexity, and training objectives.</p>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding models that perform strict logical reasoning without modularization would falsify the sufficiency claim.</li>
