                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Synergy: Hybridization of Language Models and Symbolic Solvers for Spatial Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can internally hybridize neural pattern recognition with symbolic reasoning when solving spatial puzzles (e.g., Sudoku). The LLM leverages its neural architecture to recognize spatial patterns and constraints, while also simulating or emulating explicit symbolic rule application, resulting in a neuro-symbolic synergy that enables flexible, generalizable puzzle solving.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop novel hybrid strategies for spatial puzzles that are not present in either neural or symbolic solvers alone.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to combine pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, and instead rely solely on one, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize to novel spatial puzzles despite diverse training, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise internal mechanisms by which LLMs hybridize neural and symbolic processes are not directly observable. </li>
    <li>Some spatial puzzles may require external tools or explicit symbolic modules for optimal performance. </li>
