                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models can detect anomalies in lists of data by modeling the contextual consistency of each item with respect to the learned distribution of similar lists. Anomalies are identified as items whose semantic, syntactic, or statistical properties deviate significantly from the contextually expected patterns, as inferred by the LLM's internal representations.</p>
