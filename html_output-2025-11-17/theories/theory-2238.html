                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2238</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Integration Theory for LLM Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the optimal evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a dynamic, context-sensitive integration of multiple evaluation dimensions, where the weighting and interaction of these dimensions are adaptively determined by the scientific domain, task, and uncertainty profile. The theory posits that static, one-size-fits-all evaluation frameworks are insufficient, and that meta-evaluation (i.e., evaluation of the evaluation process itself) is necessary to ensure ongoing alignment with evolving scientific standards and LLM capabilities.</p>
