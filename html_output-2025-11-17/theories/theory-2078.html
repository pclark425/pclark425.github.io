                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Scientific Law Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can autonomously synthesize new, generalizable quantitative laws by integrating extracted data, contextual knowledge, and latent patterns across disciplines. The LLM acts as a meta-analyst, identifying convergent relationships and proposing candidate laws that unify disparate findings.</p>
