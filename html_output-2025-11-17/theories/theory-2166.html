                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Guided Synthesis Theory for LLM-Based Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill scientific theories from scholarly papers by identifying, extracting, and synthesizing explicit and implicit constraints (e.g., empirical regularities, boundary conditions, exceptions) present in the literature. The LLM uses these constraints to guide the construction of candidate theories, ensuring that the resulting theories are consistent with observed evidence and known limitations. The process is guided by both user queries and the LLM's internal representation of scientific norms, enabling the generation of theories that are both explanatory and falsifiable.</p>
