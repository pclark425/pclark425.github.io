                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Automated research systems exist on a spectrum of validation rigor, from pure fabrication (inventing results) through simulation/computation to full experimental validation. Systems that generate fabricated or purely simulated results without experimental grounding create a systematic gap between reported performance and actual scientific validity. This gap is particularly problematic for evaluating transformational discoveries because: (1) fabricated results cannot be independently verified experimentally, (2) systems may hallucinate plausible but incorrect findings, (3) the distinction between genuine discovery and convincing fabrication becomes blurred, and (4) domain norms for what constitutes valid evidence vary significantly. The size and importance of this gap depends critically on the domain: in pure mathematics and theoretical physics, computational/logical validation may suffice; in experimental sciences, physical validation is essential. Systems should be characterized along a validation spectrum from 'hypothetical/proposed' (fabricated) through 'computationally validated' (simulation) to 'experimentally validated' (real experiments).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems that generate fabricated experimental results without any validation cannot produce validated scientific discoveries, only hypotheses requiring verification.</li>
                <li>The fabrication-validation gap increases with the complexity and novelty of the claimed discovery, as more complex claims are harder to validate computationally.</li>
                <li>Automated systems with fabrication capabilities create ethical risks of scientific misconduct if outputs are not clearly labeled as speculative or unvalidated.</li>
                <li>The credibility of discoveries from systems with fabrication capabilities is fundamentally limited until independent experimental or rigorous computational validation is performed.</li>
                <li>Fabrication-validation gaps create a systematic bias toward overestimating the success rate of automated discovery systems when evaluated only by simulated peer review.</li>
                <li>High-fidelity physics-based simulations can provide valid results in domains where first-principles models are accurate (e.g., orbital mechanics, protein folding with sufficient data).</li>
                <li>In pure mathematics and formal systems, computational validation through proof or high-precision numerical verification can substitute for experimental validation.</li>
                <li>The validation hierarchy from weakest to strongest is: pure fabrication < low-fidelity simulation < high-fidelity simulation < computational validation against known results < experimental validation.</li>
                <li>Systems that integrate real experimental execution produce more credible and accepted discoveries than those relying solely on fabrication or simulation.</li>
                <li>Domain norms determine what constitutes sufficient validation: mathematics requires proof, physics may accept high-fidelity simulation, biology and chemistry typically require experimental validation.</li>
            </ol>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems that integrate real experimental execution will produce discoveries with higher acceptance rates in experimental sciences than those relying on fabricated results, even if computational performance metrics are similar.</li>
                <li>The acceptance rate for discoveries from fabrication-capable systems will be significantly lower than for systems with integrated experimental validation in biology, chemistry, and materials science.</li>
                <li>Detection methods for fabricated results will become increasingly important and sophisticated as automated research systems proliferate.</li>
                <li>Journals and conferences will develop stricter disclosure requirements for AI-generated research, requiring clear labeling of fabricated vs. validated results.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems that use fabrication for rapid hypothesis generation followed by experimental validation will outperform pure fabrication or pure experimental approaches in discovery throughput.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether fabricated results could serve as useful hypotheses for guiding experimental research despite their lack of validity, potentially accelerating discovery if used appropriately.</li>
                <li>Whether the fabrication-validation gap could be closed through sufficiently accurate simulation without real experiments in currently experimental-dependent domains like drug discovery.</li>
                <li>Whether certain types of discoveries (e.g., theoretical predictions, mathematical conjectures) could be valid despite originating from fabrication-capable systems if they are later proven or validated.</li>
                <li>Whether the scientific community will develop new validation standards that accept high-fidelity simulation as equivalent to experimental validation in some domains.</li>
                <li>Whether automated systems could develop internal validation mechanisms (e.g., consistency checking, uncertainty quantification) that reduce the fabrication-validation gap without external experiments.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that fabricated results from automated systems are as reliable as real experimental results in predicting outcomes would challenge the theory's core premise.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that fabrication-capable systems produce discoveries accepted at the same rate as experimentally-validated systems in experimental sciences would contradict the credibility limitation.</li>
                <li>Showing that fabrication-validation gaps do not increase with discovery complexity would undermine the scaling concern.</li>
                <li>Finding that high-fidelity simulations are systematically unreliable even in domains where first-principles models are thought to be accurate would challenge the simulation validation pathway.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that mathematical conjectures from automated systems are no more likely to be provable than random conjectures would challenge the validity of computational discovery in formal domains.</li>
            </ol>
