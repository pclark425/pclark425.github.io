                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Distributed Constraint Propagation: Parallelized Reasoning in LLMs for Spatial Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs solve spatial puzzles by distributing constraint propagation across their network layers and attention heads, enabling parallel evaluation of multiple constraints and candidate eliminations. Rather than sequential symbolic reasoning, LLMs leverage their architecture to perform many constraint checks and updates simultaneously, resulting in rapid convergence to valid solutions.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Interventions that disrupt parallel processing (e.g., pruning attention heads) will degrade LLM performance on spatial puzzles.</li>
                <li>LLMs will outperform sequential symbolic solvers in wall-clock time and number of inference steps for constraint satisfaction.</li>
                <li>Attention maps will show distributed focus on multiple constraints during puzzle solving.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Will increasing the number of attention heads or layers further improve parallel constraint satisfaction in LLMs?</li>
                <li>Can distributed constraint propagation be leveraged for even more complex spatial or combinatorial puzzles?</li>
                <li>Are there limits to the number of constraints that can be effectively propagated in parallel before performance degrades?</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show distributed attention or parallel constraint evaluation during puzzle solving, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs require as many or more steps than symbolic solvers, the rapid convergence law would be falsified.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The exact mapping between specific attention heads/layers and particular constraints is not fully characterized. </li>
    <li>The impact of architectural variations (e.g., depth, width) on parallel constraint propagation is not specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory proposes a novel, distributed mechanism for constraint satisfaction in LLMs, distinct from both symbolic and prior neural approaches.</p>
