                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Hybrid Memory Architecture Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents in text games achieve optimal performance by employing a hierarchical hybrid memory system, combining fast-access working memory, structured episodic memory, and long-term semantic memory. The architecture dynamically allocates and retrieves information across these layers based on task demands, context window constraints, and the agent's evolving understanding of the game world.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Emergent meta-memory strategies (e.g., memory rehearsal, prioritization) may arise in agents with sufficiently flexible hybrid memory.</li>
                <li>Unexpected memory interference effects may occur when episodic and semantic memories are not properly disentangled.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with flat memory architectures perform as well as those with hierarchical hybrid memory, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If cross-layer retrieval introduces significant latency or errors, the theory's assumptions about efficiency would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts between episodic and semantic memory when both contain contradictory information. </li>
