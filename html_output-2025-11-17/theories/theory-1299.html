                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1299</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Motif-Driven Abstraction Theory for Graph-to-Text Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that constructing graph-to-text representations using a hierarchy of motifs—where small, simple motifs are recursively composed into larger, more complex substructures—enables language models to efficiently learn and reason about both local and global graph properties. Such hierarchical motif abstraction reduces representational redundancy, supports compositional generalization, and allows LMs to scale to larger and more complex graphs.</p>
