                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual-Relational LLM Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when provided with structured representations of list data and their inter-item relationships, can detect anomalies by modeling both local and global contextual dependencies. The LLM leverages its pre-trained knowledge to infer expected patterns, and deviations from these patterns—whether statistical, semantic, or relational—are flagged as anomalies. The theory emphasizes the importance of relational context and the LLM's ability to generalize across diverse list structures.</p>
