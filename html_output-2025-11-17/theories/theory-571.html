                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLMs can be used to distill theories from examining large numbers of scholarly papers on a specific topic, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Retrieval systems that leverage citation graph structure in addition to semantic similarity achieve substantially higher recall and discover more relevant papers than semantic-only or citation-only approaches. The benefit is particularly pronounced for finding methodologically related papers and tracking research lineages.</p>

    <li>RL training improved recall by ~6.24% on AutoScholarQuery and ~19.96% on RealScholarQuery compared to imitation-only training (which included citation expansion). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4609.html#e4609.1" class="evidence-link">[e4609.1]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A retrieval system that combines semantic search with 2-hop citation traversal will achieve 20-25% higher recall than semantic search alone on finding methodologically related papers.</li>
                <li>Forward citation traversal will be 30-40% more effective than backward traversal for finding recent methodological improvements, while backward traversal will be 30-40% more effective for finding foundational papers.</li>
                <li>Citation traversal beyond 3 hops will add less than 5% additional recall while increasing noise by 20-30%, making it inefficient for most literature synthesis tasks.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems that use citation graphs to re-rank semantically retrieved papers will achieve 10-15% improvement in precision compared to semantic ranking alone.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether citation-graph-based retrieval can effectively identify paradigm shifts or revolutionary papers that are initially under-cited remains unknown and could have significant implications for discovering breakthrough research.</li>
                <li>The optimal weighting between semantic similarity and citation-based relevance may vary significantly by field (e.g., fast-moving fields like ML vs. slower fields like mathematics) in ways not yet characterized.</li>
                <li>Whether temporal citation patterns (citation velocity, acceleration) can improve retrieval beyond static citation counts is unclear but could enable better identification of emerging important work.</li>
                <li>The extent to which citation-based retrieval can overcome biases in semantic embeddings (e.g., favoring certain writing styles or institutions) is unknown but could be important for fair literature synthesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that semantic-only retrieval consistently matches or exceeds the recall of citation-augmented retrieval would challenge the Citation Traversal Recall Enhancement Law.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that forward and backward citations provide equivalent types of information would challenge the Bidirectional Citation Asymmetry Law.</li>
                <li>Showing that citation traversal beyond 3 hops continues to provide substantial marginal gains would challenge the Citation Depth Diminishing Returns Law.</li>
                <li>Finding that citation-based retrieval introduces systematic biases that harm synthesis quality would challenge the overall theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how to handle papers with unusual citation patterns (e.g., highly cited but methodologically irrelevant papers, or under-cited but important papers). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4396.html#e4396.0" class="evidence-link">[e4396.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4609.html#e4609.1" class="evidence-link">[e4609.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of citation context (why a paper cites another) is not addressed, though this could significantly improve retrieval precision. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4445.html#e4445.2" class="evidence-link">[e4445.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4523.html#e4523.1" class="evidence-link">[e4523.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for temporal dynamics in citation patterns (e.g., citation velocity, sleeping beauties). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4396.html#e4396.0" class="evidence-link">[e4396.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Cross-domain citation patterns and their implications for interdisciplinary synthesis are not explained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4582.html#e4582.5" class="evidence-link">[e4582.5]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory builds on established bibliometrics and citation analysis but provides novel quantitative laws specific to LLM-based literature synthesis. The specific findings about recall improvements, bidirectional asymmetry, and diminishing returns represent new empirical contributions.</p>
