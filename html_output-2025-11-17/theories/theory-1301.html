                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1301</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Motif-Driven Locality Enhancement Theory for Hard Graph Problems (Generalized Constraint Propagation Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant of the theory asserts that ideal graph-to-text representations for hard graph problems should not only encode motifs, but also explicitly represent the propagation of constraints through these motifs. By making the flow of local and global constraints through motif interconnections explicit in the text, language models can better simulate the reasoning steps required for solving hard graph problems, leading to improved accuracy and interpretability.</p>
