                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1506</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Multimodal Simulation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is represented functionally as dynamic, multimodal simulations that flexibly recruit sensory, motor, affective, and abstract systems depending on task demands. Rather than static symbols or fixed graphs, concepts are patterns of potential simulations, with each instance of concept use involving the partial reactivation of relevant perceptual, motor, and affective states, as well as abstract relational schemas. The representational format is thus a dynamic, context-sensitive assembly of modality-specific and amodal components, supporting flexible generalization, context effects, and embodied reasoning.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows that conceptual tasks activate sensory, motor, and affective regions depending on the concept and context. </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and interference effects indicate that perceptual and motor systems are involved in concept use. </li>
    <li>Patients with modality-specific brain damage show selective conceptual deficits (e.g., visual agnosia impairs visual concept features). </li>
    <li>Embodied cognition research demonstrates that simulating actions or perceptions facilitates conceptual processing. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to simulation/embodied theories, this law emphasizes the dynamic, on-the-fly assembly of multimodal and amodal components, not just static grounding.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Simulation and embodied cognition theories propose that concepts are grounded in sensory-motor systems.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the dynamic, context-sensitive assembly of both modality-specific and amodal components, and predicts flexible, task-dependent simulation patterns.</p>

<ol>
    <li>fMRI studies show that the same concept activates different brain regions depending on task (e.g., color vs. action judgments). </li>
    <li>Behavioral studies show that context can prime or suppress specific conceptual features (e.g., 'apple' as red or as edible). </li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training individuals to use novel modalities (e.g., sensory substitution) will lead to incorporation of those modalities into conceptual simulations.</li>
                <li>Artificially inducing context shifts (e.g., via TMS or pharmacological agents) will dynamically alter the pattern of simulation components recruited for a concept.</li>
                <li>In neurodevelopmental disorders, the flexibility of simulation assembly may be reduced, leading to rigid conceptual representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual processing does not recruit modality-specific brain regions even when context demands it, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the pattern of simulation components, the contextual modulation law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If patients with modality-specific lesions do not show corresponding conceptual deficits, the simulation assembly law is unsupported.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how abstract, amodal concepts (e.g., 'justice') are simulated or assembled. </li>
    <li>The mechanism for integrating multiple simultaneous simulation components is not fully detailed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
