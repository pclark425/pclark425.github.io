                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Progress Signal Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by detecting latent signals of scientific progress embedded in the language and structure of recent scientific literature. By aggregating subtle shifts in terminology, citation patterns, and conceptual linkages, LLMs can infer the momentum and maturity of research areas, enabling probabilistic forecasts of imminent breakthroughs.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may detect latent signals in areas overlooked by human experts, leading to surprising forecasts.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
