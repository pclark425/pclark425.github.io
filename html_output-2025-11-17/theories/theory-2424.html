                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2424</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Proteostasis Capacity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic proteostasis capacity, including the efficiency of protein quality control systems (e.g., autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system, chaperones). Neurons with higher baseline proteostasis capacity can better clear or refold misfolded proteins, conferring resistance, while those with lower capacity accumulate toxic aggregates and degenerate.</p>
