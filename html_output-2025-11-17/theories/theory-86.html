                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about hybrid declarative-imperative reasoning systems and their emergent properties, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The effectiveness of integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) into neural reasoning systems depends critically on four interacting factors: (1) domain alignment between KG content and task distribution, (2) the integration method's ability to perform relevance scoring and filtering of KG facts to mitigate knowledge noise, (3) whether the integration allows joint updating of language and graph representations through shared message passing or attention mechanisms, and (4) the architectural approach to handling heterogeneous embedding spaces between symbolic KG structures and neural text representations. Systems that retrieve large, unfiltered KG subgraphs or process KG and text as separate modalities show limited improvements on structured reasoning tasks. In contrast, systems with learned relevance scoring, joint message passing, and mechanisms to control knowledge flow (e.g., visibility matrices, attention-based filtering) show substantial gains, particularly on structured reasoning phenomena like negation, quantification, and multi-hop inference. The marginal benefit of KG integration appears to decrease as language model size increases, but explicit KG integration remains beneficial for tasks requiring precise factual knowledge, structured reasoning, and interpretability.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>KG integration effectiveness is maximized when four conditions are met: (1) high domain alignment between KG content and task distribution, (2) learned relevance scoring that filters irrelevant facts, (3) joint representation updating through shared message passing or attention, and (4) mechanisms to handle heterogeneous embedding spaces.</li>
                <li>Systems that retrieve large, unfiltered KG subgraphs suffer from knowledge noise that degrades performance, with the effect increasing as the number of topic entities or hops increases.</li>
                <li>Joint message passing or attention mechanisms that update both language and graph representations outperform separate processing specifically on structured reasoning tasks (negation, quantification, multi-hop inference), while showing smaller differences on simple factoid questions.</li>
                <li>Domain alignment between KG content and task distribution is necessary but not sufficient for positive transfer; integration method quality (relevance scoring, joint updating) is equally or more important.</li>
                <li>Pre-training on KG-derived text helps when domains align but can hurt when domains mismatch (shifting weight distributions away from target domain), while attention-based injection is more robust to misalignment because it preserves original model weights.</li>
                <li>The marginal benefit of explicit KG integration decreases as language model size increases, but remains significant for tasks requiring precise factual knowledge, structured reasoning, and interpretability.</li>
                <li>Iterative or progressive refinement approaches (iterative fusion, selective expansion) outperform single-pass integration when dealing with large, noisy KGs or complex multi-hop reasoning.</li>
                <li>Mechanisms that explicitly control knowledge flow (visibility matrices, attention-based filtering, relevance scoring) are critical for mitigating knowledge noise and heterogeneous embedding space issues.</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hybrid systems with learned KG subgraph retrieval based on question semantics will outperform fixed k-hop retrieval by 3-5% on multi-hop reasoning tasks, with larger gains as the number of required hops increases.</li>
                <li>Adding relevance scoring to existing KG integration methods (e.g., retrofitting KagNet or MHGRN with QA-GNN-style scoring) will improve performance on tasks with large, noisy knowledge graphs by 2-4%, with larger improvements on structured reasoning phenomena.</li>
                <li>Joint training of language models and graph neural networks will show 4-8% larger improvements on structured reasoning phenomena (negation, quantification, temporal reasoning) than on simple factoid questions, demonstrating the specific value of joint updating for complex reasoning.</li>
                <li>Systems that dynamically adjust KG integration strength based on question type (using a learned gating mechanism) will outperform fixed-integration systems by 2-3% overall, with larger gains on heterogeneous question distributions.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple KG integration methods (e.g., pre-training + attention injection + joint message passing) will show additive or super-additive benefits when domain alignment is high, but diminishing or negative returns when alignment is poor.</li>
                <li>Iterative refinement approaches will show larger benefits over single-pass methods as KG size increases, with the gap widening from ~1% for small KGs to 5-10% for very large KGs (millions of entities).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether very large language models (>100B parameters) can internalize KG knowledge sufficiently to eliminate the need for explicit KG integration on most tasks, or whether explicit KG integration will remain beneficial for specific reasoning types regardless of model size.</li>
                <li>Whether learned relevance scoring can approach or exceed the effectiveness of human-curated KG subgraphs for complex reasoning tasks requiring deep domain expertise.</li>
                <li>Whether joint message passing scales to very large KGs (millions of entities, billions of edges) without prohibitive computational cost, or whether approximations (sampling, hierarchical methods) will be necessary.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-modal KGs (text, images, structured data, temporal information) can be effectively integrated using similar principles, or whether fundamentally different integration methods are needed for different modalities.</li>
                <li>Whether the principles of KG integration effectiveness generalize to other forms of structured knowledge (ontologies, rule bases, constraint systems) or are specific to graph-structured knowledge.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial or out-of-distribution scenarios reveal fundamental limitations in current KG integration methods that are not apparent in standard benchmarks.</li>
                <li>Whether the trade-off between KG integration complexity and benefit changes fundamentally as we move from research benchmarks to real-world applications with noisy, incomplete, and conflicting knowledge sources.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that unfiltered KG retrieval performs as well as relevance-scored retrieval across multiple tasks and KG sizes would challenge the knowledge noise mitigation principle.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that separate KG and text processing achieves equivalent performance to joint updating on structured reasoning tasks would question the necessity of tight integration and joint message passing.</li>
                <li>Showing that domain misalignment can be fully overcome through better integration methods alone (without any domain adaptation or KG filtering) would challenge the domain alignment requirement.</li>
                <li>Finding that KG integration provides no benefit when language models exceed a certain size threshold (e.g., >500B parameters) across all task types would question the long-term necessity of explicit KGs.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that simple concatenation or late fusion of KG and text features performs as well as sophisticated attention-based or message-passing integration would challenge the architectural complexity principle.</li>
                <li>Finding that single-pass integration performs as well as iterative refinement even on large, noisy KGs would question the value of progressive refinement approaches.</li>
                <li>Showing that random or heuristic relevance scoring performs as well as learned relevance scoring would challenge the necessity of learned filtering mechanisms.</li>
