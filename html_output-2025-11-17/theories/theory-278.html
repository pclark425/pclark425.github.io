                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Refinement Theory for LLM Symbolic Output</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Large Language Models can systematically improve the quality and reliability of symbolic outputs (such as state representations, action preconditions, effects, and transition models) through iterative refinement cycles that explicitly incorporate uncertainty estimates. The theory proposes that by repeatedly sampling, evaluating, and refining symbolic outputs based on consistency checks, uncertainty quantification, and feedback from environment interactions, LLMs can converge toward more accurate and stable symbolic world models suitable for planning. The refinement process operates through four primary mechanisms: (1) self-consistency checking across multiple samples to identify stable symbolic patterns, (2) uncertainty-weighted aggregation of symbolic predictions using semantic entropy or token probability distributions, (3) constraint satisfaction verification against domain rules and logical consistency requirements, and (4) feedback integration from planning failures or environment mismatches to correct erroneous symbolic components. The theory predicts that symbolic outputs will exhibit measurable improvements in accuracy, consistency, and planning utility across refinement iterations, with diminishing returns following a power-law or logarithmic curve. Critically, the theory proposes that uncertainty estimates serve as reliable indicators of which symbolic components require further refinement, enabling efficient allocation of computational resources. The refinement process can be viewed as a form of self-supervised learning where the LLM uses its own outputs and consistency signals to bootstrap improved symbolic representations without requiring explicit ground-truth labels for each refinement step.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Symbolic outputs from LLMs (including state representations, action schemas, and transition models) contain inherent uncertainty that can be quantified through multiple sampling, token probabilities, semantic entropy, or semantic consistency measures, with semantic entropy providing the most reliable uncertainty estimates for symbolic content.</li>
                <li>Iterative refinement of symbolic outputs, guided by uncertainty estimates, leads to monotonic or near-monotonic improvements in output quality across refinement cycles until convergence, with the improvement rate dependent on the quality of uncertainty estimates and feedback signals.</li>
                <li>The rate of improvement follows a diminishing returns pattern approximating a power-law (quality ∝ iterations^α where 0 < α < 1) or logarithmic curve (quality ∝ log(iterations)), where early iterations (1-3) provide substantial gains (20-40% improvement) and later iterations (4+) provide marginal improvements (<10% per iteration).</li>
                <li>Self-consistency across multiple samples serves as a reliable proxy for output correctness in symbolic domains, where higher agreement (measured by exact match or semantic equivalence) indicates higher likelihood of accuracy, with correlation coefficients between consistency and correctness typically exceeding 0.7 in structured domains.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty-weighted aggregation of symbolic predictions, where each prediction is weighted by the inverse of its uncertainty score, outperforms simple majority voting or single-sample selection by 10-25% in accuracy when generating world model components.</li>
                <li>Refinement cycles that incorporate feedback from constraint violations, logical inconsistencies, or planning failures converge 2-4x faster than purely sample-based refinement, as execution feedback provides direct error signals rather than indirect consistency signals.</li>
                <li>The optimal number of refinement iterations depends on three primary factors: (1) the complexity of the symbolic domain (measured by state space size and action schema complexity), (2) the base accuracy of the LLM (initial single-shot performance), and (3) the computational budget available, with typical optimal ranges being 3-5 iterations for simple domains and 5-10 iterations for complex domains.</li>
                <li>Symbolic outputs that remain inconsistent across multiple refinement iterations (consistency score < 0.5 after 5+ iterations) indicate fundamental knowledge gaps or ambiguities in the problem specification that require external information or human intervention, serving as a reliable signal for active learning or human-in-the-loop intervention.</li>
                <li>The refinement process exhibits a phase transition behavior where outputs transition from high-variance, low-consistency states to low-variance, high-consistency states, typically occurring between iterations 2-4 for domains within the LLM's knowledge distribution.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty estimates computed at the symbolic component level (individual predicates, action effects, state variables) provide more effective refinement guidance than document-level uncertainty, enabling targeted refinement of problematic components while preserving high-confidence components.</li>
                <li>Feedback integration from planning failures should be weighted by the causal distance between the failure point and the symbolic component being refined, with components directly involved in failed actions receiving higher weight than components several steps removed in the causal chain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Self-consistency methods improve reasoning accuracy in LLMs by sampling multiple reasoning paths and selecting the most consistent answer, demonstrating that iterative sampling can improve output quality and that consistency across samples correlates with correctness. </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification in LLMs through methods like semantic entropy and token probability analysis enables identification of unreliable outputs that may benefit from refinement, with semantic entropy being particularly effective for capturing meaning-level uncertainty. </li>
    <li>Iterative prompting and refinement strategies have been shown to improve task performance in various domains, including code generation and mathematical reasoning, with self-feedback mechanisms enabling autonomous improvement. </li>
    <li>Planning with LLM-generated world models benefits from more accurate symbolic representations of states, actions, and transitions, with world model quality directly impacting planning success rates. </li>
    <li>Ensemble methods and aggregation of multiple LLM outputs can improve reliability and reduce errors in symbolic reasoning tasks, with weighted aggregation outperforming simple voting schemes. </li>
    <li>Verification and constraint checking can identify errors in LLM outputs, providing signals for refinement and correction. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In text-based planning environments (e.g., TextWorld, ALFWorld), applying 3-5 refinement iterations with uncertainty-weighted aggregation will improve action precondition accuracy by 15-30% compared to single-shot generation, with the largest gains (20-30%) occurring in medium-complexity environments with 10-20 objects and 5-10 action types.</li>
                <li>Symbolic state representations refined through self-consistency checking across 10+ samples will exhibit higher correlation with ground-truth states than single-sample outputs, with correlation improvements of 0.1-0.2 (e.g., from 0.65 to 0.80) in typical text game environments, measured by F1 score on state predicate accuracy.</li>
                <li>Planning success rates will increase proportionally to the consistency scores of refined symbolic world models, with a Pearson correlation coefficient above 0.6 between average consistency score and task completion rate across diverse planning problems.</li>
                <li>Refinement iterations that incorporate explicit constraint checking (e.g., verifying action preconditions are satisfiable, checking for logical contradictions in state representations) will converge 2-3x faster than pure sampling-based refinement in structured domains with well-defined rules, requiring 2-3 iterations instead of 5-7 to reach 90% of maximum achievable accuracy.</li>
                <li>The variance in symbolic output quality across different random seeds will decrease significantly (by 40-60%) after iterative refinement compared to single-shot generation, with standard deviation of accuracy scores dropping from 0.15-0.20 to 0.06-0.10.</li>
                <li>Semantic entropy computed over symbolic outputs will decrease by 30-50% from iteration 1 to iteration 5, indicating convergence toward more certain and consistent representations.</li>
                <li>In domains where the LLM has moderate prior knowledge (50-70% initial accuracy), refinement will provide the largest absolute gains (20-30 percentage points), while domains with very high (>85%) or very low (<30%) initial accuracy will show smaller gains (<15 percentage points).</li>
                <li>Targeted refinement of high-uncertainty components (top 20% by semantic entropy) will achieve 80-90% of the benefit of refining all components while requiring only 30-40% of the computational cost.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether iterative refinement can enable LLMs to discover and correct systematic biases in their world models (e.g., consistently misunderstanding certain action types like 'transfer' vs 'move', or failing to model indirect effects) without explicit bias-correction mechanisms or human feedback, potentially through emergent error detection in consistency checking.</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal convergence criterion (e.g., a threshold on the rate of change in consistency scores or uncertainty metrics) that can predict when further refinement iterations will provide negligible improvements (<5% gain) across different symbolic domains, LLM architectures, and task complexities, enabling automatic stopping without domain-specific tuning.</li>
                <li>Whether refinement processes can extrapolate beyond the LLM's training distribution to generate accurate symbolic models for novel environment dynamics not seen during pretraining (e.g., new physical laws, novel action types, or unusual causal relationships), or whether refinement can only improve accuracy within the existing knowledge distribution.</li>
                <li>Whether combining iterative refinement with active learning (where the system queries for human feedback on high-uncertainty symbolic components, specifically those with semantic entropy above the 90th percentile) can achieve near-perfect world model accuracy (>95%) with minimal human intervention (<10 queries per environment), and whether the human feedback generalizes to improve refinement on related components.</li>
                <li>Whether the computational cost of iterative refinement (multiple forward passes, typically 3-10x the cost of single-shot generation) can be amortized across multiple planning episodes to achieve better overall efficiency than single-shot generation with more powerful models, particularly in scenarios with 10+ planning episodes per environment.</li>
                <li>Whether refinement can recover from catastrophically incorrect initial outputs (e.g., completely inverted action effects, fundamentally wrong state representations) or whether there exists a 'point of no return' where initial errors are too severe for consistency-based refinement to correct without external intervention.</li>
                <li>Whether different LLM architectures (e.g., decoder-only vs encoder-decoder, different sizes from 7B to 70B+ parameters) exhibit fundamentally different refinement dynamics, or whether the refinement curves are architecture-invariant when normalized by initial accuracy.</li>
                <li>Whether iterative refinement can enable smaller, more efficient LLMs (e.g., 7B-13B parameter models) to match or exceed the single-shot performance of much larger models (e.g., 70B+ parameters) on symbolic world modeling tasks, potentially democratizing access to high-quality planning systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If symbolic outputs show no improvement or degradation in accuracy after multiple refinement iterations (3-5 cycles) in well-structured domains with clear ground truth (e.g., formal planning domains like Blocksworld or grid-world navigation), this would challenge the core premise that iterative refinement improves output quality.</li>
                <li>If high self-consistency across samples (>0.8 agreement rate) does not correlate with accuracy in symbolic predictions (correlation coefficient <0.3), this would undermine the use of consistency as a refinement signal and suggest that LLMs can be consistently wrong.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty estimates (semantic entropy, token probabilities, or consistency scores) fail to identify which symbolic components would benefit most from refinement (i.e., if high-uncertainty components show no greater improvement than low-uncertainty components after refinement), this would question the uncertainty-guided aspect of the theory.</li>
                <li>If refinement with feedback from planning failures does not converge faster than pure sampling-based refinement (i.e., if both approaches require the same number of iterations to reach equivalent accuracy), this would challenge the value of incorporating execution feedback and suggest that consistency signals alone are sufficient.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of refinement iterations consistently outweighs the benefits in planning performance across diverse environments (i.e., if the improvement in planning success rate does not justify the 3-10x increase in computational cost), this would limit the practical applicability of the theory.</li>
                <li>If refinement causes mode collapse where the diversity of symbolic hypotheses decreases but accuracy does not improve or decreases (e.g., all samples converge to the same incorrect output), this would indicate that the refinement process can be counterproductive.</li>
                <li>If targeted refinement of high-uncertainty components performs worse than uniform refinement of all components, this would challenge the assumption that uncertainty estimates effectively identify problematic components.</li>
                <li>If refinement performance does not transfer across related domains (e.g., if refinement strategies optimized for one text game environment fail to improve performance in similar environments), this would suggest that refinement is highly domain-specific and not generalizable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle cases where the environment itself is stochastic or partially observable, making ground-truth symbolic models inherently uncertain or non-deterministic. In such cases, the notion of 'correct' symbolic output may be ill-defined, and refinement may need to produce probabilistic or multi-modal symbolic representations. </li>
    <li>The optimal balance between exploration (generating diverse symbolic hypotheses through varied sampling strategies or prompts) and exploitation (refining promising hypotheses through focused iteration) during iterative refinement is not explicitly addressed. This exploration-exploitation tradeoff may be critical for avoiding local optima. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for potential mode collapse where iterative refinement converges to a locally optimal but globally suboptimal symbolic representation, particularly when consistency signals reinforce systematic errors present in multiple samples. </li>
    <li>How to handle contradictory feedback signals during refinement (e.g., when consistency checks suggest one modification but planning feedback suggests a different, incompatible modification) is not fully specified. The theory needs a principled approach for resolving conflicts between different feedback sources. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle temporal dynamics in refinement, such as whether to refine all symbolic components simultaneously or sequentially, and whether the order of refinement matters for convergence speed or final accuracy. </li>
    <li>The interaction between refinement and the specific prompting strategy used is not fully characterized. Different prompt formulations may lead to different refinement dynamics, and the theory does not specify how to optimize prompts for refinement. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully address how to initialize the refinement process, particularly whether starting with multiple diverse initial samples is better than starting with a single high-quality sample and then diversifying. </li>
