                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Memory mechanisms that track state visitation (episodic counting) or world coverage (graph-based exploration heuristics) dramatically improve exploration efficiency in text games by: (1) providing intrinsic motivation to visit novel states, (2) enabling agents to avoid redundant revisitation within episodes, (3) supporting systematic exploration strategies, and (4) facilitating generalization to longer/harder games. The effectiveness of exploration memory depends critically on the temporal scope of the memory (episodic vs. cumulative) and integration with the agent's policy.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Episodic memory of state visitation (with episode-boundary resets) provides stronger exploration incentives than cumulative counting because it encourages within-episode novelty seeking without penalizing revisitation across episodes during learning.</li>
                <li>The exploration benefit of memory-driven bonuses scales with environment complexity: in simple environments (<10 states), benefit is <10%; in medium complexity (50-100 states), benefit is 20-40%; in complex environments (>200 states), benefit exceeds 50%.</li>
                <li>Memory-based exploration enables zero-shot generalization to longer/harder games: agents trained with episodic bonuses on length-N games can solve length-2N games with >70% success rate, while agents without exploration memory achieve <30%.</li>
                <li>Graph-based exploration heuristics (detecting unexplored exits, tracking coverage) provide 10-20% additional benefit beyond episodic counting alone by enabling systematic exploration strategies.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of exploration memory requires integration with recurrent policy: episodic bonuses combined with recurrent agents show super-additive benefits (>40% improvement) while episodic bonuses with feedforward policies show sub-additive benefits (<15% improvement).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Episodic discovery bonus (MODEL++) substantially improves exploration and learning compared to cumulative counting or no bonus, especially in medium/hard modes <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.2" class="evidence-link">[e234.2]</a> </li>
    <li>DRQN with episodic bonus generalizes better than non-recurrent baselines and learns to avoid redundant exploration <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.0" class="evidence-link">[e234.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.2" class="evidence-link">[e234.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Episodic count-based intrinsic reward (resetting counts each episode) is more effective than cumulative counting for driving exploration in chain-like text games <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.2" class="evidence-link">[e234.2]</a> </li>
    <li>AriGraph without exploration module shows reduced performance (Treasure Hunt: 0.87 vs 1.0, Cleaning: 0.76 vs 0.79), indicating exploration heuristics contribute to peak performance <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.2" class="evidence-link">[e238.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Exploration-specific functions leveraging memory graph improve efficiency and success in exploration-heavy tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.2" class="evidence-link">[e238.2]</a> </li>
    <li>KG-DQN with graph-based action pruning converges ~40% faster than baselines by reducing redundant exploration <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.0" class="evidence-link">[e230.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Tr-DRQN+ with episodic counting bonus shows +3.6% improvement over baseline, demonstrating exploration benefits <a href="../results/extraction-result-236.html#e236.4" class="evidence-link">[e236.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Action Eliminating Network reduces action-space size to improve exploration efficiency <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.3" class="evidence-link">[e230.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a text game with a large branching factor (>50 actions per state), agents with graph-based action pruning and episodic exploration bonuses will achieve >60% faster convergence than agents with either mechanism alone.</li>
                <li>For procedurally generated games with variable map sizes, agents trained with episodic exploration memory on small maps (10 rooms) will generalize to large maps (30 rooms) with >2x better success rate than agents trained without exploration memory.</li>
                <li>In games with distractor actions (actions that lead to dead-ends), episodic memory will enable agents to learn to avoid distractors within 50% fewer episodes than cumulative counting approaches.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In text games with cyclic map structures (where revisiting states is necessary for progress), episodic counting might over-penalize necessary revisitation, potentially reducing performance by 10-30% compared to more sophisticated exploration strategies - effect unclear.</li>
                <li>For games where optimal strategies require deliberate revisitation patterns (e.g., fetch quests requiring multiple trips), episodic bonuses might interfere with learning, but the magnitude of interference (-5% to -40%) is unknown.</li>
                <li>In highly stochastic environments where the same action from the same state can lead to different outcomes, the benefit of episodic counting may be reduced or eliminated - performance difference might range from -10% to +20%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that episodic exploration bonuses provide no advantage over random exploration in deterministic games would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that cumulative counting consistently outperforms episodic counting across diverse game types would challenge the episodic superiority claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that exploration memory provides no generalization benefit (trained and test performance improvements are equal) would challenge the generalization mechanism.</li>
                <li>Finding that graph-based exploration heuristics provide no benefit beyond episodic counting in exploration-heavy tasks would challenge the systematic exploration claim.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to set the intrinsic reward weight (beta) for episodic bonuses across different game complexities is not systematically characterized <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.2" class="evidence-link">[e234.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction between exploration memory and different RL algorithms (on-policy vs off-policy) is not fully explored <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.0" class="evidence-link">[e234.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.2" class="evidence-link">[e234.2]</a> </li>
    <li>How exploration memory scales to very large state spaces (>10,000 states) is not empirically validated <a href="../results/extraction-result-234.html#e234.2" class="evidence-link">[e234.2]</a> </li>
