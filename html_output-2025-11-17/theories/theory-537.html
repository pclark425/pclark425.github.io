                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Human-LLM Hybrid Evaluation Theory for Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the most robust and reliable evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is achieved through a hybrid pipeline that combines automated LLM-based evaluation modules with targeted human expert validation. Automated modules provide scalable, aspect-specific feedback and initial scoring, while human experts are used for calibration, spot-checking, and adjudication of ambiguous or high-impact cases. The theory claims that this hybrid approach maximizes both scalability and reliability, and is necessary to address the limitations of both fully-automated and fully-human evaluation, especially for open-ended, high-novelty scientific outputs.</p>

                <li>If a hybrid evaluation pipeline is used, the overall reliability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation will be higher than with either fully-automated or fully-human evaluation alone.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If the proportion of human-in-the-loop validation is reduced below a certain threshold, the reliability of the evaluation pipeline may degrade in unpredictable ways.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are improved to near-perfect alignment, the need for human expert validation may become negligible for most cases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a fully-automated pipeline achieves the same reliability as a hybrid pipeline (as measured by human expert agreement), the theory's claim about the necessity of human-in-the-loop is falsified.</li>
                <li>If human experts systematically disagree with LLM-based evaluation even after calibration, the hybrid approach may not achieve high reliability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the cost and scalability trade-offs of human-in-the-loop validation for very large-scale or real-time evaluation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.1" class="evidence-link">[e3819.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3814.html#e3814.3" class="evidence-link">[e3814.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle cases where human experts themselves disagree or are unavailable. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3819.html#e3819.1" class="evidence-link">[e3819.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3814.html#e3814.3" class="evidence-link">[e3814.3]</a> </li>
