                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Synergy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by maintaining and leveraging a hierarchical memory system that integrates both episodic (event-specific) and semantic (generalized knowledge) memories. The agent dynamically determines the appropriate level of abstraction for memory retrieval and storage, allowing it to generalize from past experiences while retaining the ability to recall specific details when necessary. The synergy between episodic and semantic memory enables flexible adaptation to both familiar and novel tasks.</p>
