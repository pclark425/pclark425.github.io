                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1990</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Abstraction via LLM-Driven Cross-Document Pattern Mining</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large, diverse scholarly corpora, can identify and abstract recurring qualitative patterns across documents, even when these patterns are not explicitly stated in any single source. By leveraging their ability to synthesize information from disparate contexts, LLMs can generate higher-level qualitative laws that capture emergent regularities, thus enabling the discovery of novel scientific principles.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover truly novel scientific laws that have not been previously recognized by human researchers.</li>
                <li>LLMs may generate cross-domain laws that lead to new interdisciplinary research directions.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to abstract shared patterns across documents, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate meaningful cross-domain generalizations, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may miss subtle or non-obvious patterns if the corpus lacks sufficient diversity or coverage. </li>
    <li>LLMs may overgeneralize and propose spurious laws if analogies are superficial. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
