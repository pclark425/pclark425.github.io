                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Self-Reflection as a Calibration and Bias Amplification Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that self-reflection in language models acts as a double-edged process: it can calibrate answers by identifying and correcting errors, but it can also amplify pre-existing biases if the reflection process is not sufficiently diverse or critical. The outcome depends on the diversity and quality of the reflective process, the model's prior knowledge, and the structure of the prompts.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Self-reflection will improve calibration only if the reflection process is sufficiently critical and diverse.</li>
                <li>Homogeneous or uncritical self-reflection will amplify pre-existing biases in LLM outputs.</li>
                <li>Introducing explicit diversity in reflective prompts will reduce bias amplification.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be a threshold of diversity or criticality required for calibration to outweigh bias amplification.</li>
                <li>The effect of self-reflection on bias may depend on the domain or topic (e.g., controversial vs. factual).</li>
                <li>Repeated self-reflection cycles may eventually converge to either a well-calibrated or highly biased answer, depending on initial conditions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If self-reflection always improves calibration regardless of diversity, the bias amplification law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If bias amplification occurs even with highly diverse reflection, the theory's conditional structure is undermined.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection has no effect on calibration or bias, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs introduce new types of errors during self-reflection, unrelated to initial bias or calibration. </li>
    <li>Instances where external feedback (e.g., human-in-the-loop) interacts with self-reflection in unpredictable ways. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
