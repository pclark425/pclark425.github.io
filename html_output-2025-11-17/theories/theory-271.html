                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Decomposition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments should be decomposed into hierarchical, modular structures that align with the natural compositional structure of language and the uncertainty characteristics of LLMs. Specifically, the theory posits that world models should be decomposed into: (1) entity-level modules that track objects and their properties with associated uncertainty distributions, (2) relation-level modules that capture spatial, temporal, and logical relationships between entities, and (3) action-effect modules that model state transitions. This structured decomposition enables more efficient uncertainty propagation during planning because uncertainty can be tracked and updated locally within modules rather than globally across the entire world state. The theory predicts that planning algorithms that exploit this modular structure will be more robust to LLM errors and more computationally efficient than monolithic world model approaches.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Decomposing world models into entity, relation, and action-effect modules creates natural boundaries for uncertainty isolation, where uncertainty in one module has limited impact on others when they are conditionally independent.</li>
                <li>LLM uncertainty in parsing text descriptions propagates more predictably through structured decomposed models than through monolithic representations, following the conditional independence structure of the modules.</li>
                <li>Planning efficiency improves when the planner can selectively update only the modules affected by new information or actions, rather than recomputing the entire world state distribution.</li>
                <li>The optimal granularity of decomposition depends on the trade-off between module independence (finer decomposition) and the overhead of managing inter-module dependencies (coarser decomposition).</li>
                <li>Structured decomposition enables targeted uncertainty reduction strategies where information gathering can focus on high-uncertainty modules that are critical for the current planning objective.</li>
                <li>Module-level uncertainty estimates provide more actionable information for planning than global world-state uncertainty because they indicate which aspects of the world model are unreliable.</li>
                <li>The computational complexity of uncertainty propagation in planning scales with the number of inter-module dependencies rather than the total size of the world state when using structured decomposition.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Compositional structure in language naturally maps to modular representations, and LLMs exhibit compositional generalization capabilities that can be leveraged for structured world modeling. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical and modular representations improve sample efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning and planning tasks. </li>
    <li>Uncertainty in neural language models can be better calibrated and propagated when using structured prediction approaches compared to flat representations. </li>
    <li>Modular architectures enable more interpretable uncertainty quantification by isolating sources of uncertainty to specific components. </li>
    <li>Planning under uncertainty benefits from factored representations that exploit conditional independence structure in the world model. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In household task planning from natural language instructions, decomposing the world model into separate modules for objects, spatial relations, and action effects will reduce planning failures by 30-50% compared to monolithic world models when LLM parsing errors are present.</li>
                <li>When an LLM misidentifies a single object in a scene description, a structured decomposed model will contain the error to the entity module for that object, allowing correct planning for actions involving other objects, while a monolithic model will show cascading errors.</li>
                <li>The computational time for replanning after receiving new information will scale logarithmically with world state size in structured decomposed models (due to selective module updates) versus linearly in monolithic models.</li>
                <li>Active learning strategies that query for information about high-uncertainty modules will achieve the same planning success rate with 40-60% fewer queries than strategies that don't exploit the modular structure.</li>
                <li>In multi-step planning tasks, uncertainty will accumulate more slowly in structured decomposed models because errors in irrelevant modules don't propagate to the current planning context.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the optimal decomposition structure is domain-specific or whether there exists a universal decomposition schema that works across diverse text environments (navigation, manipulation, social interaction) remains unclear and would have major implications for system design.</li>
                <li>The extent to which LLMs can automatically learn to produce appropriately structured decomposed world models from text, versus requiring hand-engineered decomposition schemas, could determine the practical scalability of this approach.</li>
                <li>Whether structured decomposition provides benefits for very simple environments with few entities and relations, or whether there is a complexity threshold below which the overhead outweighs the benefits, is unknown.</li>
                <li>How structured decomposition interacts with different planning algorithms (classical planning, Monte Carlo tree search, model-predictive control) may reveal that some algorithms benefit much more than others, with implications for algorithm selection.</li>
                <li>Whether humans naturally decompose world models in similar ways when planning from language instructions could provide insights into cognitive architectures and inform more effective decomposition strategies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If planning performance with structured decomposed models is not significantly better than monolithic models when LLM uncertainty is high, the core premise of the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the computational overhead of managing inter-module dependencies and uncertainty propagation exceeds the savings from selective updates, the efficiency claims would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty does not remain localized to modules but instead propagates broadly across the decomposed structure, the isolation benefit would not materialize.</li>
                <li>If the optimal decomposition structure varies dramatically across different instances within the same domain, the practical utility of the approach would be limited.</li>
                <li>If end-to-end learned models that don't use explicit symbolic decomposition achieve comparable or better performance, it would suggest the structured symbolic approach is not necessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle cross-module dependencies that create tight coupling, such as when an object's identity determines which relations are possible. </li>
    <li>Dynamic environments where the appropriate decomposition structure itself changes over time (e.g., objects merging or splitting) are not addressed. </li>
    <li>The interaction between decomposition granularity and the expressiveness of the symbolic representation language is not fully characterized. </li>
    <li>How to handle situations where the LLM provides information that doesn't fit cleanly into the predefined module structure is not specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
