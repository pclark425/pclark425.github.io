                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Abstraction in Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that sufficiently large and well-trained language models can develop internal representations that approximate algorithmic procedures for arithmetic, allowing for partial generalization beyond memorized patterns. This emergent capability arises from the model's exposure to diverse arithmetic data and the inductive biases of the transformer architecture.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be a critical scale threshold beyond which algorithmic generalization for arithmetic emerges abruptly.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on arithmetic in novel bases, it is unknown whether algorithmic abstraction will generalize to all bases.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing model scale does not improve generalization to novel arithmetic, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If internal representations do not encode algorithmic steps even in large models, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If models trained on diverse arithmetic data do not generalize to new formats, this would call the theory into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small models show limited generalization, suggesting that scale is not the only factor. </li>
    <li>Prompting strategies can sometimes enable generalization in smaller models. </li>
