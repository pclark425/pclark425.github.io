                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2260</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Evaluation Robustness Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation depend on the robustness of the multidimensional evaluation process. It posits that robustness is achieved when the evaluation outcome is stable under reasonable variations in dimension definitions, weighting, and aggregation methods, and that systematic sensitivity analysis is necessary to ensure that no single dimension or aggregation choice unduly dominates the evaluation.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If new, unforeseen dimensions are introduced, the robustness of the evaluation process may be unpredictably affected.</li>
                <li>If LLMs themselves are used to define evaluation dimensions, the process may become less robust due to model biases.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation outcomes are highly sensitive to minor changes in dimension weights or aggregation, the theory's robustness law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If a single dimension consistently determines the outcome regardless of other dimensions, the dominance avoidance law is called into question.</li>
