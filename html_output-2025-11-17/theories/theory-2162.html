                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs achieve robust open information extraction and theory distillation by systematically identifying, surfacing, and resolving contradictions across scholarly papers. Mission-focused instructions that explicitly require contradiction detection and reconciliation enable LLMs to filter out spurious or context-dependent laws, resulting in more universally valid scientific theories.</p>

                <li>LLMs will surface context-dependent or spurious laws as exceptions or special cases when contradiction resolution is enabled.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously develop new meta-laws about the conditions under which contradictions arise in scientific literature.</li>
                <li>Contradiction resolution may enable LLMs to identify previously unrecognized scientific paradigms or subfields.</li>
                <li>The process may reveal systematic biases or gaps in the scientific literature.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If contradiction resolution does not improve the robustness of extracted laws, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot reliably detect or resolve contradictions, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If filtering out contradictory laws does not increase the universality of the remaining laws, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of ambiguous or poorly defined contradictions on LLM performance is not fully explained. </li>
    <li>The effect of LLM scale and training data on contradiction resolution ability is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
