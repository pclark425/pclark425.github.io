                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Drift Through Translation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about faithfulness gaps between natural language descriptions and code implementations in automated experimentation.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faithfulness gaps between natural language descriptions and code implementations arise from systematic semantic drift that occurs during the translation process itself. The theory identifies multiple drift mechanisms: (1) Lexical ambiguity - natural language terms map to multiple possible code constructs, and translators must choose without perfect information; (2) Abstraction level mismatch - natural language operates at variable abstraction levels while code requires precise specification at a single level; (3) Implicit assumption externalization - natural language can leave assumptions implicit while code must make them explicit, forcing translators to infer and potentially misinterpret; (4) Operational semantics gap - natural language describes what should happen while code specifies how it happens, requiring translators to bridge this gap; and (5) Cumulative error propagation - small translation choices early in implementation constrain and potentially distort later choices. The theory predicts that drift accumulates non-linearly through the translation process, with early decisions having outsized impact on final faithfulness.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Semantic drift accumulates non-linearly during translation, with drift magnitude D(n) > k*n where n is the number of translation decisions and k is a constant, indicating super-linear growth.</li>
                <li>Early translation decisions (architectural choices, data structure selections) have disproportionate impact on final faithfulness compared to later decisions (parameter naming, comment style).</li>
                <li>Lexical ambiguity in natural language creates branching points in translation where each branch leads to semantically distinct implementations, with drift proportional to the number and significance of ambiguous terms.</li>
                <li>The abstraction level gap between natural language (which can freely mix abstraction levels) and code (which requires consistent abstraction) forces translators to make normalization decisions that introduce systematic drift.</li>
                <li>Implicit assumptions in natural language descriptions must be externalized in code, and the probability of incorrect externalization increases exponentially with the number of implicit assumptions.</li>
                <li>Automated translation systems exhibit 2-5x higher semantic drift than expert human translators due to reduced ability to infer implicit assumptions and resolve ambiguities using domain knowledge.</li>
                <li>The operational semantics gap (what vs. how) requires translators to invent algorithmic details not specified in natural language, with each invented detail being a potential source of drift.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Studies of machine translation show that semantic drift increases with translation distance and complexity, with errors compounding through multi-step processes. </li>
    <li>Research on program synthesis demonstrates that natural language specifications are inherently ambiguous and lead to multiple valid but semantically different implementations. </li>
    <li>Analysis of scientific method descriptions shows that they systematically omit implementation details that are considered 'obvious' within the research community but are not obvious to implementers. </li>
    <li>Studies of code comprehension reveal that programmers must infer implicit assumptions and design decisions from natural language descriptions, leading to systematic variation in implementations. </li>
    <li>Research on reproducibility in computational science shows that implementations of the same algorithm from natural language descriptions often produce different results due to translation choices. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Measuring semantic drift at multiple points during the translation process will show non-linear accumulation, with steeper increases after architectural decisions are made.</li>
                <li>Providing translators with explicit disambiguation prompts at high-ambiguity lexical items will reduce final implementation drift by 20-40%.</li>
                <li>Implementations that defer architectural decisions until more context is available will show reduced drift compared to those that make early commitments.</li>
                <li>Standardizing the abstraction level of natural language descriptions (e.g., requiring all descriptions at pseudocode level) will reduce translation drift.</li>
                <li>Explicitly listing implicit assumptions in natural language descriptions will reduce implementation variance across different translators.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Using iterative refinement approaches where initial translations are validated and corrected might reduce drift or might amplify it if corrections introduce new inconsistencies.</li>
                <li>Providing translators with multiple example implementations might reduce drift by clarifying ambiguities or might increase drift by biasing translators toward specific interpretations.</li>
                <li>Using ensemble approaches where multiple translators independently implement and results are merged might reduce drift through averaging or might increase it through inconsistent merge decisions.</li>
                <li>Automated detection of high-drift-risk translation points (high ambiguity, many implicit assumptions) might enable targeted intervention, but the effectiveness of such interventions is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that semantic drift accumulates linearly rather than non-linearly would challenge the cumulative error propagation mechanism.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that early and late translation decisions have equal impact on final faithfulness would undermine the theory's prediction about disproportionate early decision impact.</li>
                <li>Showing that automated systems achieve equal or lower drift than expert human translators would question the role of domain knowledge and inference in reducing drift.</li>
                <li>Finding that making implicit assumptions explicit does not reduce implementation variance would challenge the assumption externalization mechanism.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that lexical ambiguity does not correlate with implementation variance would undermine the lexical ambiguity drift mechanism.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain why some highly ambiguous natural language descriptions nonetheless lead to consistent implementations across translators. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for cases where semantic drift actually improves implementation quality by correcting errors or inefficiencies in the original natural language description. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain the role of programming language features and idioms in constraining or enabling semantic drift during translation. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
