                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Statistical Expectation Modeling by Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models, when trained on large corpora, internalize the statistical regularities of sequences (including lists) in data. When presented with a list, the model can estimate the likelihood of each item given the context of the list. Items that deviate significantly from these learned expectations are detected as anomalies. This theory posits that language models can serve as universal anomaly detectors for both structured and unstructured lists, leveraging their ability to model conditional probabilities and generalize to unseen list structures.</p>
