                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2305</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Cascade Model of Alzheimer's Disease Initiation and Progression</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple, partially independent biological processes—including genetic susceptibility, metabolic dysfunction, chronic neuroinflammation, vascular compromise, and environmental/lifestyle factors—which interact in a nonlinear, threshold-dependent manner to initiate and drive the pathological cascade. The model predicts that no single factor is necessary or sufficient for disease onset, but that the cumulative burden and synergy among these factors determine both the risk and the trajectory of AD progression. This framework also implies that effective detection and intervention require multidimensional biomarker panels and personalized risk profiling.</p>
