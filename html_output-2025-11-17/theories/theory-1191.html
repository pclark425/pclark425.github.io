                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Abstraction and Constraint Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by constructing hierarchical abstractions of chemical and application spaces, and by propagating constraints from application requirements down to molecular structure generation. The theory asserts that the ability to abstract and propagate constraints is central to the LLM's generative power in chemistry.</p>
