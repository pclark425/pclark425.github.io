                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy: General Threshold Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that there exists a minimum capability threshold for language models, below which self-reflection (i.e., iterative generate-then-reflect cycles) does not reliably improve answer quality. Above this threshold, self-reflection becomes increasingly effective, with the degree of improvement scaling with model capability. The threshold is determined by the model's ability to represent, detect, and reason about its own errors.</p>
