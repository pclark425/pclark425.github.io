                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection Type Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles in dementia is determined by the interplay between their network connectivity (i.e., their position and role within local and global cortical circuits) and their axonal projection type (local, short-range, or long-range). Neurons with extensive long-range projections and high network centrality are more susceptible to pathological protein aggregation due to increased metabolic demand, axonal transport burden, and exposure to trans-synaptic spread, while neurons with local connectivity and low centrality are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Interventions that reduce network centrality (e.g., by silencing hub neurons) will slow the spread of tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the network centrality of a locally projecting neuron will increase its vulnerability to tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Forcing a long-range projection neuron to adopt a local projection pattern will reduce its vulnerability, even if it remains in a deep cortical layer.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with local projections and low centrality are equally or more vulnerable than long-range, high-centrality neurons would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that network centrality has no effect on vulnerability within a given projection type would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some deep-layer interneurons may show resistance despite being in a vulnerable laminar position. </li>
    <li>Certain atypical dementias may show early pathology in locally connected neurons. </li>
