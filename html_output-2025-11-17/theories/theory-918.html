                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Query and Compression Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by actively querying and compressing their memory stores. Rather than passively storing all past information, the agent should learn to selectively retrieve relevant memories and compress redundant or low-utility information. This active process enables efficient use of limited memory resources and supports long-horizon reasoning and planning.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>If agents with compressed memory consistently forget critical information needed for task completion, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
