                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1522</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal FTL via Nonlocal Quantum Information Channels</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by exploiting nonlocal quantum information channels, such as entanglement-assisted teleportation and engineered quantum field effects, to transfer the quantum state of a spacecraft (or its contents) to a distant location. The process would utilize quantum error correction, macroscopic entanglement, and rapid state reconstruction, all within realistic energy and resource budgets, to enable effective FTL relocation without violating causality or requiring infinite energy.</p>
