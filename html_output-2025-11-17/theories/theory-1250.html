                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Plausibility Principle for Multimodal Graph-to-Text Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective graph-to-text representations for language model training are those that mirror the cognitive processes humans use to interpret and verbalize structured information. Such representations should facilitate incremental, context-aware mapping from graph elements to linguistic expressions, leveraging hierarchical and compositional structures that align with human language production and comprehension.</p>
