                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the formal, conceptual, and procedural structures of the target scientific subdomain. The closer the LLM's learned representations and reasoning patterns match the epistemic and methodological norms of the subdomain, the higher the simulation accuracy.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new scientific subdomain is created with a formal structure that is highly dissimilar to any existing domain, LLMs will fail to simulate it accurately unless retrained or fine-tuned.</li>
                <li>If an LLM is trained on a synthetic corpus that is structurally isomorphic to a real scientific subdomain, it will achieve high simulation accuracy in the real domain, even without direct exposure.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained to explicitly map their internal representations to formal ontologies, simulation accuracy will increase even in low-resource domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM achieves high simulation accuracy in a subdomain where its internal representations are demonstrably not aligned with the domain's formal structure, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If procedural fidelity is not required for high simulation accuracy (e.g., LLMs can simulate correct outcomes without following correct procedures), the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on general corpora outperform those fine-tuned on domain-specific corpora in highly formalized subdomains, the theory would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy through memorization or pattern matching, rather than structural alignment or procedural fidelity. </li>
    <li>Instances where LLMs use analogical reasoning to simulate unfamiliar domains with surprising accuracy. </li>
