                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the manipulation of vacuum energy via engineered Casimir-like boundary conditions at macroscopic scales can create regions of spacetime with locally altered metric properties, enabling the formation of a positive-energy warp bubble. The theory asserts that, by using advanced metamaterials and nanostructures, it is possible to generate the required spacetime curvature for FTL travel without recourse to exotic negative energy densities.</p>
