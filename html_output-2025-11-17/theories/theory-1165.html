                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1165</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Preference Optimization and Adversarial Reasoning for Logical Generalization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that robust logical reasoning in language models emerges from a hierarchical preference optimization process, where preferences are optimized at multiple levels of abstraction (from atomic logical steps to high-level reasoning strategies), combined with adversarial training using hard negatives that target both local and global reasoning errors. This multi-level approach enables models to generalize logical reasoning skills across diverse tasks and domains.</p>
