                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Commonsense Knowledge Integration Specificity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that effective planning with external tools in partially observable text environments requires integrating commonsense knowledge at multiple specificity levels, where each level corresponds to different granularities of world knowledge. The theory posits three primary specificity levels: (1) Universal Commonsense Level - containing general physical, social, and causal principles that apply across domains (e.g., 'objects fall down', 'people need to eat'), (2) Domain-Specific Commonsense Level - containing task-relevant patterns, conventions, and constraints (e.g., 'kitchens contain food', 'keys open locks'), and (3) Instance-Specific Commonsense Level - containing particular facts about specific entities and their current states (e.g., 'the red key is in the drawer', 'the apple is rotten'). Tool outputs are semantically analyzed to determine which specificity level(s) they inform, and belief-state updates integrate this information by: (a) matching tool outputs against existing commonsense knowledge at each level to detect confirmations or violations, (b) propagating implications bidirectionally (specific observations can invalidate general assumptions; general principles can constrain specific interpretations), and (c) using specificity-appropriate reasoning strategies (deductive for universal, abductive for domain-specific, inductive for instance-specific). This integration enables shortest-path planning by allowing agents to leverage high-specificity commonsense knowledge to prune impossible actions, medium-specificity knowledge to identify promising subgoals, and low-specificity knowledge to maintain coherent world models even with sparse observations.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Commonsense knowledge should be organized into three specificity levels: Universal (U), Domain-specific (D), and Instance-specific (I), where U contains general principles, D contains task-relevant patterns, and I contains particular facts.</li>
                <li>Each tool output O is analyzed to extract commonsense implications at one or more specificity levels: perceptual tools primarily inform I, analytical tools primarily inform D, and reasoning tools can inform any level.</li>
                <li>Belief-state updates integrate tool outputs by: (1) matching against existing commonsense knowledge at each level, (2) detecting confirmations (strengthening beliefs) or violations (triggering belief revision), and (3) propagating implications across levels.</li>
                <li>Bottom-up propagation occurs when instance-specific observations (I) contradict or refine domain-specific patterns (D) or universal principles (U), triggering belief revision at higher levels.</li>
                <li>Top-down propagation occurs when universal principles (U) or domain patterns (D) constrain the interpretation of ambiguous tool outputs or rule out impossible instance-specific states (I).</li>
                <li>Action selection leverages commonsense knowledge at the appropriate specificity level: U-level knowledge prunes physically impossible actions, D-level knowledge identifies goal-relevant actions, and I-level knowledge determines executable actions given current state.</li>
                <li>Shortest-path planning is achieved by using U-level commonsense to establish feasibility constraints, D-level commonsense to identify subgoal sequences, and I-level commonsense to select specific actions.</li>
                <li>Tool selection should prioritize gathering information that resolves uncertainty at the specificity level currently limiting planning progress: if U-level beliefs are uncertain, use reasoning tools; if D-level beliefs are uncertain, use analytical tools; if I-level beliefs are uncertain, use perceptual tools.</li>
                <li>Commonsense violations detected through tool outputs indicate either: (a) incorrect tool output requiring verification, (b) incomplete commonsense knowledge requiring learning, or (c) exceptional circumstances requiring special-case reasoning.</li>
                <li>The strength of commonsense beliefs should vary by specificity level: U-level beliefs are most resistant to revision (requiring strong contradictory evidence), D-level beliefs are moderately resistant (updated through pattern learning), and I-level beliefs are least resistant (updated through direct observation).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Commonsense reasoning research demonstrates that humans organize world knowledge hierarchically from abstract principles to specific facts, and this organization facilitates efficient inference. </li>
    <li>Knowledge base research shows that commonsense knowledge can be organized by specificity, with general axioms, domain theories, and instance facts forming distinct layers. </li>
    <li>Planning research indicates that leveraging knowledge at appropriate abstraction levels improves planning efficiency by reducing search space. </li>
    <li>Natural language understanding research shows that resolving ambiguity and making inferences requires integrating commonsense knowledge at multiple levels of specificity. </li>
    <li>Cognitive science research indicates that humans use different reasoning strategies for different types of knowledge: deductive for general principles, abductive for domain patterns, and inductive for specific instances. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents that integrate commonsense knowledge at multiple specificity levels will require fewer tool queries to achieve goals compared to agents using flat knowledge representations, because they can infer missing information using appropriate-level commonsense reasoning.</li>
                <li>When tool outputs contain errors that violate commonsense knowledge, agents using specificity-based integration will detect these errors faster by checking consistency across specificity levels.</li>
                <li>In novel domains, agents will show better transfer performance if they can reuse universal and domain-specific commonsense knowledge while learning only instance-specific facts.</li>
                <li>Agents will exhibit more human-like planning behavior when they use deductive reasoning for universal commonsense, abductive reasoning for domain commonsense, and inductive reasoning for instance commonsense.</li>
                <li>Tool outputs that provide domain-specific commonsense knowledge (e.g., 'kitchens typically contain refrigerators') will have greater impact on planning efficiency than tool outputs providing only instance-specific facts (e.g., 'this kitchen contains a refrigerator').</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal ratio of tool queries across specificity levels (universal vs. domain vs. instance) might vary dramatically by task type in ways that reveal fundamental differences in task structure.</li>
                <li>Commonsense knowledge integration at multiple specificity levels might enable entirely new forms of meta-reasoning, such as identifying which level of commonsense knowledge is most deficient and strategically acquiring knowledge at that level.</li>
                <li>The interaction between pre-trained commonsense knowledge (from language models) and learned commonsense knowledge (from tool interactions) might create emergent reasoning capabilities not present in either source alone.</li>
                <li>Bidirectional propagation between specificity levels might enable agents to discover novel commonsense principles by generalizing from instance-specific observations, potentially leading to autonomous commonsense knowledge acquisition.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of maintaining and reasoning with multi-level commonsense knowledge might create unexpected trade-offs where simpler flat representations outperform hierarchical ones in time-constrained scenarios despite being less sample-efficient.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents using flat commonsense knowledge representations achieve equivalent planning efficiency and sample complexity to specificity-based agents across diverse tasks, the added complexity of specificity levels would not be justified.</li>
                <li>If removing bidirectional propagation (using only bottom-up or only top-down) does not impair performance, the necessity of cross-level reasoning would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If agents cannot effectively use universal commonsense knowledge to prune impossible actions or domain commonsense to identify subgoals, the functional value of higher specificity levels would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the reasoning strategy (deductive/abductive/inductive) used at each specificity level does not affect performance, the theory's claim about specificity-appropriate reasoning would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If commonsense violations detected through cross-level consistency checking do not correlate with actual tool errors or knowledge gaps, the diagnostic value of multi-level integration would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If agents perform equally well when commonsense knowledge is randomly distributed across specificity levels rather than organized by generality, the importance of proper specificity organization would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the exact algorithms for semantic analysis of tool outputs to determine which specificity level(s) they inform. </li>
    <li>How to automatically acquire and populate commonsense knowledge at each specificity level, particularly for novel domains, is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The computational complexity of cross-level consistency checking and bidirectional propagation is not formally analyzed. </li>
    <li>How to handle commonsense knowledge that spans multiple specificity levels or doesn't fit cleanly into one level is not specified. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle cultural or contextual variations in commonsense knowledge, which may affect what is considered 'universal' vs. 'domain-specific'. </li>
    <li>How to balance pre-trained commonsense knowledge (e.g., from language models) with learned commonsense knowledge (from tool interactions) is not fully specified. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle temporal aspects of commonsense knowledge (e.g., knowledge that becomes outdated or context-dependent). </li>
