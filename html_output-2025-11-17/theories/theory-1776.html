                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Language Model Statistical Consistency Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models (LMs) encode statistical regularities of data sequences. When applied to lists, LMs can detect anomalies by identifying items that deviate from the learned statistical patterns, as measured by their assigned probabilities or likelihoods. This theory posits that LMs act as general-purpose anomaly detectors by leveraging their internalized distributional knowledge, regardless of the data domain, provided the LM has been exposed to similar data during training.</p>
