                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Consensus and Temporal Signal Theory for LLM Discovery Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs forecast the likelihood of future scientific discoveries by constructing a meta-consensus from temporally distributed signals—such as shifts in citation patterns, emergence of new research clusters, and changes in scientific discourse—while dynamically adjusting for the temporal decay or amplification of these signals. The theory asserts that LLMs are capable of synthesizing multi-temporal evidence to generate calibrated, time-sensitive probability estimates.</p>
