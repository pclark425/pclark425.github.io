                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Abstraction and Variable Mapping for Quantitative Law Discovery</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can abstract and map diverse terminologies, variable names, and measurement units across large numbers of scholarly papers, enabling the unification of heterogeneous data into a common representational framework. This abstraction and mapping process is a prerequisite for the automated extraction of quantitative laws, as it allows the LLM to recognize equivalence classes of variables and measurements, harmonize disparate data, and synthesize generalizable quantitative relationships.</p>
