                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Motif-Driven Locality Enhancement Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the motif-driven approach by positing that hierarchical encoding of motifs—where motifs are recursively composed into higher-order structures—further enhances the ability of language models to solve hard graph problems. The theory claims that such hierarchical representations allow LMs to capture both local and global graph properties, leading to improved performance on tasks that require multi-scale reasoning.</p>
