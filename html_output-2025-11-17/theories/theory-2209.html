                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2209</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory posits that the quality, novelty, and scientific utility of LLM-generated scientific theories are fundamentally determined by the dynamic coupling between the evaluator (human or automated) and the LLM during the theory generation process. The theory asserts that the nature, timing, and structure of evaluator interventions (feedback, constraints, prompts) interact with the LLM's generative mechanisms to shape the resulting scientific outputs, and that optimizing this coupling is essential for maximizing the epistemic value of LLM-generated theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
