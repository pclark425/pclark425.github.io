                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Cognitive Scaffolding for Hierarchical Decomposition</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that prompt format serves as a form of cognitive scaffolding, enabling LLMs to decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks by providing explicit or implicit hierarchical structure. The format of the prompt can guide the LLM's internal reasoning, encourage stepwise problem solving, and facilitate the chaining of intermediate results. The effectiveness of a prompt format is thus determined by its ability to scaffold the LLM's cognitive processes, mirroring the role of scaffolding in human learning and problem solving.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is reformatted to include explicit sub-task instructions, LLMs will show improved accuracy on multi-step problems.</li>
                <li>If implicit hierarchical cues (e.g., indentation, lists) are added to prompts, LLMs will more often produce structured, stepwise outputs.</li>
                <li>If prompts are designed to scaffold intermediate reasoning, LLMs will be less likely to make logical leaps or errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompts are designed to scaffold meta-reasoning (e.g., 'reflect on your answer'), LLMs may develop emergent self-correction abilities.</li>
                <li>If implicit scaffolding is combined with explicit constraints, LLMs may exhibit synergistic improvements in complex reasoning tasks.</li>
                <li>If scaffolding is overused, LLMs may become overly reliant on prompt structure and underperform on unstructured tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well on multi-step tasks with and without explicit or implicit scaffolding, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to decompose tasks even when prompts are highly structured, the hierarchical decomposition law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If implicit cues in prompt format do not affect LLM output structure, the implicit scaffolding law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs sometimes fail to follow explicit scaffolding, especially on tasks outside their training distribution. </li>
