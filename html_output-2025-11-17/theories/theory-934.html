                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Query and Update Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by actively querying and updating their memory based on explicit uncertainty estimation and goal-driven information seeking. Rather than passively storing all past information, the agent should use its internal state and task goals to identify knowledge gaps, retrieve relevant memories, and update or overwrite memory contents as new evidence is acquired. This active process enables efficient use of limited memory resources and supports adaptive planning in dynamic game environments.</p>

    <li>Human problem solvers actively seek information when uncertain, rather than relying solely on passive recall. </li>
    <li>LLM agents with retrieval mechanisms conditioned on uncertainty outperform those with static retrieval. </li>
    <li>Cognitive science shows that metacognitive monitoring (awareness of uncertainty) triggers information search. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general principle is related to existing work, but its formalization and application to LLM agents in text games is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Active information seeking and uncertainty-driven retrieval are known in human cognition and some AI models.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit coupling of uncertainty estimation with memory querying in LLM agents for text games is novel.</p>

                <li>If goal-driven memory updating does not lead to faster adaptation to new objectives, the theory is called into question.</li>
