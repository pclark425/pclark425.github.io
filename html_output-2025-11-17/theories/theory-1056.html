                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Symbolic Reasoning via Pattern-Token Mapping</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) solve spatial puzzle games like Sudoku by developing emergent internal representations that map symbolic tokens (e.g., digits, cell positions) to abstract patterns of constraints and allowable moves. Rather than explicit spatial reasoning, the model leverages its training on vast textual data to learn statistical regularities and constraint satisfaction patterns, which it applies to the puzzle context through token prediction.</p>

                <li>If a language model is trained on a new spatial puzzle with similar constraint structure (e.g., KenKen), it will show above-chance performance without explicit retraining.</li>
                <li>If the tokenization scheme for the puzzle is altered but preserves constraint information, the model will still be able to solve the puzzle, albeit with some performance drop.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained on a synthetic language with entirely novel spatial constraints, it may develop new emergent representations for those constraints.</li>
                <li>If a model is probed for neuron activations during puzzle solving, distinct clusters corresponding to different constraint types may be found, revealing a form of internal symbolic mapping.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is presented with a puzzle where the token sequence does not encode constraints (e.g., random token order), it should fail to solve the puzzle.</li>
                <li>If the model is tested on puzzles with constraints that are not present in its training data, and it still performs well, this would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can solve puzzles with visual or spatial layouts not easily tokenized, which may not be fully explained by token-constraint mapping. </li>
