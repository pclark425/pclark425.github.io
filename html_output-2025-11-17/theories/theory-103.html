                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Shortest-Path Planning with Learned Heuristics Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In partially observable text environments with explicit spatial structure (rooms, locations, navigation graphs), agents that combine explicit graph-based representations of connectivity with learned heuristics for navigation achieve more efficient goal-reaching than pure learned policies or pure classical planners alone. The graph representation provides a structured substrate for planning that handles spatial connectivity, while learned components (value functions, neural scorers, or LLM reasoning) handle partial observability, uncertain state estimation, and action selection under ambiguity. The benefit of this hybrid approach is most pronounced in environments with: (1) non-trivial spatial structure (multiple rooms, complex connectivity), (2) long-horizon navigation requirements, and (3) partial observability where classical heuristics (e.g., Euclidean distance) are unavailable or unreliable. However, the effectiveness critically depends on accurate graph construction, which in text-only environments must be inferred from descriptions.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Explicit graph representations of spatial connectivity enable more efficient navigation than purely learned policies in environments with non-trivial spatial structure (multiple rooms, complex connectivity patterns).</li>
                <li>Learned heuristics (value functions, neural network scorers, LLM reasoning) can guide graph search or action selection in partially observable settings where classical heuristics (e.g., Euclidean distance) are unavailable or unreliable due to incomplete state information.</li>
                <li>Hybrid approaches that combine graph-based path planning with learned action selection outperform either pure classical planning or pure learning in partially observable spatial environments, particularly for long-horizon navigation tasks.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of graph-based navigation depends critically on the quality of graph construction: accurate connectivity information is essential, and errors in graph construction can negate benefits.</li>
                <li>In text-only environments, spatial graphs must be inferred from textual descriptions, making graph construction itself a challenging learning problem that requires entity extraction, relation detection, and temporal integration.</li>
                <li>Graph-based navigation provides diminishing returns in environments where: (1) spatial structure is trivial (single room, linear paths), (2) navigation is not the primary challenge, or (3) the environment is fully observable and deterministic.</li>
                <li>Classical shortest-path algorithms (A*, Dijkstra) can be effectively combined with learned components by using learned heuristics for node scoring, learned graph construction, or learned action execution.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learned end-to-end navigation policies can match the sample efficiency of graph-based approaches when given sufficient training data (millions of episodes) and modern architectures (transformers with large context).</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal learned heuristic function that works across diverse spatial environments (indoor navigation, outdoor navigation, abstract graphs), or whether heuristics must be environment-specific or learned per-domain.</li>
                <li>Whether graph-based navigation remains beneficial in very high-dimensional or continuous spatial environments where discrete graphs are difficult to construct, or whether learned representations (e.g., neural maps) are more effective.</li>
                <li>Whether probabilistic graph representations (with uncertain edges and nodes) provide significant benefits over deterministic graphs in partially observable settings, and whether the computational cost is justified.</li>

                <li>Demonstrating that pure learned policies (e.g., transformers with sufficient capacity and training data) achieve the same path efficiency and sample efficiency as graph-based planners in structured spatial environments would challenge the necessity of explicit graphs.</li>
                <li>Showing that random walk or simple heuristics (e.g., always go to unexplored rooms) perform as well as shortest-path planning in certain text-based environments would question the value of path optimization.</li>
                <li>Finding that graph-based navigation provides no benefit over learned policies in environments with clear spatial structure and long-horizon navigation requirements would challenge the theory's core claims.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the computational cost of maintaining and updating graphs outweighs the benefits in terms of sample efficiency or final performance would challenge the practical utility of the approach.</li>
                <li>Showing that errors in graph construction (from text) are so frequent that they negate any benefits of graph-based planning would challenge the feasibility of the approach in text-only environments.</li>
