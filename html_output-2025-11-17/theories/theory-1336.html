                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Alignment through Internal Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, during generate-then-reflect cycles, internally simulate alternative reasoning paths and outcomes, aligning their outputs with implicit internal standards of coherence, factuality, and task-specific goals. Reflection acts as a mechanism for the model to compare its outputs against these internal simulations, leading to improved alignment and answer quality.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained to explicitly simulate and compare multiple internal reasoning paths during reflection, they may develop new forms of self-alignment or self-correction.</li>
                <li>There may be tasks where internal standards conflict with external correctness, leading to unexpected reflection outcomes.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection does not lead to increased coherence or factuality, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models cannot generate alternative reasoning paths during reflection, the internal simulation law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If models' answers do not change after reflection, the theory's mechanism is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection leads to increased verbosity or hedging rather than improved accuracy. </li>
    <li>Tasks where reflection does not improve or even degrades answer quality. </li>
