                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1249</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Alignment and Compactness Principle for Graph-to-Text Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective graph-to-text representations for language model training are those that maximize alignment between the structural properties of the input graph and the sequential, compositional nature of natural language, while also ensuring representational compactness. The principle asserts that representations should encode graph semantics in a way that is both information-preserving and efficiently mappable to text, leveraging multimodal cues (e.g., node/edge types, attributes, and graph topology) to facilitate robust, generalizable language model learning.</p>

            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If structurally aligned, compact representations do not improve generalization or fidelity, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If redundant or misaligned representations yield better performance, the law would be falsified.</li>
