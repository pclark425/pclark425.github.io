                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1367</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative generate-then-reflect cycles in language models serve to align the model's outputs more closely with implicit or explicit task objectives, by leveraging internalized representations of correctness, coherence, and user intent. The reflection process acts as a mechanism for internal alignment, allowing the model to re-evaluate and adjust its outputs in light of both prior knowledge and the specific context of the task.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>If the reflection prompt is tailored to highlight alignment with user intent, the model's answers will more closely match user expectations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained to reflect specifically on alignment with user values, they may develop internal representations of value alignment.</li>
                <li>If reflection is performed with misleading or adversarial context, the model may misalign its outputs in systematic ways.</li>
                <li>If reflection is combined with external feedback (e.g., human-in-the-loop), the alignment process may accelerate or become more robust.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection does not improve alignment with task objectives or user intent, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If models fail to incorporate new contextual information during reflection, the law of contextual re-evaluation is falsified.</li>
                <li>If reflection cycles consistently decrease alignment, the theory's core mechanism is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain cases where task objectives are fundamentally ambiguous or conflicting. </li>
    <li>It does not account for situations where the model's training data is misaligned with the intended task objective. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
