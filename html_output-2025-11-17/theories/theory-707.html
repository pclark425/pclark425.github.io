                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Fourier-Modular Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs solve arithmetic by hierarchically integrating modular (digitwise) and frequency-based (global) representations, with lower layers encoding modular residues and higher layers synthesizing global structure via Fourier-like transformations. The integration across layers enables the LLM to perform both local and global arithmetic reasoning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit layer constraints (e.g., modular-only or frequency-only), their arithmetic performance may degrade or adapt in novel ways.</li>
