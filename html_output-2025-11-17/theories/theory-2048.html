                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can extract quantitative laws from large corpora by leveraging their ability to semantically align, abstract, and statistically synthesize numerical relationships across diverse scholarly texts, even when those relationships are expressed in heterogeneous forms or embedded in complex narrative contexts.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
