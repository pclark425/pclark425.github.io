                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Iterative Self-Verification for Logical Consistency in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that strict logical reasoning in LMs is best achieved when the model is equipped with an iterative self-verification mechanism, wherein the LM generates candidate logical inferences, checks them for consistency with prior steps and premises, and revises or rejects inconsistent outputs. This process mimics human logical proof-checking and enables robust error correction and logical soundness.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Human logical reasoning often involves iterative proof-checking and error correction. </li>
    <li>LMs with self-consistency or self-verification mechanisms (e.g., chain-of-thought with verification) show improved logical accuracy. </li>
    <li>Standard LMs often produce logically inconsistent outputs without explicit verification. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to self-consistency prompting, the theory proposes a more general, iterative, and architectural mechanism.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Self-consistency and verification are used in some LM prompting strategies (e.g., self-consistency decoding, scratchpad).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit, iterative self-verification mechanism as a core architectural feature for strict logical reasoning.</p>
