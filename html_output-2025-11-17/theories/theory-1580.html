                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hyperwave/Hypertube FTL Communication via Planck-Scale Microbubbles: Energy-Efficient Realization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory refines the general framework by proposing that FTL travel via hypertubes can be achieved with realistic energy budgets by exploiting quantum resonance effects and vacuum energy fluctuations. By tuning the energy input to match natural resonant frequencies of spacetime at the Planck scale, the energy required to nucleate and sustain microbubbles is dramatically reduced. This makes the creation of hypertubes feasible with near-future technology, potentially within the reach of advanced laboratory or space-based experiments.</p>
