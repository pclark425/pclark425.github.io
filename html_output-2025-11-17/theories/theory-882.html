                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective and Abstractive Memory Consolidation Theory for Long-Term Coherence in LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve long-term coherence and robust task performance by integrating two complementary memory processes: reflective consolidation (where the agent periodically reviews and integrates episodic experiences to resolve inconsistencies and reinforce salient knowledge) and abstractive consolidation (where the agent compresses and generalizes across experiences to form higher-level schemas). The interplay between these processes enables both retention of critical details and the formation of transferable knowledge, supporting adaptive behavior across diverse tasks.</p>
