                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal Modularity and Neuro-Symbolic Augmentation Law for Strict Logical Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve the highest levels of strict logical reasoning when their architectures and workflows enforce explicit modularity between selection, inference, and verification steps, and when these steps are further augmented by neuro-symbolic or deterministic components (e.g., symbolic solvers, value functions, or verifiers). Causal decoupling—ensuring that inference modules do not have direct access to the question—prevents shortcutting and hallucination, while value-guided or verifier-guided search amplifies faithfulness and accuracy, especially in multi-step or distractor-rich contexts. The integration of symbolic solvers or deterministic reasoning modules further enhances faithfulness, robustness, and generalization, particularly for deep, compositional, or out-of-distribution logical tasks.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Logic-LM, DetermLR, and SATLM approaches that combine LLMs with symbolic solvers or deterministic logical modules achieve substantial accuracy improvements (e.g., +13.9pp on FOLIO, +11.5pp on LSAT) over vanilla LLMs. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3454.html#e3454.8" class="evidence-link">[e3454.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3454.html#e3454.10" class="evidence-link">[e3454.10]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3542.html#e3542.3" class="evidence-link">[e3542.3]</a> </li>
    <li>PAL and DeClarative methods that delegate computation to symbolic solvers outperform pure CoT or direct LLM approaches, especially on tasks requiring arithmetic or algebraic reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3541.html#e3541.1" class="evidence-link">[e3541.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3521.html#e3521.2" class="evidence-link">[e3521.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Tool-based approaches (e.g., GPT-4o + Prover9) show that choice of symbolic tool can yield up to 50% performance variation, and that symbolic execution is robust to reasoning depth. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3432.html#e3432.0" class="evidence-link">[e3432.0]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new reasoning system is constructed with strict modularity and causal decoupling (e.g., inference module never sees the question), hallucinated facts and shortcutting will be minimized, and reasoning traces will be more interpretable.</li>
                <li>If value-guided or verifier-guided search is added to a stepwise selection-inference pipeline, accuracy on deep or distractor-rich logical reasoning tasks will increase.</li>
                <li>If a language model is augmented with a symbolic solver or deterministic logical module, its faithfulness and robustness on multi-step or OOD logical tasks will improve over pure LLM baselines.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the selection module is imperfect or context is incomplete, it is unclear whether the inference module will still avoid hallucination or if new failure modes will emerge.</li>
                <li>If the value function or verifier is miscalibrated or trained on adversarial negatives, it is unknown whether search will still improve accuracy or could introduce new biases.</li>
                <li>If symbolic solvers are integrated with LLMs for tasks with ambiguous or underspecified natural language, it is unknown whether the overall system will maintain high faithfulness or will be bottlenecked by translation errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model with causal decoupling still produces shortcutting or hallucinated facts at rates comparable to end-to-end models, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If value-guided or verifier-guided search fails to improve or even reduces accuracy on deep or distractor-rich tasks, the theory's claims would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If neuro-symbolic or deterministic augmentation fails to improve faithfulness or robustness on multi-step or OOD logical tasks, or introduces new systematic errors, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain cases where selection is ambiguous or context is incomplete, leading to inference errors even with causal decoupling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3522.html#e3522.0" class="evidence-link">[e3522.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3522.html#e3522.1" class="evidence-link">[e3522.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Some end-to-end or fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., RuleTakers, RoBERTa-based) achieve high QA accuracy without explicit modularity or neuro-symbolic augmentation, though they do not produce explicit proofs or maintain faithfulness at depth. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3525.html#e3525.1" class="evidence-link">[e3525.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3525.html#e3525.0" class="evidence-link">[e3525.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3539.html#e3539.6" class="evidence-link">[e3539.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain tasks (e.g., abductive or commonsense reasoning) may not benefit from strict modularity or symbolic augmentation, as their logical structure is less well-defined. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3501.html#e3501.0" class="evidence-link">[e3501.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3501.html#e3501.2" class="evidence-link">[e3501.2]</a> </li>
