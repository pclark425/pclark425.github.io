                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the efficacy of self-reflection in language models—i.e., the ability to improve answer quality through iterative generate-then-reflect cycles—is governed by the existence of a capability threshold. Only when a model's internal representational and reasoning abilities surpass this threshold can self-reflection reliably lead to substantive answer improvements. Below this threshold, self-reflection is ineffective or may even degrade performance.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that small language models (e.g., <1B parameters) do not improve with self-reflection, while larger models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4) do. </li>
    <li>Ablation studies indicate that models lacking sufficient reasoning or abstraction capacity fail to identify and correct their own errors. </li>
    <li>Self-reflection in small models often leads to repetition or superficial changes rather than substantive improvements. </li>
    <li>Meta-evaluations show that error detection and correction rates are near chance for small models, but rise sharply for larger models. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to scaling laws and prompt engineering, the explicit threshold concept for self-reflection efficacy is not formalized in prior literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that larger models tend to benefit more from self-reflection and chain-of-thought prompting.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formulation of a threshold—below which self-reflection is ineffective and above which it is reliably beneficial—is new, as is the conditional framing.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Performance improvements from self-reflection are disproportionately larger in models above a certain size/capability, as seen in scaling studies. </li>
    <li>Qualitative analyses show that only sufficiently capable models can generate meaningful critiques and corrections. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends scaling law observations to the domain of self-reflection, which is not directly addressed in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Scaling laws for LLMs are well-studied, and some work notes non-linear improvements with size.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The superlinear relationship specifically for self-reflection efficacy, tied to a threshold, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is below the capability threshold, increasing the number of self-reflection iterations will not improve answer quality.</li>
                <li>For models just above the threshold, small increases in capability (e.g., via fine-tuning) will yield disproportionately large gains in self-reflection efficacy.</li>
                <li>Tasks that require multi-step reasoning will show a sharper threshold effect than tasks requiring only surface-level corrections.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist tasks for which the threshold is much higher, such that even current state-of-the-art models cannot benefit from self-reflection.</li>
                <li>Introducing architectural changes that increase abstraction capacity (without increasing parameter count) may lower the threshold for self-reflection efficacy.</li>
                <li>Thresholds may shift depending on the domain (e.g., code vs. natural language).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a small model (<1B parameters) can reliably improve its answers through self-reflection, the threshold hypothesis would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing model capability above the threshold does not yield superlinear gains in self-reflection efficacy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection is equally effective across all model sizes, the threshold concept would be invalidated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where small models improve with heavy external guidance or scaffolding are not fully explained. </li>
    <li>Some tasks with low complexity may allow for effective self-reflection even in small models. </li>
