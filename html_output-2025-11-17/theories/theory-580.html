                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Chain-of-Thought and Program Synthesis in Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs achieve high performance on multi-step arithmetic and mathematical reasoning tasks not by learning explicit symbolic algorithms internally, but by leveraging emergent algorithmic reasoning through chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and program synthesis. CoT prompts elicit stepwise natural-language reasoning, which decomposes complex problems into simpler sub-steps, while program-of-thought (PoT) and code generation approaches allow the model to offload exact computation to external interpreters. The effectiveness of these mechanisms depends on model scale, pretraining data, and the presence of high-quality exemplars.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If CoT exemplars are corrupted or omitted, arithmetic accuracy will drop, especially for multi-step problems.</li>
                <li>If a model is prompted to generate code for a new arithmetic operation (e.g., modular exponentiation) and the external interpreter supports it, the model will achieve high accuracy even if it cannot perform the operation internally.</li>
                <li>If a small model (<10B) is prompted with CoT, it will produce fluent but often illogical chains, and accuracy will not improve.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained with both CoT and PoT exemplars, it may learn to hybridize reasoning, producing both natural-language and code-based intermediate steps.</li>
                <li>If a model is exposed to a new domain (e.g., physics problems) with CoT and PoT exemplars, it may generalize algorithmic reasoning to novel problem types.</li>
                <li>If external execution is disabled, models relying on PoT will revert to lower accuracy, revealing the limits of their internal arithmetic capabilities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If CoT prompting does not improve arithmetic accuracy in large models, the emergent reasoning claim would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If program synthesis does not improve accuracy over direct-answer prompting, the external execution mechanism would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If small models (<10B) benefit as much from CoT as large models, the scale-dependence claim would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The internal distributed representation mechanisms (e.g., Fourier features, frequency specialization) underlying arithmetic computation are not explained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4629.html#e4629.5" class="evidence-link">[e4629.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4629.html#e4629.0" class="evidence-link">[e4629.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The causal role of specific neurons or circuits (e.g., FF neurons encoding arithmetic concepts) is not addressed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4626.html#e4626.0" class="evidence-link">[e4626.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4626.html#e4626.3" class="evidence-link">[e4626.3]</a> </li>
