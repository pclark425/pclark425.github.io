                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2306</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Biomarker Convergence Theory for Early AD Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that the earliest and most reliable detection of Alzheimer's disease requires the integration of multidimensional biomarker data—encompassing molecular (amyloid, tau, neurofilament light), metabolic (glucose hypometabolism), inflammatory (cytokines, microglial activation), vascular (blood-brain barrier integrity, perfusion), and genetic (APOE, polygenic risk) domains. The model predicts that convergence of abnormality across these domains, rather than isolated biomarker changes, is necessary for high-confidence early diagnosis and risk stratification.</p>
