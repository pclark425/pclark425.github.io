                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Episodic-Semantic Hybrid Memory Architecture Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal performance of LLM agents in text games is achieved by dynamically integrating both episodic (event-specific, temporally ordered) and semantic (generalized, abstracted) memory systems. The agent must fluidly switch between and combine these memory types, leveraging episodic memory for context-sensitive reasoning and semantic memory for generalization and planning, with a meta-controller that adaptively allocates attention and retrieval resources based on task demands and uncertainty.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human cognition leverages both episodic and semantic memory for problem-solving; LLMs with only one type of memory (e.g., context window or static knowledge) underperform on tasks requiring both recall of specific events and generalization. </li>
    <li>Empirical results show that LLM agents with memory augmentation (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) outperform those without on complex, multi-step text games. </li>
    <li>Cognitive neuroscience demonstrates that episodic memory supports event recall and semantic memory supports abstraction and transfer; both are needed for flexible reasoning. </li>
    <li>Ablation studies in memory-augmented neural networks show performance drops when either episodic or semantic memory is removed. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While hybrid memory systems exist in cognitive science and some AI, the explicit, dynamic, meta-controlled integration for LLM agents in text games is a new, formalized principle.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The distinction between episodic and semantic memory is well-established in cognitive science, and hybrid memory architectures have been explored in some AI systems.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit principle that dynamic, meta-controlled integration of both memory types is necessary for optimal LLM agent performance in text games, and the conditional switching based on task demands, is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Meta-control in human cognition allows flexible switching between memory systems; LLM agents with static memory usage fail to adapt to changing task demands. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general idea of meta-control exists, but its formalization and application to LLM agent memory in text games is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Meta-control and uncertainty-driven retrieval are studied in cognitive science and some AI planning systems.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law's application to LLM agents in text games, with explicit dynamic allocation and switching between memory modules based on uncertainty, is novel.</p>

                <li>In highly stochastic or adversarial text games, the optimal balance between episodic and semantic memory may shift in unexpected ways, potentially favoring non-intuitive memory usage patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM agents with only one type of memory (episodic or semantic) perform equally well as hybrid agents on complex text games, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If dynamic switching between memory modules does not improve performance over static allocation, the meta-control principle would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of memory module size and retrieval latency on real-time agent performance is not addressed. </li>
