                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models can best perform strict logical reasoning by engaging in iterative self-consistency checks and/or multi-agent debate, where multiple instances of the model (or different models) reason independently and then cross-examine each other's outputs. The process of repeated self-consistency and adversarial debate exposes logical flaws, reduces hallucinations, and converges on more robust, logically valid conclusions.</p>
