                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the brain represents conceptual knowledge in multiple, partially redundant representational formats (e.g., sensory-motor, symbolic, schematic), and dynamically arbitrates between them based on the relative precision (i.e., reliability, informativeness, and task-relevance) of each format for the current cognitive context. The arbitration process is formalized as a precision-weighted selection mechanism, where the format(s) with the highest expected precision for a given task or context dominate(s) conceptual processing and behavioral output.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies show that different tasks (e.g., action planning vs. verbal reasoning) preferentially engage different representational systems for the same concept. </li>
    <li>Behavioral studies demonstrate flexible switching between sensory-motor and symbolic representations depending on task demands. </li>
    <li>Computational models of arbitration (e.g., Daw et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2014) formalize precision-weighted selection in other cognitive domains. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While format pluralism and context-dependence are known, the precision-weighted arbitration mechanism is a novel, formal, and general principle.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multiple representational formats for concepts and context-dependent recruitment are established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formalization of arbitration as a precision-weighted selection mechanism for conceptual format is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Tasks requiring fine-grained action knowledge (e.g., tool use) preferentially recruit sensory-motor representations. </li>
    <li>Tasks requiring abstract or verbal reasoning preferentially recruit symbolic or schematic representations. </li>
    <li>Patients with selective deficits in one format (e.g., apraxia, semantic dementia) show task-specific impairments. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Task-dependence is known, but the precision-based selection mechanism is a new formalization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Task-dependent recruitment of different representational systems is established.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link to format precision and arbitration is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks that increase the precision of a given format (e.g., training in sensory-motor skills) will increase reliance on that format for conceptual processing.</li>
                <li>Disruption of a high-precision format (e.g., via TMS or lesion) will cause a shift to alternative formats, with performance depending on their relative precision.</li>
                <li>Ambiguous or noisy input will lead to greater integration or blending of multiple formats, weighted by their relative precision.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In individuals with atypical format precision profiles (e.g., synesthesia, expertise), arbitration patterns will deviate from the population norm.</li>
                <li>Novel tasks that require integration of features from multiple formats will reveal emergent hybrid representations, with arbitration weights dynamically shifting during learning.</li>
                <li>Precision-weighted arbitration may be modulated by neuromodulatory states (e.g., attention, arousal) in ways not yet observed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual processing does not shift to the most precise format when task demands change, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If disruption of a dominant format does not lead to compensatory recruitment of alternative formats, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If all formats are equally engaged regardless of task or precision, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how precision is computed or learned for each format at the algorithmic or neural level. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address the developmental origins of representational formats or their initial arbitration. </li>
