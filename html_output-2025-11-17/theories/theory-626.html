                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Conceptual representations in brains are distributed along a graded continuum from fully modal (perceptual, sensorimotor, affective) to fully amodal (symbolic, propositional, abstract), with most real-world concepts occupying intermediate, hybrid positions. The system dynamically hybridizes and recruits representations at different points on this continuum depending on task demands, context, and developmental stage. Integration is achieved via hub-and-spoke architectures, dual coding, and context-sensitive arbitration mechanisms, allowing for flexible, multimodal, and compositional conceptual knowledge.</p>

<ol>
    <li>The modal–amodal continuum framework explicitly describes a graded, context-sensitive recruitment of modal and amodal representations, with hybrid and intermediate forms being the norm rather than the exception. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5195.html#e5195.2" class="evidence-link">[e5195.2]</a> </li>

    <li>Complementary learning systems and multiple memory systems frameworks show that both modal (perceptual, procedural) and amodal (declarative, associative) representations are used in parallel, depending on context and task. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5424.html#e5424.3" class="evidence-link">[e5424.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5428.html#e5428.3" class="evidence-link">[e5428.3]</a> </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Linguistic shortcut and symbol interdependency hypotheses show preference for linguistic/distributional representations in fast or shallow tasks, with simulation/embodied representations recruited only when needed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.2" class="evidence-link">[e5156.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5208.html#e5208.2" class="evidence-link">[e5208.2]</a> </li>

    <li>Dual-process theories and dual coding frameworks posit that System 1 (fast, automatic) processes rely on distributional/linguistic or prototype-based representations, while System 2 (slow, deliberative) processes recruit more detailed, often modal or compositional representations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5182.html#e5182.4" class="evidence-link">[e5182.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.1" class="evidence-link">[e5156.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Empirical evidence from category production and property verification tasks shows that linguistic proximity predicts fast responses, while sensorimotor similarity predicts slower, deeper responses. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.2" class="evidence-link">[e5156.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5208.html#e5208.1" class="evidence-link">[e5208.1]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The arbitration principle is present in prior work, but its explicit generalization to a graded continuum and its formalization as a law of conceptual representation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Linguistic shortcut, LASS, dual coding, and dual-process models describe context-dependent selection of representation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law generalizes the arbitration mechanism to the entire modal–amodal continuum and formalizes the principle that context and task demands drive dynamic hybridization and selection.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks that require both perceptual detail and abstract reasoning (e.g., interpreting novel metaphors or complex analogies) will show concurrent activation of both modality-specific and amodal hub regions in neuroimaging.</li>
                <li>Manipulating the modality of input (e.g., visual vs. verbal) will shift the balance of modal and amodal representation recruitment, as measured by behavioral and neural markers.</li>
                <li>Abstract concepts with strong emotional or social content will preferentially recruit affective and social modality-specific regions, in addition to amodal hubs.</li>
                <li>Developmental studies will show a progression from predominantly modal representations in early childhood to increasingly hybrid and amodal representations with age and experience.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural architectures that implement dynamic hybridization along a modal–amodal continuum will outperform both pure modal and pure amodal models on tasks requiring flexible generalization and context-sensitive reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In individuals with selective damage to amodal hubs (e.g., anterior temporal lobe), the system will compensate by relying more heavily on distributed modal representations, potentially leading to novel patterns of conceptual errors.</li>
                <li>In tasks requiring rapid switching between modalities (e.g., cross-modal priming), the degree of hybridization will predict performance and neural efficiency.</li>
                <li>The degree of hybridization (as measured by coactivation of modal and amodal regions) will correlate with individual differences in cognitive flexibility and creativity.</li>
                <li>In neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., autism, semantic dementia), disruptions in hybridization or arbitration mechanisms will manifest as specific patterns of conceptual impairment.</li>
                <li>The emergence of new abstract concepts in a culture will initially rely more on linguistic (amodal) scaffolding, with gradual recruitment of modal/embodied representations as the concept becomes more entrenched.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If tasks requiring both perceptual and abstract processing never show concurrent or hybrid activation patterns, the continuum and hybridization claims would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If all concepts can be fully accounted for by either purely modal or purely amodal representations, with no evidence for intermediate or hybrid formats, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If context manipulations fail to shift the balance of representation recruitment (e.g., input modality or task demands do not affect which representations are used), the contextual arbitration law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If individuals with damage to amodal hubs do not show compensatory reliance on modal representations, the compensatory prediction would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Precise neural mechanisms for arbitration and integration across the continuum are not fully specified; the theory does not detail how arbitration is implemented at the neural circuit level. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.3" class="evidence-link">[e5156.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5195.html#e5195.2" class="evidence-link">[e5195.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how highly abstract, non-embodied concepts (e.g., mathematical entities) are grounded or hybridized beyond linguistic or symbolic representation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.5" class="evidence-link">[e5156.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5195.html#e5195.4" class="evidence-link">[e5195.4]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully address the computational scalability of hybridization mechanisms in large-scale, real-world knowledge bases. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5193.html#e5193.0" class="evidence-link">[e5193.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5156.html#e5156.3" class="evidence-link">[e5156.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and extends existing frameworks, providing a novel, mechanistically explicit account of how hybridization and context-sensitive recruitment operate along the continuum, and formalizes these as default principles rather than exceptions.</p>
