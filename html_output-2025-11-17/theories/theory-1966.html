                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to vast and diverse corpora of scholarly literature, can synthesize qualitative laws that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging their emergent pattern recognition and abstraction capabilities, LLMs can identify, generalize, and articulate cross-domain regularities that are not explicitly stated in any single source, effectively acting as synthesizers of new scientific laws.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to answer questions and generate hypotheses that integrate knowledge from disparate fields, such as analogical reasoning between biology and computer science. </li>
    <li>Emergent abilities in LLMs, such as in-context learning and abstraction, have been observed as model scale increases. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While LLMs' emergent abilities and cross-domain reasoning are documented, the theory that they can synthesize genuinely new, abstract qualitative laws across domains is not established in the literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to perform cross-domain reasoning and analogical mapping, and emergent abilities have been documented as models scale.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of LLMs as synthesizers of new, cross-domain qualitative laws—rather than just retrieving or summarizing existing knowledge—is novel.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to generate cross-domain qualitative laws when given multi-domain input, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce existing laws and never synthesize new, abstracted laws, the theory is undermined.</li>
