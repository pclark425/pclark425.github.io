                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1568</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Engineering for Positive-Energy FTL Propulsion</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by manipulating the quantum vacuum—specifically, by engineering local energy densities and stress-energy tensors through Casimir-like effects, vacuum polarization, or dynamic boundary conditions—it is possible to create positive-energy spacetime geometries suitable for FTL travel. The approach leverages advances in quantum field theory, nanotechnology, and high-field physics to achieve the necessary conditions for warp bubble formation without exotic negative energy.</p>
