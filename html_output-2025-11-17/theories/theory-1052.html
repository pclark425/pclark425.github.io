                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Synergy: Hybridization of Language Models and Symbolic Solvers for Spatial Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) implicitly hybridize neural and symbolic reasoning by dynamically constructing internal symbolic-like structures (such as constraint graphs) and leveraging them with neural pattern-matching to solve spatial puzzles like Sudoku. The LLM's neural activations serve as a substrate for representing and manipulating symbolic constraints, enabling multi-step logical inference and candidate elimination without explicit symbolic modules.</p>
