                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Reasoning and Contextualization Theory for LLM-Based Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when guided through iterative, context-aware reasoning steps (beyond single-pass CoT), can dynamically refine their anomaly detection and classification in lists of data. By leveraging both explicit context windows and feedback from prior reasoning steps, LLMs can resolve ambiguous cases, adapt to evolving data distributions, and provide more robust anomaly-type explanations.</p>
