                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Integration of Memory and Reasoning is Required for Robust Generalization in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that robust generalization in text games requires a hierarchical integration of explicit structured memory and reasoning modules. Specifically, agents must organize memory and reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., object-level, event-level, goal-level) to adapt to novel tasks, transfer knowledge, and efficiently plan in complex, partially observable environments.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Hierarchical integration may enable zero-shot generalization to entirely novel game genres or mechanics.</li>
                <li>There may exist optimal levels of hierarchy for different classes of text games, with diminishing returns beyond a certain depth.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical memory and reasoning may enable emergent meta-cognitive behaviors (e.g., self-reflection, strategy revision).</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If agents with flat or unstructured memory/reasoning match or exceed the generalization performance of hierarchical agents, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If hierarchical integration does not improve transfer or adaptation in complex text games, the necessity claim is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some simple or highly repetitive text games may not benefit from hierarchical organization. </li>
