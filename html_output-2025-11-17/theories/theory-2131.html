                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2131</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HMOT: Feedback-Driven Modular Refinement for Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the quality and novelty of theories distilled by LLMs from scholarly corpora are maximized when the orchestration framework incorporates iterative feedback loops between modules. Each module (e.g., evidence extraction, contradiction detection, synthesis) not only processes input but also receives feedback from downstream modules, enabling refinement and error correction. The theory asserts that feedback-driven modular refinement leads to more accurate, coherent, and novel scientific theories than purely feedforward or static modular approaches.</p>
