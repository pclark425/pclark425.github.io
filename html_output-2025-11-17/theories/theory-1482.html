                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization (Functional Integration Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the brain's conceptual system is organized to flexibly integrate modal and amodal representations through a set of functional hubs and spokes. The spokes correspond to modality-specific systems (e.g., visual, auditory, motor), while the hubs (e.g., anterior temporal lobe, angular gyrus) serve as convergence zones that enable dynamic hybridization. The degree of modal or amodal involvement is determined by the interaction between these hubs and spokes, modulated by task demands, context, and learning history.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Disruption of hub regions will impair tasks requiring hybrid representations more than tasks requiring only modal or only amodal processing.</li>
                <li>Functional connectivity between hubs and spokes will increase during tasks that require integration of sensory and abstract information.</li>
                <li>Training in tasks that require hybridization will enhance the flexibility of hub–spoke interactions.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificial stimulation of hub regions will induce hybrid representations even in tasks that are typically unimodal.</li>
                <li>In individuals with atypical hub development (e.g., in autism), hybridization capacity will predict conceptual flexibility.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological modulation of hub–spoke connectivity will selectively affect hybrid conceptual processing.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If hub lesions do not impair hybridization, the central role of hubs would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If task demands do not modulate the degree of hybridization, the theory's context-sensitivity claim would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the microcircuitry or temporal dynamics of hub–spoke interactions. </li>
