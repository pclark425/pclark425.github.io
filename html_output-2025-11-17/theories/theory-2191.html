                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2191</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Alignment Theory of LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of scientific theories generated by large language models (LLMs) is best understood as a process of alignment across multiple, distinct dimensions (e.g., empirical adequacy, logical coherence, novelty, explanatory power, ethical acceptability, and domain relevance). Evaluation is not reducible to a single metric or axis; rather, a theory's scientific value emerges from its position in a multidimensional alignment space, and evaluators (human or automated) must explicitly consider trade-offs and synergies among these axes.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Novel but empirically unsupported theories are often rejected in science, despite their creativity (Lakatos, 1970). </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate highly novel but factually incorrect outputs, requiring evaluators to balance axes (Bubeck et al., 2023). </li>
    <li>Human peer review often involves explicit discussion of trade-offs (e.g., between explanatory power and parsimony). </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The concept of trade-offs is known, but its formalization for LLM-generated theory evaluation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Trade-offs in theory evaluation are discussed in philosophy of science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly requiring evaluators to account for these trade-offs in LLM-generated theory evaluation is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluators use a multidimensional alignment rubric, inter-rater agreement on LLM-generated theory quality will increase.</li>
                <li>Theories that score highly across multiple axes will be more likely to be accepted by scientific communities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Optimizing LLMs for multidimensional alignment may lead to emergent properties in theory generation (e.g., more creative yet robust theories).</li>
                <li>Explicit multidimensional evaluation may reveal new, previously unrecognized axes of scientific value.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-axis evaluation (e.g., factuality only) produces equally robust theory selection as multidimensional evaluation, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If evaluators cannot reliably distinguish trade-offs between axes, the necessity of multidimensional alignment is questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where a single axis (e.g., empirical adequacy) is so dominant that other axes are irrelevant in practice. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory builds on existing multidimensional evaluation concepts but formalizes them for the LLM-generated scientific theory context.</p>
