                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Refinement and Consensus Law Extraction in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine candidate quantitative laws by simulating a process analogous to scientific peer review and consensus-building. By repeatedly sampling, critiquing, and reconciling quantitative relationships extracted from diverse papers, the LLM converges on robust, consensus laws that are resilient to outliers and noise. This process leverages the LLM's ability to model argumentation, uncertainty, and evidence weighting, resulting in more reliable law extraction than single-pass summarization.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve law accuracy or robustness with iterative refinement, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot suppress outlier or spurious laws despite evidence weighting, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully address how LLMs handle deeply entrenched biases or systematic errors present in the majority of the literature. </li>
