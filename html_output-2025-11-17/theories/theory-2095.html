                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can distill quantitative laws from scholarly papers by identifying statistical regularities in reported data, results, and equations, even when explicit laws are not stated. By mining patterns in numerical values, relationships, and trends across many studies, the LLM can induce candidate quantitative laws that generalize observed phenomena.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize and generalize from large sets of numerical data and results, as seen in tasks such as table-to-text generation and scientific summarization. </li>
    <li>Pattern mining and law induction are established in data mining and machine learning, with automated systems like the Robot Scientist (King et al., 2009) successfully inducing scientific laws from data. </li>
    <li>LLMs can extract and align numerical relationships from heterogeneous sources, as shown in recent work on multi-document scientific synthesis. </li>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to perform few-shot and in-context learning, enabling them to generalize patterns from limited but representative data. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is a targeted extension of known methods to the context of LLM-driven law induction, with novelty in the application to unstructured, multi-source scholarly corpora.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Pattern mining and law induction are established in data mining; LLMs can summarize and generalize from data.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law applies these principles specifically to LLM-driven induction of quantitative laws from scholarly corpora, leveraging LLMs' emergent pattern recognition and synthesis capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to induce correct quantitative laws from consistent data patterns, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs overfit to spurious correlations or noise, producing incorrect laws, the theory's assumptions would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize beyond explicit statements in the text, the theory's claim of implicit law induction would be falsified.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how LLMs distinguish between causation and correlation in mined patterns. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for LLMs to validate or experimentally test induced laws. </li>
