                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2488</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Molecular Signature-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular signatures, including expression of specific receptors, proteostasis machinery, and stress response genes. Populations expressing high levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), tau, or receptors facilitating amyloid uptake, and with low expression of chaperones or autophagy-related proteins, are more vulnerable. Conversely, populations with robust proteostatic and stress response gene expression are resistant.</p>
