                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Fidelity Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximizes semantic fidelity: the preservation and explicit encoding of all graph semantics (nodes, edges, attributes, and higher-order structures) in a form that is both interpretable and compositional for language models. The theory asserts that representations which maintain a one-to-one mapping between graph elements and textual tokens, while preserving graph topology and attribute information, will yield the most effective language model training outcomes.</p>

                <li>Semantic fidelity may interact with model size: smaller models may benefit more from explicit representations, while larger models may learn to infer missing semantics from context.</li>
                <li>There may exist a threshold of semantic detail beyond which further explicitness does not yield additional performance gains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model trained on a semantically complete, invertible representation fails to reconstruct the original graph, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If a non-compositional, uninterpretable representation yields better generalization than a compositional one, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models trained on lossy representations consistently outperform those trained on semantically explicit ones across a range of graph-based tasks, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of representation length and tokenization efficiency on model training cost and performance is not directly addressed. </li>
    <li>The effect of domain-specific graph structures (e.g., biological networks vs. social graphs) on the optimality of representation is not considered. </li>
