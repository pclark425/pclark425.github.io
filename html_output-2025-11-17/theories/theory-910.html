                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Compression and Expansion Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents in text games optimally utilize memory by dynamically compressing and expanding contextual information. Compression reduces memory load by abstracting or summarizing less relevant details, while expansion reconstructs or retrieves detailed information as needed for reasoning or action. This adaptive process enables agents to balance memory efficiency with task-relevant recall, especially in environments with limited context windows or high information density.</p>
