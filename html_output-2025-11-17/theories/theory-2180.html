                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when exposed to large, heterogeneous corpora spanning multiple scientific disciplines, can identify and synthesize cross-disciplinary patterns and analogies, leading to the generation of novel, generalizable scientific theories that would be difficult for human experts to discover due to disciplinary silos.</p>
