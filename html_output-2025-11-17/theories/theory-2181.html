                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates logical coherence, empirical adequacy, novelty, and epistemic utility. Each dimension is necessary but not sufficient alone; only their intersection yields robust evaluation. The theory further asserts that the weighting of these dimensions should be context-sensitive, adapting to the scientific domain and the intended use of the theory.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Scientific theory evaluation in philosophy of science (e.g., Kuhn, Lakatos, Popper) emphasizes logical consistency, empirical fit, and novelty as core criteria. </li>
    <li>Recent work on AI-generated hypotheses highlights the need for both empirical and epistemic evaluation (e.g., ability to generate new predictions, explanatory power). </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate plausible but logically inconsistent or empirically unsupported theories, necessitating multi-dimensional evaluation. </li>
    <li>Epistemic utility (e.g., explanatory power, unification, predictive scope) is a recognized but often underemphasized criterion in both human and AI-generated theory assessment. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the criteria themselves are well-known, their explicit, conjunctive application to LLM-generated theories and the requirement for their intersection is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multi-criteria evaluation is standard in philosophy of science, but typically for human-generated theories.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly formalizes the necessity of all four dimensions for LLM-generated theories and their intersection as a requirement.</p>
