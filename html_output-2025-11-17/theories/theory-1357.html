                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1357</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Metacognitive Loop Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, instantiate an emergent metacognitive loop. In this loop, the model not only evaluates the content of its answers but also monitors its own reasoning strategies, error patterns, and confidence levels. Through repeated cycles, the model adapts its approach, leading to improved answer quality not just by correcting content, but by refining its own process of reasoning and self-evaluation.</p>
