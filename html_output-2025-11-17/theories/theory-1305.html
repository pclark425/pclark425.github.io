                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Alignment Theory for Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the ideal graph-to-text representation is one that preserves the compositional and structural alignment between the graph and its textual form, enabling language models to learn mappings that are both interpretable and generalizable. The theory posits that representations which maintain explicit correspondences between graph substructures and text segments facilitate better learning, transfer, and reasoning.</p>
