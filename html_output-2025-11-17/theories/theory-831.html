                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Deliberative-Programmatic Memory Control Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal memory use in LLM agents arises from a hierarchical integration of deliberative (explicit, agent-driven) and programmatic (algorithmic, system-driven) memory control. At higher levels, agents use deliberative reasoning to set memory goals and policies, while lower levels execute programmatic routines for memory retrieval, storage, and pruning. The theory predicts that this hierarchical structure enables both flexible adaptation and efficient, scalable memory management across a wide range of tasks.</p>
