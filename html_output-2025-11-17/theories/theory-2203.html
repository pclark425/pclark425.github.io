                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2203</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates logical coherence, empirical plausibility, novelty, and alignment with domain-specific constraints. Each dimension is assessed independently and then synthesized to produce an overall evaluation score, enabling both automated and human-in-the-loop assessment. The theory further asserts that weighting these dimensions adaptively, based on the scientific context and intended use, yields more robust and context-sensitive evaluations.</p>
