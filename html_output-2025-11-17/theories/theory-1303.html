                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1303</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that optimally balances information preservation and representational efficiency, following an information bottleneck principle. The representation should retain all task-relevant information from the graph while minimizing redundancy and irrelevant detail, thus maximizing the mutual information between the graph and the text while compressing away noise. This enables language models to learn the essential graph semantics without being overwhelmed by superfluous structure.</p>
