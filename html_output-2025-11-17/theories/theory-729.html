            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit algorithmic supervision, they may develop more robust arithmetic capabilities.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are probed for internal representations, they may reveal emergent algorithmic subroutines for arithmetic.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If small LLMs can solve complex arithmetic without stepwise reasoning, this would challenge the capacity-dependent law.</li>
