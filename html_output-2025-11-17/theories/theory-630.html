                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Feasibility Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the recent emergence of positive-energy warp bubble solutions in general relativity (e.g., Lentz, Bobrick & Martire, Fell & Heisenberg, Fuchs et al.) opens a new regime for FTL spacetime engineering, in which the stress-energy required to support a warp bubble can, in principle, be constructed from positive-energy matter and fields. While these solutions may still require enormous total energy and present formidable engineering challenges, they are not fundamentally forbidden by quantum inequalities or energy conditions, and thus represent a physically plausible (if technologically daunting) path to FTL travel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Analytic and numerical estimates for positive-energy warp bubbles (e.g., Lentz, Bobrick & Martire, Fuchs et al.) show that total energy scales with the square of the bubble radius and linearly with wall thickness. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5558.html#e5558.0" class="evidence-link">[e5558.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.6" class="evidence-link">[e5556.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.5" class="evidence-link">[e5556.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5553.html#e5553.5" class="evidence-link">[e5553.5]</a> </li>
    <li>For a 100 m radius bubble with 1 m wall thickness, total energy is estimated to be a fraction of a solar mass, which is enormous but not fundamentally forbidden. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5558.html#e5558.0" class="evidence-link">[e5558.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.6" class="evidence-link">[e5556.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.5" class="evidence-link">[e5556.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5553.html#e5553.5" class="evidence-link">[e5553.5]</a> </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is a quantitative generalization of existing scaling results, applied to the new class of positive-energy warp bubbles.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Scaling laws for energy requirements in warp bubble geometries have been discussed in the literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies the scaling to positive-energy warp bubbles and emphasizes that, while the energy is enormous, it is not forbidden by fundamental physics.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Future numerical-relativity simulations will find that positive-energy warp bubbles can be constructed in principle, provided the stress-energy tensor satisfies all energy conditions for all observers.</li>
                <li>Observational searches for technosignatures may detect emissions (EM, GW, particle) from positive-energy warp bubbles if advanced civilizations construct them.</li>
                <li>Laboratory-scale experiments will not be able to construct positive-energy warp bubbles due to the enormous energy requirements, but no fundamental physical law will forbid their existence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new class of matter or field is discovered that can realize the required positive-energy stress-energy tensor with much lower energy density, positive-energy warp bubbles may become technologically feasible.</li>
                <li>If quantum gravity or other new physics imposes additional constraints on positive-energy warp bubbles, their feasibility may be limited in ways not currently understood.</li>
                <li>If a positive-energy warp bubble is observed in nature (e.g., as a technosignature), it would confirm the physical plausibility of such constructs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstration that all positive-energy warp bubble solutions violate energy conditions for some observers would falsify the Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Law.</li>
                <li>Observation that quantum inequalities or other fundamental constraints forbid positive-energy warp bubbles would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>Failure to find any physically realizable positive-energy warp bubble solution in full nonlinear general relativity would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some positive-energy warp bubble proposals have not yet been demonstrated to satisfy energy conditions for all observers; further analysis is needed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5558.html#e5558.0" class="evidence-link">[e5558.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.6" class="evidence-link">[e5556.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.5" class="evidence-link">[e5556.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5553.html#e5553.5" class="evidence-link">[e5553.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The practical engineering of the required positive-energy stress-energy distributions remains unresolved. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5558.html#e5558.0" class="evidence-link">[e5558.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.6" class="evidence-link">[e5556.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5556.html#e5556.5" class="evidence-link">[e5556.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5553.html#e5553.5" class="evidence-link">[e5553.5]</a> </li>
