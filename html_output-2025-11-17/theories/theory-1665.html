                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is determined by the degree of epistemic alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the formal epistemic structures (e.g., ontologies, causal models, and procedural rules) of the scientific subdomain. High alignment enables accurate simulation, while misalignment leads to systematic errors, even within the LLM's training distribution.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will show higher simulation accuracy in subdomains with explicit, well-structured ontologies (e.g., organic chemistry) than in loosely structured domains (e.g., ecology).</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning LLMs to better align with subdomain epistemic structures will improve simulation accuracy.</li>
                <li>Systematic errors will cluster around areas of epistemic misalignment, even if training data coverage is high.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit epistemic structure supervision, they may develop new forms of generalization.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are prompted to self-reflect on their epistemic structure, they may self-correct errors.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to hybrid symbolic-neural training, epistemic alignment may improve beyond current architectures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in domains with low epistemic alignment, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If systematic errors do not correlate with epistemic misalignment, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If fine-tuning for epistemic alignment does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may achieve high accuracy in some loosely structured domains due to statistical regularities rather than epistemic alignment. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes ideas from representation learning and epistemology, but the explicit application to LLM simulation is new.</p>
