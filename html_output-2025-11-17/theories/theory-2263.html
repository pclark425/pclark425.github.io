                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2263</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most effective when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The process leverages the complementary strengths of humans (domain expertise, intuition, ethical judgment) and AI (scalability, pattern recognition, consistency) to refine, critique, and validate candidate theories. The theory emphasizes the necessity of repeated cycles of evaluation and feedback, with each cycle improving the quality and reliability of the resulting scientific theories.</p>
