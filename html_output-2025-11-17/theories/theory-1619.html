                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1619</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Contextualization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is fundamentally limited by their ability to dynamically contextualize queries within the evolving discourse and methodological context of the subdomain. LLMs that can incorporate up-to-date, context-rich information (e.g., via retrieval-augmented generation or real-time feedback) will outperform static models, especially in rapidly evolving or highly contextual subdomains.</p>
