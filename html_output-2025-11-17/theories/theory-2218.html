                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Epistemic Traceability for LLM-Generated Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the scientific value and trustworthiness of LLM-generated theories are fundamentally dependent on the epistemic traceability of their claims. That is, every assertion within an LLM-generated theory should be traceable to its source data, underlying reasoning, and, where possible, to the scientific literature or empirical evidence. The theory further asserts that traceability enables robust error analysis, facilitates scientific debate, and is essential for integrating LLM-generated theories into the broader scientific enterprise.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>High traceability may reveal systematic biases in LLM training data that would otherwise go undetected.</li>
                <li>Mandating traceability may limit the generative creativity of LLMs, potentially reducing the novelty of their theories.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly traceable LLM-generated theories are found to be systematically incorrect, the sufficiency of traceability as a trust metric is called into question.</li>
                <li>If untraceable but correct LLM-generated theories are routinely discovered, the necessity of traceability is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle assertions based on genuinely novel synthesis or abduction, where no direct source exists. </li>
