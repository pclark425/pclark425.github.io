                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates criteria of internal logical coherence, empirical plausibility, novelty, and potential for falsifiability. The framework asserts that only by systematically assessing these dimensions can the scientific value and reliability of LLM-generated theories be determined, and that the weighting of these criteria should be dynamically adjusted based on the maturity of the scientific domain and the intended use-case (e.g., hypothesis generation vs. publication).</p>
