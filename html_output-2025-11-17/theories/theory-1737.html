                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Generalized Language Model Representation and Adaptation Theory for Anomaly Detection in Lists and Tabular Data</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) internally construct generalized representations of list and tabular data, capturing both explicit and implicit regularities, and can adapt these representations to new contexts. Anomalies are detected as items that deviate from the learned or adapted representation, either at the level of token probability, semantic coherence, or structural conformity. The theory further asserts that LLMs can generalize across domains and data types, enabling robust anomaly detection even in previously unseen or weakly structured data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to detect anomalies in highly abstract or non-linguistic tabular data (e.g., sensor readings) if provided with minimal context.</li>
                <li>The theory predicts that LLMs could generalize anomaly detection to multimodal data (e.g., text and images) if the internal representation is sufficiently abstract.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to detect anomalies in lists/tables from novel domains, the theory's claim of generalized representation is challenged.</li>
                <li>If providing in-context examples does not improve anomaly detection, the adaptation law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle adversarially constructed lists that mimic normal patterns but are semantically anomalous. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify the limits of generalization for highly non-linguistic or high-dimensional tabular data. </li>
