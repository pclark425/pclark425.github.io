                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Abstracted Chemical Syntax and Functional Motif Transfer in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, through exposure to large chemical corpora, learn abstract representations of chemical syntax and functional motifs, enabling them to recombine these motifs in novel ways. When prompted for specific applications, the LLM can transfer relevant motifs to new chemical backbones, facilitating the generation of molecules with desired properties even in zero-shot settings.</p>
