                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Symbolic Law Discovery as a Self-Organizing System</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the process of LLM-enabled law discovery, when coupled with program synthesis and simulation feedback, forms a self-organizing system. The system dynamically adapts its internal representations and candidate laws in response to feedback, leading to emergent, robust symbolic laws that are not explicitly encoded in the input data but arise from the iterative interaction between LLM, synthesis, and simulation.</p>
