                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates criteria from philosophy of science (such as explanatory power, coherence, novelty, and empirical adequacy) with computational metrics (such as formalizability, prediction density, and interpretability). The theory asserts that only by combining these dimensions can automated or semi-automated systems robustly assess the scientific merit of LLM-generated theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Evaluation systems that use both computational and philosophical criteria will outperform those using only one in ranking LLM-generated theories by scientific value.</li>
                <li>LLM-generated theories that score highly across multiple criteria will be more likely to be accepted by human experts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some LLM-generated theories may score highly on computational metrics but poorly on philosophical criteria, or vice versa, leading to ambiguous overall evaluation.</li>
                <li>The optimal weighting of different criteria for different scientific domains remains undetermined and may vary significantly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-criterion evaluation systems consistently match or outperform multi-criteria systems in expert alignment, the multi-criteria necessity law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If integration of computational and philosophical criteria does not improve robustness or reliability, the integration law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts between criteria (e.g., high novelty but low empirical adequacy). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
