                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Law of Feedback Loop and Syntax/Error Reporting in Code-Generating LLM Simulators</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In code-generating scientific simulation tasks, the presence of an iterative feedback loop with syntax checking and error reporting is necessary for high accuracy, especially for less capable LLMs. The feedback loop enables the LLM to correct errors and converge to correct solutions, and its absence results in low or zero accuracy regardless of model scale or prompt engineering. This law is supported by extensive ablation and comparative evidence across multiple LLMs and simulation tasks, and is particularly critical for open-source or less capable models.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 achieve high coding accuracy on DALINE tasks only when feedback loop and syntax/error reporting are present; without these, accuracy is near zero. Ablation studies show that omitting the feedback loop or syntax/error reporting drops accuracy from 96% (GPT-4o-Full) or 81% (GPT-3.5-Full) to 0% (GPT-4o-Sole, GPT-3.5-Sole). <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.0" class="evidence-link">[e5509.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.1" class="evidence-link">[e5509.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Ablation experiments show that adding syntax checking and error reporting, as well as iterative feedback, are necessary for less capable LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) to reach high accuracy; without these, even with prompt engineering and RAG, accuracy remains low. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.1" class="evidence-link">[e5509.1]</a> </li>
    <li>ChatGPT-4o (web interface with official RAG) achieves only 33.82% accuracy despite access to the full knowledge base, due to lack of enhanced feedback loop and syntax/error reporting, compared to 96.07% for GPT-4o-Full with all framework components. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.2" class="evidence-link">[e5509.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Iterative feedback and error reporting are especially critical for weaker models: GPT-3.5-Full (with all framework components) achieves 81.37%, but without feedback loop or syntax checking, accuracy drops to 0%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.1" class="evidence-link">[e5509.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The feedback loop enables correction of code errors and convergence to correct solutions, as shown by the iterative improvement in code accuracy over multiple attempts per task. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.0" class="evidence-link">[e5509.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5509.html#e5509.1" class="evidence-link">[e5509.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The necessity of feedback loop and error reporting is further supported by the failure of other LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, LLaMA) to reliably follow span-copying or code-generation instructions in zero-shot settings without such mechanisms. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5510.html#e5510.1" class="evidence-link">[e5510.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While feedback and error correction are established in software engineering, their necessity as a system-level requirement for LLM-based scientific code simulation is new and not previously formalized in the LLM literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Iterative feedback and error correction are well-known in software engineering and human-in-the-loop programming, but their necessity and sufficiency for LLM-based code simulation accuracy, especially in scientific simulation, has not been formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes, with empirical ablation evidence, that an explicit feedback loop with syntax/error reporting is necessary (not just helpful) for high-accuracy LLM-based code simulation, especially for less capable or open-source LLMs.</p>

</ul>
            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new code-based scientific simulation task is attempted without a feedback loop and error reporting, even strong LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) will achieve low or zero accuracy.</li>
                <li>Adding an iterative feedback loop with syntax/error reporting to an existing LLM code simulation system will increase accuracy, especially for weaker or open-source models.</li>
                <li>For tasks requiring multi-step code generation or adaptation to new toolboxes, the absence of a feedback loop will result in persistent errors and low task completion rates.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the feedback loop is made adaptive (e.g., prioritizing error types, using meta-learning, or learning from past correction patterns), accuracy may further improve, but the magnitude of improvement is unknown.</li>
                <li>If feedback is provided in natural language rather than structured error messages, the effect on LLM correction and convergence is unknown and may depend on the LLM's ability to parse and act on unstructured feedback.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained end-to-end with simulated feedback loops (e.g., reinforcement learning with code execution), it is unknown whether explicit external feedback loops will remain necessary.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If high accuracy is achieved on code-based simulation tasks without a feedback loop or error reporting (i.e., in a single-shot or non-iterative setting), the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If adding a feedback loop and syntax/error reporting does not improve accuracy for code-based simulation tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If a less capable LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5) achieves high accuracy on code-based simulation tasks without any feedback or error reporting, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Tasks where code generation is trivial, deterministic, or fully covered by pretraining (e.g., canonical examples or simple scripts) may not require a feedback loop for high accuracy. </li>
    <li>Some LLMs with built-in code execution and self-correction (e.g., future models with integrated tool-use) may reduce the need for external feedback loops. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work formalizes this law as a necessary system-level requirement for LLM-based scientific code simulation; prior work focuses on code execution as a tool, not as a required feedback loop for accuracy.</p>
