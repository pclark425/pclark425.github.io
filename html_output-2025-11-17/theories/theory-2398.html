                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Synaptic Activity-Dependent Protective Signaling</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective resistance of certain visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein tangles is due to their intrinsic ability to engage synaptic activity-dependent protective signaling pathways. Neurons with higher baseline or stimulus-induced activity activate neuroprotective gene programs (e.g., BDNF, CREB, synaptic scaling) that buffer against proteotoxic stress, while less active neurons lack this resilience. This activity-dependent resilience is hypothesized to underlie the observed heterogeneity in vulnerability among visual cortex neurons in dementia.</p>
