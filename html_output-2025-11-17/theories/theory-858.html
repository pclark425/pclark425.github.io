                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Utilization Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically leveraging a hierarchy of memory systems—short-term, episodic, and semantic—wherein information is selectively encoded, retrieved, and abstracted based on task demands, recency, and relevance. The agent's ability to flexibly traverse and update these memory layers enables both rapid adaptation to new information and robust generalization across tasks.</p>
