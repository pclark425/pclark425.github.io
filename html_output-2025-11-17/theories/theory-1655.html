                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Simulation Bottlenecks: Limits of Internalized Reasoning in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the primary bottleneck for LLM accuracy in scientific simulation is the mismatch between the internalized reasoning capabilities of the model and the formal, algorithmic, or up-to-date knowledge required by the domain. It asserts that LLMs are fundamentally limited by their training data and internal architecture, and that externalization via tools is the only reliable way to overcome these bottlenecks for high-fidelity simulation.</p>
