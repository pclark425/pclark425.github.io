                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent World-State Representation Emergence in Autoregressive Language Models for Board Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that autoregressive language models, when trained on spatial board games (such as Sudoku), spontaneously develop internal latent representations that encode the current world-state of the game. These representations are not explicitly supervised but emerge as a consequence of the model's need to predict legal and contextually appropriate moves. The latent world-state is distributed across the model's activations and is dynamically updated as the model processes each move, enabling the model to maintain spatial consistency and enforce game rules.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Probing the hidden states of a language model trained on Sudoku will allow accurate reconstruction of the current board at any step.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on multiple board games with conflicting spatial rules, it may develop either a unified or game-specific latent world-state representation.</li>
                <li>If the model is forced to process moves in a non-sequential order, the integrity of the latent world-state may degrade or reorganize.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If probing the hidden states does not allow reconstruction of the board state, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the model makes frequent illegal moves despite sufficient training, it would suggest the absence of a robust latent world-state.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models may use shallow pattern-matching rather than true latent state tracking, especially on small or trivial boards. </li>
