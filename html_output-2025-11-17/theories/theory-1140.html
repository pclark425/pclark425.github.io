                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dual-Process Reasoning Theory for Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) can best perform strict logical reasoning when they explicitly separate and coordinate two distinct reasoning processes: (1) a fast, pattern-based, intuitive process (System 1) and (2) a slow, rule-based, formal logical process (System 2). The LM must be architected or prompted to invoke System 2 for tasks requiring strict logic, and to cross-validate System 1 outputs with System 2, ensuring logical rigor and minimizing errors from pattern-matching alone.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Human reasoning is often modeled as dual-process (Kahneman, 2011), and LMs show both intuitive and formal reasoning behaviors. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law adapts dual-process theory to LMs and formalizes the need for explicit coordination for logical rigor.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Dual-process theories are well-established in cognitive science; LMs have been observed to exhibit both intuitive and formal reasoning.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly requiring LMs to coordinate and cross-validate these processes for strict logic is new.</p>
