                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1723</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid and Retrieval-Augmented LLM Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when augmented with retrieval mechanisms that access external structured or unstructured data, can detect anomalies in lists by comparing observed list patterns to both their internalized world knowledge and dynamically retrieved reference data. The hybrid approach leverages the LLM's generalization and reasoning abilities with up-to-date, domain-specific, or contextually relevant information, enabling robust anomaly detection even in rapidly evolving or specialized domains.</p>
