                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill qualitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by leveraging the emergent property of uncertainty aggregation. Specifically, LLMs identify and amplify points of high epistemic uncertainty across diverse sources, and use these as focal points for hypothesis generation and law abstraction. The process is driven by the model's ability to detect, represent, and synthesize areas of consensus and contention, allowing for the emergence of new, generalizable qualitative laws.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize, contrast, and synthesize conflicting or uncertain information from multiple sources, as seen in multi-document summarization and scientific review tasks. </li>
    <li>Human scientists often focus on areas of uncertainty or controversy to generate new hypotheses and laws, suggesting a parallel mechanism in LLM-driven discovery. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to highlight ambiguous, controversial, or underdetermined findings in scientific literature, indicating sensitivity to epistemic uncertainty. </li>
    <li>Recent work in AI interpretability shows that LLMs can represent uncertainty internally, as evidenced by calibration and confidence estimation studies. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is exposed to a large, diverse set of papers in a field with unresolved controversies, it will generate candidate qualitative laws that focus on the points of highest uncertainty.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be more likely to propose novel qualitative laws in fields with high epistemic diversity than in fields with strong consensus.</li>
                <li>When prompted to summarize a field, LLMs will highlight areas of uncertainty and propose new generalizations at those points.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to identify entirely new scientific paradigms by aggregating uncertainty across multiple, seemingly unrelated fields.</li>
                <li>The emergent laws generated by LLMs may outperform human-derived laws in predictive power in certain complex, data-rich domains.</li>
                <li>LLMs could reveal hidden connections between disparate scientific controversies, leading to unexpected law synthesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate any new candidate laws when exposed to highly uncertain or contentious literature, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate laws only in areas of consensus and ignore uncertainty, the uncertainty aggregation principle would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot distinguish between genuine epistemic uncertainty and noise or error, the theory's mechanism would be undermined.</li>
