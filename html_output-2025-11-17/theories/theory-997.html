                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by structuring their memory episodically, segmenting experiences into goal-relevant episodes, and dynamically retrieving or recombining these episodes based on current objectives. The theory emphasizes the importance of temporal and causal organization, enabling agents to generalize across similar situations and adapt to novel challenges.</p>

    <li>LLM agents with episodic memory modules (e.g., memory graphs, event segmentation) show improved generalization and task transfer. </li>
