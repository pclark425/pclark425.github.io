                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular profiles, including gene expression patterns, proteostasis capacity, and receptor composition. These intrinsic factors govern the ability of neurons to handle misfolded proteins, respond to stress, and maintain cellular homeostasis.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introducing novel proteostasis pathways from resistant species (e.g., long-lived mammals) into human neurons will confer resistance.</li>
                <li>Altering receptor expression in resistant neurons will render them vulnerable.</li>
                <li>Proteostasis enhancement in the absence of receptor modulation may be insufficient for protection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If proteostasis gene expression does not correlate with resistance in visual cortex neurons, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If receptor expression does not predict vulnerability, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If manipulation of these intrinsic factors does not alter pathology, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with high proteostasis gene expression still develop pathology. </li>
    <li>Environmental factors (e.g., glial activity) may override intrinsic molecular signatures. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
