                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory-Enhanced Decision-Making Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language model (LLM) agents improve their performance in text-based games by integrating multiple forms of memory—working memory for short-term dependencies and episodic memory for long-term experience recall—enabling better generalization, faster learning, and adaptive decision-making. Memory mechanisms allow agents to store, retrieve, and reflect on past experiences, which enhances their ability to solve complex, multi-step tasks that require remembering sequences, inferring relationships, and adapting strategies based on prior outcomes.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents benefit from combining working memory and episodic memory to handle both short-term and long-term dependencies in text games.</li>
                <li>Episodic memory enables agents to recall specific past experiences or feedback, which improves generalization to unseen tasks and environments.</li>
                <li>Memory architectures that allow rapid updates and retrieval (e.g., key-value stores, DND) accelerate learning and adaptation in complex environments.</li>
                <li>Verbal reinforcement learning combined with episodic memory allows LLM agents to learn from self-reflection, improving performance without traditional gradient updates.</li>
                <li>Memory capacity and update mechanisms influence the agent's ability to generalize and adapt, with limitations arising from memory size or update frequency.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The Memory Recall Agent (MRA) uses both working memory (LSTM) and episodic memory (slot-based) to achieve superhuman scores on memory tasks, showing improved generalization and long-term dependency handling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1.html#e1.0" class="evidence-link">[e1.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Neural Episodic Control (NEC) employs episodic memory via a Differentiable Neural Dictionary (DND) to rapidly integrate experiences, resulting in faster learning in the Atari Learning Environment compared to traditional methods. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3.html#e3.0" class="evidence-link">[e3.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Reflexion agent uses episodic memory to store self-reflective feedback, improving decision-making and task performance in complex multi-step environments like AlfWorld. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents equipped with both working and episodic memory will outperform agents with only one type of memory on complex text games requiring multi-step reasoning.</li>
                <li>Incorporating self-reflective feedback into episodic memory will improve LLM agent performance on tasks requiring error correction or strategy adaptation.</li>
                <li>Memory architectures that support efficient key-value retrieval will enable faster learning in new text game environments compared to purely parametric models.</li>
                <li>Agents with episodic memory buffers that store recent experiences will show improved performance on tasks with sparse or delayed rewards.</li>
                <li>Increasing episodic memory capacity within LLM context limits will correlate with improved task success rates in multi-step text games.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether scaling episodic memory beyond current LLM context window limits will yield proportional improvements in complex text game performance.</li>
                <li>If integrating multiple memory types (e.g., semantic memory alongside episodic and working memory) will further enhance LLM agent generalization and adaptability.</li>
                <li>Whether verbal reinforcement learning combined with episodic memory can enable zero-shot transfer to entirely novel text game domains.</li>
                <li>If memory architectures can be optimized to overcome current limitations in generalizing outside training distributions in highly complex tasks.</li>
                <li>Whether episodic memory mechanisms can be adapted to enable LLM agents to learn and reason about abstract concepts beyond concrete episodic events.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Testing agents with disabled episodic memory modules to see if performance drops significantly on tasks requiring long-term dependencies.</li>
                <li>Evaluating agents with working memory only to determine if they fail to generalize to holdout or unseen tasks compared to agents with episodic memory.</li>
                <li>Removing self-reflective feedback from Reflexion agents to assess if performance gains on multi-step tasks diminish.</li>
                <li>Comparing learning speed of NEC with and without the DND memory to verify if rapid experience integration is memory-dependent.</li>
                <li>Testing if increasing episodic memory capacity beyond a threshold yields no further performance improvements, challenging the assumed linear benefit.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanisms by which episodic memory updates without gradient flow maintain computational efficiency are not fully detailed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1.html#e1.0" class="evidence-link">[e1.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Limitations in memory effectiveness under certain challenging conditions, such as tasks requiring full generalization outside training sets, remain unresolved. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1.html#e1.0" class="evidence-link">[e1.0]</a> </li>
