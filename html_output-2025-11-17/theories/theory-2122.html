                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize high-level scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by leveraging their ability to semantically align, abstract, and generalize across diverse textual evidence. The LLM acts as a meta-analyst, identifying patterns, contradictions, and convergences in the literature to propose new, testable theoretical frameworks relevant to a given query.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can perform contradiction detection and evidence aggregation, as shown in claim verification and fact-checking tasks. </li>
    <li>Scientific progress often arises from resolving contradictions and synthesizing convergent evidence. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law builds on existing NLP and scientific synthesis methods, but applies them in a novel, automated, theory-building context.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Contradiction detection and evidence aggregation are known in NLP and scientific practice.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Automated, LLM-driven identification and synthesis of theoretical contradictions/convergences at scale is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may synthesize entirely novel theoretical frameworks that have not been previously articulated by human experts.</li>
                <li>LLMs could reveal latent, cross-disciplinary theoretical connections that are not apparent to domain specialists.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to produce coherent or accurate theoretical syntheses from large corpora, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLM-generated theories do not align with or meaningfully extend human meta-analyses, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of domain-specific jargon and implicit assumptions on LLM synthesis accuracy is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential for LLMs to propagate or amplify existing biases in the literature is not explicitly modeled. </li>
