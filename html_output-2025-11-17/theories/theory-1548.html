                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Feasibility Principle (Macroscopic Casimir Engineering)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by engineering large-scale Casimir-like boundary conditions using advanced metamaterials and nanostructures, it is possible to generate positive-energy density regions that mimic the spacetime geometry of a warp bubble. The theory leverages the ability to manipulate vacuum energy at macroscopic scales, potentially enabling FTL travel without the need for exotic negative energy.</p>
