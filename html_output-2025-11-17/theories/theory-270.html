                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Architectural Modularity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory explaining the dissociation between strong QA performance and weak interactive procedural performance in LLM-based agents, and the architectural/training interventions required to close the gap.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the dissociation between strong QA performance and weak interactive procedural performance in LLM-based agents arises from the monolithic, undifferentiated architecture of transformer-based LLMs. Unlike human cognition, which employs specialized neural circuits for different cognitive functions (declarative memory, procedural memory, working memory, executive control), current LLMs use a single, homogeneous architecture to handle all tasks. This architectural uniformity creates a fundamental bottleneck: while the same mechanism can retrieve and articulate procedural knowledge (QA), it cannot simultaneously maintain goal states, track environmental changes, plan action sequences, detect errors, and execute recovery strategies - all of which are required for successful interactive procedural performance. The theory predicts that introducing architectural modularity - specialized sub-networks or modules for distinct cognitive functions - will close the performance gap by allowing different aspects of procedural execution to be handled by components optimized for those specific functions. Critically, this modularity must be complemented by appropriate training procedures that encourage functional specialization while maintaining inter-module coordination.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The monolithic transformer architecture processes all cognitive functions (knowledge retrieval, planning, state tracking, error detection) through the same undifferentiated mechanism, creating interference and resource competition that manifests as performance degradation on interactive tasks.</li>
                <li>Interactive procedural tasks require simultaneous activation of multiple specialized cognitive functions (at minimum: knowledge retrieval, goal maintenance, state tracking, action planning, and error monitoring) that benefit from architectural separation and specialization.</li>
                <li>The performance gap between QA and interactive procedural tasks increases monotonically with: (a) the number of distinct cognitive functions that must be simultaneously active, (b) the length of the interaction sequence, and (c) the complexity of state tracking required.</li>
                <li>Introducing architectural modularity with specialized components for: (1) declarative knowledge retrieval, (2) goal and subgoal maintenance, (3) state tracking and working memory, (4) action planning and sequencing, and (5) error detection and recovery, will reduce the performance gap by at least 25% on standard benchmarks compared to parameter-matched monolithic models.</li>
                <li>The degree of performance improvement from modularization will correlate positively with: (a) the degree of functional specialization achieved within modules (measurable via representational analysis), (b) the quality of inter-module communication protocols, and (c) the alignment between module boundaries and natural task decomposition.</li>
                <li>Modules trained with function-specific objectives will develop more efficient and specialized internal representations than monolithic models trained with general language modeling objectives, as measured by probing classifiers and activation analysis.</li>
                <li>The architectural modularity must be complemented by training procedures that encourage functional specialization within modules while maintaining coherent inter-module coordination; purely architectural changes without appropriate training will show minimal benefits.</li>
                <li>The benefits of modularity will be most pronounced for tasks with clear functional decomposition and will diminish for tasks requiring tight integration of multiple functions within single processing steps.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs demonstrate high performance on question-answering benchmarks including procedural knowledge questions, yet fail on interactive tasks requiring the same knowledge, establishing the core dissociation. </li>
    <li>Agent performance degrades significantly as task length increases, suggesting inability to maintain goal states and track progress over extended interactions, consistent with limitations in simultaneous processing of multiple cognitive functions. </li>
    <li>LLM agents struggle with error recovery and replanning when initial actions fail, despite being able to describe recovery strategies when asked, indicating a dissociation between knowledge retrieval and executive control functions. </li>
    <li>Neuroscience research demonstrates that human procedural and declarative memory systems are neuroanatomically and functionally distinct, with different brain regions specialized for different cognitive functions, providing biological precedent for functional modularity. </li>
    <li>Modular neural network architectures in other domains show improved performance on complex tasks requiring multiple cognitive functions, demonstrating the general principle that architectural specialization can improve multi-function performance. </li>
    <li>LLMs show poor performance on tasks requiring simultaneous tracking of multiple state variables and constraints, consistent with resource competition in monolithic architectures. </li>
    <li>Transformer attention mechanisms have finite capacity and show interference effects when processing multiple types of information simultaneously, supporting the resource competition hypothesis. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An LLM architecture with a dedicated 'working memory module' (separate from the main transformer, possibly implemented as a differentiable external memory) that explicitly tracks task state will show improved performance on multi-step procedural tasks compared to standard architectures, with gains proportional to task length (predicted 15-40% improvement on tasks >10 steps).</li>
                <li>Adding a specialized 'goal maintenance module' that receives explicit supervision on maintaining and updating goals will reduce goal drift in long-horizon tasks by at least 30%, with the effect size increasing with task length.</li>
                <li>A modular architecture with separate planning and execution modules will show better error recovery than monolithic models (predicted 25-50% improvement in recovery success rate), as the planning module can be re-invoked without disrupting state tracking.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning only the action planning module on procedural tasks while keeping the knowledge retrieval module frozen will improve interactive performance by 20-35% without degrading QA performance (less than 2% degradation).</li>
                <li>Architectures with explicit module boundaries will show more interpretable failure modes, as errors can be localized to specific modules (e.g., planning failures vs. state tracking failures), with at least 70% of failures attributable to a single module.</li>
                <li>Modular architectures will show reduced performance degradation under distribution shift when the shift affects only one cognitive function (e.g., novel action spaces but familiar goals), compared to monolithic models where all functions are affected.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A fully modular architecture with 5+ specialized modules might show emergent capabilities in complex procedural tasks that were never seen during training, due to novel combinations of module outputs - this could manifest as zero-shot transfer to task types not in the training distribution.</li>
                <li>The optimal degree of modularity may be task-dependent: highly modular architectures (7+ modules) might underperform on tasks requiring tight integration of multiple cognitive functions, suggesting a modularity-integration tradeoff with a performance crossover point.</li>
                <li>Training modules in isolation before joint training might lead to better specialization but worse coordination, or vice versa - the optimal training curriculum for modular architectures is unknown and may involve a critical transition point in the isolation-to-joint-training ratio.</li>
                <li>Modular architectures might develop more human-like cognitive biases and limitations (e.g., working memory capacity limits, goal interference effects), potentially including improved few-shot learning but increased susceptibility to certain types of interference that humans also experience.</li>
                <li>The performance gap closure might not be monotonic with module count - there may be an optimal number of modules (possibly 4-6) beyond which coordination overhead dominates any specialization benefits, creating an inverted-U relationship.</li>
                <li>Modular architectures might enable new forms of continual learning where individual modules can be updated without catastrophic forgetting in other modules, fundamentally changing the training paradigm and enabling lifelong learning capabilities not possible in monolithic models.</li>
                <li>The benefits of modularity might interact non-linearly with model scale: modularity might be more beneficial at intermediate scales (1B-10B parameters) but less beneficial at very large scales (>100B parameters) where monolithic models have sufficient capacity to implicitly learn functional specialization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If adding architectural modularity (specialized modules) provides no performance improvement over simply scaling up a monolithic model to the same parameter count (within 5% performance difference), this would challenge the core premise that functional specialization is necessary rather than just additional capacity.</li>
                <li>If ablating inter-module communication mechanisms (e.g., removing cross-module attention or shared representations) has no effect on performance (less than 10% degradation), this would suggest the modules are not actually coordinating and the architecture is not truly modular in function.</li>
                <li>If a modular architecture shows the same performance degradation pattern with task length as monolithic models (correlation coefficient >0.9 between degradation curves), this would challenge the theory that modularity helps with extended interactions.</li>
                <li>If modules do not develop functionally specialized internal representations as measured by probing classifiers or representational similarity analysis (e.g., if all modules show similar representations for all task aspects), this would indicate that architectural modularity alone is insufficient without appropriate training.</li>
                <li>If the performance gap between QA and procedural tasks remains constant across different degrees of modularity (2, 4, 6, 8 modules showing <10% variance in gap size), this would suggest the gap arises from factors other than architectural uniformity.</li>
                <li>If modular architectures show worse performance on simple procedural tasks (1-3 steps) where coordination overhead might dominate (>15% worse than monolithic models), this would reveal important boundary conditions on when modularity helps and potentially invalidate the theory for short tasks.</li>
                <li>If training modules with function-specific objectives produces no better specialization than training with general objectives (as measured by task-specific probing accuracy), this would challenge the claim that specialized training is necessary for modularity benefits.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of training data composition and the ratio of QA examples to interactive procedural examples in creating the performance gap - the dissociation might partially arise from data imbalance rather than purely architectural limitations. </li>
    <li>The potential contribution of tokenization and discrete action spaces to procedural performance limitations - the mismatch between continuous procedural execution and discrete token prediction might contribute to the gap. </li>
    <li>The impact of evaluation methodology and whether QA benchmarks truly measure the same knowledge required for procedural tasks - the apparent dissociation might partially reflect measurement artifacts rather than genuine capability differences. </li>
    <li>The role of reinforcement learning versus supervised learning in training agents - the performance gap might be partially attributable to training paradigm rather than architecture, as most LLMs are trained with supervised learning while procedural tasks may benefit from RL. </li>
    <li>The contribution of grounding and embodiment to procedural performance - the gap might partially reflect lack of sensorimotor grounding rather than architectural limitations in cognitive function separation. </li>
