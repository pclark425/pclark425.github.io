                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Exploration via Problem Decomposition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how adaptive experimental design works for AI agents operating in unknown environments.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that AI agents can achieve superior experimental efficiency in unknown environments by leveraging problem decomposition to structure their exploration strategy. The core principle is that agents should identify or construct hierarchical decompositions of the problem space, then use this structure to guide a 'coarse-to-fine with adaptive backtracking' exploration policy. Specifically, the theory posits that: (1) experiments at higher abstraction levels provide constraints that prune the search space at lower levels, (2) the optimal allocation of experimental budget across decomposition levels follows a logarithmic relationship with respect to the size of each level's search space, weighted by the information propagation factor between levels, (3) agents should dynamically adjust their exploration strategy based on cross-level consistency checks, backtracking to higher levels when lower-level findings violate higher-level assumptions, and (4) the decomposition structure itself can be refined through meta-experiments that test the validity of the decomposition. The theory predicts that this structured approach achieves experimental efficiency that scales as O(sum_i k_i * log(n_i) * p_i) where k_i is the cost per experiment at level i, n_i is the search space size at level i, and p_i is the information propagation efficiency between levels. This represents a significant improvement over flat exploration strategies that scale linearly or worse with problem size.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal initial experimental budget allocation across decomposition levels is proportional to log(n_i) * I_i, where n_i is the search space size at level i and I_i is the information propagation factor measuring how much a single experiment at level i constrains lower levels.</li>
                <li>Information gain from a high-level experiment should be weighted by the expected reduction in low-level experimental budget it enables through constraint propagation, not just by its direct information content.</li>
                <li>Backtracking to higher abstraction levels should occur when the cross-level consistency metric falls below a threshold, specifically when lower-level uncertainty exceeds higher-level uncertainty by more than a factor proportional to the decomposition depth.</li>
                <li>The expected total experimental cost under optimal structured exploration scales as O(sum_i k_i * log(n_i) * p_i) where k_i is the cost per experiment at level i, n_i is the search space size at level i, and p_i is the information propagation efficiency, compared to O(k * n) for flat exploration.</li>
                <li>Experiments at adjacent levels should be interleaved with a frequency proportional to the rate of information flow between levels, enabling rapid feedback and adaptation rather than strict sequential ordering.</li>
                <li>The decomposition structure itself should be treated as a hypothesis subject to experimental validation, with agents allocating a small fraction of experimental budget to meta-experiments that test decomposition validity.</li>
                <li>When multiple decomposition structures are possible, agents should maintain a portfolio of decompositions weighted by their posterior probability given experimental evidence, and allocate experiments to maximize expected information gain across the portfolio.</li>
                <li>The benefit of structured exploration increases with problem complexity, showing the greatest advantage when the problem has natural hierarchical structure with strong information propagation between levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Hierarchical reinforcement learning demonstrates that decomposing problems into subgoals and skills enables more efficient learning in complex environments. </li>
    <li>Multi-resolution planning in robotics shows that coarse-to-fine strategies reduce planning time while maintaining solution quality by pruning infeasible regions early. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical Bayesian optimization demonstrates that allocating experimental budget across fidelity levels based on information gain improves optimization efficiency. </li>
    <li>Adaptive experimental design in statistics shows that sequential designs that update based on previous results and use information-theoretic criteria outperform fixed designs. </li>
    <li>Abstraction in AI planning demonstrates that hierarchical task networks and abstract planning reduce computational complexity by reasoning at multiple levels of granularity. </li>
    <li>Active learning research shows that strategic selection of which data points to label based on uncertainty or information gain significantly reduces sample complexity. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a hierarchical navigation task with multiple rooms and corridors, an agent that spends 25-35% of initial experiments discovering high-level topology (room connectivity) before detailed path planning will reach goals 2-3x faster than an agent that immediately begins low-level path optimization.</li>
                <li>When the high-level decomposition is partially incorrect (e.g., assuming independence between subproblems that are actually coupled), agents that monitor cross-level consistency and backtrack will recover within 1.5x the optimal experimental budget, while agents that commit to the initial decomposition will require 3-5x the optimal budget.</li>
                <li>In multi-stage optimization problems with hierarchical structure, allocating experimental budget proportional to log(complexity) at each stage will outperform uniform allocation by 40-60% in terms of solution quality per experiment.</li>
                <li>Agents that explicitly test their problem decomposition through meta-experiments will adapt more quickly to environment changes that violate the decomposition structure, recovering optimal performance within 20-30% additional experimental budget.</li>
                <li>In environments with modular structure, structured exploration will show 3-10x improvement in sample efficiency compared to flat exploration, with greater improvements for deeper hierarchies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the logarithmic allocation rule remains optimal in environments with highly non-uniform information density across levels, or whether adaptive allocation based on observed information propagation would provide significant additional benefits, is unclear but would have major implications for practical algorithm design.</li>
                <li>The optimal backtracking threshold may depend on environment properties (such as noise level, decomposition depth, and coupling strength between levels) in complex, non-linear ways that are difficult to predict a priori, and discovering these relationships could enable significant performance improvements.</li>
                <li>Whether this structured exploration approach can be effectively learned through meta-learning across multiple environments with different decomposition structures, potentially enabling zero-shot transfer to new environments, is unknown but would be transformative for practical applications.</li>
                <li>How to optimally balance exploration between refining the current decomposition and searching for alternative decompositions is unclear, and the answer may depend critically on the true structure of the environment in ways that are difficult to characterize.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist classes of problems where structured exploration via decomposition provides no benefit or even harms performance compared to flat exploration, and how to identify such problems a priori, remains an open question with important practical implications.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that uniform budget allocation across all decomposition levels performs as well as or better than the logarithmic allocation rule in environments with clear hierarchical structure would fundamentally challenge the theory's quantitative predictions.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that backtracking based on cross-level consistency checks provides no benefit or actively harms performance in environments where the decomposition is partially incorrect would undermine a key adaptive mechanism of the theory.</li>
                <li>Showing that the predicted O(sum_i k_i * log(n_i) * p_i) scaling law does not hold in practice across a range of hierarchical problems would call the core efficiency claims into question.</li>
                <li>Finding that agents using flat exploration strategies match or exceed the performance of structured exploration in problems with known hierarchical structure would contradict the fundamental premise of the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the overhead of maintaining and updating decomposition structures exceeds the benefits from improved exploration efficiency would challenge the practical applicability of the theory.</li>
                <li>Showing that information propagation between levels is negligible (p_i ≈ 0) in most real-world hierarchical problems would eliminate the primary mechanism by which the theory achieves efficiency gains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to handle resource constraints that limit the total number of experiments across all levels simultaneously, particularly when different levels have competing demands for experimental budget. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully address how to schedule experiments when different levels have vastly different time costs (e.g., high-level experiments take hours while low-level experiments take seconds), which could dominate the optimization objective in practice. </li>
    <li>How to automatically discover or construct appropriate problem decompositions in completely novel environments where no prior knowledge of structure exists is not fully specified by the theory. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for situations where the optimal decomposition changes over time as the agent learns more about the environment, requiring dynamic restructuring of the exploration strategy. </li>
    <li>How to handle stochastic environments where experimental outcomes are noisy, potentially requiring multiple experiments at each level to achieve reliable information propagation, is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The interaction between structured exploration and other exploration strategies (such as curiosity-driven exploration or novelty search) is not characterized by the theory. </li>
