                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Embodied Simulation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented as dynamic, context-sensitive simulations grounded in sensorimotor and affective systems. Concepts are not static entities but are enacted as partial reactivations of perceptual, motor, and emotional states, flexibly assembled according to current goals and context. The representational format is thus a temporally unfolding pattern of multimodal activations, with conceptual structure emerging from the coordination of these simulations.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual processing does not involve sensorimotor or affective activations, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the pattern of simulation, the theory's account of flexibility is called into question.</li>
