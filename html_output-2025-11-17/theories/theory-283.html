                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes a method for detecting and correcting spurious correlations that arise specifically from collider bias in virtual lab inquiry. When learners condition on (observe or control for) a collider variable—one that is causally influenced by multiple manipulated variables—spurious correlations emerge among those causes. The theory introduces a propensity score framework where each variable's 'collider propensity' is computed based on: (1) the number of causal parents it has, (2) the frequency with which it is conditioned upon during inquiry, and (3) the strength of causal relationships from potential causes. Variables with high collider propensity are flagged, and correlations involving their parents are downweighted by a factor inversely proportional to the collider propensity score. Specifically, when a variable V has n causal parents and is conditioned upon with frequency f, its collider propensity P(V) = f × C(n,2) × mean(|β_i|), where β_i are the standardized path coefficients from parents to V. Correlations between any two parents of V are then adjusted by dividing the observed correlation by (1 + P(V)), effectively reducing the weight given to spurious signals. This approach is particularly valuable in open-ended virtual labs where learners freely choose which variables to observe and manipulate, making traditional causal discovery methods that assume no selection bias inadequate.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The collider propensity score P(V) for a variable V is computed as P(V) = f × C(n,2) × mean(|β_i|), where f is the conditioning frequency, n is the number of causal parents, and β_i are standardized path coefficients from parents to V.</li>
                <li>Observed correlations r(X,Y) between two variables X and Y that are both parents of a collider V should be adjusted to r_adjusted(X,Y) = r(X,Y) / (1 + P(V)) to account for spurious correlation induced by conditioning on V.</li>
                <li>Variables with high collider propensity (P(V) > threshold τ, typically τ = 0.5) should be flagged as potential sources of spurious correlations during inquiry.</li>
                <li>The adjustment factor (1 + P(V)) increases with: (a) more frequent conditioning on V, (b) more causal parents of V, and (c) stronger causal effects from parents to V, reflecting the increased risk of spurious correlation.</li>
                <li>In virtual labs where learners can freely choose which variables to observe, collider propensity scores must be computed dynamically based on actual inquiry behavior rather than assumed uniformly.</li>
                <li>When multiple colliders exist in a causal network, the total adjustment for a correlation between X and Y is the product of individual adjustments: r_adjusted(X,Y) = r(X,Y) / ∏_i(1 + P(V_i)) for all colliders V_i that have both X and Y as parents.</li>
                <li>Propensity-based adjustment is most effective when combined with causal structure learning algorithms that can identify potential collider relationships from observational and interventional data.</li>
                <li>The method requires estimating path coefficients β_i, which can be done through: (a) regression of V on its parents, (b) structural equation modeling, or (c) interventional experiments where parents are manipulated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Collider bias (also called Berkson's paradox or selection bias) occurs when conditioning on a common effect of two variables creates a spurious negative correlation between those variables, even when they are causally independent. </li>
    <li>Propensity score methods have been successfully used in causal inference to adjust for confounding by creating balanced groups based on the probability of treatment assignment. </li>
    <li>In virtual labs and exploratory learning environments, learners often condition on variables non-randomly, creating selection bias that traditional causal discovery algorithms do not account for. </li>
    <li>The strength of collider bias increases with the strength of the causal relationships from the causes to the collider, and with the degree of conditioning on the collider. </li>
    <li>Multiple causal parents converging on a single variable create a combinatorial explosion of spurious correlations, with C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2 pairwise spurious associations induced when conditioning on a variable with n parents. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a virtual ecology lab where population size depends on birth rate, death rate, and immigration rate, learners who frequently observe population size will show spurious correlations among the three rate variables. Applying propensity-based adjustment with P(population_size) computed from conditioning frequency and path strengths should reduce these spurious correlations by 40-60%.</li>
                <li>Virtual labs that provide real-time collider propensity warnings (flagging when P(V) > 0.5) will lead to 30-50% fewer spurious causal inferences compared to labs without such warnings.</li>
                <li>In a chemistry simulation where reaction yield is affected by temperature, pressure, and catalyst amount, the correlation between temperature and pressure observed by learners who always measure yield should be reduced to near-zero after propensity-based adjustment, matching the true causal independence.</li>
                <li>Learners who receive training on collider bias and are shown propensity scores during inquiry will develop more accurate causal models, with 25-40% improvement in causal structure accuracy compared to unaided learners.</li>
                <li>The propensity-based adjustment method will show greater improvement over unadjusted correlations in domains with stronger causal effects (larger |β_i| values), with effect sizes correlating r > 0.6 with mean path strength.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether propensity-based adjustment can effectively handle cases where the causal structure itself is unknown and must be learned simultaneously with the adjustment parameters is unclear. This would require iterative algorithms that alternate between structure learning and propensity estimation.</li>
                <li>The optimal threshold τ for flagging high-propensity colliders may vary across domains, learner populations, and inquiry contexts. Whether a universal threshold exists or domain-specific calibration is necessary is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether learners can develop intuitive understanding of propensity scores and use them metacognitively to guide their inquiry strategies, or whether propensity information is too abstract to influence inquiry behavior, is uncertain.</li>
                <li>The extent to which propensity-based adjustment can handle dynamic causal structures that change over time (e.g., in developmental or evolutionary simulations) is unknown, as the method assumes stable causal relationships.</li>
                <li>Whether propensity-based adjustment interacts synergistically or antagonistically with other bias-correction methods (e.g., confounder adjustment, instrumental variable methods) in complex causal networks is unclear and could have major implications for integrated causal discovery systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If correlations between known causally independent variables (verified through ground truth in simulated environments) are not reduced after propensity-based adjustment, the adjustment formula would be inadequate.</li>
                <li>If the adjustment factor (1 + P(V)) does not correlate with the magnitude of spurious correlation in controlled experiments where collider bias is artificially induced, the propensity score formula would need revision.</li>
                <li>If learners show equal rates of spurious inference in conditions with and without propensity-based adjustment (when adjustment information is provided), the method would not be practically useful despite theoretical validity.</li>
                <li>If propensity-based adjustment reduces genuine correlations between variables that are actually causally related (false negatives), the method would be over-correcting and causing harm.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of calculating propensity scores in real-time makes the method impractical for complex virtual labs (e.g., >100 variables), the approach would have limited applicability despite theoretical merit.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to estimate path coefficients β_i when only observational data is available and interventional experiments are not feasible or have not yet been conducted. </li>
    <li>The method for handling cases where the causal structure is partially unknown (some parents of V are unidentified) is not fully developed, though this is common in real inquiry scenarios. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle measurement error in V, which could affect both the estimation of path coefficients and the strength of induced spurious correlations. </li>
    <li>Computational complexity and scalability to very large causal networks (hundreds or thousands of variables) are not thoroughly analyzed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle temporal dynamics where conditioning frequency f changes over the course of inquiry, requiring dynamic updating of propensity scores. </li>
