                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Organization Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by organizing memory into hierarchical levels, each with distinct temporal and semantic granularity. Lower levels store recent, fine-grained information, while higher levels store abstracted, long-term knowledge. The agent dynamically navigates this hierarchy to retrieve and update information at the appropriate level, enabling efficient handling of both immediate and long-range dependencies.</p>
