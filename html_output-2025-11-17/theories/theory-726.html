            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained on a wider range of arithmetic examples, its generalization range for arithmetic queries will increase.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought prompting is used, the model will show improved accuracy on arithmetic queries outside its memorized facts.</li>
                <li>If a model is probed for internal representations, specific neurons or attention heads will be found that correspond to digit positions or arithmetic operations.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on synthetic arithmetic tasks with novel operations (e.g., base-7 arithmetic), it may develop new emergent representations for those operations.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with explicit algorithmic supervision, its internal representations may become more interpretable and modular.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model fails to generalize to any arithmetic queries outside its training data, this would challenge the emergent algorithmic reasoning theory.</li>
                <li>If no internal representations corresponding to arithmetic operations can be found, this would call the theory into question.</li>
                <li>If models trained on arithmetic data do not outperform models trained without such data on arithmetic tasks, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs make systematic errors on arithmetic that are inconsistent with algorithmic reasoning (e.g., digit transpositions, copying errors). </li>
