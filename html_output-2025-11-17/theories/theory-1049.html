                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Driven Abstraction: Generalization of Spatial Reasoning via Language Model Training</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs develop abstract, domain-general representations of constraints and spatial relations through exposure to diverse language and structured data. These representations enable the LLM to generalize spatial reasoning strategies across different puzzle types (e.g., Sudoku, logic grids, crosswords) by mapping surface features to underlying constraint structures. The LLM's ability to flexibly apply learned constraint satisfaction heuristics is a result of its training on varied linguistic and structured representations of rules, rather than explicit programming of symbolic solvers.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The cross-domain generalization of constraint heuristics in LLMs for spatial puzzles is a novel extension of transfer learning.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Heuristic learning and transfer are known in both symbolic AI and neural networks.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law claims that LLMs can generalize constraint satisfaction heuristics across structurally similar but superficially different spatial puzzles.</p>

                <li>LLMs will be able to explain their reasoning for novel puzzles using language referencing abstract constraints.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Will LLMs generalize constraint satisfaction heuristics to spatial puzzles with fundamentally novel rule structures (e.g., non-grid-based, non-discrete domains)?</li>
                <li>Can LLMs develop entirely new heuristics for constraint satisfaction when exposed to puzzles with rules not present in training data?</li>
                <li>Will LLMs trained on only linguistic data (no explicit puzzles) develop similar abstraction abilities for spatial reasoning?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize to novel spatial puzzles despite extensive training on diverse constraint-based tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot map surface features to abstract constraint representations, as evidenced by poor transfer to new puzzle types, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of abstraction and generalization in LLMs for highly novel or adversarial spatial puzzles are not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends generalization and abstraction concepts to the specific context of LLMs solving spatial puzzles via constraint-driven abstraction.</p>
