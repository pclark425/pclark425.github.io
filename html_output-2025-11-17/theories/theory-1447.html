                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextualized Conceptual Map Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is functionally represented as high-dimensional, context-sensitive maps, where each concept is a region in a continuous conceptual space. The position and boundaries of each concept are dynamically modulated by context, task demands, and prior knowledge. Relations between concepts are encoded as transformations or trajectories within this space, allowing for flexible generalization, analogy, and context-dependent meaning shifts.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neural representational geometry (e.g., as measured by RSA) will shift systematically with changes in task context or prior knowledge.</li>

                <li>Analogical reasoning will correspond to geometric transformations (e.g., translation, rotation) in conceptual space.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially manipulating context (e.g., via priming or TMS) will induce predictable shifts in neural conceptual maps, which can be decoded to predict behavioral changes.</li>
                <li>Training artificial agents with context-sensitive conceptual spaces will yield human-like flexibility in analogy and generalization.</li>
                <li>Novel concepts introduced in a new context will occupy new, context-dependent regions in conceptual space, which can be predicted from prior context-concept mappings.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neural or behavioral measures show fixed, context-invariant conceptual boundaries, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If relations between concepts cannot be modeled as transformations or trajectories in conceptual space, the theory's core claim would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If context manipulations do not produce systematic changes in similarity judgments or neural geometry, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The mechanism by which context is integrated into the conceptual map is not fully specified. </li>
    <li>How abstract, symbolic, or mathematical concepts are represented in this framework is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
