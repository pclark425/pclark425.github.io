                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Distributed Symbolic-Subsymbolic Hybrid Representation for Arithmetic in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs encode arithmetic knowledge through a hybrid of distributed (subsymbolic) and symbolic representations. Arithmetic operations are not stored as explicit rules, but as patterns in high-dimensional vector spaces, which can be dynamically composed and manipulated via attention and contextual cues. Chain-of-thought and program synthesis act as mechanisms for activating and sequencing these latent representations, enabling flexible and generalizable arithmetic reasoning.</p>
