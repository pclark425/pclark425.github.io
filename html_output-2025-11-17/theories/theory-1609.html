                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1609</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Modular Augmentation for Enhanced LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the integration of modular, domain-specific augmentation tools (e.g., symbolic solvers, knowledge bases, external APIs) with LLMs can systematically compensate for representational and reasoning limitations, thereby enhancing simulation accuracy in scientific subdomains. The effectiveness of augmentation depends on the modularity, interface compatibility, and the granularity of tool-task decomposition.</p>

                <li>If interface incompatibility does not reduce augmentation benefits, the theory's necessity claim is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where augmentation introduces new errors due to tool misuse or misinterpretation by the LLM. </li>
