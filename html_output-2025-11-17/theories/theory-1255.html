                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that optimally balances semantic completeness with representational efficiency, following an information bottleneck principle. The representation should retain all information necessary for downstream graph reasoning and generation, while minimizing redundancy and irrelevant detail, thus maximizing the mutual information between the graph and its textual encoding under the constraints of language model capacity.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Language models have finite context windows and memory, so representations exceeding these limits result in information loss and degraded performance. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law formalizes a quantitative relationship between representation size and model capacity in the context of graph-to-text for LMs.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Capacity constraints are well-known in neural network and information theory.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit matching of graph representation information content to language model capacity for optimal learning is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Graph-to-text representations that are compressed to fit within the language model's context window, while retaining all task-relevant semantics, will outperform longer, redundant representations.</li>
                <li>Language models will fail to learn full graph semantics if the representation exceeds their effective capacity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There exists a minimal sufficient representation for any graph class that enables optimal language model learning, and this can be algorithmically discovered.</li>
                <li>Adaptive representations that dynamically adjust compression based on model feedback will outperform static representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If language models perform equally well with highly redundant or excessively verbose representations, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models can learn full graph semantics from representations that exceed their context window, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to algorithmically determine the minimal sufficient representation for arbitrary graph types. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory adapts known information-theoretic principles to a new domain, providing a formal framework for representation design.</p>
