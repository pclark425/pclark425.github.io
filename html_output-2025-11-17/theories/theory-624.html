                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally represented as unified, hierarchical, probabilistic generative models in which multiple representational formats (prototypes, exemplars, theory-like structures, symbolic rules, and perceptual templates) are integrated within a single, context-sensitive architecture. The apparent diversity of conceptual formats arises from selective activation, precision-weighting, and processing depth within this hierarchy, rather than from separate, modular stores. This architecture supports both fast, similarity-based categorization and slow, theory-driven inference, and allows for dynamic abstraction, compositionality, and context-dependent recruitment of representational subtypes.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In tasks requiring rapid categorization, neural and behavioral signatures will reflect shallow (prototype-like) activation in higher levels of the hierarchy, while tasks requiring detailed discrimination or memory for specific instances will show deeper (exemplar-like) activation.</li>
                <li>When background knowledge or causal reasoning is required, lateral and upward activation within the hierarchy will be observed, corresponding to theory-like processing.</li>
                <li>Manipulating task context (e.g., by changing instructions or feedback) will shift the dominant representational format (prototype, exemplar, theory) used by the system, as measured by both behavior and neural activation patterns.</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will reveal overlapping but distinct patterns of activation for prototype, exemplar, and theory-based processing within the same conceptual task, modulated by task demands.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks with hierarchical, context-sensitive architectures will outperform single-format models on tasks requiring flexible switching between categorization, generalization, and theory-based inference.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel, highly abstract concept is introduced in a context that lacks direct perceptual grounding, the system will attempt to recruit linguistic or symbolic substructures at higher levels of the hierarchy, and may fail to form a stable representation if no suitable substructure exists.</li>
                <li>In cases of brain injury or targeted disruption to specific levels of the hierarchy (e.g., MTL vs. posterior cortex), the system will compensate by shifting processing to remaining levels, potentially revealing latent hybrid representations or novel error patterns.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks designed to mimic this architecture will outperform both pure prototype/exemplar and pure symbolic models on tasks requiring flexible switching between categorization, generalization, and theory-based inference.</li>
                <li>Developmental studies will show that children initially rely more on shallow, perceptual or prototype-like representations, with deeper, theory-like and compositional processing emerging as hierarchical integration matures.</li>
                <li>In cross-cultural or multilingual contexts, the hierarchy will flexibly recruit language-specific or culture-specific substructures for abstract concepts, leading to systematic differences in conceptual processing across populations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If behavioral and neural data show that prototype, exemplar, and theory-like effects can be fully dissociated and never co-occur or influence each other within the same task or context, this would challenge the unified hierarchy claim.</li>
                <li>If direct neural evidence demonstrates that representational formats are strictly modular and never integrated or coactivated, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If compositionality in concept combination is always achieved by simple intersection of prototypes, and never by hierarchical meshing or simulation, this would contradict the compositionality law.</li>
                <li>If context manipulations fail to shift the dominant representational format or processing depth, the theory's context-sensitivity claim would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If artificial neural networks with hierarchical, context-sensitive architectures do not outperform single-format models on flexible conceptual tasks, the theory's computational predictions would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Direct single-neuron evidence for the strict functional separation of error and representation units in predictive coding is lacking. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5445.html#e5445.0" class="evidence-link">[e5445.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The exact neural implementation of hierarchical generative models and their scalability to complex cognition remain open questions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5445.html#e5445.0" class="evidence-link">[e5445.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5445.html#e5445.4" class="evidence-link">[e5445.4]</a> </li>
