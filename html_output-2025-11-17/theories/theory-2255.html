                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires the explicit alignment of multiple evaluative dimensions (such as accuracy, novelty, coherence, explanatory power, and ethical risk) with the intended scientific purpose, domain, and stakeholder values. The alignment process is both multidimensional and adaptive, ensuring that the evaluation reflects the complex, context-dependent nature of scientific theory assessment.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory formalizes the adaptivity of evaluation, which is only implicit in current practice.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Rubric adaptation is observed, but the law of adaptive alignment for LLM-generated theory evaluation is not formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law that evaluative alignment must be dynamically recalibrated for LLM-generated scientific theories is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new evaluative dimension (e.g., interpretability) becomes important in a scientific field, evaluation frameworks for LLM-generated theories will adapt to include and weight this dimension.</li>
                <li>If a theory is evaluated in two different domains (e.g., medicine vs. physics), the relative importance of dimensions like ethical risk or mathematical rigor will shift accordingly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If multiple evaluative dimensions are in conflict (e.g., high novelty but low accuracy), the optimal alignment strategy for resolution is not yet known and may depend on emergent stakeholder consensus.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate theories in highly interdisciplinary domains, the process for aligning multidimensional evaluation may reveal new, unforeseen evaluative dimensions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation outcomes remain unchanged despite major context shifts, the theory's claim of adaptive alignment is challenged.</li>
                <li>If evaluators cannot adapt dimension weights in response to context, the theory's context-dependence law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for resolving conflicts when multiple evaluative dimensions are in direct opposition (e.g., high novelty but low coherence). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes observed adaptivity and multidimensionality into a formal explanatory framework for LLM-generated scientific theory evaluation.</p>
