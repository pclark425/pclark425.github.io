                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1839</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Representation Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the likelihood of future scientific discoveries by aligning their internal probabilistic representations—learned from vast, temporally-ordered scientific corpora—with the statistical regularities and innovation patterns present in real-world science. This alignment enables LLMs to generate probability estimates that reflect both explicit and implicit trends in scientific progress.</p>
