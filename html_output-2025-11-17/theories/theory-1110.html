                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Structured Intermediate Representations for Logical Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) achieve strict logical reasoning most effectively when they internally construct and manipulate structured intermediate representations (SIRs) that explicitly encode logical forms, variable bindings, and inference steps, rather than relying solely on distributed, unstructured embeddings. The SIRs act as a latent workspace, enabling systematic, stepwise logical inference and error checking.</p>
