                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Activity-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is primarily determined by their patterns of synaptic activity and plasticity. Neurons with high baseline activity, frequent synaptic remodeling, or strong excitatory drive are more prone to pathological protein accumulation and degeneration due to increased metabolic demand, calcium influx, and local production of amyloidogenic and tau-phosphorylating factors.</p>
