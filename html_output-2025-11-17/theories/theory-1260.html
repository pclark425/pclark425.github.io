                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1260</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Fidelity Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is one that maximizes semantic fidelity: the preservation and explicit encoding of all graph semantics (nodes, edges, attributes, and higher-order structures) in the text, such that the original graph can be reconstructed with minimal information loss. The theory further asserts that representations that optimize for semantic fidelity will yield language models with superior graph reasoning, generalization, and robustness.</p>
