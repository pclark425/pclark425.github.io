                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Predictive-Traceability Theory of LLM-Generated Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the scientific value of LLM-generated theories is determined by two primary axes: predictive power (the ability to generate novel, testable predictions) and traceability (the ability to reconstruct and scrutinize the reasoning and sources underlying the theory). Only theories that are both predictively powerful and traceable are considered scientifically valuable, as this dual requirement ensures both empirical utility and epistemic accountability.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Predictive power is a cornerstone of scientific theory evaluation (Popper, Lakatos). LLMs can generate theories that sound plausible but lack genuine predictive content. </li>
    <li>LLM-generated outputs are often evaluated for plausibility or coherence, but without predictive power, such theories cannot be empirically tested or falsified. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law adapts an existing criterion to a new context (LLM-generated theories), emphasizing the risk of plausible but non-predictive outputs.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Predictive power as a criterion is well-established in philosophy of science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Its explicit application to LLM-generated theories, which may lack genuine predictive content, is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs are often criticized for their lack of transparency and inability to provide clear reasoning chains or source attribution, which is critical for scientific scrutiny. </li>
    <li>Scientific practice values reproducibility and the ability to audit the reasoning and evidence behind claims; LLMs' black-box nature challenges this. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law formalizes a practice (traceability) that is often implicit, making it explicit and central for LLM-generated theories.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Traceability and transparency are valued in scientific practice but are not always formalized as evaluation criteria.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The formal requirement for traceability in LLM-generated theory evaluation is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories that lack traceability will be more likely to contain subtle errors or ungrounded claims.</li>
                <li>Theories with high predictive power but low traceability will be less likely to be accepted by scientific evaluators.</li>
                <li>Mandating both predictive power and traceability will reduce the acceptance of spurious or unverifiable LLM-generated theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some LLM-generated theories may achieve high predictive power and traceability, leading to genuinely novel scientific discoveries.</li>
                <li>Requiring traceability may limit the creativity or serendipity of LLM-generated theories.</li>
                <li>The dual requirement may systematically bias against certain types of interdisciplinary or speculative theories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM-generated theories with low traceability are consistently found to be correct and valuable, the necessity of traceability is undermined.</li>
                <li>If predictive power does not correlate with theory value in LLM-generated outputs, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If scientific communities accept theories lacking either predictive power or traceability, the theory's dual-axis requirement is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of human-in-the-loop evaluation and collaborative theory development is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of LLM architecture (e.g., interpretable vs. black-box) on traceability is not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This theory extends existing criteria and formalizes traceability as a central requirement for LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
