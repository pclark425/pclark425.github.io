                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Uncertainty Calibration via Iterative Self-Assessment</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models dynamically calibrate their uncertainty and confidence in answers through repeated generate-then-reflect cycles, adjusting their output distributions and self-assessed confidence in response to detected inconsistencies or uncertainty, leading to more reliable and better-calibrated responses.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In tasks with high inherent uncertainty, entropy may not decrease, or calibration may not improve with reflection.</li>
