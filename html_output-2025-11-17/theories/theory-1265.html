                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structural Inductive Bias and Modality Adaptation Theory (Alignment and Abstraction Principle)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that abstracts graph structure into forms that are maximally aligned with the language model's native inductive biases (such as sequentiality, compositionality, and hierarchical structure). The theory posits that representations which recast graph information into abstractions that match the model's preferred modalities will facilitate more efficient learning, better generalization, and improved transfer across tasks.</p>
