                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Subdomain Alignment and Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is fundamentally determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the formal structure of the scientific subdomain. High simulation accuracy is achieved when the LLM's learned representations encode the subdomain's key entities, relations, and rules, and when the model's generative process is constrained to respect these structures.</p>
