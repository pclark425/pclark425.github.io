                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual and Semantic Reasoning Law for LLM-Based Anomaly Detection in Lists</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs' ability to model context, semantics, and relationships among elements in lists or tabular data enables them to detect not only simple outliers but also complex, contextual, and semantic anomalies (e.g., unusual co-occurrences, logical impossibilities, or rare combinations). The theory further posits that chain-of-thought prompting, domain knowledge injection, and attention mechanisms enhance the LLM's capacity for interpretable and accurate anomaly detection, especially for semantic or system-level anomalies that are not easily captured by statistical or classical ML methods.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is prompted with chain-of-thought reasoning and explicit domain rules, it will outperform naive prompting on semantic anomaly detection tasks.</li>
                <li>If attention weights are analyzed in an LLM-based anomaly detector, the most anomalous features or tokens will correspond to the true source of the anomaly.</li>
                <li>If a semantic anomaly (e.g., logically impossible combination) is present in a list, an LLM with sufficient context will flag it even if it is not a statistical outlier.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are applied to highly abstract or non-linguistic semantic anomalies (e.g., in scientific or mathematical data), will chain-of-thought prompting still enhance detection?</li>
                <li>If attention mechanisms are used in very large LLMs for anomaly detection, will the interpretability of attention weights persist or become diffuse?</li>
                <li>If LLMs are used to detect causal or temporal anomalies in complex event logs, will semantic reasoning outperform statistical baselines?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to detect semantic or contextual anomalies that are not simple outliers, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought or attention mechanisms do not improve interpretability or accuracy in anomaly detection, the theory would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce uninterpretable or misleading explanations for detected anomalies, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs' inability to detect perception/model inference errors (component-level faults) in autonomous driving, as shown by LLM Monitor (Driving). <a href="../results/extraction-result-5606.html#e5606.0" class="evidence-link">[e5606.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs' tendency to overfit to few-shot examples or prompt patterns, leading to false positives or missed anomalies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5606.html#e5606.0" class="evidence-link">[e5606.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5738.html#e5738.0" class="evidence-link">[e5738.0]</a> </li>
