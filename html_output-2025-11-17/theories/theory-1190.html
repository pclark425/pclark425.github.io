                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness and Modality Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by leveraging robust, compositional internal representations of both chemical structures and application requirements, and by integrating information across multiple modalities (e.g., text, molecular graphs, property tables). The theory asserts that the robustness of these representations and the ability to integrate modalities are central to the LLM's capacity for generalization and innovation in chemical design.</p>
