                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Activity-Driven Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is primarily determined by their synaptic activity, connectivity, and metabolic demand. Neurons with higher firing rates, greater synaptic input/output, or more extensive network integration experience increased metabolic and proteostatic stress, making them more susceptible to toxic protein aggregation.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Highly active neurons in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are among the first to show pathology in Alzheimer's disease. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing network activity in normally resistant visual cortex neurons will render them vulnerable to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
                <li>Long-term optogenetic silencing of highly active visual cortex neurons will prevent or reverse established pathology.</li>
                <li>Enhancing mitochondrial efficiency in high-activity neurons will confer resistance to amyloid-β and tau aggregation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly active or metabolically demanding visual cortex neurons are found to be resistant to pathology, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If reducing activity in vulnerable neurons does not alter pathology progression, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If visual cortex regions with low metabolic demand show early and severe pathology, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some low-activity or low-metabolic-demand neurons may still be vulnerable, suggesting additional factors are involved. </li>
    <li>Certain visual cortex interneurons with low firing rates can accumulate tau pathology, indicating exceptions. </li>
