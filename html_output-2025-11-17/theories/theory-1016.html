                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance Filtering for Efficient Memory Utilization in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by employing contextual relevance filtering: dynamically selecting and prioritizing memory contents based on their estimated relevance to the current game state and goal. This mechanism prevents memory overload, reduces distraction from irrelevant details, and enables focused, context-sensitive reasoning and planning.</p>
