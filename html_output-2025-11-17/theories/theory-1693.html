                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Language Model Statistical Deviation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) can detect anomalies in lists of data by learning the statistical regularities and latent structures of such lists, and flagging items that deviate significantly from these learned patterns. The LM's internal representation encodes both explicit and implicit rules of the data, allowing it to generalize anomaly detection across diverse domains.</p>
