            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Attention mechanisms propagate relevant numerical and contextual information across tokens.</li>
                <li>MLP modules transform and combine information to produce arithmetic results.</li>
                <li>Arithmetic reasoning emerges from the interaction of these components across layers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Causal mediation analysis on GPT-J shows that early layers transmit arithmetic information via attention, while MLP modules generate result-related information. <a href="../results/extraction-result-31.html#e31.0" class="evidence-link">[e31.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Interventions disrupting attention or MLP modules in early layers will degrade arithmetic performance.</li>
                <li>Training focused on arithmetic tasks will strengthen specific pathways in attention and MLP modules.</li>
                <li>Visualizing activations will reveal arithmetic-specific patterns in intermediate layers.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether specialized architectural modifications can enhance arithmetic-specific representations is unknown.</li>
                <li>The extent to which these mechanisms generalize to other reasoning domains remains to be seen.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If causal mediation analysis fails to identify arithmetic-related pathways, the theory would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If disrupting attention or MLP modules does not affect arithmetic accuracy, the theory's mechanistic claims would be undermined.</li>
