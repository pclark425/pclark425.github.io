                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Theory-of-mind capabilities in LLMs emerge primarily through instruction tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which align the model's outputs with human communicative intentions. This tuning enables models to better simulate mental state reasoning by learning to cooperate and anticipate human expectations in dialogue, rather than through raw language modeling alone.</p>

                <li>The extent to which instruction tuning can compensate for lack of grounding in real-world contexts remains uncertain.</li>
                <li>Whether instruction tuning can enable models to overcome biases and hallucinations in ToM reasoning is unknown.</li>
                <li>The potential for instruction tuning to enable models to generalize ToM reasoning to novel, complex social scenarios is unclear.</li>

                <li>If prompting strategies do not enhance ToM reasoning, the importance of cooperative communication scaffolds would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If instruction tuning leads to overcautious or inconclusive responses without improved accuracy, the theory's assumptions would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If instruction tuning cannot improve performance on higher-order ToM tasks, its sufficiency would be doubted.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some instruction-tuned models still fail on simple perturbations of ToM tasks, indicating limits to alignment benefits. <a href="../results/extraction-result-73.html#e73.0" class="evidence-link">[e73.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.1" class="evidence-link">[e83.1]</a> </li>
