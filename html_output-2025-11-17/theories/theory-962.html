                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Abstraction Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents in text games achieve superior performance by constructing and maintaining a hierarchy of memory representations, ranging from low-level event traces to high-level abstract schemas. The agent dynamically abstracts, compresses, and organizes information at multiple levels, enabling efficient retrieval, generalization, and planning across diverse game scenarios.</p>
