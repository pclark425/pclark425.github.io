                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that hybrid memory architectures in LLM agents, which dynamically route information between episodic and semantic stores based on task demands, enable robust long-horizon reasoning in text games. The agent selectively attends to relevant episodic details or abstracted knowledge, optimizing both recall and generalization.</p>
