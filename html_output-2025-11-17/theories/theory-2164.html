                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Consistency Checking Enhances LLM Theory Robustness</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when equipped with mission-focused instructions that explicitly require iterative self-consistency checking (e.g., re-deriving laws from different evidence subsets and comparing results), produce more robust and reliable scientific theories. The process reduces hallucinations, increases reproducibility, and helps surface edge cases or exceptions in the distilled laws.</p>
