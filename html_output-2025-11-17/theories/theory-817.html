                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Organization Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance and continual learning by organizing their memories into hierarchical structures, where lower levels encode specific episodes and higher levels encode abstracted patterns, rules, or schemas. Deliberate control over the flow of information between these levels enables efficient retrieval, generalization, and self-improvement.</p>

<ol>

    <li>The impact of hierarchical memory on adversarial robustness is not addressed. </li>
