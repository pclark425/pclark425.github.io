                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-SR Programmatic Equation Discovery Law: General Iterative Refinement and Hypothesis Testing Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can iteratively refine candidate equations by generating, testing, and updating hypotheses based on feedback from the corpus, analogous to the scientific method. The LLM acts as both hypothesis generator and evaluator, using corpus-derived evidence to accept, reject, or modify equations, thereby converging on laws that best explain the textual data.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to evaluate the plausibility of statements or equations given a body of evidence. </li>
    <li>Scientific hypothesis testing involves comparing predictions to evidence, a process that can be simulated in LLMs via prompt engineering. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law adapts scientific hypothesis testing to LLM-driven equation discovery, which is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hypothesis testing is foundational in science; LLMs can evaluate statements against evidence.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes LLMs as agents performing hypothesis testing on equations using only textual corpora.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop novel strategies for hypothesis refinement not present in traditional symbolic regression.</li>
                <li>LLMs could identify and correct for systematic biases in the corpus during hypothesis testing.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve equation quality with iteration, the theory's core claim is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot reject obviously incorrect equations after multiple cycles, the analogy to scientific hypothesis testing fails.</li>
                <li>If the process diverges or cycles indefinitely without convergence, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how LLMs handle ambiguous or conflicting feedback from the corpus. </li>
    <li>The impact of corpus size and diversity on convergence and refinement quality is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
