                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Skill Acquisition and Task Decomposition Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through iterative self-reflection by acquiring meta-skills—such as error detection, task decomposition, and adaptive strategy selection—across multiple generate-then-reflect cycles. The process enables LLMs to break down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks, identify and localize errors, and adaptively refine their reasoning strategies, resulting in systematic performance improvements that generalize across domains.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs prompted to reflect iteratively develop more robust error-checking and self-correction behaviors. </li>
    <li>Meta-cognitive prompting (e.g., 'explain why your answer might be wrong') leads to improved performance on out-of-distribution tasks. </li>
    <li>Iterative self-refinement (Self-Refine, Madaan et al. 2023) demonstrates that LLMs can learn to identify and correct their own mistakes over multiple passes. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to meta-cognition in humans and iterative refinement in LLMs, the law formalizes meta-skill emergence as a core mechanism in LLM self-reflection.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Meta-cognition and self-reflection are established in human learning theory, and LLMs have been shown to improve with iterative refinement.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of meta-skill acquisition (error detection, adaptive strategy selection) as emergent properties of iterative LLM self-reflection is new.</p>
