                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Graph Memory Representation Efficiency Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about navigation complexity in text worlds that relates graph-topology features (diameter, clustering, dead-ends, door constraints) to exploration efficiency and optimal policy structure, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The efficiency of navigation policies in text worlds and spatial environments depends critically on how the environment's graph structure is represented in the agent's memory. Explicit graph representations (knowledge graphs, topological maps, spatial memory structures) outperform implicit representations (LSTM hidden states, distributed embeddings) when: (1) the environment requires long-term memory beyond the effective horizon of recurrent networks (typically >50-100 timesteps), (2) the graph structure contains exploitable regularities (shortcuts, hub nodes, bottlenecks), (3) planning over multiple steps is beneficial, or (4) the task requires reasoning about non-local connectivity. The theory further posits that graph representation should be structured to match the environment's natural abstraction level (e.g., room-level for buildings, entity-level for text adventures, intersection-level for road networks). Graph representations enable O(1) or O(log n) retrieval and support planning algorithms, while implicit representations require O(n) sequential processing and cannot directly support graph search.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Explicit graph memory representations enable O(1) or O(log n) retrieval of relevant past states, while implicit LSTM representations require O(n) sequential processing through hidden states.</li>
                <li>Graph representations that preserve structural properties (connectivity, distances, bottlenecks) enable planning algorithms (Dijkstra, A*, value iteration) that implicit representations cannot directly support.</li>
                <li>The optimal graph abstraction level matches the environment's natural hierarchical structure: room-level for buildings, entity-level for text adventures, intersection-level for road networks, region-level for large outdoor spaces.</li>
                <li>Graph memory becomes necessary when required memory horizon exceeds the effective capacity of recurrent networks, typically around 50-100 timesteps for LSTMs, though this varies with task complexity.</li>
                <li>Sparse graph representations (storing only key states/observations/landmarks) are more sample-efficient than dense representations when the environment has exploitable structure (hubs, bottlenecks, hierarchical organization).</li>
                <li>Graph attention mechanisms (GAT, GNN) enable better information propagation than simple pooling when graph structure is irregular or when multi-hop reasoning is required.</li>
                <li>Graph representations support explicit planning and backtracking, which are difficult for implicit representations to learn, especially in environments with dead-ends or required detours.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of graph construction and maintenance is amortized over multiple episodes in repeated navigation tasks, making explicit graphs more efficient than re-learning implicit representations.</li>
                <li>Graph sparsification (pruning edges, merging nodes) improves both computational efficiency and generalization when done appropriately, but excessive sparsification can disconnect the graph and harm performance.</li>
                <li>Dynamic graph maintenance (adding nodes, updating edges, pruning based on visit counts) is necessary for lifelong learning and adaptation to changing environments.</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a navigation task requiring memory of 200+ timesteps with exploitable structure (e.g., hierarchical rooms), explicit graph memory will outperform LSTM by >30 percentage points in success rate.</li>
                <li>Graph representations that explicitly encode room-level structure will outperform pixel-level representations by >20% in multi-room navigation tasks with >10 rooms.</li>
                <li>Sparse topological graphs with 100-200 nodes will achieve similar or better performance than dense grids with 10,000+ nodes in indoor navigation, while requiring 100x less memory and 10x faster planning.</li>
                <li>In text-adventure games with >50 rooms and complex object dependencies, knowledge-graph-based agents will converge 2-5x faster than LSTM-based agents.</li>
                <li>Graph representations with learned edge weights (traversability, distance) will outperform unweighted graphs by 10-20% in success rate on navigation tasks with variable terrain or obstacles.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical graph representations (e.g., rooms -> buildings -> neighborhoods) will enable better generalization to larger environments than flat graph representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be a critical graph size (possibly 10,000-100,000 nodes) beyond which explicit graph memory becomes computationally intractable and implicit representations or hierarchical abstractions become necessary.</li>
                <li>The optimal sparsity level for graph representations may vary non-monotonically with environment complexity, with an optimal intermediate sparsity that balances coverage and computational cost.</li>
                <li>Hybrid representations combining explicit graphs for long-term structure and implicit representations for local details may outperform pure approaches, but the optimal division of labor is unknown.</li>
                <li>Graph neural networks with very deep message passing (>10 layers) might be able to approximate the benefits of explicit planning, potentially closing the gap with graph-based planning methods.</li>
                <li>In highly dynamic environments where graph structure changes every few timesteps, the overhead of graph maintenance might outweigh benefits, favoring implicit representations.</li>
                <li>Learned graph abstractions (automatically discovering the right level of granularity) might significantly outperform hand-designed abstractions, but current methods for learning abstractions are limited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where LSTM consistently outperforms explicit graph memory despite long memory requirements (>100 timesteps) and exploitable structure would challenge the core theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that graph abstraction level has no effect on performance across a wide range of environments would contradict the matching principle.</li>
                <li>Showing that dense representations always outperform sparse representations, even in highly structured environments, would invalidate the sparsity efficiency claim.</li>
                <li>Finding that graph attention mechanisms provide no benefit over simple pooling in irregular graphs would challenge the information propagation claim.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the computational cost of graph construction never amortizes, even over hundreds of episodes, would challenge the efficiency argument.</li>
                <li>Showing that graph representations cannot be effectively maintained in dynamic environments, even with simple update rules, would limit the theory's applicability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory doesn't specify how to automatically determine the optimal abstraction level for a given environment without manual design or extensive hyperparameter search. </li>
    <li>The exact computational cost trade-offs between explicit and implicit representations are not fully characterized, including memory overhead, planning time, and update costs. </li>
    <li>How graph memory representations should handle highly dynamic environments with frequently changing topology is unclear, though DGMem provides some evidence for dynamic updates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1219.html#e1219.2" class="evidence-link">[e1219.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory doesn't fully explain when graph sparsification helps vs hurts - what is the optimal sparsity level and how does it depend on environment properties? <a href="../results/extraction-result-1163.html#e1163.0" class="evidence-link">[e1163.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1350.html#e1350.0" class="evidence-link">[e1350.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How to handle perceptual aliasing (different states that look similar) in graph construction is not fully addressed, though some papers show localization challenges. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1198.html#e1198.0" class="evidence-link">[e1198.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1347.html#e1347.0" class="evidence-link">[e1347.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory doesn't specify how to handle uncertainty in graph structure (e.g., uncertain edges, probabilistic connectivity) beyond simple binary representations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1245.html#e1245.2" class="evidence-link">[e1245.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1245.html#e1245.3" class="evidence-link">[e1245.3]</a> </li>
    <li>How graph representations should be initialized in completely novel environments (cold-start problem) is not fully addressed. </li>
