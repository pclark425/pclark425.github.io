                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when equipped with in-context learning and retrieval-augmentation, can synthesize novel chemical structures for specific applications, even for chemical classes not present in their training data. The mechanism relies on the LLM's ability to abstract chemical rules and recombine retrieved molecular fragments or property annotations, enabling zero-shot generalization to new chemical spaces.</p>
