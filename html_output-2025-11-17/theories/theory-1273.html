                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for LM training is one that maximizes the mutual information between the graph and the text, while minimizing redundant or irrelevant information. The representation should act as an information bottleneck, preserving only the features of the graph that are necessary and sufficient for accurate and generalizable text generation, thus improving both model efficiency and generalization.</p>
