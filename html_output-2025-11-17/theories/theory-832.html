                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Deliberative and Programmatic Memory Control Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal task-solving in LLM agents arises from the dynamic interplay between deliberative (explicit, goal-driven) and programmatic (automatic, procedural) memory control. LLM agents can flexibly switch between these two modes of memory access, leveraging deliberative retrieval for novel, complex, or long-horizon tasks, and programmatic memory for routine, well-structured, or short-horizon tasks. The theory further asserts that meta-cognitive mechanisms enable agents to monitor task demands and select the most effective memory control strategy, leading to improved generalization, efficiency, and robustness.</p>
