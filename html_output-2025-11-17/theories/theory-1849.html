                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Bayesian Aggregators of Scientific Priors</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) encode, via their training on vast scientific corpora, the implicit distribution of scientific priors, beliefs, and evidence. When prompted, LLMs aggregate these priors in a Bayesian-like fashion to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries, effectively acting as distributed, data-driven Bayesian reasoners.</p>
