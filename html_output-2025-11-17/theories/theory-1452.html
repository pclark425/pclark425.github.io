                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Schema Assembly Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is functionally represented as dynamic assemblies of schemas—structured templates encoding prototypical features, roles, and relations. Schemas are flexibly composed and decomposed in working memory according to context, allowing for rapid adaptation, generalization, and creative recombination. The representational format is inherently hierarchical, supporting both specific instances and abstract generalizations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially enhancing schema assembly (e.g., via neurostimulation) will improve creative problem-solving.</li>
                <li>Training artificial agents with dynamic, hierarchical schema assembly will yield human-like transfer and abstraction.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual tasks can be performed without any evidence of schema assembly or hierarchy, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If working memory disruption does not impair schema-based generalization, the theory's core claim would be challenged.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how entirely novel concepts are integrated into existing schema hierarchies. </li>
