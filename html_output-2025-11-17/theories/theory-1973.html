                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Meta-Scientific Law Extractors</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when trained on a sufficiently broad and deep corpus of scientific literature, can extract meta-scientific laws—general principles about how scientific laws themselves are formulated, evolve, and are applied across domains. These meta-laws govern the structure, transferability, and limitations of domain-specific laws, and LLMs can make these explicit by synthesizing patterns in the language and logic of scientific discourse.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
