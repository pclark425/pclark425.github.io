                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Spatial Knowledge Representation Hierarchy Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models encode and utilize spatial, procedural, and object-relational knowledge for embodied planning tasks without direct sensory input, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models without direct sensory input represent spatial knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction in a hierarchy: (1) Qualitative/topological level (left/right, near/far, inside/outside, directional relations), (2) Metric/coordinate level (numeric positions, distances, angles, elevations), (3) Geometric/structural level (shapes, layouts, configurations, 3D point clouds, meshes), and (4) Affordance/functional level (reachability, navigability, manipulability, feasibility). Models preferentially encode and reason at the qualitative level due to its prevalence in language training data, but struggle with metric precision without explicit numeric representations. Effective spatial reasoning requires translating between levels: qualitative relations for high-level planning and natural language grounding, metric coordinates for precise execution and geometric computation, geometric understanding for collision checking and feasibility assessment, and affordances for action selection and embodiment grounding. Systems that provide explicit representations at multiple levels (e.g., qualitative spatial calculi + coordinate maps + 3D geometry + learned affordances) consistently outperform those operating at a single level. The hierarchy is not strictly sequential—models can operate at different levels for different subtasks—but translation between levels remains a key bottleneck, with qualitative-to-metric conversion being particularly challenging.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Spatial knowledge in language models is organized hierarchically across qualitative, metric, geometric, and affordance levels, with each level serving distinct computational purposes</li>
                <li>Models preferentially encode qualitative spatial relations due to their prevalence in natural language training data and the difficulty of learning precise metric representations from text alone</li>
                <li>Metric precision requires explicit numeric representations (coordinates, distances, angles) that models struggle to generate reliably from language without structured intermediate representations or tools</li>
                <li>Geometric understanding (shapes, layouts, collision checking, 3D structure) requires structured spatial representations (point clouds, meshes, voxels) beyond what language naturally encodes</li>
                <li>Affordance-level reasoning requires integrating spatial geometry with action capabilities, embodiment constraints, and task goals through learned value functions or feasibility predictors</li>
                <li>Effective spatial planning requires coordinating across levels: qualitative for high-level reasoning and language grounding, metric for execution and precise computation, geometric for feasibility and collision checking, affordance for action selection and embodiment grounding</li>
                <li>Translation between levels is a key bottleneck: models can reason within levels but struggle to convert between them, particularly from qualitative to metric representations</li>
                <li>Different representation levels can be implemented through different mechanisms: symbolic logic for qualitative, numeric computation for metric, neural encoders for geometric, learned functions for affordances</li>
                <li>The hierarchy is not strictly sequential—models can operate at different levels for different subtasks—but dependencies exist (e.g., affordances depend on geometric understanding)</li>
                <li>Explicit multi-level representations consistently outperform implicit single-level representations for embodied spatial reasoning tasks</li>
                <li>Spatial embeddings can be specialized through task-specific training to better encode spatial relationships at the appropriate level of abstraction</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Models perform better with qualitative spatial relations (left/right, near/far, directional relations) than raw coordinates when reasoning about spatial arrangements, and GPT-4o generates better plans when given qualitative spatial prompts (Spa-prompt) rather than raw coordinates (Cord-prompt) <a href="../results/extraction-result-385.html#e385.6" class="evidence-link">[e385.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-344.html#e344.0" class="evidence-link">[e344.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-518.html#e518.2" class="evidence-link">[e518.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-385.html#e385.1" class="evidence-link">[e385.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Explicit coordinate representations enable precise spatial computation: coordinate-based ASP rules, location modules with offset propagation, and coordinate feature maps all improve spatial reasoning accuracy <a href="../results/extraction-result-342.html#e342.0" class="evidence-link">[e342.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-520.html#e520.3" class="evidence-link">[e520.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-357.html#e357.3" class="evidence-link">[e357.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-518.html#e518.2" class="evidence-link">[e518.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-514.html#e514.3" class="evidence-link">[e514.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Geometric representations (bounding boxes, 3D meshes, point clouds, TSDF reconstructions) are necessary for collision checking, feasibility assessment, and manipulation planning <a href="../results/extraction-result-392.html#e392.3" class="evidence-link">[e392.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-425.html#e425.0" class="evidence-link">[e425.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-526.html#e526.0" class="evidence-link">[e526.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-392.html#e392.0" class="evidence-link">[e392.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-355.html#e355.2" class="evidence-link">[e355.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Affordance representations (value functions, feasibility scores, learned Q-functions) bridge spatial geometry and action selection, with systems combining LLM task knowledge and learned affordances outperforming either alone <a href="../results/extraction-result-549.html#e549.1" class="evidence-link">[e549.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-351.html#e351.0" class="evidence-link">[e351.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-531.html#e531.3" class="evidence-link">[e531.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-351.html#e351.3" class="evidence-link">[e351.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Systems that combine multiple spatial representation levels outperform single-level systems: SpatialVLM (qualitative + quantitative metrics), Spartun3D-LLM (qualitative directions + 3D geometry + alignment), VLMaps (semantic embeddings + metric maps) <a href="../results/extraction-result-355.html#e355.0" class="evidence-link">[e355.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-385.html#e385.1" class="evidence-link">[e385.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-519.html#e519.2" class="evidence-link">[e519.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-519.html#e519.0" class="evidence-link">[e519.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Models struggle to translate between representation levels: converting qualitative descriptions to precise coordinates is a major failure mode, and providing textual state descriptions improves performance over vision-only inputs <a href="../results/extraction-result-372.html#e372.6" class="evidence-link">[e372.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-344.html#e344.0" class="evidence-link">[e344.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-385.html#e385.6" class="evidence-link">[e385.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-372.html#e372.3" class="evidence-link">[e372.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-372.html#e372.4" class="evidence-link">[e372.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Spatial reasoning at different levels requires different computational mechanisms: qualitative uses symbolic logic and spatial calculi (CDC, RCC8), metric uses numeric computation and coordinate arithmetic, geometric uses spatial transformations and 3D encoders <a href="../results/extraction-result-518.html#e518.2" class="evidence-link">[e518.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-520.html#e520.3" class="evidence-link">[e520.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-357.html#e357.3" class="evidence-link">[e357.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-531.html#e531.3" class="evidence-link">[e531.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-526.html#e526.0" class="evidence-link">[e526.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Qualitative spatial calculi (CDC for cardinal directions, RCC8 for topological relations) provide effective symbolic interfaces between perception and language grounding, enabling relational descriptions and sampling of continuous regions <a href="../results/extraction-result-357.html#e357.3" class="evidence-link">[e357.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-531.html#e531.3" class="evidence-link">[e531.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Spatial embeddings can be specialized through training: backpropagating spatial prediction loss into embeddings improves correlation with human spatial similarity judgments and enables better generalization <a href="../results/extraction-result-537.html#e537.3" class="evidence-link">[e537.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Coordinate feature maps and positional encodings (APE, relative x/y coordinates) facilitate spatial reasoning by providing explicit per-location spatial position cues to neural networks <a href="../results/extraction-result-514.html#e514.3" class="evidence-link">[e514.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-425.html#e425.2" class="evidence-link">[e425.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Spatial-visual systems that compose primitive spatial literals (distance, axis alignment) into symbolic spatial prepositions enable grounding of language to actionable spatial goals <a href="../results/extraction-result-531.html#e531.3" class="evidence-link">[e531.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-357.html#e357.3" class="evidence-link">[e357.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-view 3D representations with pose-aware features (ReCon++) and explicit 3D point cloud encodings (ShapeLLM) enable better geometric understanding than single-view or 2D representations <a href="../results/extraction-result-425.html#e425.1" class="evidence-link">[e425.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-425.html#e425.0" class="evidence-link">[e425.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-526.html#e526.0" class="evidence-link">[e526.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Language models can generate text-form spatial visualizations (ASCII grids, emoji maps) that serve as explicit intermediate spatial representations for multi-hop reasoning, though with limited accuracy <a href="../results/extraction-result-358.html#e358.0" class="evidence-link">[e358.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-532.html#e532.1" class="evidence-link">[e532.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Probing experiments show that language models encode spatial and temporal coordinates in their activations, with linear probes achieving high accuracy on coordinate prediction, though absolute mapping may be memorized by probes while relative geometry is encoded by models <a href="../results/extraction-result-348.html#e348.0" class="evidence-link">[e348.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-348.html#e348.4" class="evidence-link">[e348.4]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training models with explicit multi-level spatial representations (qualitative + metric + geometric + affordance) will improve their ability to translate between levels compared to single-level training</li>
                <li>Providing models with tools to query spatial information at different levels (e.g., 'get_qualitative_relation', 'get_coordinates', 'check_collision', 'get_affordance') will improve planning performance over models that must generate all representations internally</li>
                <li>Models will show better transfer to novel spatial tasks when trained on datasets that include multiple representation levels with explicit annotations at each level</li>
                <li>Prompting strategies that explicitly request reasoning at appropriate levels (qualitative for planning, metric for execution, geometric for feasibility) will improve performance over generic prompting</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning spatial embeddings on task-specific spatial prediction objectives will improve downstream spatial reasoning compared to using frozen pretrained embeddings</li>
                <li>Systems that combine learned geometric encoders (for 3D understanding) with symbolic qualitative reasoning (for language grounding) will outperform purely learned or purely symbolic approaches</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether models can learn to automatically select the appropriate representation level for different reasoning steps without explicit guidance or tool-use scaffolding</li>
                <li>Whether there exist additional spatial representation levels beyond the four identified (qualitative, metric, geometric, affordance) that would improve embodied reasoning, such as topological or semantic-spatial levels</li>
                <li>Whether the hierarchy is universal across different spatial domains (navigation, manipulation, spatial reasoning) or whether different domains require different hierarchical structures</li>
                <li>Whether different model architectures (transformers, graph networks, hybrid neuro-symbolic) naturally favor different levels of the hierarchy and whether this affects their spatial reasoning capabilities</li>
                <li>Whether training on one level of the hierarchy (e.g., metric coordinates) can induce learning at other levels (e.g., qualitative relations) through implicit regularization or whether each level must be explicitly supervised</li>
                <li>Whether the translation bottleneck between levels can be overcome through architectural innovations (e.g., dedicated translation modules) or whether it is fundamental to the nature of spatial knowledge representation</li>
                <li>Whether models can learn to maintain consistency across levels when representations conflict (e.g., qualitative 'left of' but metric coordinates suggest 'right of') or whether this requires explicit consistency checking</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where single-level representations consistently outperform multi-level representations would challenge the hierarchy's necessity and suggest that level integration has costs that outweigh benefits</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that models can achieve metric precision without explicit coordinate representations (e.g., through purely qualitative reasoning) would question the necessity of the metric level</li>
                <li>Showing that translation between levels does not improve with training or tool provision would challenge the assumption that the translation bottleneck is learnable</li>
                <li>Finding that affordance reasoning does not require geometric understanding (e.g., can be learned from language alone) would question the hierarchical dependencies between levels</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that implicit end-to-end learned representations outperform explicit multi-level representations on a wide range of spatial tasks would challenge the core premise of the hierarchy</li>
                <li>Finding that models trained on only one level (e.g., qualitative) can generalize to tasks requiring other levels (e.g., metric) without additional training would question the distinctness of the levels</li>
                <li>Showing that providing representations at multiple levels degrades performance due to confusion or interference would challenge the assumption that more levels are always better</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
