                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Contextual Calibration in Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when equipped with retrieval modules, can dynamically calibrate their probability estimates for future scientific discoveries by integrating meta-contextual signals—such as citation velocity, funding trends, and social attention—alongside textual evidence. The theory asserts that meta-contextual calibration enables LLMs to adjust for biases and temporal dynamics, resulting in more accurate and context-sensitive probabilistic forecasts.</p>
