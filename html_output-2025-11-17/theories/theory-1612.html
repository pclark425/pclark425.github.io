                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Task-Tool Alignment and Modular Augmentation in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is fundamentally determined by the degree of alignment between the structure of the scientific task and the modular augmentation tools available to the LLM. When the representational, procedural, and inferential requirements of a scientific subdomain are matched by the LLM's toolset and its ability to orchestrate these tools, simulation accuracy is maximized. Misalignment, in contrast, leads to systematic errors, hallucinations, or degraded performance.</p>
