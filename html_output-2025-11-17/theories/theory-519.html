                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-519</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Structured Extraction and Rule Induction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs, when fine-tuned or prompted with structured extraction tasks and combined with downstream machine learning or symbolic reasoning, can transform unstructured scientific literature into structured datasets that enable the induction of empirical, qualitative rules and heuristics governing scientific phenomena (e.g., synthesis outcomes, structure-property relationships, or procedural heuristics). This process is most effective when LLM outputs are validated against human-annotated ground truth and used as input for conventional ML or symbolic regression to surface interpretable rules.</p>
