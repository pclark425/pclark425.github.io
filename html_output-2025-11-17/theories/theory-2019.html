                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can identify, extract, and aggregate latent variables and relationships from large corpora of scholarly papers, enabling the synthesis of new quantitative laws that are not explicitly stated in any single source. The LLM leverages its internal representations to detect patterns, correlations, and mathematical forms across diverse studies, and can propose candidate laws that generalize over the aggregated evidence.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel quantitative laws that have not been previously hypothesized by human researchers.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent variables that are not recognized in current scientific taxonomies.</li>
                <li>The process may reveal emergent relationships that challenge existing scientific paradigms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to synthesize accurate quantitative laws from large, diverse corpora, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce explicit statements from the literature and do not generate new, aggregated laws, the theory's novelty claim is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of LLMs' ability to detect truly novel latent variables are not fully understood. </li>
    <li>Potential for LLMs to propagate or amplify biases present in the input literature is not fully addressed. </li>
