                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The process leverages the complementary strengths of humans (domain expertise, intuition, ethical judgment) and AI (scalability, pattern recognition, consistency), with each round of evaluation refining both the theory and the evaluation criteria themselves. The theory further posits that feedback loops between human and AI evaluators increase the reliability and creativity of the evaluation outcome.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal number of human-AI feedback iterations for maximal evaluation reliability is unknown and may vary by domain.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If human-AI co-evaluation does not outperform human-only or AI-only evaluation in controlled studies, the complementary evaluation law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If iterative feedback does not improve reliability or criteria refinement, the iterative refinement law is called into question.</li>
