                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Extraction of Reviewer Feedback Laws as a Function of Corpus Diversity and Scale</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ability of LLMs to extract robust and generalizable reviewer feedback laws is a function of both the diversity and scale of the input peer review corpus. As the diversity (across domains, journals, and reviewer backgrounds) and scale (number of reviews) increase, the LLM's capacity to distill both universal and nuanced laws improves, up to a saturation point. The theory predicts diminishing returns beyond a certain corpus size and diversity threshold.</p>
