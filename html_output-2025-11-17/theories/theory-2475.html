                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined primarily by their network connectivity profiles—specifically, the degree, type, and pattern of both local and long-range synaptic connections. Neurons with high centrality, extensive long-range projections, or participation in highly active subnetworks are more susceptible to pathological protein accumulation and spread, while neurons with sparse, local, or modular connectivity are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high network centrality in the visual cortex do not show increased vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If neurons with only local, modular connectivity are found to be equally or more vulnerable than long-range projecting neurons, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If interruption of long-range connections does not reduce the spread of pathology, the theory would be weakened.</li>
