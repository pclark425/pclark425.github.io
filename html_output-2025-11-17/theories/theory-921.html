                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Goal-Oriented Memory Prioritization in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents should prioritize memory storage and retrieval based on relevance to current and anticipated goals, rather than recency or frequency. By dynamically assessing which facts, events, or states are most likely to impact goal achievement, agents can optimize memory usage and decision-making, especially in complex or resource-constrained environments.</p>
