                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that, with sufficient scale and training, language models can develop internal, distributed representations that approximate structured logical reasoning circuits. These emergent circuits enable the model to perform strict logical reasoning without explicit symbolic augmentation, provided the reasoning task is within the model's training distribution and complexity limits.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>With sufficient scale and data, LMs may develop general-purpose logical reasoning circuits rivaling symbolic systems.</li>
                <li>Hybrid training (combining chain-of-thought and logic supervision) may push the complexity threshold higher.</li>
                <li>Emergent circuits may enable LMs to discover new logical rules not present in training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If interpretability research fails to find structured reasoning circuits in large LMs, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LMs cannot perform strict logical reasoning even on in-distribution tasks despite scaling, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LMs can perform strict logical reasoning on highly complex, novel tasks without external help, the theory's capacity limit claim is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some logical tasks may require explicit memory or recursion not easily implemented in transformer architectures. </li>
    <li>Certain forms of logical reasoning (e.g., higher-order logic) may not emerge even with extreme scale. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
