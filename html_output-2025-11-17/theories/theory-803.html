                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-803</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Abstraction and Compression Theory for LLM Agent Memory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal task performance by hierarchically abstracting and compressing experiences into increasingly general representations, enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and transfer of knowledge. The memory system dynamically balances specificity and generality, compressing redundant or low-utility information while preserving salient patterns and exceptions, thus supporting both rapid learning and robust generalization.</p>
