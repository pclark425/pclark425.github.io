                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Stepwise Supervision and Scratchpad Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Providing or eliciting intermediate computational steps (scratchpad, chain-of-thought) during training and inference substantially improves language models' arithmetic performance by: (1) decomposing complex problems into simpler sub-problems, (2) providing explicit supervision for intermediate algorithmic steps, (3) enabling error detection and correction at intermediate stages, (4) reducing the effective depth of reasoning required in a single forward pass, and (5) making the model's reasoning process more interpretable and verifiable. The effectiveness of stepwise supervision depends on: the quality and format of intermediate steps (detailed vs. abbreviated), the alignment between step format and algorithmic structure, the model's capacity to learn from step-level supervision, and the problem complexity. However, stepwise approaches also introduce failure modes: error propagation across steps, increased token generation cost, and potential for learning superficial step patterns rather than genuine algorithmic understanding.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Providing intermediate computational steps during training substantially improves arithmetic learning and generalization.</li>
                <li>Stepwise supervision decomposes complex problems into simpler sub-problems that are individually learnable.</li>
                <li>The quality and format of intermediate steps matters: detailed algorithmic steps are more effective than abbreviated reasoning.</li>
                <li>Stepwise approaches enable error detection and correction at intermediate stages, improving final accuracy.</li>
                <li>Chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent ability that requires large model scale (≈100B+ parameters) to be effective.</li>
                <li>Process-level supervision (scoring intermediate steps) is more effective than outcome-level supervision (scoring only final answers).</li>
                <li>Stepwise supervision reduces the effective reasoning depth required in a single forward pass.</li>
                <li>However, stepwise approaches introduce error propagation: mistakes in early steps cascade to later steps.</li>
                <li>The benefit of stepwise supervision increases with problem complexity and reasoning depth.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting dramatically improves PaLM-540B performance: GSM8K 17.9%→56.9%, SVAMP 69.4%→79.0%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-309.html#e309.0" class="evidence-link">[e309.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-3-175B with CoT: GSM8K 46.9% vs 15.6% standard, showing large gains from stepwise reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-321.html#e321.2" class="evidence-link">[e321.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Scratchpad-Detailed achieves 99.8% addition, 97.3% subtraction accuracy with explicit intermediate computations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-266.html#e266.3" class="evidence-link">[e266.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Finetuning GPT-3 to produce full solutions (with steps) achieves ~20.6% vs 5.2% for final-answer-only. <a href="../results/extraction-result-311.html#e311.0" class="evidence-link">[e311.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Bit-subset parity: with intermediate supervision, Transformer learns easily (>95%); without, fails even after 2M steps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-290.html#e290.1" class="evidence-link">[e290.1]</a> </li>
    <li>RoT (Recursion of Thought) with supervised recursive traces enables tiny Transformer (536K) to solve 64-digit arithmetic. <a href="../results/extraction-result-292.html#e292.2" class="evidence-link">[e292.2]</a> </li>
    <li>WizardMath uses step-by-step PPO with PRM (process-supervised reward) to achieve 92.8% GSM8K, 58.6% MATH. <a href="../results/extraction-result-302.html#e302.0" class="evidence-link">[e302.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MathGLM training on step-by-step solution sequences achieves 93%+ accuracy on complex arithmetic. <a href="../results/extraction-result-265.html#e265.0" class="evidence-link">[e265.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Scaffolding learning (specific skill training then applied learning) enables rapid transfer with <1000 examples. <a href="../results/extraction-result-246.html#e246.1" class="evidence-link">[e246.1]</a> </li>
    <li>CoT is an emergent ability at large scale: substantial gains only appear at ≈100B+ parameters. <a href="../results/extraction-result-309.html#e309.0" class="evidence-link">[e309.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Models trained with step-level supervision should show better performance on multi-step problems than models trained only on final answers.</li>
                <li>Providing step-level feedback during training should improve learning efficiency (fewer examples needed) compared to outcome-only feedback.</li>
                <li>Models should show higher accuracy on problems where intermediate steps are provided at inference time than when generating all steps.</li>
                <li>The optimal level of step detail should vary with model capacity: smaller models benefit more from detailed steps.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal level of step granularity that balances detail and efficiency is unclear.</li>
                <li>It's unknown whether models can learn to automatically generate optimal step decompositions without explicit supervision.</li>
                <li>Whether stepwise supervision transfers across different types of reasoning tasks (arithmetic to logic to planning) is uncertain.</li>
                <li>The extent to which stepwise supervision can compensate for limited model capacity is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that step-level supervision provides no benefit over outcome-only supervision would challenge the decomposition claim.</li>
                <li>Discovering that models trained with steps perform worse on problems requiring novel step sequences would challenge the generalization claim.</li>
                <li>Observing that error propagation negates the benefits of stepwise supervision would challenge the net-benefit claim.</li>
                <li>Finding that small models cannot benefit from stepwise supervision would challenge the capacity-independence claim.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The optimal level of step granularity for different operations and model sizes is not specified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-266.html#e266.3" class="evidence-link">[e266.3]</a> </li>
    <li>How models learn to generate appropriate intermediate steps without explicit supervision is not explained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-309.html#e309.0" class="evidence-link">[e309.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The trade-off between step detail and generation efficiency is not quantified. <a href="../results/extraction-result-266.html#e266.3" class="evidence-link">[e266.3]</a> </li>
