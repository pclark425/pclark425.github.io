                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Bottleneck and Compression Theory for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The performance of LLM agents in text games is fundamentally constrained by the memory bottleneck imposed by the context window and the agent's ability to compress, summarize, and retrieve relevant information. Agents that employ memory condensation strategies (e.g., tips, reflections, structured summaries, skill libraries) outperform those that rely on raw trajectory replay or unfiltered memory, especially as task horizon and environment complexity increase. The effectiveness of memory is thus a function of both its capacity and its information density.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Agents that summarize or condense their memory (e.g., via tips, skill summaries, or reflections) will outperform those that use raw trajectory replay on long-horizon or complex text games.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent that learns to dynamically compress and summarize its memory based on task demands will outperform static condensation strategies across diverse environments.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple condensation strategies (e.g., tips + skill libraries + structured summaries) will enable agents to scale to arbitrarily long-horizon tasks without loss of performance.</li>
                <li>If an agent can learn to generate context-dependent, task-specific memory summaries, it may achieve human-level generalization in open-ended text games.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents using raw trajectory replay outperform those using condensed tips or summaries on long-horizon tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing the experience pool size always improves performance, regardless of filtering or condensation, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If agents with no memory condensation (e.g., only raw history) achieve the same efficiency and generalization as those with skill libraries or tips, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some tasks (e.g., those with highly dynamic or adversarial environments) may require both raw history and condensed summaries for optimal performance, which is not fully addressed by the theory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3057.html#e3057.4" class="evidence-link">[e3057.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3264.html#e3264.0" class="evidence-link">[e3264.0]</a> </li>
