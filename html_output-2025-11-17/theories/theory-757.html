                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> With sufficient scale and training diversity, language models can develop internal representations that approximate algorithmic procedures for arithmetic, enabling limited generalization beyond memorized patterns. This theory posits that, while initial arithmetic ability is pattern-based, larger models with more data can exhibit emergent, compositional reasoning that mimics algorithmic computation for certain classes of arithmetic problems.</p>
