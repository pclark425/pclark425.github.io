                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1613</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Representational Fidelity and Procedural Transparency in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is governed by two orthogonal factors: (1) the representational fidelity of the LLM's internal and external (tool-augmented) models to the scientific subdomain, and (2) the procedural transparency with which the LLM can expose, sequence, and justify its simulation steps. High accuracy is achieved when both factors are maximized, enabling not only correct answers but also verifiable, interpretable reasoning chains.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with low representational fidelity or procedural opacity achieve high accuracy, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If increasing transparency does not improve verifiability or error correction, the procedural transparency law is challenged.</li>
