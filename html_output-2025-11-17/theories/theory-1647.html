                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck and Cognitive Load Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the accuracy of LLMs as simulators in scientific subdomains is fundamentally constrained by the information bottleneck imposed by model architecture (e.g., context window, parameter count) and the cognitive load required to represent and manipulate subdomain-specific knowledge. When the complexity of the subdomain's knowledge structures exceeds the LLM's effective capacity, simulation accuracy degrades, regardless of training data alignment.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is given access to unlimited external memory, will it overcome the information bottleneck and achieve human-level simulation accuracy in all scientific subdomains?</li>
                <li>If cognitive load is artificially reduced (e.g., by chunking or scaffolding), can small LLMs match the performance of much larger models on complex tasks?</li>
                <li>Are there emergent strategies by which LLMs can internally compress or abstract subdomain knowledge to overcome bottlenecks?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with limited context windows and parameter counts achieve high simulation accuracy on highly complex subdomains, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing model size or context window does not improve simulation accuracy on high-complexity tasks, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can accurately simulate tasks with cognitive load far exceeding their working memory, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs use external tools or retrieval-augmented methods to bypass internal bottlenecks. </li>
    <li>Instances where LLMs generalize to complex tasks via emergent reasoning strategies not directly tied to model size or context window. </li>
