                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement via LLM-Driven Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill initial qualitative laws from scholarly corpora, but can also iteratively refine these laws by simulating hypothesis testing: generating candidate laws, seeking counterexamples or supporting evidence within the corpus, and updating the law statements accordingly. This process mimics aspects of the scientific method and enables LLMs to converge on more robust, generalizable qualitative laws.</p>

                <li>If an LLM is prompted to generate and then critique or refine a law statement using a corpus, the resulting law will be more robust and general than the initial statement.</li>
                <li>Iterative prompting will reduce the number of exceptions or counterexamples to the distilled law.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to identify and correct overgeneralizations in initial law statements when provided with sufficient counterexamples from the corpus.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to autonomously converge on novel, previously unknown qualitative laws through iterative refinement.</li>
                <li>The process may break down in highly complex or contradictory domains, leading to overfitting or spurious laws.</li>
                <li>The number of iterations required for convergence to a robust law may vary unpredictably with domain complexity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative refinement does not improve the generality or robustness of law statements, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot identify counterexamples or supporting evidence in the corpus, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs reinforce initial biases or errors during iterative refinement, rather than correcting them, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM hallucination or misattribution on the reliability of refined laws is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The effect of corpus quality and representativeness on the accuracy of distilled laws is not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work has formalized this process as a general theory for law distillation, though related work exists in hypothesis generation and self-consistency prompting.</p>
