                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1134</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Thresholds and Modularization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) exhibit emergent capabilities for strict logical reasoning only when their internal representational capacity and architectural modularity surpass certain critical thresholds. At these thresholds, specialized reasoning modules spontaneously emerge, enabling the decomposition and recombination of logical subproblems. The theory further asserts that both the scale of the model and the structure of its training data interact to determine when and how these reasoning modules arise, and that modularization is a necessary (but not always sufficient) condition for robust logical inference.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating strict logical reasoning in a non-modular, sub-threshold LM would falsify the necessity of modularization and threshold claims.</li>
                <li>Finding a model that acquires strict logical reasoning gradually, rather than abruptly at a threshold, would challenge the phase transition hypothesis.</li>
