                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Abstraction and Generalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large corpora of peer review texts, can abstract and generalize qualitative laws that capture the underlying principles of reviewer feedback. By leveraging their ability to recognize patterns, analogies, and latent structures, LLMs can distill high-level, domain-agnostic laws that transcend individual papers or disciplines, enabling the codification of universal peer review principles.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover latent, previously unrecognized universal laws of peer review.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify subtle differences in feedback laws between disciplines that are not apparent to human reviewers.</li>
