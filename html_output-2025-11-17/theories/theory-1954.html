                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when iteratively exposed to large, diverse scholarly corpora and equipped with retrieval and abstraction mechanisms, can autonomously generate higher-level qualitative laws that abstract over disparate findings, leading to emergent scientific generalizations not explicitly present in any single source.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may generate entirely new scientific generalizations that are later validated by empirical research.</li>
                <li>Emergent abstraction may reveal hidden patterns or relationships not previously recognized by human experts.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not generate more abstract or novel laws with increased cycles or evidence diversity, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If emergent laws are always present in the input sources and never novel, the abstraction law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to synthesize across disparate findings, the emergent abstraction law would be called into question.</li>
