                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Symbolic-Analog Hybrid Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally represented using a hybrid format: discrete, compositional symbolic structures (akin to predicate-argument or graph-based representations) are embedded within continuous, analog representational spaces. The symbolic layer enables rule-based reasoning, compositionality, and abstraction, while the analog layer supports graded similarity, generalization, and context sensitivity. The two layers interact bidirectionally, allowing for flexible switching between symbolic and analog processing depending on task demands.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If all conceptual tasks can be explained by a single representational format (purely symbolic or purely analog), the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If no neural evidence for interaction or switching between symbolic and analog regions is found, the theory would be challenged.</li>

    <li>The precise mechanism for translating between symbolic and analog representations is not fully specified. </li>
    <li>How the brain determines which layer to prioritize in ambiguous or novel situations is not fully addressed. </li>
