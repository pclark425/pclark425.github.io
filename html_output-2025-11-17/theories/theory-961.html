                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Architecture Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by employing a hybrid memory architecture that dynamically integrates both episodic (event-based) and semantic (abstracted, structured) memory systems. The agent allocates, retrieves, and updates information in these systems based on task demands, context, and resource constraints, enabling both detailed recall and generalization for effective decision-making.</p>
