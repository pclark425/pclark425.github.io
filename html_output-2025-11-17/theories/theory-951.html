                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by maintaining a hierarchical memory system that integrates episodic (event-specific) and semantic (generalized knowledge) memory, allowing flexible retrieval and abstraction depending on task demands, and enabling transfer, generalization, and efficient planning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If agents with only episodic or only semantic memory perform as well as those with both, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If dynamic integration does not improve transfer or generalization, the theory is challenged.</li>
