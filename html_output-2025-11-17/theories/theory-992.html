                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with structured and interpretable memory representations—such as explicit, queryable records of world state, actions, and outcomes—can more efficiently plan, explore, and recover from errors in text-based game environments. By organizing memory in a way that supports causal reasoning, temporal sequencing, and abstraction, agents can generalize across tasks, anticipate consequences, and adapt to novel situations.</p>
