                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective and Abstractive Memory Consolidation Theory for Long-Term Coherence in LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve long-term coherence and task performance by integrating two complementary memory processes: (1) reflective memory consolidation, in which the agent periodically evaluates and selects memories based on predicted future utility, and (2) abstractive memory consolidation, in which the agent synthesizes higher-level, generalized representations from episodic experiences. The interplay between these processes enables efficient storage, retrieval, and generalization, supporting robust performance across diverse and temporally extended tasks.</p>
