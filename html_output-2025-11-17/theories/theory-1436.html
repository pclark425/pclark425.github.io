                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1436</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Feedback Loop Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to reflect on their own outputs, instantiate a meta-cognitive feedback loop. In this loop, the model not only generates answers but also simulates an internal critic, evaluating and revising its own reasoning. The effectiveness of this loop depends on the model's ability to simulate diverse perspectives and to integrate self-generated feedback, leading to emergent improvements in answer quality and reasoning depth.</p>
