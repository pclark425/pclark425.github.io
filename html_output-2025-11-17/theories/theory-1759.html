                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Semantic Consistency Theory for LLM-Based Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs detect anomalies in lists by modeling the contextual semantic consistency of list elements. Anomalies are identified as items that disrupt the learned or inferred semantic, syntactic, or logical patterns present in the majority of the list. The LLM's internal representations allow it to generalize anomaly detection across diverse domains, even in the absence of explicit training data.</p>
