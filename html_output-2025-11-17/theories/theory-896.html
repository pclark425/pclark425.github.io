                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Consolidation and Recall-Frequency Law for Personalized Dialogue Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance and personalization by consolidating memories of dialogue episodes based on their frequency of recall and relevance to user goals. The consolidation process is governed by a law that prioritizes episodes that are frequently recalled or referenced in successful task completions, leading to a dynamic, self-organizing memory structure that adapts to user needs over time.</p>
