                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Cognitive Scaffolding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format of a prompt serves as a form of external cognitive scaffolding for LLMs, shaping the internal reasoning trajectory by providing explicit or implicit cues for task decomposition, prioritization, and solution strategy. The prompt format interacts with the LLM's learned priors to either facilitate or hinder effective problem solving, depending on the alignment between the scaffolding provided and the optimal cognitive decomposition for the task.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform better on multi-step reasoning tasks when prompts are structured to break down the problem into explicit steps (e.g., 'Let's think step by step'). </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting improves LLM accuracy by providing intermediate reasoning steps. </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can be misled by prompts that encourage incorrect or suboptimal reasoning steps, resulting in systematic errors. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is structured to match the optimal decomposition of a task, LLM performance will improve relative to unstructured prompts.</li>
                <li>If a prompt imposes a non-optimal structure, LLMs will make systematic errors aligned with that structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel scaffolding format is introduced that is not present in training data, LLMs may develop new, emergent reasoning patterns or errors.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained to recognize and override non-optimal scaffolding, performance on adversarial prompts may improve.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show improved performance with optimally structured prompts, the scaffolding alignment law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are unaffected by non-optimal scaffolding, the scaffolding interference law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may possess internal meta-reasoning capabilities that allow them to override prompt-induced scaffolding, especially in advanced architectures. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
