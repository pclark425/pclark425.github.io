                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models, when sufficiently large and trained on diverse data, develop internal representations that approximate algorithmic processes for arithmetic, enabling them to perform arithmetic operations beyond rote memorization or surface-level pattern matching. This emergent capability is not explicitly programmed but arises from the model's exposure to structured data and the pressure to predict correct continuations.</p>
