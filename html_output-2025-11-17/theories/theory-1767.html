                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1767</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Unified Language Model Representation Theory for Anomaly Detection in Lists and Sequences</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs detect anomalies in lists and sequences by constructing high-dimensional internal representations (embeddings) of elements and their contexts. Anomalies are identified as elements whose representations are poorly integrated with the contextual manifold formed by typical elements, as measured by distance metrics or representational coherence. This approach generalizes to both linguistic and non-linguistic data, provided the data is mapped into the LLM's representational space.</p>
