                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) develop apparent theory-of-mind (ToM) capabilities as an emergent property of large-scale pattern recognition and statistical learning from diverse and extensive training data. These models do not possess genuine mental state understanding but can simulate ToM-like reasoning by leveraging learned correlations and linguistic patterns that reflect human social cognition.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs do not possess genuine theory-of-mind but simulate it through statistical pattern recognition of language data.</li>
                <li>Larger model size and richer, more diverse training data improve the model's ability to mimic ToM reasoning.</li>
                <li>Explicit prompting techniques can enhance the model's ability to chain reasoning steps, improving ToM task performance.</li>
                <li>LLMs struggle with higher-order ToM tasks and generalization beyond training distributions.</li>
                <li>Failures on task perturbations indicate that LLMs rely on learned heuristics rather than true mental state inference.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs such as GPT-4, ChatGPT, and BLOOM perform well on first-order ToM tasks but struggle with second-order and higher-order ToM tasks, indicating limitations in deeper mental state reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.0" class="evidence-link">[e83.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.2" class="evidence-link">[e83.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.1" class="evidence-link">[e83.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-74.html#e74.0" class="evidence-link">[e74.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Performance on ToM tasks improves with model size and diversity of training data, suggesting that exposure to more varied linguistic contexts enhances pattern recognition relevant to ToM. <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.0" class="evidence-link">[e83.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.2" class="evidence-link">[e83.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-75.html#e75.0" class="evidence-link">[e75.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-75.html#e75.1" class="evidence-link">[e75.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-74.html#e74.0" class="evidence-link">[e74.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-86.html#e86.0" class="evidence-link">[e86.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Prompting strategies such as chain-of-thought and step-by-step reasoning improve ToM task performance, indicating that explicit reasoning scaffolds help models better utilize learned patterns. <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.0" class="evidence-link">[e88.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.1" class="evidence-link">[e88.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.2" class="evidence-link">[e88.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Models often fail on slight perturbations or variations of ToM tasks, suggesting reliance on surface-level cues rather than robust mental state representations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-73.html#e73.0" class="evidence-link">[e73.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.0" class="evidence-link">[e79.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs show evidence of mental state representation in text-based tasks but lack grounding in real-world or multimodal contexts, limiting genuine understanding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.0" class="evidence-link">[e87.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-80.html#e80.0" class="evidence-link">[e80.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on even larger and more diverse datasets will show incremental improvements in first-order ToM tasks but will continue to struggle with higher-order ToM without architectural changes.</li>
                <li>Applying chain-of-thought prompting to new ToM tasks will consistently improve performance compared to zero-shot prompting.</li>
                <li>LLMs fine-tuned with explicit belief state tracking modules will outperform vanilla LLMs on complex ToM tasks.</li>
                <li>LLMs will fail ToM tasks that require grounding in non-linguistic modalities unless multimodal training is incorporated.</li>
                <li>Smaller LLMs will continue to perform near chance on ToM tasks, confirming the importance of scale.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Integrating symbolic reasoning modules with LLMs may enable genuine recursive mental state reasoning, bridging the gap between pattern recognition and true ToM.</li>
                <li>Multimodal LLMs with visual and contextual grounding may develop more robust ToM capabilities that generalize better to real-world social reasoning.</li>
                <li>Future LLM architectures that incorporate explicit mental state representations could achieve human-level ToM performance.</li>
                <li>LLMs trained with interactive, social, and embodied learning paradigms may develop more authentic theory-of-mind abilities.</li>
                <li>It is unknown whether LLMs can ever develop genuine ToM without fundamentally different learning objectives beyond language modeling.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If larger LLMs fail to improve on first-order ToM tasks despite increased data and parameters, the theory that scale and data drive ToM-like behavior would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought prompting does not improve performance on new ToM tasks, the role of explicit reasoning scaffolds would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on multimodal data still fail to show improved ToM capabilities, the importance of grounding would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If symbolic belief tracking modules do not enhance ToM task performance, the utility of hybrid symbolic-neural approaches would be doubtful.</li>
                <li>If LLMs demonstrate robust higher-order ToM reasoning without architectural changes, the theory that current models lack genuine ToM would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs achieve near or above human-level performance on certain first-order ToM tasks, raising questions about whether pattern recognition alone suffices to explain these results. <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.2" class="evidence-link">[e88.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.0" class="evidence-link">[e88.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs sometimes produce inconsistent or inconclusive responses, indicating variability not fully explained by pattern recognition. <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.1" class="evidence-link">[e88.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.2" class="evidence-link">[e88.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-80.html#e80.0" class="evidence-link">[e80.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain benchmarks (e.g., FANToM, N-ToM) show very low LLM performance, suggesting that some aspects of ToM are not captured by current training or prompting methods. <a href="../results/extraction-result-84.html#e84.0" class="evidence-link">[e84.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.0" class="evidence-link">[e79.0]</a> </li>
