                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Relational Symbolic-Analog Hybrid Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented in a hybrid format that combines structured symbolic relations (akin to predicate-argument structures) with distributed analog features. Concepts are encoded as structured graphs, where nodes correspond to entities or properties, edges to relations, and each node/edge is associated with a distributed analog vector capturing graded, context-sensitive features. This format enables flexible compositionality, abstraction, and context-dependent generalization, while supporting both symbolic reasoning and similarity-based inference.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuropsychological and cognitive evidence shows both symbolic (rule-based) and analog (feature-based) processing in concept use. </li>
    <li>fMRI and MEG studies reveal both distributed patterns (supporting analog features) and region-specific activations (supporting structured relations). </li>
    <li>Behavioral evidence from category learning and analogy tasks shows both compositionality and graded similarity effects. </li>
    <li>Lesion studies show dissociations between rule-based and similarity-based concept use, suggesting separable but interacting systems. </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., LISA, tensor product representations) demonstrate the feasibility of hybrid symbolic-analog encoding. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing hybrid models, this law specifies a more explicit, graph-based hybrid with analog vectors at all levels, and is not fully captured by prior models.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hybrid models (e.g., Hummel & Holyoak's LISA, Smolensky's tensor product representations) propose symbolic-analog integration, and cognitive science has long debated symbolic vs. distributed representations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law posits a specific graph-structured hybrid at the functional level, with explicit mapping of analog vectors to nodes/edges, and predicts context-sensitive compositionality and flexible abstraction.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While compositionality and context effects are known, their explicit integration in a hybrid graph-analog format is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Compositionality is a core property in symbolic theories; context effects are well-documented in semantic memory research.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes how context modulates analog features within a structured hybrid, predicting dynamic re-weighting of features and relations at the representational level.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially disrupting the analog vector component (e.g., via TMS to distributed regions) will selectively impair graded similarity judgments but not rule-based reasoning.</li>
                <li>Training on highly abstract, relational concepts will induce measurable changes in the graph-structure of neural representations, observable via advanced network analysis.</li>
                <li>In individuals with semantic dementia, the breakdown of analog vectors will precede the loss of structured relations, or vice versa, depending on disease subtype.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concept use in the brain is found to be purely symbolic (with no evidence of distributed analog features), this theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the activation of conceptual features or relations, the compositionality/context law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If neural representations of concepts do not show any graph-like structure or network co-activation, the hybrid format is unsupported.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise neural implementation of the analog vectors and their mapping to graph nodes/edges is not specified at the functional level. </li>
    <li>How temporal dynamics (e.g., sequence learning) are integrated into this representational format is not fully addressed. </li>
