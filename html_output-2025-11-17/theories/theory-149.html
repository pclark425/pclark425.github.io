                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Architectural Scaling Laws for World Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The optimal world model architecture depends on multiple interacting factors: temporal structure, scale, computational constraints, and task requirements. RNN-based models (RSSM, LSTM, GRU) excel at short-to-medium context real-time control with limited memory, achieving strong performance across diverse domains with fixed hyperparameters. Transformer-based models excel at long-range dependencies and offline learning, with quadratic scaling in sequence length but superior parallelization during training. Structured state-space models (S4, S4WM) offer a middle ground with linear scaling and competitive performance at lower parameter counts. Diffusion models achieve highest visual fidelity for multi-modal generation but require substantial compute. Hybrid architectures (e.g., Transformer-XL with recurrence, hierarchical models) can achieve better efficiency-performance trade-offs by combining local and global processing. The choice should be guided by: (1) required effective context length and memory horizon, (2) real-time vs offline constraints, (3) multi-modality and stochasticity requirements, (4) available computational budget and hardware, (5) training data scale, and (6) need for discrete vs continuous representations. Discrete tokenization enables architectural scaling by reducing sequence length, while architectural modifications like recurrence and relative positional encodings extend effective context without quadratic cost growth.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>RNN-based world models are optimal for real-time control applications requiring low latency (<100ms per decision) and effective context lengths under ~200 steps, with memory efficiency advantages</li>
                <li>Transformer-based world models are optimal for offline learning scenarios with effective context requirements >200 steps, where training parallelization benefits outweigh quadratic inference costs</li>
                <li>Structured state-space models (S4-family) offer competitive performance to transformers at 2-4x lower parameter counts, representing an underexplored middle ground for medium-length sequences</li>
                <li>Diffusion-based world models are optimal when high-fidelity multi-modal generation is required and computational budget allows (typically offline scenario generation rather than real-time control)</li>
                <li>Hybrid architectures combining recurrence with attention (e.g., Transformer-XL) achieve 50-80% longer effective context than pure RNNs while maintaining sub-quadratic scaling through caching</li>
                <li>Discrete tokenization enables transformer scaling to higher-resolution inputs by reducing sequence length proportionally to compression factor (e.g., 16x compression → 16x shorter sequences)</li>
                <li>The computational cost of transformers scales quadratically with sequence length for vanilla attention, but architectural modifications (recurrence, relative encodings, sparse attention) can reduce this to near-linear</li>
                <li>RNN-based models can achieve strong generalization across diverse domains with fixed hyperparameters (demonstrated across 150+ tasks), challenging the assumption that transformers are always superior for generalization</li>
                <li>Training data scale interacts with architecture choice: transformers benefit more from large-scale pretraining while RNNs can be effective with smaller datasets</li>
                <li>The optimal architecture depends on whether the task requires modeling precise long-range dependencies (favoring transformers) vs maintaining stable hidden state over time (favoring RNNs)</li>
                <li>Architectural choice interacts with latent representation: discrete latents enable more efficient transformer processing while continuous latents may be more natural for RNN dynamics</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For real-time robotics control with <20 step planning horizons and <50ms latency requirements, RNN-based world models will achieve 2-5x lower latency than transformers with comparable task performance</li>
                <li>In offline RL with trajectory lengths >200 steps, transformer-based world models will achieve 20-40% better sample efficiency than RNN models on tasks requiring long-range credit assignment</li>
                <li>Hybrid architectures combining local RNN processing with global transformer attention will outperform pure approaches by 10-30% on medium-length sequences (100-300 steps) while maintaining <2x compute overhead</li>
                <li>Structured state-space models will achieve within 5% of transformer performance on long-context tasks while using 50-70% fewer parameters and 30-50% less memory</li>
                <li>Discrete tokenization with compression factors of 8-16x will enable transformer world models to scale to 4-8x higher resolution inputs while maintaining similar sequence modeling performance</li>
                <li>For domains with effective context requirements between 50-200 steps, Transformer-XL with recurrence will outperform both pure RNNs and vanilla transformers by 15-25% in sample efficiency</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether state-space models (S4, Mamba) can fully replace transformers for long-context world modeling (>500 steps) while maintaining both efficiency and performance parity</li>
                <li>If there exists a universal adaptive architecture that dynamically adjusts its computational pattern (RNN-like vs attention-like) based on sequence length and task requirements, achieving optimal efficiency across all regimes</li>
                <li>Whether diffusion models can be made efficient enough (<10ms per frame generation) for real-time control applications through architectural innovations or distillation</li>
                <li>If architectural choices interact with domain properties (e.g., visual complexity, stochasticity, action space dimensionality) in predictable ways that enable automatic architecture selection via meta-learning</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid architectures can achieve the best of all worlds: RNN-like efficiency for short contexts, transformer-like long-range modeling, and diffusion-like multi-modal generation, without prohibitive computational costs</li>
                <li>If the 'effective context length' metric generalizes across domains or if different domains require fundamentally different notions of context that favor different architectures</li>
                <li>Whether emerging architectures (e.g., Mamba, RWKV) that claim linear scaling with sequence length can match transformer performance on world modeling tasks while delivering on efficiency promises at scale</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that RNNs consistently outperform transformers on long-context tasks (>500 steps) with proper training would challenge the scaling law and suggest architectural biases in current transformer training</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that transformers are more efficient than RNNs for short-context real-time control (<20 steps) would contradict the latency-based architectural recommendation</li>
                <li>Showing that architectural choice has no systematic relationship with task properties (context length, stochasticity, etc.) after controlling for model capacity would invalidate the domain-matching principle</li>
                <li>Finding that a single architecture (e.g., a sufficiently large transformer) can match specialized architectures across all regimes without efficiency penalties would suggest the scaling laws are artifacts of insufficient scale</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that discrete tokenization provides no efficiency benefits for transformers when sequence length is held constant would challenge the compression-based scaling mechanism</li>
                <li>Showing that hybrid architectures consistently underperform pure approaches would suggest that combining architectural patterns introduces detrimental interference rather than complementary benefits</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of training data scale and diversity in determining optimal architecture is not fully characterized - how much data is needed for each architecture to reach its potential? </li>
    <li>How architectural choices interact with other design decisions like latent dimensionality, discrete vs continuous representations, and hierarchical vs flat structure </li>
    <li>The impact of hardware constraints (GPU memory, TPU vs GPU, batch size limitations) on optimal architecture selection in practice </li>
    <li>Whether the architectural scaling laws generalize across modalities (vision, language, audio, multi-modal) or are domain-specific </li>
    <li>The role of training stability and hyperparameter sensitivity in architectural choice - some architectures may be more robust to hyperparameter choices </li>
