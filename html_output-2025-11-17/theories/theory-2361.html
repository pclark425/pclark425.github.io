                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disconnection and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of large-scale brain network disconnection, initiated by focal pathology (amyloid, tau, or vascular insult) that propagates along vulnerable neural networks. The spread of pathology is governed by network topology, and early detection is possible by identifying subtle network dysfunction via advanced neuroimaging and connectomics.</p>
