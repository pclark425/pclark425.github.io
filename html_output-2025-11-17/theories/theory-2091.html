                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Hypothesis Refinement via LLM-Guided Human-in-the-Loop Feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when used in an iterative, human-in-the-loop workflow, can accelerate the discovery and refinement of quantitative laws from scholarly literature. The LLM generates candidate laws by synthesizing evidence from the literature, and human experts provide targeted feedback, corrections, or additional constraints. This feedback is incorporated by the LLM to iteratively refine its hypotheses, leading to more accurate, robust, and generalizable quantitative laws.</p>
