                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Relevance-Gated Memory Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically gating access to memory based on the evolving relevance of stored information to the current context and task goals. The agent's memory system continuously evaluates both short-term and long-term memory stores, selectively retrieving, updating, or suppressing information according to a learned or adaptive relevance function. This process is modulated by the agent's internal state, task demands, and environmental feedback, enabling efficient use of memory resources and minimizing interference or overload.</p>
