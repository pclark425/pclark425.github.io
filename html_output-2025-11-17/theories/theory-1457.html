                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the representational format of conceptual knowledge is dynamically contextualized by predictive signals at multiple hierarchical levels. The brain flexibly reconfigures the weighting and integration of distributed, symbolic, and sensorimotor codes based on current context, task demands, and prior experience, allowing for adaptive conceptual processing.</p>
