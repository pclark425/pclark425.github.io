                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Driven Training Objectives Enable Neural Networks to Internalize Global Spatial Rules</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when neural networks, particularly language models, are trained with objectives that require the satisfaction of global spatial constraints (such as those found in Sudoku or similar spatial puzzles), the models internalize abstract representations of these global rules. This internalization is not merely a result of memorization or local pattern recognition, but emerges from the necessity to satisfy constraints that span the entire input space. The theory further asserts that such training objectives drive the development of distributed representations and attention patterns that encode and enforce global spatial consistency, enabling the model to generalize to novel puzzle instances.</p>
