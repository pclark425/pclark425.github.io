                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1814</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Knowledge Activation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs' ability to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries is governed by the activation of latent knowledge structures during inference. The theory asserts that LLMs can synthesize implicit patterns from their training data to generate probabilistic forecasts, but the accuracy of these forecasts depends on the degree to which relevant latent knowledge is activated by the prompt and context.</p>
