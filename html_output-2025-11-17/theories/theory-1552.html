                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Feasibility Principle (Quantum Field Resonance Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that FTL travel can be achieved by exploiting resonant interactions between engineered quantum fields and the vacuum, creating localized regions of spacetime contraction and expansion (warp bubbles) using only positive-energy-density states. The approach leverages quantum coherence, field resonance, and vacuum polarization effects to minimize energy requirements and maintain stability.</p>
