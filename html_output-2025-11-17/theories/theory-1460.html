                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextually Modulated Dynamic Schema Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented as dynamic, context-sensitive schemas. Each concept is encoded as a flexible schema—a structured set of slots and fillers—whose instantiation is modulated in real time by contextual cues, task demands, and recent experience. The representational format is not static: the same concept can be instantiated with different features, relations, or levels of abstraction depending on context, supporting rapid adaptation and context-dependent reasoning.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context effects and schema theories are known, the claim that the representational format is itself dynamic and contextually modulated is a novel, functional-level assertion.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context effects in conceptual processing are well-documented, and schema theories exist in cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that the representational format itself is dynamically instantiated and context-sensitive, not just the activation of static representations.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The novelty lies in attributing flexibility to the representational format, not just to processing or retrieval mechanisms.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Schema flexibility is discussed in cognitive psychology, but often as a process rather than a representational property.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law claims that the representational format itself is inherently flexible and reconfigurable, not just the process of retrieval or use.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neural representations of the same concept will differ systematically depending on context, even when controlling for sensory input.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificial systems with dynamically instantiated schema representations will show superior context-dependent generalization compared to static models.</li>
                <li>Disruption of context-sensitive schema instantiation (e.g., via TMS to prefrontal cortex) will impair flexible conceptual reasoning but not rote recall.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neural or behavioral data show that conceptual representations are invariant across all contexts, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If people cannot flexibly adapt conceptual knowledge to novel contexts, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the underlying mechanism for how context cues are integrated to modulate schema instantiation. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends schema and context theories by making a strong claim about the dynamic, context-modulated nature of the representational format itself.</p>
