                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Selective Vulnerability in Visual Cortex Neuronal Populations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by their unique network connectivity, activity patterns, and integration within local and global cortical circuits. Neurons with high centrality, dense excitatory input, and strong participation in recurrent loops are more prone to pathological protein accumulation due to increased metabolic demand, synaptic activity-dependent Aβ production, and propagation of tau via synaptic connections. Conversely, neurons with sparse connectivity, inhibitory dominance, or peripheral network roles are more resistant.</p>
