                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1896</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format-Driven Information Compression and Bottleneck Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the format of a prompt determines the efficiency and fidelity of information compression within the LLM's context window. Structured and explicit formats reduce information bottlenecks by enabling more lossless encoding and retrieval of relevant details, while ambiguous or verbose formats increase the risk of information loss, misallocation of attention, and context window overflow. The prompt format thus acts as a regulator of the information bottleneck, directly impacting the LLM's ability to maintain, retrieve, and reason over long or complex inputs.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If a novel compression-optimized prompt format is developed, LLMs may be able to process even longer contexts without information loss.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit bottleneck-aware objectives, the effect of prompt format may be amplified or diminished in unpredictable ways.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If structured prompt formats do not reduce information loss or context window overflow, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If verbose or ambiguous formats do not increase information loss, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of prompt format on LLMs with dynamic context window expansion or external memory is not addressed. </li>
