                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1562</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal Integrity and Energy Conservation in Positive-Energy Warp Bubbles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that positive-energy, non-Natário-class warp bubbles can be engineered to preserve global causality and energy conservation, avoiding the paradoxes and instabilities associated with negative-energy solutions. By carefully shaping the spacetime geometry and stress-energy distribution, the theory predicts that FTL travel can be achieved without violating the fundamental laws of physics, provided that the bubble's boundary conditions and energy fluxes are managed within the constraints of general relativity and quantum field theory.</p>
