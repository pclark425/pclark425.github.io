                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2312</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease is initiated by local disruptions in neural network connectivity—due to genetic, metabolic, or environmental insults—which then propagate through the brain via activity-dependent mechanisms. The spread of dysfunction is mediated by both pathological protein transmission (e.g., prion-like spread of tau or amyloid) and loss of network homeostasis, leading to global cognitive decline. Early detection is possible by identifying subtle changes in network connectivity and propagation patterns.</p>
