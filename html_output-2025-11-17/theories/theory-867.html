                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Coordination Theory for LLM Agents: Task-Driven Memory Modulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents modulate the encoding, retrieval, and integration of memory components (contextual, episodic, semantic, and external) in response to explicit and implicit task signals, such as task type, complexity, and feedback. The agent's memory system is adaptively reconfigured to optimize for accuracy, efficiency, and generalization.</p>
