                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Chemical Innovation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on extensive chemical, physical, and application-specific corpora, can serve as general-purpose engines for chemical innovation. By leveraging their ability to model complex relationships between molecular structure, properties, and application context, LLMs can generate novel chemical structures tailored to user-specified requirements, thus accelerating the pace of discovery across domains such as pharmaceuticals, materials science, and catalysis.</p>
