                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid and Hierarchical Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model (LLM) agents achieve optimal task performance by employing a hybrid memory architecture that integrates multiple memory types (e.g., working, episodic, semantic) organized hierarchically. The architecture enables dynamic routing and prioritization of information based on task demands, context, and temporal relevance, allowing agents to balance efficiency, recall, and adaptability.</p>
