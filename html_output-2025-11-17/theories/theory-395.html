                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Aligned Abstraction Principle (Revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> An optimal world model should encode information at the level of abstraction that matches the task's decision-making requirements across spatial, semantic, and temporal dimensions, rather than maximizing raw observational fidelity. Models that reconstruct all observable details waste representational capacity and computational resources, leading to worse task performance than models that selectively encode task-relevant features. However, effective task-alignment typically requires supervision, privileged information, or explicit task signals (though minimal supervision of 1-5% is often sufficient). The optimal abstraction is frequently hybrid and multi-level, combining different abstraction types for different purposes (e.g., latent dynamics for prediction, geometric for spatial reasoning, semantic for object identity, temporal modeling for sequential dependencies, and pixel-level for verification or when fine visual details encode task information). Dynamic adaptation of abstraction at test time can improve robustness to distribution shifts. There exist lower bounds below which excessive abstraction discards task-relevant information. Benefits manifest as improved sample efficiency, robustness to distractors, and task performance, though computational costs and transfer capabilities depend on implementation details and domain characteristics.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>World model fidelity should be measured by task-relevant prediction accuracy (reward, value, policy-relevant features, temporal dependencies) rather than pixel reconstruction error</li>
                <li>Effective task-aligned abstractions typically require supervision, privileged information, or explicit task signals, though minimal supervision (1-5% of data) is often sufficient for strong performance</li>
                <li>Optimal abstractions are frequently hybrid and multi-level, combining spatial, semantic, and temporal dimensions rather than selecting a single abstraction level</li>
                <li>Temporal abstraction is critical for sequential tasks: semantic abstractions without temporal modeling fail on temporally-dependent tasks regardless of spatial/semantic quality</li>
                <li>Dynamic test-time adaptation of representations (via meta-learned self-supervision or online intervention) can improve robustness to distribution shifts beyond static training-time abstraction</li>
                <li>Lower bounds exist on abstraction: excessive compression that removes spatial relationships, color information, or appearance details harms performance when these features encode task-relevant signals</li>
                <li>Pixel-level appearance fidelity is necessary when fine-grained visual features (color, texture, appearance) directly encode task-relevant information, not only for pixel-perfect discrimination tasks</li>
                <li>Simple explicit abstraction mechanisms (e.g., bounding-box masking) can match learned representations with lower computational cost and better interpretability in some domains</li>
                <li>Transfer benefits of task-aligned abstractions are limited and domain-dependent: supervised task-aligned pretraining does not always exceed training from scratch on target domain, especially under large domain shifts</li>
                <li>Computational costs of task-aligned abstractions vary by implementation: some abstractions have higher costs than pixel baselines (e.g., structured multi-plane representations), while others reduce costs by avoiding reconstruction</li>
                <li>Data augmentation and training data selection (e.g., dissimilarity-based sampling) are complementary mechanisms to architectural abstraction for achieving task-relevance and avoiding shortcut learning</li>

However, effective task-alignment typically requires supervision, privileged information, or explicit task signals (though minimal supervision of 1-5% is often sufficient). The optimal abstraction is frequently hybrid and multi-level, combining different abstraction types for different purposes (e.g., latent dynamics for prediction, geometric for spatial reasoning, semantic for object identity, temporal modeling for sequential dependencies, and pixel-level for verification or when fine visual details encode task information). Dynamic adaptation of abstraction at test time can improve robustness to distribution shifts. There exist lower bounds below which excessive abstraction discards task-relevant information.
