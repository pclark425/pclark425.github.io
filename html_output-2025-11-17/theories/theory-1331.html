                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1331</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Externalization and Multi-Scale Decorrelation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM self-reflection operates at multiple representational scales, with externalization and decorrelation occurring at token, span, and global levels. Iterative reflection enables the model to identify and externalize errors or uncertainties at the appropriate scale, leading to hierarchical correction and progressive improvement in answer quality.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends the concept of decorrelation to a hierarchical, multi-scale process, which is novel in LLM self-reflection.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hierarchical review is used in human editing, but not formalized as a mechanism for LLM self-reflection.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law introduces hierarchical decorrelation as a mechanism for progressive error correction in LLMs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Hierarchical correction will reduce both local and global errors more effectively than flat, non-hierarchical approaches.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be diminishing returns or interference between scales if corrections at one level disrupt coherence at another.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical externalization may enable LLMs to self-correct emergent or distributed errors, but the extent is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If multi-scale externalization does not lead to improved answer quality or hierarchical correction, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If decorrelation does not occur at all representational scales, the law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some errors may not be easily classified or externalized at any single scale, limiting the effectiveness of hierarchical correction. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
