                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Self-Reflection and Adaptive Task Decomposition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, through iterative generate-then-reflect cycles, develop a hierarchical process of self-reflection and adaptive task decomposition. At each reflection stage, the LLM not only corrects surface-level errors but also recursively decomposes the problem into sub-tasks, applies meta-cognitive routines at each level, and adapts its strategies based on feedback from previous iterations. This hierarchical, adaptive process enables LLMs to tackle increasingly complex problems and generalize their self-improvement strategies across domains.</p>
