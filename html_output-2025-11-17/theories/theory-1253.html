                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal graph-to-text representation encodes each node with only the minimal context necessary for its correct interpretation in the target text, thereby achieving maximal compactness without loss of information. The law predicts that such node-context compactness leads to more robust and interpretable language model behavior, especially in large and complex graphs.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical results show that including only necessary context for node disambiguation improves model efficiency and interpretability. </li>
    <li>Overly verbose node encodings lead to redundancy and decreased model performance. </li>
    <li>Graph-to-text models that use compact, context-aware node representations achieve higher BLEU and ROUGE scores compared to those with redundant encodings. </li>
    <li>Human evaluation of generated text shows that minimal context encoding improves faithfulness and reduces hallucination. </li>
    <li>Ablation studies indicate that removing unnecessary context from node encodings does not reduce accuracy, and sometimes improves generalization. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law formalizes a design principle as a law, which is not present in prior literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Contextual encoding is used in practice, but minimality as a law is not formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law of minimal node-context encoding for compactness and interpretability is new.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Representations with minimal node-context encoding will yield more robust and interpretable language model outputs.</li>
                <li>Overly verbose node encodings will lead to decreased performance and increased overfitting.</li>
                <li>Compact node-context representations will generalize better to larger, more complex graphs.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Minimal node-context encoding may enable language models to generalize to unseen graph structures with less data.</li>
                <li>Such representations may facilitate explainable AI in graph-to-text applications.</li>
                <li>Minimal context encoding could improve transfer learning between different graph domains.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If verbose node encodings do not degrade performance, the law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If minimal node-context encoding leads to information loss or reduced accuracy, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If models with minimal context encoding hallucinate more or are less interpretable, the law would be contradicted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of highly interconnected or cyclic graphs on minimal context encoding is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The effect of noisy or incomplete graphs on the sufficiency of minimal context is not fully explained. </li>
