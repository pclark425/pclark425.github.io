                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Connectivity-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory (Propagation-Reservoir Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their position and role within the cortical network, specifically as hubs or reservoirs for pathological protein propagation. Neurons with high centrality or hub status facilitate the spread and accumulation of misfolded proteins, making them more susceptible to pathology and degeneration.</p>
