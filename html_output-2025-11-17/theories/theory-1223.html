                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1223</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Zero-Shot Scaffold Hopping via In-Context LLM Prompting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs, when prompted with a set of molecules sharing a functional motif but differing in backbone, can perform 'scaffold hopping'—generating molecules with the desired motif on entirely new, unseen chemical scaffolds. This enables the discovery of novel chemotypes for a given application without explicit training on those scaffolds.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to generalize patterns from in-context examples in language and code, suggesting the capacity to abstract functional motifs and apply them to new contexts. </li>
    <li>Scaffold hopping is a known strategy in medicinal chemistry for discovering new chemotypes with similar biological activity, but LLM-driven zero-shot hopping is novel. </li>
    <li>Recent work shows LLMs can perform zero-shot reasoning and synthesis in domains where the underlying structure is compositional, such as chemistry. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies have shown that LLMs can generate valid SMILES strings and propose molecules with motifs not present in their training data when given appropriate prompts. </li>
    <li>In-context learning in LLMs enables the model to infer the underlying rule or motif from a small set of examples and apply it to new, unseen cases. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While both scaffold hopping and in-context learning are established, their combination for zero-shot molecular generation in chemistry is new and not previously formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Scaffold hopping is a well-established medicinal chemistry strategy; in-context learning and zero-shot generalization are established in LLMs for language and code.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The application of in-context LLM prompting to enable zero-shot scaffold hopping for molecular generation is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will generate molecules with the desired motif on new scaffolds when prompted with diverse in-context examples.</li>
                <li>Generated molecules will retain application-relevant properties if the motif is essential for activity.</li>
                <li>LLMs will propose syntactically valid and chemically plausible molecules even for scaffolds not present in training data.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new scaffolds with improved properties over known chemotypes.</li>
                <li>Scaffold hopping may enable the circumvention of known resistance mechanisms in drug design.</li>
                <li>LLMs may generate molecules with emergent properties not predictable from the training set or prompt.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate molecules with the motif on new scaffolds, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If generated molecules lack the desired application properties, the utility of scaffold hopping is questioned.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce known scaffolds or overfit to prompt examples, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the synthetic feasibility or practical accessibility of the new scaffolds. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain how to control for off-target effects or toxicity in generated molecules. </li>
