                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Instruction Template Dominance and Representational Overfitting Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that instruction-tuned LLMs overfit their internal representations to dominant instruction templates seen during training, leading to a form of representational bias. This overfitting causes the model to preferentially activate response pathways associated with dominant templates, even when alternative templates or semantically equivalent instructions are presented.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new template is introduced that is structurally similar to a dominant template, the LLM will produce responses matching the dominant template's style.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with adversarially designed templates to disrupt representational overfitting, they may develop more flexible internal representations.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are probed with neuro-symbolic methods, template-induced clustering in internal activations will be observable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show clustering of internal representations by template structure, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If response bias does not correlate with template dominance in training, the theory is refuted.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs with extensive data augmentation show reduced template-induced bias. </li>
