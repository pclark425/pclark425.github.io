                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Self-Reflection as a Calibration and Bias Amplification Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that iterative self-reflection in language models serves a dual role: it can calibrate model outputs by correcting errors and aligning answers with external or internal standards, but it can also amplify pre-existing biases or errors if the reflection process is not sufficiently diverse or critical. The process is governed by the interplay between error correction (calibration) and the reinforcement of initial beliefs (bias amplification), with the outcome depending on the diversity and criticality of the reflection prompts and mechanisms.</p>
