                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1741</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relational Modeling for Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models not only capture statistical regularities but also encode complex contextual and relational dependencies between list elements. This theory posits that language models can detect anomalies by modeling the expected relationships and dependencies among items in a list, flagging items that violate these learned relational patterns—even when their individual probabilities are not low. This enables detection of contextually inappropriate or relationally inconsistent anomalies.</p>
