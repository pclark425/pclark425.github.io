                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Relevant Fidelity Sufficiency Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about minimal simulator fidelity requirements for training transferable scientific reasoning in domains such as thermodynamics, circuits, and biology, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Simulator fidelity requirements are task-dependent: only aspects of the simulator that affect task-relevant observables, decision-making, or learning dynamics need high fidelity. Simulators can be low-fidelity in task-irrelevant aspects without harming transfer. The minimal sufficient fidelity is determined by: (1) which physical phenomena directly affect the task objective and reward signal, (2) which state variables the agent/model observes and uses for decisions, (3) the sensitivity of optimal behavior to modeling errors in each aspect, and (4) whether errors accumulate over the task horizon. Task-relevance is not always obvious a priori and can depend on the learning algorithm and training dynamics, not just the final task objective.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fidelity requirements are determined by task objectives: manipulation requires contact/friction/actuator fidelity, navigation requires collision/sensor/timing fidelity, vision-based control requires appearance diversity and dynamics accuracy</li>
                <li>Aspects of the simulator that do not affect observed state variables, reward signals, or learning dynamics can be low-fidelity without harming transfer</li>
                <li>The sensitivity of optimal policies to modeling errors determines which aspects require high fidelity: high-sensitivity aspects (e.g., contact for manipulation, timing for locomotion) need accurate modeling, low-sensitivity aspects can be approximate</li>
                <li>Task-relevance can be identified through: (1) sensitivity analysis of policy performance to parameter variations, (2) ablation studies removing/degrading specific fidelity aspects, (3) domain knowledge about task structure and physics, (4) observing which aspects cause transfer failures</li>
                <li>Over-investing in task-irrelevant fidelity (e.g., photorealistic rendering for dynamics-dominated tasks, detailed fluid visualization for temperature control) wastes computational resources without improving transfer</li>
                <li>For vision-based tasks, appearance diversity through randomization is often more task-relevant than photorealism, as it prevents overfitting to specific visual features</li>
                <li>Temporal accumulation matters: aspects with small per-step errors can become task-relevant in long-horizon tasks if errors accumulate</li>
                <li>Stochastic aspects (noise, disturbances) are task-relevant when they affect the distribution of outcomes the policy must handle, even if not directly in the reward function</li>
                <li>Domain randomization can compensate for low fidelity in some aspects by forcing policies to be robust, but cannot replace accurate modeling of high-sensitivity task-relevant aspects</li>
            </ol>

    <li>For dexterous manipulation, randomizing action delays, observation noise, and physics parameters (mass, friction, damping) was critical, while some dynamics details could be simplified if residual learning compensated <a href="../results/extraction-result-1534.html#e1534.1" class="evidence-link">[e1534.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1534.html#e1534.2" class="evidence-link">[e1534.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1515.html#e1515.0" class="evidence-link">[e1515.0]</a> </li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For thermodynamics control tasks: Accurate modeling of heat transfer coefficients, boundary conditions, and thermal mass is critical for temperature regulation, while detailed fluid flow visualization and turbulence modeling are unnecessary for steady-state temperature control</li>
                <li>For circuit design optimization: Accurate modeling of component nonlinearities, parasitics, and temperature effects is critical for analog circuits, while detailed electromagnetic field simulation is unnecessary for many digital circuit timing tasks</li>
                <li>For biological pathway control: Accurate modeling of key regulatory interactions and feedback loops is critical for concentration predictions, while detailed spatial cell geometry and individual molecule tracking are unnecessary for population-level dynamics</li>
                <li>For robotic assembly: Contact force modeling and gripper compliance are critical, while detailed visual rendering of the workspace is unnecessary if object poses are known</li>
                <li>For autonomous driving in simulation: Accurate modeling of vehicle dynamics, sensor latency, and traffic agent behavior is critical, while photorealistic rendering of distant background scenery is unnecessary for local planning tasks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether task-irrelevant high-fidelity features can harm transfer by providing spurious correlations that the learning algorithm exploits, increasing sample complexity or reducing robustness</li>
                <li>How to automatically identify task-relevant aspects without extensive domain knowledge, ablation studies, or trial-and-error experimentation, especially for complex multi-objective tasks</li>
                <li>Whether there are emergent effects where combinations of multiple low-fidelity aspects create task-relevant errors even when each aspect individually seems irrelevant (e.g., interaction between simplified contact and simplified actuator models)</li>
                <li>The extent to which task-relevance depends on the learning algorithm: whether model-free RL, model-based RL, and imitation learning have different fidelity requirements for the same task</li>
                <li>Whether there are universal task-relevant aspects that matter across all domains (e.g., timing, delays, stochasticity) versus domain-specific aspects</li>
                <li>How task-relevance changes with task complexity: whether more complex tasks require higher fidelity in more aspects, or whether they can tolerate lower fidelity through learned robustness</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding cases where improving task-irrelevant fidelity (e.g., background rendering for a manipulation task) significantly improves transfer would challenge the task-relevance principle</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that all aspects of a simulator equally affect transfer regardless of task structure would contradict the theory's core claim of differential importance</li>
                <li>Showing that sensitivity analysis or ablation studies fail to predict which aspects require high fidelity would challenge the proposed methods for identifying task-relevance</li>
                <li>Finding tasks where low-fidelity in supposedly task-irrelevant aspects causes transfer failure would require refining the definition of task-relevance</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that domain randomization can fully compensate for low fidelity in high-sensitivity aspects would challenge the claim that some aspects require accurate modeling</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to formally define and measure 'task-relevance' for complex multi-objective tasks with multiple reward components and constraints </li>
    <li>The interaction between multiple low-fidelity aspects that individually seem task-irrelevant but jointly create task-relevant errors (e.g., simplified contact + simplified actuator + simplified friction) </li>
    <li>How domain randomization interacts with task-relevance: whether randomizing task-irrelevant aspects helps or hurts, and whether it can compensate for low fidelity in task-relevant aspects <a href="../results/extraction-result-1534.html#e1534.2" class="evidence-link">[e1534.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1328.html#e1328.0" class="evidence-link">[e1328.0]</a> </li>
