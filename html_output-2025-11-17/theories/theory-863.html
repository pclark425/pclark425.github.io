                <li>Recency/relevance-modulated memory use will improve performance on tasks requiring sequential reasoning or adaptation.</li>
                <li>Dynamic arbitration policies will outperform static memory selection in environments with changing task demands.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Learned arbitration policies may enable LLM agents to develop novel memory management strategies not present in training data.</li>
                <li>Dynamic arbitration could allow LLM agents to self-organize memory hierarchies for complex, multi-domain tasks.</li>
                <li>Arbitration mechanisms may generalize to coordination between multiple LLM agents with distributed memories.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reliability-weighted arbitration does not improve robustness to noisy memory, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If recency/relevance modulation does not enhance sequential task performance, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If dynamic arbitration policies do not outperform static ones in non-stationary environments, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how arbitration policies are learned or updated in the absence of explicit supervision. </li>
    <li>The impact of memory source latency or computational cost on arbitration is not modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
