                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, perform a form of internal optimization by iteratively updating their internal representations and output strategies based on self-evaluated feedback, leading to improved answer quality over multiple iterations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introducing explicit optimization objectives during reflection may accelerate convergence or raise the quality plateau.</li>
