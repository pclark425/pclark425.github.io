                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic Stress-Gradient Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by a gradient of metabolic stress tolerance. Neurons with higher baseline metabolic demand, lower antioxidant capacity, or less efficient proteostasis are more susceptible to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, while those with robust metabolic support and stress-response mechanisms are resistant.</p>
