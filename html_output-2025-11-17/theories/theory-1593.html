                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1593</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Metric Engineering via Plasma-Electromagnetic Coupling</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by coupling high-density plasma with dynamically modulated electromagnetic fields, it is possible to locally engineer the spacetime metric in a way that allows a region (containing a spacecraft) to move through space at effective FTL speeds. Unlike previous proposals requiring negative energy, this approach leverages the collective behavior of plasma and the stress-energy tensor of electromagnetic fields to create a 'metric bubble' that propagates through the plasma, carrying the payload with it.</p>
