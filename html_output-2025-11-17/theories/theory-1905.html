                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Hierarchical Cognitive Scaffolding</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format in which a problem is presented to a large language model (LLM) acts as a hierarchical cognitive scaffold, structuring the model's internal reasoning and decomposition processes. The prompt format provides explicit or implicit cues that guide the LLM in chunking, sequencing, and prioritizing sub-tasks, thereby enhancing or impeding its ability to solve complex problems. The effectiveness of the prompt format is determined by its alignment with the LLM's learned representations and its ability to activate relevant latent knowledge and reasoning pathways.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt format is designed to induce a new, previously unseen decomposition strategy, the LLM may develop emergent reasoning capabilities not present in its training data.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well on complex tasks regardless of prompt structure, the theory's claim about hierarchical scaffolding is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs activate relevant knowledge equally well for unfamiliar prompt formats, the latent knowledge activation law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
