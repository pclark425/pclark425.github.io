                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by actively managing their memory contents through selective encoding, updating, and forgetting. Rather than passively storing all encountered information, agents should prioritize memory resources for information that is predicted to be most relevant for future task steps, using signals from task structure, uncertainty, and feedback.</p>
