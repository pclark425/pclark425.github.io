                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Driven Memory Allocation and Compression Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimize their memory usage by allocating storage and compression resources adaptively, based on the predicted utility of information for current and future tasks. The architecture prioritizes salient, high-utility memories for detailed storage, while compressing or discarding low-utility information, enabling efficient scaling and continual learning.</p>
