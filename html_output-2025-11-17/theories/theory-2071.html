                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Iterative Symbolic Law Discovery via Program Synthesis and Simulation Feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can autonomously distill quantitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively generating, testing, and refining symbolic hypotheses (e.g., equations, algorithms) through program synthesis and feedback from simulation or empirical data. The process leverages LLMs' abilities to parse natural language, identify variables and relationships, synthesize executable representations, and incorporate feedback to converge on robust, generalizable laws.</p>
