                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-871</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management and Compression Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by actively managing, compressing, and prioritizing their memory contents. The agent employs mechanisms to assess the utility, relevance, and redundancy of stored information, dynamically compressing or discarding less useful memories and prioritizing high-utility traces for rapid retrieval. Compression is achieved through abstraction, clustering, and information-theoretic techniques, enabling the agent to maintain a compact yet effective memory footprint that adapts to changing task demands and environments.</p>
