                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Abstracted Chemical Objective Engines</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on chemical data and natural language, develop internal representations that allow them to map high-level application objectives (expressed in natural language or structured prompts) to the generation of novel chemical structures. The LLM acts as an abstracted objective engine, translating application constraints into molecular features, and generating candidate molecules that satisfy these constraints, even when such molecules are not present in the training data.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to generate molecules that satisfy novel application constraints not present in the training data, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize to new application domains or objectives, the mapping law would be invalidated.</li>
