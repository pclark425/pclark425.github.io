                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Predictive Pattern Extractors from Scientific Discourse</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, through exposure to the temporal evolution of scientific literature and discourse, learn patterns in how scientific discoveries emerge, including precursor signals, citation dynamics, and shifts in consensus. LLMs can extrapolate these patterns to predict the likelihood of future discoveries, even in the absence of explicit priors.</p>
