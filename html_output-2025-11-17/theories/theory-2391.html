                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Signature Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic molecular and genetic profiles, including expression of proteostasis-related genes, synaptic activity patterns, and susceptibility to oxidative stress. Neurons with high expression of protective chaperones, efficient protein degradation machinery, and low baseline activity are resistant, while those with pro-aggregation profiles or high metabolic demand are vulnerable.</p>
