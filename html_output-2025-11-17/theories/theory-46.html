                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Explicit structured memory representations (particularly knowledge graphs) provide superior performance in text-based games compared to implicit or unstructured memory because they enable: (1) explicit tracking of world state under partial observability, (2) efficient retrieval of relevant facts through graph traversal, (3) action space reduction through entity-aware constraints, and (4) better generalization through lifted representations that abstract over specific instances.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Explicit structured memory (knowledge graphs) enables faster convergence in RL for text games compared to implicit memory (recurrent states) or no persistent memory.</li>
                <li>The performance advantage of structured memory increases with: (a) degree of partial observability, (b) size of action space, (c) complexity of long-term dependencies, and (d) diversity of test environments.</li>
                <li>Graph-based memory provides 20-40% performance improvements over text-only baselines in procedurally generated text games.</li>
                <li>Structured memory enables action space reduction through entity-aware masking, which is critical for tractability in combinatorial action spaces (e.g., reducing O(10^14) to manageable sizes).</li>
                <li>Lifted graph representations enable better generalization across games by abstracting entity-relation patterns rather than memorizing specific instances.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>KG-DQN with explicit knowledge graph converges ~40% faster than LSTM-DQN baseline on TextWorld games <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.0" class="evidence-link">[e230.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GATA with learned belief graphs achieves +24.2% improvement over text-only Tr-DQN baseline <a href="../results/extraction-result-236.html#e236.0" class="evidence-link">[e236.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Worldformer with graph-based memory achieves 39.15% graph-level EM, significantly outperforming baselines <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.0" class="evidence-link">[e235.0]</a> </li>
    <li>AriGraph with hybrid graph memory substantially outperforms full history baseline (Treasure Hunt: 1.0 vs 0.47, Cooking: 1.0 vs 0.18, Cleaning: 0.79 vs 0.05) <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.3" class="evidence-link">[e238.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Graph-based RL agents cited as superior state representations for addressing partial observability and combinatorial action spaces <a href="../results/extraction-result-237.html#e237.3" class="evidence-link">[e237.3]</a> </li>
    <li>KG-A2C matches or outperforms Template-DQN on 23 of 28 Jericho games using knowledge graph memory <a href="../results/extraction-result-233.html#e233.0" class="evidence-link">[e233.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LSTM-DQN (no explicit memory) is noted to be at a disadvantage in partially-observable games compared to approaches with persistent memory <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.2" class="evidence-link">[e230.2]</a> </li>
    <li>DRRN is not conditioned on previous observations and thus disadvantaged in partially-observable games <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.2" class="evidence-link">[e230.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Graph-constrained RL reduces effective action space and improves exploration efficiency <a href="../results/extraction-result-229.html#e229.3" class="evidence-link">[e229.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-235.html#e235.6" class="evidence-link">[e235.6]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a new text game domain with high partial observability (e.g., only 20% of world state visible at any time), agents with explicit graph memory will show >30% performance improvement over recurrent-only agents.</li>
                <li>For text games with action spaces larger than 10^6 possible actions, graph-based action masking will be necessary for any agent to achieve >50% success rate within reasonable training time.</li>
                <li>Agents with structured memory will show better transfer learning: pre-training on one set of text games and fine-tuning on another domain will yield >2x sample efficiency compared to training from scratch, while unstructured memory agents will show <1.5x improvement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In highly dynamic text game environments where the world state changes rapidly even without agent actions (e.g., NPCs moving, time-based events), the advantage of structured memory may diminish if graph update mechanisms cannot keep pace - performance difference might drop from 30% to <10%.</li>
                <li>For text games requiring deep theory-of-mind reasoning about other agents' beliefs (which are not directly observable), current graph-based memory may not provide advantages over sophisticated language model implicit memory, potentially showing <5% difference.</li>
                <li>In text games with highly ambiguous or metaphorical language where entity extraction is unreliable (>40% extraction error rate), structured memory might actually harm performance compared to end-to-end learned representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding text game domains where unstructured full-history memory consistently outperforms graph-based memory would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that graph-based memory provides no advantage in fully observable text games (where partial observability is eliminated) would challenge the partial observability mechanism.</li>
                <li>Showing that in games with very small action spaces (<10 actions), graph-based memory provides no convergence speed advantage would challenge the action-space reduction mechanism.</li>
                <li>Finding that graph-based agents fail to generalize better than recurrent agents when tested on games with novel entity types but similar relational structures would challenge the lifted representation claim.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanisms by which graph attention networks integrate graph structure with textual observations are not fully characterized <a href="../results/extraction-result-233.html#e233.0" class="evidence-link">[e233.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-236.html#e236.0" class="evidence-link">[e236.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal graph structure (relation types, granularity of entities) for different game genres is not systematically explored <a href="../results/extraction-result-230.html#e230.0" class="evidence-link">[e230.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-233.html#e233.0" class="evidence-link">[e233.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-236.html#e236.0" class="evidence-link">[e236.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How to handle contradictory or uncertain information in knowledge graphs during partial observability is not addressed <a href="../results/extraction-result-236.html#e236.0" class="evidence-link">[e236.0]</a> </li>
