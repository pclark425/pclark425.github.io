                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modal–Amodal Continuum with Dynamic Hybridization (Contextual Modulation Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant emphasizes that the position of a concept's representation on the modal–amodal continuum is not fixed, but is dynamically modulated by context, including task instructions, recent experience, and individual differences. The brain flexibly shifts the representational format of a concept in real time, optimizing for efficiency, accuracy, and behavioral goals. Hybridization is thus not only a blending of codes, but a context-sensitive reweighting of representational resources.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law synthesizes resource optimization and representational format theories in a novel way.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Resource allocation and strategy switching are known in cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link to hybridization along a modal–amodal continuum for conceptual representation is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating context (e.g., by changing task instructions) will produce measurable shifts in the neural representation of the same concept along the modal–amodal continuum.</li>
                <li>Individuals with greater cognitive flexibility or working memory capacity will show more pronounced context-driven shifts in representational format.</li>
                <li>Training to optimize for speed or accuracy will bias the representational format toward more amodal or modal codes, respectively.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chronic exposure to a particular context (e.g., professional expertise) will produce long-term shifts in the default representational format of relevant concepts.</li>
                <li>Pharmacological or neuromodulatory interventions that affect cognitive control will alter the ability to shift along the continuum.</li>
                <li>In neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders, the ability to contextually modulate representational format will be selectively impaired.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If context manipulations do not produce any measurable shift in representational format, the contextual modulation law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If resource constraints do not lead to reweighting of modal and amodal resources, the resource optimization law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If individuals cannot switch strategies or formats even when it would be optimal, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The mechanisms by which context is detected and translated into representational shifts are not specified. </li>
    <li>The role of unconscious or implicit context effects is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
