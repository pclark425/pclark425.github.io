                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Feedback Loops in Language Model Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative self-reflection in language models constitutes a meta-cognitive feedback loop, wherein the model not only evaluates and corrects its outputs but also updates its internal representations of uncertainty and bias. The effectiveness of this loop depends on the model's ability to generate diverse self-critiques and to integrate feedback in a way that balances error correction with avoidance of overfitting to initial responses.</p>
