                <p><strong>Name:</strong> HMOT: Adaptive Query-Guided Orchestration for Targeted Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory proposes that LLM-based theory distillation can be optimized by adaptively orchestrating modules and workflows in response to the specificity and complexity of the user query. The orchestrator dynamically configures the depth, breadth, and specialization of modules (e.g., retrieval, abstraction, contradiction detection) based on the query's requirements, enabling efficient and targeted distillation of scientific theories from large scholarly corpora.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Adaptive orchestration may enable the system to autonomously identify and prioritize emerging scientific trends.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If static workflows match or outperform adaptive orchestration in efficiency or relevance, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If query-guided module selection does not improve precision, the approach is challenged.</li>
