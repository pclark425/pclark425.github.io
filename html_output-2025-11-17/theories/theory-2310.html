                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2310</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Homeostatic Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease results from a progressive failure of the brain's homeostatic mechanisms to maintain synaptic, metabolic, and immune balance in the face of age-related stressors. The breakdown of compensatory processes—such as protein clearance, synaptic plasticity, and neurovascular coupling—leads to the accumulation of pathological proteins, chronic inflammation, and network instability. Early detection is possible by identifying subtle failures in these homeostatic systems before overt pathology emerges.</p>
