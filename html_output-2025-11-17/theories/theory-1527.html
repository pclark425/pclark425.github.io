                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metric Engineering for Localized Spacetime Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by engineering the local spacetime metric using advanced, but plausible, energy-density configurations (such as negative energy or exotic matter), it is possible to create a spacetime 'bubble' or corridor in which a spacecraft can effectively achieve FTL travel relative to external observers, while remaining locally subluminal. The theory leverages recent advances in quantum field theory, Casimir effect engineering, and high-energy laser/plasma systems to propose that, within realistic budgets, small-scale metric manipulation could be achieved, enabling proof-of-concept FTL propulsion.</p>
