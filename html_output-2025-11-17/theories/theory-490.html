                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompting and Training Objective Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the effectiveness of language models (LMs) in strict logical reasoning is fundamentally determined by the alignment between their pretraining/fine-tuning objectives, prompt structure, and the logical structure of the target task. When models are trained or prompted with objectives that explicitly encode logical or discourse structure—such as sentence-order prediction (SOP), scratchpads, chain-of-thought (CoT), least-to-most (L2M) decomposition, or logic-driven data augmentation—they develop more robust, compositional, and generalizable logical reasoning capabilities, especially for multi-step or compositional tasks. Conversely, misalignment between training/prompting and the logical demands of the task (e.g., next-sentence prediction conflating topic and coherence, or training on non-logical data) leads to brittle, shallow, or biased reasoning, even in large models. The theory further asserts that prompt structure and training objective interact: instructive, logic-reflective prompts can elicit latent reasoning abilities in large models, but only if the underlying model has been exposed to objectives or data that support such reasoning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If a new pretraining objective is designed to explicitly encode multi-step logical dependencies (e.g., multi-hop entailment prediction), models trained with it will outperform standard MLM/NSP models on deep logical reasoning tasks.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought or least-to-most prompting is applied to a new compositional reasoning task, large models will show substantial gains over standard prompting.</li>

                <li>If explicit scratchpad or program-aided reasoning is used in training or prompting, models will generalize better to out-of-distribution or longer reasoning chains.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines logic-driven augmentation and standard language modeling, it is unclear whether the gains will be additive or if interference will occur.</li>
                <li>If a model is prompted with a novel, automatically generated logical decomposition (e.g., via program synthesis), it is unknown whether this will outperform hand-crafted chain-of-thought or least-to-most prompts.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with logic-driven objectives but evaluated on tasks with ambiguous or fuzzy logic (e.g., commonsense reasoning), the effect on performance is uncertain.</li>
                <li>If logic-driven data augmentation is applied to generative models with careful distribution matching, it is unknown whether the harm observed in AMR-LDA will be avoided.</li>

                <li>If a model trained with standard MLM/NSP objectives and no logic-driven augmentation matches or exceeds the performance of logic-aligned models on strict logical reasoning tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought or least-to-most prompting fails to improve performance on new multi-step logical reasoning tasks, the theory's claims about prompt structure would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If logic-driven data augmentation harms discriminative model robustness on logical perturbation benchmarks, the theory's assertion about augmentation would be called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>Some models (e.g., Mistral-7B) outperform larger models on deep logical reasoning, possibly due to architectural or training differences not captured by prompt/objective alignment alone. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3430.html#e3430.3" class="evidence-link">[e3430.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain neuro-symbolic or modular systems achieve high accuracy without explicit logic-driven pretraining or prompting, suggesting that architecture may also play a critical role. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3522.html#e3522.0" class="evidence-link">[e3522.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3435.html#e3435.0" class="evidence-link">[e3435.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3522.html#e3522.4" class="evidence-link">[e3522.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3527.html#e3527.0" class="evidence-link">[e3527.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3527.html#e3527.2" class="evidence-link">[e3527.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3542.html#e3542.3" class="evidence-link">[e3542.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3541.html#e3541.1" class="evidence-link">[e3541.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3521.html#e3521.2" class="evidence-link">[e3521.2]</a> </li>
