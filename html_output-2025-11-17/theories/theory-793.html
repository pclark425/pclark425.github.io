                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management for Continual Adaptation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by actively managing their memory contents through continual evaluation, selective retention, and targeted forgetting. By monitoring the utility and relevance of stored information in real time, agents can adapt their memory to changing task demands, environments, and goals, thereby avoiding memory overload, interference, and catastrophic forgetting.</p>
