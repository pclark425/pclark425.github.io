                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the combination of explicit structured memory and modular reasoning components is essential for LLM agents to perform hierarchical planning in text games. By leveraging structured memory to represent the world and explicit reasoning modules to decompose tasks and infer subgoals, agents can efficiently solve complex, multi-stage objectives under partial observability.</p>

                <li>If explicit subgoal tracking does not improve adaptation to dynamic environments, the necessity claim is challenged.</li>
