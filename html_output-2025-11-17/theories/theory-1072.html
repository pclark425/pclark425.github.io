                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Constraint Propagation in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) solve spatial puzzle games like Sudoku by implicitly learning and applying constraint propagation mechanisms through their training on vast corpora, enabling them to represent, update, and reason about spatial constraints in a distributed, non-symbolic manner. Rather than explicit symbolic manipulation, LLMs use their internal representations to propagate constraints across the puzzle grid, allowing them to fill in cells in a manner analogous to human logical deduction, but realized through high-dimensional vector operations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is probed during Sudoku solving, its internal activations will show distributed patterns corresponding to the propagation of constraints from filled to unfilled cells.</li>
                <li>LLMs will perform better on spatial puzzles when the input is structured to make constraints more explicit (e.g., using grid-like formatting).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is trained on a synthetic language with explicit constraint markers, it may develop more interpretable internal representations of constraint propagation.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize constraint propagation to novel spatial puzzles (e.g., non-standard Sudoku variants) if the underlying logic is similar.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to solve spatial puzzles even at chance level, this would challenge the theory that they perform distributed constraint propagation.</li>
                <li>If interventions on LLM activations do not disrupt constraint satisfaction, this would call into question the distributed nature of the process.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanism by which LLMs represent and update constraints is not fully understood or directly observable. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
