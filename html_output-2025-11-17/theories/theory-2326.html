                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Homeostatic Failure Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease results from a progressive failure of the brain's dynamic homeostatic mechanisms, including synaptic scaling, glial regulation, and metabolic adaptation. The breakdown of these adaptive systems, triggered by genetic, environmental, and age-related stressors, leads to runaway protein aggregation, synaptic loss, and ultimately, neurodegeneration. Early detection is best achieved by identifying markers of homeostatic stress and compensatory failure, rather than static pathology.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Synaptic scaling and glial regulation are essential for maintaining neural stability; their failure is observed in AD models. </li>
    <li>Metabolic stress (e.g., impaired glucose metabolism) is an early feature of AD and predicts progression. </li>
    <li>Experimental disruption of homeostatic mechanisms in animal models leads to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. </li>
