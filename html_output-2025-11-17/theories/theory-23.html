                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Current large language models, primarily based on autoregressive transformers trained on static text corpora, can mimic first-order theory-of-mind (ToM) tasks using pattern recognition. However, they still lack genuine recursive and dynamic mental state modeling. This results in success on controlled, static tasks, but failures on complex, higher-order, and context-sensitive social reasoning. Integrating explicit belief state modules, symbolic reasoning, and multimodal interactive training improves performance, yet these hybrid approaches fall short of capturing true human-like ToM.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs can achieve high performance on static, first-order ToM tasks using learned patterns, but this success is superficial and does not reflect true mental state modeling.</li>
                <li>The absence of explicit, recursive, and dynamic representations of mental states in LLM architectures severely limits their genuine ToM capabilities.</li>
                <li>Training solely on static text corpora limits the development of robust, context-sensitive and higher-order ToM reasoning.</li>
                <li>While hybrid approaches (incorporating symbolic reasoning and multimodal interactive training) improve performance, they still do not reach the level of human-like, dynamic social cognition.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AutoToM demonstrates that when explicit Bayesian inverse planning and agent modeling are integrated, performance on ToM tasks improves, which confirms that unmodified LLMs lack explicit mental state representations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-145.html#e145.0" class="evidence-link">[e145.0]</a> </li>
    <li>BIP-ALM and DEL-ToM show that hybrid multimodal and symbolic approaches enhance performance but still struggle with complex scenarios, reinforcing the limitations of static training. <a href="../results/extraction-result-147.html#e147.0" class="evidence-link">[e147.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-146.html#e146.0" class="evidence-link">[e146.0]</a> </li>
    <li>DynToM's evaluation in temporal mental state tracking highlights a significant performance degradation compared to human performance, underlining deficiencies in dynamic belief updates. <a href="../results/extraction-result-153.html#e153.0" class="evidence-link">[e153.0]</a> </li>
    <li>GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 exhibit failures in higher-order and dynamic ToM tasks despite good performance on baseline false-belief tasks, indicating superficial pattern-based reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-158.html#e158.0" class="evidence-link">[e158.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-148.html#e148.0" class="evidence-link">[e148.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-156.html#e156.0" class="evidence-link">[e156.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The 'ToM and GeRRI' framework, employing recursive gradient-based inference, only achieves toddler-level performance, emphasizing the absence of deep recursive mental state modeling. <a href="../results/extraction-result-141.html#e141.0" class="evidence-link">[e141.0]</a> </li>
    <li>VToM shows that while additional visual context improves accuracy, LLMs still struggle to infer additional layers of mental state reasoning under conflicting cues. <a href="../results/extraction-result-159.html#e159.0" class="evidence-link">[e159.0]</a> </li>
    <li>XToM reveals that despite strong fact consistency, there are significant performance gaps in belief reasoning across languages, supporting limitations inherent to static training. <a href="../results/extraction-result-154.html#e154.0" class="evidence-link">[e154.0]</a> </li>
    <li>T@MBench indicates that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 lag behind humans in false belief tasks, reinforcing the core limitations in genuine ToM reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-163.html#e163.0" class="evidence-link">[e163.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs without architectural modifications will continue to excel in controlled static ToM evaluations yet fail on dynamic and higher-order ToM tasks.</li>
                <li>Integrating explicit belief state modules and structured symbolic reasoning will boost performance on static benchmarks but will not fully bridge the gap to human-level dynamic ToM.</li>
                <li>Hybrid and multimodal training methods will provide incremental improvements in recursive and dynamic ToM tasks, although genuine human-like understanding will remain elusive.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>It remains uncertain whether future transformer architectures can be designed to inherently develop recursive and dynamic mental state representations.</li>
                <li>The potential for novel training objectives beyond static language modeling to induce genuine and human-like ToM is unclear.</li>
                <li>Whether an optimal integration of explicit belief modules with multimodal interactive training can fully replicate the depth of human social cognition is still an open question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If future LLMs achieve human-level performance on complex, dynamic, and higher-order ToM tasks without any architectural modifications, it would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If hybrid models that integrate symbolic reasoning and explicit belief tracking do not show significant improvements over pure autoregressive models in robust ToM benchmarks, the theory's assumptions would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some studies report high performance on standard false belief tasks (e.g., GPT-3) suggesting that emergent pattern recognition can mimic ToM, though this may be due to superficial heuristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-167.html#e167.0" class="evidence-link">[e167.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Results such as LLaMA2-70B's outperformance on faux pas tests and high forward belief accuracy in Llama-2 indicate that certain performance metrics could be influenced by biases and not genuine ToM understanding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-156.html#e156.2" class="evidence-link">[e156.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-149.html#e149.0" class="evidence-link">[e149.0]</a> </li>
