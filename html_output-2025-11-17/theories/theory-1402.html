                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization through Reflective Generation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-optimization, where each cycle of generate-then-reflect enables the model to identify, diagnose, and correct its own errors by leveraging internal uncertainty signals and external feedback. The process is governed by a feedback loop in which the model's outputs are recursively evaluated and revised, leading to progressive refinement and higher answer quality.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Studies show that LMs are more likely to revise outputs when uncertainty or low confidence is detected, as seen in uncertainty estimation and self-reflection experiments. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes uncertainty estimation and reflection, which are typically studied separately.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Uncertainty estimation in LMs is a known area; reflection based on uncertainty is emerging.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law connects internal uncertainty signals directly to the initiation of reflection cycles.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is allowed to perform multiple generate-then-reflect cycles, answer quality will improve with each iteration until a plateau is reached.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty signals are artificially increased in certain answer regions, the model will focus reflection and revision on those regions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the reflection process is made recursive without limit, the model may eventually overfit or degrade answer quality due to excessive self-correction.</li>
                <li>If external feedback is combined with self-reflection, the rate of answer improvement may accelerate or decelerate depending on feedback quality.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative reflection does not lead to improved answer quality, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models do not initiate reflection in response to uncertainty, the uncertainty-driven reflection law is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection leads to no improvement or even degradation in answer quality are not fully explained. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
