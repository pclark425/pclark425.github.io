                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Task Decomposition Signal Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the format of a prompt serves as an explicit or implicit signal to the LLM about the expected decomposition of the task, thereby modulating the model's internal attention, memory allocation, and reasoning strategy. The presence of stepwise or segmented formats cues the LLM to allocate resources to intermediate steps, while unsegmented formats encourage holistic or shortcut-based reasoning. The effectiveness of this signaling depends on the alignment between prompt structure and the underlying task complexity.</p>

                <li>If LLMs do not allocate attention to step markers, the decomposition signaling law is undermined.</li>
                <li>If prompt-task alignment does not affect performance, the alignment law is challenged.</li>
