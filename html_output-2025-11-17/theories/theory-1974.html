                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill qualitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by semantically aggregating and abstracting recurring relational patterns, even when those patterns are expressed in diverse linguistic forms. The process leverages the LLM's ability to align semantically similar statements, identify high-frequency relational structures, and generalize them into candidate laws, which can then be further refined through iterative prompting or external validation.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize, paraphrase, and abstract information from large text corpora, including scientific literature. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs can extract and generalize relationships from diverse textual inputs. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to work on information extraction and scientific summarization, this law formalizes the emergent property of law distillation as a core LLM capability.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Existing work shows LLMs can summarize and extract information from text, and some research explores their ability to identify patterns in scientific literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of LLMs as semantic aggregators that can distill qualitative laws from recurring relational patterns across heterogeneous scholarly texts is novel.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to generate coherent qualitative laws from a corpus known to contain explicit and implicit laws, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to align semantically equivalent statements across documents, the abstraction mechanism would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs generate spurious or incoherent laws from high-quality, well-structured corpora, the theory's assumptions would be undermined.</li>
