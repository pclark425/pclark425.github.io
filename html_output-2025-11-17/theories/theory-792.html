                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by organizing memory in a hierarchical structure, where information is stored and retrieved at varying levels of abstraction and temporal granularity. High-level summaries and schemas are maintained for long-term context, while detailed episodic traces are kept for recent or salient events. This enables efficient reasoning, flexible adaptation, and robust handling of both short- and long-horizon dependencies.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human and animal memory systems are organized hierarchically, with both semantic (abstract) and episodic (detailed) memory (Tulving, 1972; McClelland et al., 1995). </li>
    <li>Hierarchical memory architectures in neural networks improve performance on tasks with long-term dependencies (Kaiser et al., 2017; Rae et al., 2016). </li>
    <li>Transformer-based models with memory layers or hierarchical attention outperform flat memory models on complex reasoning tasks (Ainslie et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019). </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes established principles from neuroscience and ML, but applies them in a new, formalized way to LM agent memory.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hierarchical memory is well-established in cognitive science and has been explored in neural architectures.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Explicitly linking abstraction level and temporal granularity to memory organization in LM agents for optimal task performance is novel.</p>
