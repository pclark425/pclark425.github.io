                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of scholarly literature, can autonomously synthesize new, generalizable quantitative laws by identifying, abstracting, and reconciling patterns, contradictions, and gaps across diverse sources, thus accelerating scientific discovery beyond traditional human-driven meta-analysis.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely novel quantitative laws in underexplored scientific domains by synthesizing weak signals across many papers.</li>
                <li>LLMs could identify meta-laws—laws about the structure or evolution of scientific laws themselves—by analyzing patterns in law emergence across disciplines.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to synthesize accurate or generalizable quantitative laws from large, diverse corpora, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot resolve contradictions in quantitative claims across papers, the theory's claim of automated law refinement would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of biased or low-quality input literature on the accuracy of synthesized laws. </li>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to handle highly technical or domain-specific mathematical notation is not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends the concept of meta-analysis to a new, automated, LLM-driven paradigm.</p>
