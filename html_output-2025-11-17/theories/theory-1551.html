                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel is feasible within current or near-future technological and budgetary constraints by engineering spacetime metrics using only positive-energy-density matter and fields. It generalizes the concept of warp bubbles to include any configuration of classical or quantum fields that can locally contract and expand spacetime, enabling superluminal effective travel without violating known energy conditions.</p>
