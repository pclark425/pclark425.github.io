                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-SR Programmatic Equation Discovery Law: General Corpus-Driven Symbolic Synthesis Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when provided with a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can synthesize symbolic quantitative laws by leveraging distributed representations of scientific concepts and their interrelations. The LLM's internal representations enable it to generalize across variations in terminology, notation, and context, allowing the model to unify disparate textual evidence into coherent mathematical expressions.</p>
