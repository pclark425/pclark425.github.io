                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Hybrid Memory Control for Multi-Scale Reasoning in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with a hierarchical hybrid memory architecture—where memory is organized at multiple temporal and abstraction scales (e.g., short-term episodic, long-term episodic, and semantic)—can reason effectively across both immediate and extended time horizons in text games. A hierarchical controller dynamically allocates attention and retrieval across these memory levels, enabling agents to integrate fine-grained event details with high-level knowledge for robust planning and adaptation.</p>
