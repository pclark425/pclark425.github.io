                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection-Dependent Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is determined by the interplay between their network connectivity (i.e., their position and role within local and global cortical circuits) and the specific long-range projection targets they innervate. Neurons that are highly interconnected within vulnerable subnetworks or that project to regions with high pathological burden are more susceptible to neurodegeneration, while those embedded in resistant subnetworks or projecting to less affected regions are more resistant.</p>
