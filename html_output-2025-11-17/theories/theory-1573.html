                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Vacuum Engineering for FTL Travel</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by manipulating the quantum vacuum at macroscopic scales, it is possible to engineer local spacetime metrics that allow effective faster-than-light (FTL) travel. The approach leverages advances in quantum field theory, metamaterials, and energy localization to create regions where the speed of light barrier is circumvented for a contained system, without violating causality or local Lorentz invariance.</p>
