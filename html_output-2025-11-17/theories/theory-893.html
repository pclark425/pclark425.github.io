                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Integration Theory for Personalized Dialogue Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve optimal task-solving by integrating memories at multiple hierarchical levels (episodic, semantic, and procedural), with dynamic transitions between these levels governed by task requirements and user interaction patterns. The theory asserts that agents must not only consolidate and recall information, but also flexibly shift between granular (episodic) and abstract (semantic/procedural) memory representations to maximize personalization, adaptability, and task performance.</p>
