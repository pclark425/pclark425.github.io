                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1632</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Constraint Theory of LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by the degree to which contextual constraints—such as prompt specificity, input format, and external tool integration—reduce ambiguity and guide the model toward valid domain-specific inferences. The more precisely the context constrains the model's generative process to the valid solution space of the subdomain, the higher the simulation accuracy.</p>

                <li>If contextual constraints are made too rigid, LLMs may fail to generalize or may miss creative solutions present in the domain.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple forms of contextual constraint (prompt, input format, tool integration) may yield non-linear improvements in simulation accuracy.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in the absence of explicit contextual constraints or tool integration, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing prompt specificity does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If tool integration fails to improve accuracy in subdomains requiring precise computation, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs generate accurate simulations despite vague or ambiguous prompts, possibly due to memorization or overfitting. </li>
    <li>Instances where LLMs hallucinate or err even with highly constrained prompts and tool integration, suggesting other factors (e.g., model architecture, training data) are at play. </li>
