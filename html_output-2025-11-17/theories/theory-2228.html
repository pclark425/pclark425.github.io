                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Multi-Agent Consensus Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when performed by a dynamic ensemble of diverse evaluators (human and machine), whose judgments are aggregated through consensus mechanisms that adaptively weight each agent's input based on demonstrated reliability and domain expertise. The system iteratively updates agent weights and consensus rules as new evidence about evaluator performance emerges.</p>
