                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Explicit Intermediate Representation for Logical Reasoning in LMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve strict logical reasoning best when they are guided to generate explicit, structured intermediate representations (such as formal logic expressions, proof trees, or programmatic steps) during inference. These representations serve as scaffolding, enabling both the model and external modules to verify, manipulate, and ensure the logical validity of the reasoning process before producing a final answer.</p>
