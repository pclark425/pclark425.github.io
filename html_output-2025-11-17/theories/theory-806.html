                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Structuring Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve maximal task performance when their memory is structured hierarchically, with distinct levels (e.g., episodic, semantic, procedural) supporting different types of reasoning and retrieval. The hierarchical organization enables efficient storage, retrieval, and abstraction, allowing agents to generalize across tasks and contexts.</p>

                <li>If agents fail to retrieve information at the correct abstraction level, resulting in poor generalization, the theory's mechanism would be questioned.</li>
