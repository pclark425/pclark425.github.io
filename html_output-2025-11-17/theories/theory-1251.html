                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Alignment and Compactness Principle for Graph-to-Text Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is achieved when the structural, semantic, and contextual information in the graph is aligned with the linguistic, pragmatic, and discourse structures in text, and the representation is as compact as possible without loss of essential information. The principle asserts that such multimodal alignment and compactness maximize both the learnability and generalization of language models.</p>
