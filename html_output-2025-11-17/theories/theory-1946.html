                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Human Feedback Loops</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the process of distilling qualitative laws from scholarly papers using LLMs is most effective when combined with iterative human feedback. LLMs generate candidate laws, which are then evaluated, critiqued, and refined by human experts, with the feedback used to further fine-tune the LLM or guide subsequent law extraction cycles. This iterative loop leads to increasingly accurate, interpretable, and consensus-aligned qualitative laws.</p>

    <li>Human-in-the-loop approaches in NLP have improved model outputs in summarization, fact-checking, and knowledge extraction. </li>
