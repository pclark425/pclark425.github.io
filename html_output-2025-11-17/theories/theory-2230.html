                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be dynamically calibrated to the context of the domain, the intended use, and the LLM's training provenance. It asserts that evaluation criteria should be adaptively weighted based on the novelty of the domain, the risk profile of the application, and the transparency of the LLM's training data, to optimize both scientific rigor and practical utility.</p>

    <li>Evaluation standards in science are often adapted to the novelty and risk profile of the domain (e.g., higher standards in medicine than in theoretical physics). </li>
    <li>LLM outputs are more reliable in domains well-represented in their training data, and less so in novel or high-risk domains. </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Dynamic calibration may lead to inconsistent standards across domains, potentially allowing unsafe theories in under-regulated areas.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If contextually calibrated evaluation does not improve the reliability of accepted LLM-generated theories, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If high-risk domains do not benefit from increased rigor, the adaptive rigor law is challenged.</li>
