                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abductive Synthesis Theory for LLM-Based Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill scientific theories by iteratively generating, evaluating, and refining candidate theory statements through abductive reasoning. The LLM hypothesizes explanations for observed patterns in the literature, tests these against the corpus, and revises its hypotheses in light of new evidence, converging on theories that best explain the data.</p>
