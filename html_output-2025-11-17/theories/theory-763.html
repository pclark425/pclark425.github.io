                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Token Pattern Matching Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by learning and exploiting statistical patterns in token sequences, rather than by executing true algorithmic computation. Their apparent arithmetic ability is a byproduct of pattern completion, with accuracy depending on the frequency and regularity of arithmetic expressions in the training data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will perform poorly on arithmetic problems with novel tokenizations or rare phrasing.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning on new arithmetic formats will improve performance on those formats but not on others.</li>
                <li>Performance will correlate with n-gram frequency of arithmetic expressions in the training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on a language with highly regular but artificial arithmetic token patterns, it may outperform on those patterns but fail on natural language arithmetic.</li>
                <li>Introducing adversarial tokenizations may cause systematic arithmetic failures even for simple problems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can solve arithmetic problems with completely novel token patterns, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If performance is robust to tokenization and phrasing changes, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial generalization to arithmetic problems with unseen token patterns, suggesting limited abstraction. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory is closely related to existing work but formalizes the role of token patterns in arithmetic.</p>
