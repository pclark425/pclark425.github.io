                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-697</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that, under certain conditions, language models develop internal representations and mechanisms that approximate algorithmic arithmetic procedures (e.g., digit-wise addition with carry, multiplication via partial products). These mechanisms emerge from the model's architecture (e.g., attention, depth) and the structure of the training data, enabling the model to perform arithmetic beyond mere memorization or pattern matching, especially for problems outside the training distribution.</p>
