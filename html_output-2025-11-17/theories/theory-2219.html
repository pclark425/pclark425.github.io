                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Dimensional Evaluation Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires a multi-dimensional framework that integrates factual accuracy, logical coherence, novelty, and empirical testability. The theory asserts that no single dimension is sufficient for robust evaluation, and that systematic, weighted aggregation of these dimensions yields a more reliable assessment of scientific value.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories evaluated with a multi-dimensional, weighted framework will have higher alignment with expert human judgments than those evaluated with single metrics.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Some theories may be highly novel and logically coherent but empirically untestable, challenging the weighting scheme.</li>
                <li>The optimal weighting of dimensions may vary by scientific domain and could reveal new biases in LLM outputs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If single-metric evaluation (e.g., factuality only) outperforms multi-dimensional evaluation in predicting expert acceptance, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If the weighted aggregation fails to distinguish between high- and low-quality LLM-generated theories, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to set or adapt weights for different scientific domains or contexts. </li>
    <li>It does not address the challenge of evaluating theories in domains with limited empirical data. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
