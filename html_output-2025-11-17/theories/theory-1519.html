                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Functional Stable Coactivation Criterion for Concept Individuation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is functionally individuated by the emergence of stable coactivation patterns among distributed representational units. A concept is defined not by a single localized representation, but by a reproducible, context-sensitive pattern of coactivation that is stable across relevant cognitive states and tasks. This criterion allows for flexible, compositional, and context-dependent conceptual representations, while maintaining functional individuation and discrimination between concepts.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificial neural systems trained with this criterion may develop emergent, non-human-like conceptual structures.</li>
                <li>In cases of extreme context variability, the stability of coactivation patterns may break down, leading to concept confusion or blending.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be accessed without any reproducible stable coactivation pattern, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context changes always produce entirely new patterns with no stable core, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the minimal granularity or scale of representational units required for stable coactivation. </li>
    <li>It does not address how new stable coactivation patterns are learned or consolidated. </li>
