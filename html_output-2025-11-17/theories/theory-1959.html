                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Distillation via Semantic Aggregation in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill qualitative scientific laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by semantically aggregating and abstracting recurring relational patterns, even when these patterns are distributed across diverse linguistic expressions and domains. The process leverages the LLM's ability to encode, align, and generalize over heterogeneous textual evidence, resulting in the emergence of high-level, human-interpretable laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is exposed to a large, diverse set of papers in a scientific field, it will be able to generate qualitative laws that align with the consensus of that field.</li>
                <li>LLMs will more reliably distill laws that are expressed in multiple forms and contexts across the literature, even if no single paper states the law explicitly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on highly heterogeneous or conflicting corpora may generate novel, previously unrecognized qualitative laws that synthesize disparate subfields.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to distill cross-domain qualitative laws (e.g., analogies between physics and biology) if exposed to sufficiently diverse corpora.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM fails to distill a well-established qualitative law that is widely distributed across the literature, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently generate spurious or non-existent laws from corpora with no recurring relational patterns, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of LLM architecture and pretraining objectives in the fidelity of law distillation is not fully explained. </li>
