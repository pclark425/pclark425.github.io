                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large corpora of scholarly papers, can induce qualitative scientific laws by aggregating and abstracting recurring semantic patterns, even when these patterns are distributed across diverse domains, terminologies, and document structures. The LLM's internal representations enable it to generalize from specific instances to higher-level, cross-domain qualitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel, previously unrecognized scientific laws by aggregating weak signals across many papers.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to propose unifying principles that bridge currently disconnected scientific domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to abstract general laws from recurring patterns in large corpora, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot induce cross-domain laws despite exposure to semantically similar relationships, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may struggle with highly technical or mathematically formalized laws that lack sufficient linguistic redundancy. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
