                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic-Connectivity Interaction Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by the interaction between their metabolic demand and their network connectivity. Neurons with both high metabolic rates and high connectivity (especially long-range projections) are most susceptible, as the combination increases oxidative stress, protein misfolding, and exposure to trans-synaptic spread.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The resistance of such neurons is known, but the conditional logic is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Resistance of low-activity, sparsely connected neurons is observed.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit conditional dependence on both low metabolic demand and low connectivity is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual cortical neurons with both high metabolic rates and high connectivity will show early and severe pathology in dementia models.</li>
                <li>Reducing metabolic demand (e.g., by pharmacological inhibition) in highly connected neurons will reduce their vulnerability to pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing metabolic demand in a low-connectivity neuron will not increase vulnerability unless connectivity is also increased.</li>
                <li>Simultaneous reduction of both metabolic demand and connectivity in a vulnerable neuron will confer resistance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with high metabolic demand but low connectivity are equally vulnerable would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that metabolic demand and connectivity do not interact to determine vulnerability would contradict the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with high metabolic demand but low connectivity may still be vulnerable, suggesting other factors. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
