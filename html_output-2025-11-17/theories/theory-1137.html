                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1137</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Intermediate Representation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve the highest accuracy in strict logical reasoning when they are required to generate, manipulate, and verify explicit intermediate representations (EIRs) of logical structure—such as formal proofs, symbolic trees, or stepwise derivations—rather than relying solely on end-to-end sequence prediction. The theory asserts that the act of constructing and referencing EIRs enables LMs to avoid common pitfalls of pattern-matching and to maintain logical consistency across multi-step reasoning.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LMs without EIRs can match or exceed the logical accuracy of EIR-based LMs, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If EIR generation and verification do not reduce logical errors, the theory's central claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If EIRs introduce new failure modes (e.g., overfitting to stepwise patterns), the theory may need revision.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LMs can solve simple logic tasks without explicit intermediate steps. </li>
    <li>Very large LMs sometimes produce correct answers via pattern-matching alone. </li>
