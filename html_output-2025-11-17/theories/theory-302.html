                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-302</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Aligned Abstraction Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> An optimal world model for AI systems should dynamically allocate representational fidelity and abstraction levels based on task-specific utility gradients, rather than maintaining uniform detail across all modeled aspects. The principle posits that world models achieve optimality through selective fidelity: high-resolution representations for task-critical features and compressed, abstract representations for task-peripheral information. This creates a heterogeneous representational landscape where computational resources, interpretability, and predictive accuracy are concentrated along task-relevant dimensions. Critically, this principle applies both to explicitly designed abstractions and to learned representations that implicitly implement task-aligned abstraction through mechanisms like attention and adaptive computation.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal level of representational fidelity for any feature in a world model is determined by the sensitivity of task performance to errors in that feature's representation, formalized as: optimal fidelity F*(c) increases monotonically with |∂U_task/∂ε(c)|, where ε(c) is representation error for component c.</li>
                <li>Computational resources allocated to world model components should follow a utility gradient principle: R(c) ∝ ∂U_task/∂F(c), where R(c) is resources for component c, U_task is task utility, and F(c) is fidelity of component c, subject to a total resource constraint Σ R(c) ≤ R_total.</li>
                <li>Abstraction boundaries in world models should align with task-relevant causal structure rather than perceptual or ontological boundaries, such that interventions on abstract representations correspond to meaningful task-level interventions.</li>
                <li>Interpretability of world models is maximized when abstraction levels match the semantic granularity at which task decisions are made, creating alignment between model representations and human decision-making concepts.</li>
                <li>World models achieve optimal efficiency when they maintain multiple simultaneous representations at different abstraction levels, with task-dependent and context-dependent routing between them, enabling flexible adaptation to varying task demands.</li>
                <li>The generalization capability of a world model to new tasks is determined by the reusability and composability of its abstraction primitives across task families, with higher reusability indicating better-aligned abstractions.</li>
                <li>Task-aligned abstraction creates a natural regularization effect that prevents overfitting to task-irrelevant details while maintaining necessary complexity for task-critical features, improving out-of-distribution generalization.</li>
                <li>The optimal world model exhibits heterogeneous uncertainty: high confidence (low uncertainty) in task-critical predictions and calibrated uncertainty in peripheral aspects, with uncertainty itself serving as a signal for abstraction level selection.</li>
                <li>Abstraction alignment can be achieved either through explicit architectural design or through implicit learning mechanisms (e.g., attention, gating, pruning) that discover task-aligned abstractions from data and task feedback.</li>
                <li>The degree of abstraction alignment required for optimality increases with task complexity and decreases with available computational resources, creating a three-way trade-off between task performance, computational cost, and abstraction specificity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Human visual attention and working memory selectively allocate resources to task-relevant features while maintaining lower fidelity representations of peripheral information, suggesting biological world models use task-aligned abstraction. </li>
    <li>Predictive coding frameworks in neuroscience show that the brain weights prediction errors by precision (inverse variance), allocating more representational resources to reliable, task-relevant signals - a form of task-aligned abstraction. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical reinforcement learning demonstrates that abstract action spaces and state representations improve sample efficiency and generalization when abstractions align with task structure. </li>
    <li>Neural network pruning and compression techniques show that models can maintain task performance while dramatically reducing parameters, indicating redundancy in uniform representations and supporting task-specific allocation of capacity. </li>
    <li>Object-centric world models that decompose scenes into entities show improved generalization and interpretability for tasks involving object manipulation and reasoning, demonstrating benefits of task-appropriate abstraction granularity. </li>
    <li>Causal representation learning demonstrates that models capturing task-relevant causal structure outperform those with purely correlational representations for intervention and counterfactual reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Attention mechanisms in transformers demonstrate that learned, context-dependent and task-dependent weighting of information improves performance by dynamically focusing computational resources on task-relevant features. </li>
    <li>Model-based reinforcement learning shows trade-offs between model fidelity and planning efficiency, with task-specific model accuracy being more important than global accuracy for achieving high performance. </li>
    <li>Disentangled representation learning shows that factorized representations aligned with ground-truth generative factors improve sample efficiency and transfer, particularly when the factors align with task-relevant variables. </li>
    <li>Multi-task learning with task-specific modules or adapters demonstrates that sharing abstract representations while maintaining task-specific parameters improves efficiency and performance across task distributions. </li>
    <li>Adaptive computation time mechanisms show that dynamically allocating computation based on input difficulty and task requirements improves efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>AI systems trained with explicit task-aligned abstraction objectives (e.g., using task-specific attention masks or modular architectures) will achieve 20-50% better sample efficiency than those trained with uniform world model fidelity objectives in data-limited regimes (< 10% of typical training data).</li>
                <li>World models that dynamically adjust their abstraction levels based on task context will outperform fixed-abstraction models by 15-30% on multi-task benchmarks while using 30-50% fewer computational resources (FLOPs).</li>
                <li>Interpretability metrics (e.g., human prediction of model decisions, alignment with human explanations) will show 25-40% higher human-AI alignment for models using task-aligned abstractions compared to uniformly detailed models.</li>
                <li>Neural architectures with built-in mechanisms for task-conditioned abstraction selection (e.g., mixture of experts with task-specific routing, conditional computation) will demonstrate 20-35% better transfer learning performance compared to monolithic architectures on held-out tasks from the same family.</li>
                <li>In robotics manipulation tasks, world models that represent object affordances and relational properties at abstraction levels matching the action space will achieve 2-3x faster learning than pixel-level or uniformly detailed geometric models.</li>
                <li>Models with task-aligned abstraction will show more graceful degradation under computational constraints, maintaining 80-90% of performance with 50% resource reduction, compared to 60-70% for uniform models.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether task-aligned abstraction principles can be automatically discovered through meta-learning across task distributions without explicit architectural inductive biases remains unclear, but if successful, would enable fully automated design of optimal world models for new task domains.</li>
                <li>The extent to which task-aligned abstractions learned for narrow tasks can compose hierarchically to support complex, multi-objective tasks with potentially conflicting abstraction requirements is unknown, but if successful, could enable scalable hierarchical AI systems that match human cognitive flexibility.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist universal abstraction primitives (e.g., objects, relations, causality, time) that are optimal across broad task families or whether abstractions must be highly task-specific could determine the feasibility of general-purpose world models and the limits of transfer learning.</li>
                <li>If task-aligned abstraction can be extended to include computational cost and latency as explicit task constraints in real-time systems, it might enable adaptive systems that gracefully degrade under resource pressure, but the stability and safety guarantees of such systems under extreme conditions are uncertain.</li>
                <li>Whether human-interpretable abstractions necessarily align with optimal task performance, or whether there exists a fundamental trade-off between interpretability and performance, could determine the feasibility of interpretable high-performance AI systems and has implications for AI safety and alignment.</li>
                <li>The degree to which task-aligned abstraction can mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning by protecting task-critical representations while allowing task-peripheral representations to be overwritten is unknown but could revolutionize lifelong learning systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If world models with uniform high fidelity across all features consistently outperform task-aligned abstraction models on held-out tasks from the same distribution by >10%, it would suggest abstraction alignment overfits to specific tasks and sacrifices robustness.</li>
                <li>If computational efficiency gains from task-aligned abstraction (measured in FLOPs or wall-clock time) are consistently offset by the overhead of abstraction selection mechanisms by >50%, it would challenge the practical utility of the principle.</li>
                <li>If models using task-aligned abstraction show worse transfer to novel tasks compared to uniformly detailed models by >20%, it would suggest that task-specific abstraction sacrifices generalization and that uniform representations are more robust.</li>
                <li>If interpretability does not improve with task-aligned abstraction, or if human users prefer uniformly detailed models in user studies, it would question the interpretability benefits claimed by the theory.</li>
                <li>If the optimal abstraction level for a given task feature cannot be reliably estimated from task performance gradients (e.g., gradients are noisy, non-monotonic, or misleading), it would undermine the practical implementability of the principle.</li>
                <li>If task-aligned abstraction models show increased vulnerability to adversarial attacks that exploit low-fidelity peripheral representations by >30% compared to uniform models, it would indicate a critical safety limitation.</li>
                <li>If meta-learning approaches fail to discover task-aligned abstractions that outperform random or uniform abstractions across multiple task families, it would suggest the principle requires strong domain-specific inductive biases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to handle tasks with multiple, potentially conflicting objectives that might require different abstraction levels for the same world model features, such as in multi-objective optimization or tasks with safety constraints. </li>
    <li>The computational cost of dynamically adjusting abstraction levels, including the meta-learning required to discover optimal abstractions and the overhead of routing mechanisms, may itself be prohibitive and could dominate the efficiency gains. </li>
    <li>How task-aligned abstraction interacts with continual learning and catastrophic forgetting when task distributions shift over time is not fully explained, particularly regarding which abstractions should be preserved versus updated. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle non-stationary tasks where the optimal abstraction level changes over time, requiring dynamic re-allocation of representational resources. </li>
    <li>The relationship between task-aligned abstraction and out-of-distribution robustness is not fully specified - it's unclear whether task-aligned models are more or less robust to distribution shift. </li>
