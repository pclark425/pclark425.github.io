                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1431</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Self-Reflective Subnetwork Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that, within large language models (LLMs), repeated generate-then-reflect cycles activate and reinforce specialized subnetworks responsible for self-evaluation, error detection, and answer revision. These subnetworks emerge during pretraining and are selectively recruited during reflection, enabling the model to simulate a form of internal dialogue or debate, leading to improved answer quality through internal competition and consensus-building.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Neural activation patterns during reflection will differ systematically from those during initial answer generation.</li>
                <li>Models with more pronounced subnetwork specialization will show greater gains from generate-then-reflect cycles.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training models with explicit internal debate objectives will lead to more robust and generalizable self-reflection capabilities.</li>
                <li>If subnetworks responsible for self-reflection are isolated and amplified, models may develop emergent meta-cognitive abilities beyond current LLMs.</li>
                <li>The degree of subnetwork specialization for reflection may correlate with model size or training data diversity in non-linear ways.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no distinct subnetworks are found to be active during reflection, the subnetwork recruitment law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If disabling reflection-active subnetworks does not impair self-correction, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If models with no observable subnetwork specialization still show strong reflection-driven improvement, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where small models with limited capacity still benefit from reflection, despite lacking clear subnetwork specialization. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends known specialization to a new domain (self-reflection) and introduces the internal debate concept.</p>
