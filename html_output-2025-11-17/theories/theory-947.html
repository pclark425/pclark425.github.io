                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Structure-Dependent Memory Utility Law for LLM Agents: Adaptive Memory Allocation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents should dynamically allocate memory resources based on the inferred structure of the text game task, such as the presence of branching narratives, state aliasing, or delayed rewards. The theory predicts that agents capable of meta-reasoning about task structure and adjusting their memory usage accordingly will achieve superior performance and sample efficiency.</p>
