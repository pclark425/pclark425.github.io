                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Temporal Commitment and Deep Exploration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how adaptive experimental design works for AI agents operating in unknown environments, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Effective exploration in sequential decision problems with long-horizon dependencies requires temporal commitment to exploratory strategies over multiple timesteps, rather than myopic resampling at each step. Agents that commit to a sampled hypothesis, policy, or value function for an entire episode (or extended period) achieve 'deep exploration' that can discover distant rewards and resolve long-horizon uncertainties. The key mechanism is that temporal commitment creates temporally-extended behavior patterns that: (1) allow exploratory actions to propagate backward through value estimates via TD learning, (2) enable the agent to follow through on multi-step plans that reach informative states far from the initial state, and (3) implement effective posterior sampling in sequential settings by maintaining consistency with a sampled hypothesis. In contrast, per-step randomization (e.g., epsilon-greedy) produces diffusive, uncoordinated exploration that fails to discover rewards requiring coordinated action sequences. The benefit of temporal commitment scales with the depth of exploration required and is most pronounced in deterministic or low-noise environments where multi-step plans can be reliably executed.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents that commit to a sampled policy, value function, or hypothesis for an entire episode achieve deeper exploration than agents that resample at every timestep, because commitment allows coordinated multi-step action sequences.</li>
                <li>Temporal commitment enables exploratory value estimates to propagate backward through TD updates, allowing the agent to learn the value of multi-step exploratory sequences that reach distant informative states.</li>
                <li>The benefit of temporal commitment increases with the depth of exploration required: environments needing longer action sequences to reach informative states show larger advantages for commitment-based methods over per-step randomization.</li>
                <li>Commitment-based exploration naturally implements Thompson sampling in sequential settings by sampling from the posterior over models/policies and following through on the sampled hypothesis for extended periods.</li>
                <li>The optimal commitment duration depends on environment dynamics: longer commitment helps in deterministic or slowly-changing environments, while shorter commitment may be needed in highly stochastic settings where plans frequently fail.</li>
                <li>Per-step randomization (e.g., epsilon-greedy) produces diffusive local exploration that fails in environments requiring coordinated action sequences, because it cannot maintain consistency with any particular exploratory hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Temporal commitment is most effective when combined with posterior sampling or uncertainty-based selection, as this ensures the committed strategy is plausibly optimal given current beliefs.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of planning under committed hypotheses can be amortized over the commitment period, making commitment-based methods practical even when per-step planning would be prohibitive.</li>

    <li>Optimal Bayesian Exploration via curiosity Q-values requires planning over multiple timesteps (τ-step lookahead) to achieve optimal cumulative information gain, with myopic greedy information gain underperforming substantially <a href="../results/extraction-result-1144.html#e1144.0" class="evidence-link">[e1144.0]</a> </li>

    <li>Epsilon-greedy exploration (per-step randomization) often converges slowly and to lower scores on exploration-challenging games compared to methods with temporal commitment, and fails completely on hard exploration Atari games like Montezuma's Revenge <a href="../results/extraction-result-1293.html#e1293.3" class="evidence-link">[e1293.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1285.html#e1285.1" class="evidence-link">[e1285.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Thompson sampling via dropout (resampling network at each action selection) showed mixed results and was not consistently superior to model-based bonuses, suggesting per-step resampling is insufficient <a href="../results/extraction-result-1293.html#e1293.2" class="evidence-link">[e1293.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Active Inference agents select policies (action sequences) by minimizing expected free energy over future trajectories, committing to policy sequences rather than selecting actions myopically <a href="../results/extraction-result-1281.html#e1281.0" class="evidence-link">[e1281.0]</a> </li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In maze navigation tasks requiring 10+ coordinated actions to reach a goal, episode-level commitment to exploration strategies will find the goal in 10× fewer episodes than per-step epsilon-greedy exploration with the same total randomness.</li>
                <li>For meta-RL problems with sparse rewards and long horizons, methods that commit to task hypotheses for entire episodes will achieve faster adaptation (measured in number of episodes to reach threshold performance) than methods that update beliefs after every transition.</li>
                <li>In hierarchical RL settings, committing to high-level options/skills for their full duration will produce more effective exploration (measured by states visited and rewards discovered) than interrupting and resampling options at every timestep.</li>
                <li>The advantage of temporal commitment will be largest in deterministic or low-noise environments where multi-step plans can be reliably executed, with the performance gap increasing as environment stochasticity decreases.</li>
                <li>In deep RL with function approximation, bootstrap-based temporal commitment will outperform dropout-based per-step Thompson sampling on tasks requiring deep exploration, because bootstrap heads provide more stable committed value estimates.</li>
                <li>For model-based RL, committing to a sampled model for an episode and planning within it will be more sample-efficient than replanning with the posterior mean model at every step, especially early in learning when posterior uncertainty is high.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In highly stochastic environments where plans frequently fail (e.g., success probability < 0.5 per step), temporal commitment may perform worse than adaptive per-step methods that can quickly react to unexpected outcomes, but the exact threshold is unclear.</li>
                <li>For very long horizons (1000+ steps), the optimal commitment duration may be intermediate (e.g., 10-100 steps) rather than full-episode, but the exact relationship between horizon length and optimal commitment duration is unknown.</li>
                <li>In adversarial environments where an opponent can exploit predictable committed strategies, temporal commitment may be disadvantageous compared to more reactive exploration, but whether this depends on the opponent's learning speed is unclear.</li>
                <li>Whether temporal commitment helps or hurts in non-stationary environments where the dynamics change during an episode is unclear and may depend on the rate of change relative to the commitment duration.</li>
                <li>The interaction between temporal commitment and off-policy learning with replay buffers is not fully understood: whether replaying committed trajectories helps or hurts compared to replaying per-step randomized trajectories is unclear.</li>
                <li>In continuous control with high-dimensional action spaces, whether commitment should be in parameter space (as in VAN) or action space (as in trajectory optimization) for maximum exploration efficiency is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether hierarchical commitment (committing at multiple timescales simultaneously) provides additional benefits beyond single-level commitment is unclear, though it may help in environments with multiple temporal scales of structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding environments where per-step Thompson sampling consistently outperforms episode-level commitment would challenge the theory's generality and suggest important boundary conditions.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that in highly stochastic environments (e.g., action success probability < 0.3), committed exploration performs worse than reactive per-step methods would reveal important limitations of the theory.</li>
                <li>Showing that the computational cost of planning under committed hypotheses makes these methods slower than simpler per-step methods in time-constrained settings would limit practical applicability.</li>
                <li>Identifying problem classes where temporal commitment leads to getting stuck in local optima more often than per-step exploration (e.g., due to committing to poor hypotheses early) would question the robustness of the approach.</li>
                <li>Finding that in environments with very rapid non-stationarity, per-step adaptation consistently outperforms any fixed commitment duration would challenge the theory's assumptions about environment structure.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that off-policy learning with replay buffers can make per-step methods as effective as commitment-based methods would suggest the benefit comes from data reuse rather than temporal commitment per se.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The optimal commitment duration as a function of environment properties (stochasticity, horizon, branching factor, reward sparsity) is not fully characterized, and may require adaptive adjustment during learning </li>
    <li>How to adaptively adjust commitment duration during learning based on observed environment properties (e.g., plan success rate, value estimate variance) remains an open question </li>
    <li>The interaction between temporal commitment and function approximation errors in deep RL is not fully understood: whether commitment amplifies or mitigates approximation errors is unclear <a href="../results/extraction-result-1320.html#e1320.0" class="evidence-link">[e1320.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Methods like MAX that use ensemble disagreement with model-free RL achieve good exploration without obvious temporal commitment to hypotheses, suggesting alternative mechanisms may exist <a href="../results/extraction-result-1127.html#e1127.0" class="evidence-link">[e1127.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Count-based exploration methods (pseudo-counts, CTS) achieve strong exploration in some domains without explicit temporal commitment, though they may implicitly commit via value function learning <a href="../results/extraction-result-1285.html#e1285.0" class="evidence-link">[e1285.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1285.html#e1285.1" class="evidence-link">[e1285.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1285.html#e1285.2" class="evidence-link">[e1285.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of replay buffers and off-policy learning in commitment-based methods is not fully explained: whether replaying committed trajectories provides additional benefits is unclear <a href="../results/extraction-result-1320.html#e1320.0" class="evidence-link">[e1320.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How temporal commitment interacts with hierarchical RL and options frameworks is not fully characterized, though SUBPO suggests marginal-gain weighting may provide similar benefits <a href="../results/extraction-result-1134.html#e1134.0" class="evidence-link">[e1134.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The relationship between temporal commitment and information-directed sampling (selecting actions to maximize information gain) is not fully clear, though both seem to encourage coordinated exploration <a href="../results/extraction-result-1144.html#e1144.0" class="evidence-link">[e1144.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1281.html#e1281.0" class="evidence-link">[e1281.0]</a> </li>
