                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Literature-Driven Law Refinement Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when exposed to iterative cycles of literature ingestion and law proposal, can refine and converge upon increasingly accurate and generalizable quantitative laws. The process involves the LLM generating candidate laws, testing them against new or held-out literature, and updating its internal representations and law proposals in response to inconsistencies or new evidence.</p>
