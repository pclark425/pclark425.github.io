                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Externalized Symbolic Augmentation for Logical Reasoning in LMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language models achieve optimal strict logical reasoning when they are augmented with external symbolic systems (such as theorem provers, logic engines, or structured memory) that can be invoked as needed. The LM's role is to translate natural language into formal representations, delegate logical sub-tasks to the external system, and integrate the results back into natural language outputs.</p>
