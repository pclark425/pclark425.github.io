                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by continuously filtering and prioritizing memory contents based on contextual relevance to the current task, thereby maximizing the utility of limited memory resources and improving decision-making efficiency.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Overly aggressive filtering may cause agents to forget critical information needed for later stages of the game.</li>
                <li>Contextual filtering may enable agents to generalize across games with similar context patterns.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
