                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Modality-Task Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The effectiveness of different memory types in text-based games is determined by alignment between the memory's structural properties and the task's cognitive demands. Specifically: (1) graph-based memory excels at spatial reasoning and entity tracking, (2) episodic memory excels at procedural recall and instruction following, (3) recurrent memory excels at short-term context integration, and (4) reflection-based memory excels at strategy refinement across attempts. Misalignment between memory type and task demands results in sub-optimal performance regardless of memory capacity.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Memory effectiveness follows a task-alignment hierarchy: perfectly aligned memory provides 40-60% improvement, partially aligned memory provides 10-30% improvement, misaligned memory provides <5% improvement or negative impact.</li>
                <li>Spatial/navigational tasks (e.g., Cleaning, Treasure Hunt) require graph-based memory for >50% success rate; episodic-only memory achieves <30% success rate on these tasks.</li>
                <li>Procedural/sequential tasks (e.g., Cooking, recipe following) require episodic memory for >70% success rate; semantic-only memory achieves <50% success rate on complex procedural tasks.</li>
                <li>Multi-attempt learning tasks benefit from reflection memory, with optimal performance at 2-4 attempts; beyond 4 attempts, reflection memory shows diminishing or negative returns.</li>
                <li>Short-term context integration tasks (within 5-10 steps) benefit from recurrent memory; long-term dependencies (>20 steps) require explicit external memory (graph or episodic) for >60% success rate.</li>
                <li>The performance gap between aligned and misaligned memory grows with task complexity: for simple tasks (<20 steps), gap is <20%; for complex tasks (>50 steps), gap exceeds 50%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>AriGraph without episodic memory maintains high performance on navigation-heavy Cleaning (0.92) but drops substantially on procedural Cooking (0.64 Medium, 0.45 Hard) <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Reflexion shows marked performance growth at second try but degrades with subsequent tries, suggesting reflection memory is optimized for few-shot adaptation <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.6" class="evidence-link">[e238.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Full history baseline performs very poorly on Cleaning (0.05) but better on Cooking (0.18), suggesting unstructured memory is particularly bad for spatial tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.3" class="evidence-link">[e238.3]</a> </li>
    <li>RAG baseline shows relatively balanced but mediocre performance across tasks (0.33-0.39), suggesting vector retrieval doesn't align well with any specific task type <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.5" class="evidence-link">[e238.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Simulacra memory (scored episodic) performs well on Cleaning (0.70) but poorly on Treasure Hunt (0.40) and Cooking (0.30) <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.7" class="evidence-link">[e238.7]</a> </li>
    <li>LSTM-DRQN with recurrent memory shows modest improvements (3.9%) over non-recurrent baseline, suggesting recurrent memory provides limited benefits for long-horizon tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-236.html#e236.3" class="evidence-link">[e236.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Sweet&Sour with positive+negative reflection memory substantially outperforms failure-only Reflexion (54.6 vs 45.3 for GPT-4o) <a href="../results/extraction-result-232.html#e232.0" class="evidence-link">[e232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-232.html#e232.1" class="evidence-link">[e232.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Commonsense-enhanced agents with external knowledge bases help with thematic reasoning and affordance understanding <a href="../results/extraction-result-229.html#e229.2" class="evidence-link">[e229.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a new text game requiring pure spatial reasoning (navigating a maze with no procedural elements), graph-based memory will achieve >80% success rate while episodic-only memory will achieve <40%.</li>
                <li>For a task requiring memorization and recall of a 15-step procedure with no navigation, episodic memory will achieve >75% success rate while graph-only memory will achieve <45%.</li>
                <li>In a task requiring both navigation and procedures but with clear separation (navigate first, then execute procedure), hybrid memory will show exactly additive benefits of each component with <5% synergy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For tasks requiring temporal reasoning about event sequences and causality (e.g., 'what caused the door to open?'), it's unclear whether episodic memory (preserving temporal order) or graph memory (capturing causal relations) would be more effective - difference could range from -30% to +40%.</li>
                <li>In tasks requiring analogical reasoning across different game scenarios, it's unknown whether abstract semantic memory or concrete episodic examples would be more beneficial - performance difference unclear.</li>
                <li>For tasks with nested sub-goals (goals within goals), the optimal memory structure (hierarchical graph vs. flat episodic vs. hybrid) is unknown and could show 20-50% performance variation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where misaligned memory consistently outperforms aligned memory would challenge the alignment principle.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that a single memory type (e.g., graph-based) achieves optimal performance across all task types would challenge the task-specificity claim.</li>
                <li>Showing that memory alignment provides no performance benefit in complex tasks (>50 steps) would challenge the complexity-scaling claim.</li>
                <li>Finding that reflection memory continues to improve performance beyond 10 attempts would challenge the diminishing returns claim.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to automatically determine the optimal memory type for a new task without manual analysis is not addressed <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.1" class="evidence-link">[e238.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.2" class="evidence-link">[e238.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The mechanisms for dynamically switching between memory types during task execution are not explored <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> </li>
    <li>How memory alignment interacts with different LLM architectures and sizes is not systematically studied <a href="../results/extraction-result-232.html#e232.0" class="evidence-link">[e232.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-238.html#e238.0" class="evidence-link">[e238.0]</a> </li>
