                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Cognitive Feedback Loops in LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that self-reflection in LLMs operates as a meta-cognitive feedback loop, where each reflection step serves as an internal evaluation and adjustment mechanism. The effectiveness of this loop is determined by the model's capacity for error detection, the granularity of its internal representations, and the degree to which the reflection process can access and modify relevant reasoning paths. The theory predicts that the structure and transparency of the model's internal state, as well as the explicitness of the reflection prompt, critically shape the outcome of iterative self-reflection.</p>
