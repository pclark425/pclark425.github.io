                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit Simulator Requirements Hypothesis (Evidence-Limited)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about minimal simulator fidelity requirements for training transferable scientific reasoning in domains such as thermodynamics, circuits, and biology.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that when training data is limited (fewer than 100 circuit examples), circuit simulators can achieve transferable scientific reasoning by meeting three minimal fidelity requirements: (1) Preservation of fundamental conservation laws (Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws), (2) Representation of primary component behaviors using simplified models that capture dominant causal relationships (e.g., Ohm's law for resistors, exponential charging for capacitors), and (3) Consistent mathematical relationships between circuit parameters. Secondary effects including component non-idealities, parasitic elements, thermal effects, and manufacturing tolerances can be omitted without compromising the development of core reasoning capabilities. The theory posits that under evidence-limited conditions, learners extract and generalize from the dominant causal structure first, and that introducing secondary complexity prematurely increases cognitive load without improving transfer. This applies specifically to foundational circuit reasoning tasks such as series/parallel analysis, voltage division, current distribution, and basic transient analysis.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A circuit simulator must preserve Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws exactly to enable transfer of conservation reasoning to real circuits.</li>
                <li>Resistors can be modeled with constant resistance (ignoring temperature dependence, tolerance, and frequency effects) for training basic DC circuit analysis without compromising transfer to room-temperature applications.</li>
                <li>Voltage sources can be modeled as ideal (zero internal resistance) for evidence-limited training, with successful transfer to real power supplies in applications where load current is well below the source's rated capacity.</li>
                <li>Capacitors and inductors can be modeled with ideal frequency-independent behavior for training basic transient analysis, with transfer limited to mid-frequency ranges where parasitic effects are minimal.</li>
                <li>Non-linear components (diodes, transistors) require at minimum a piecewise-linear approximation that captures distinct operating regions, but detailed physics-based models (e.g., full Shockley equations) are not necessary for evidence-limited training.</li>
                <li>Component tolerances and manufacturing variations can be omitted entirely when training examples are limited, as they introduce statistical complexity without enhancing understanding of causal relationships.</li>
                <li>Parasitic elements (stray capacitance, lead inductance, contact resistance) can be omitted for evidence-limited training of low-frequency DC and AC circuits.</li>
                <li>The simulator must maintain consistent mathematical relationships (e.g., if V=IR, then I=V/R and R=V/I) to avoid creating contradictory reasoning patterns.</li>
                <li>Thermal effects and power dissipation calculations can be omitted for evidence-limited training focused on circuit analysis, though they become essential for circuit design tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cognitive load theory demonstrates that reducing extraneous cognitive load during initial learning improves schema acquisition and transfer, particularly when learning examples are limited. </li>
    <li>Research in physics education shows that students can successfully learn fundamental principles using idealized models before progressing to more complex realistic scenarios. </li>
    <li>Studies in model-based reasoning indicate that simplified causal models can effectively capture essential relationships and support reasoning transfer when the core causal structure is preserved. </li>
    <li>Educational research in circuit understanding shows that students initially struggle with basic concepts like current conservation and voltage distribution, suggesting that foundational reasoning should be prioritized over detailed component behavior. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Students trained on simulators meeting these minimal requirements will correctly predict current distribution in series and parallel resistor networks in real circuits with accuracy comparable to students trained on high-fidelity simulators (within 10% error for standard components at room temperature).</li>
                <li>Learners trained with ideal voltage sources will successfully predict qualitative circuit behavior (which components receive more/less voltage or current) in real circuits even when voltage droop occurs under load.</li>
                <li>Training with ideal capacitor models will enable correct predictions of charging and discharging time constants in real RC circuits for time constants between 100μs and 10s.</li>
                <li>Students trained on minimal-fidelity simulators will successfully apply Kirchhoff's laws to analyze novel circuit configurations not seen during training.</li>
                <li>Learners will successfully transfer series/parallel reasoning from resistive circuits to capacitive and inductive circuits despite training only on resistive examples.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists a critical threshold of training examples (e.g., 50, 100, or 200 circuits) above which including secondary effects begins to improve rather than harm transfer performance.</li>
                <li>Whether training exclusively on ideal components creates persistent misconceptions that are resistant to correction when learners later encounter real component limitations, or whether these misconceptions are easily corrected with minimal additional training.</li>
                <li>Whether certain abstraction choices (e.g., ideal operational amplifiers with infinite gain and bandwidth) are so divorced from reality that they actively impair transfer despite simplifying initial learning.</li>
                <li>Whether a 'staged fidelity' approach—where simulator complexity increases progressively—outperforms both minimal-fidelity and high-fidelity approaches, and if so, what the optimal staging sequence and timing would be.</li>
                <li>Whether the minimal fidelity requirements differ significantly across learner populations (e.g., novices vs. those with some electronics experience, or different age groups).</li>
                <li>Whether training on minimal-fidelity simulators affects learners' ability to debug real circuits where component failures or non-ideal behavior is the source of malfunction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If learners trained on minimal-fidelity simulators systematically fail to recognize basic series/parallel behavior in real circuits (e.g., error rates >30%), this would challenge the theory's core claim about sufficiency.</li>
                <li>If including temperature-dependent resistor models in evidence-limited training significantly improves transfer performance to real circuits, this would question whether thermal effects can be safely omitted.</li>
                <li>If students trained with ideal voltage sources make systematic errors in predicting real battery behavior even in low-current scenarios where internal resistance effects are minimal, this would challenge the proposed abstraction level.</li>
                <li>If learners trained on minimal-fidelity simulators show significantly worse performance on novel circuit configurations compared to those trained on high-fidelity simulators, this would challenge the claim that core reasoning transfers effectively.</li>
                <li>If adding component tolerances to evidence-limited training improves learners' understanding of circuit robustness and design principles, this would challenge the claim that tolerances can be omitted.</li>
                <li>If learners trained on minimal-fidelity simulators develop misconceptions that persist even after explicit instruction on real component behavior, this would challenge the theory's assumption that simplified models don't create harmful misconceptions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle components with multiple distinct operating modes (e.g., transistors in cutoff, active, and saturation regions, or diodes in forward and reverse bias) and whether all modes must be represented or only the most common. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how interactions between multiple component non-idealities (e.g., how resistor tolerance affects overall circuit behavior when multiple resistors are combined) should be handled. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify requirements for numerical precision and solver accuracy in the simulator, which could affect whether mathematical relationships are perceived as consistent. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address whether visual representation fidelity (e.g., realistic component symbols vs. schematic symbols) affects learning and transfer. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to handle frequency-dependent behavior in AC circuits and what level of frequency response modeling is necessary. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address whether feedback mechanisms (e.g., error messages, hints about violations of physical laws) should be included in minimal-fidelity simulators. </li>
