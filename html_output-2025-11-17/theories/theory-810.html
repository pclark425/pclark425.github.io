                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically organizing and accessing memory at multiple hierarchical levels of abstraction. The agent's memory system should flexibly shift between fine-grained episodic details and high-level semantic summaries, depending on the demands of the current task context, enabling both efficient retrieval and robust generalization.</p>
