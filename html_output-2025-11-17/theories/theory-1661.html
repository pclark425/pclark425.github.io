                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Representational Fidelity in Tool-Augmented LLM Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the fidelity with which external tools represent the formal structures, entities, and processes of a scientific subdomain is the primary determinant of LLM-based simulation accuracy. High-fidelity tools that closely mirror the subdomain's ontologies and computational rules enable LLMs to simulate with high accuracy, while low-fidelity or approximate tools introduce systematic errors and limit performance.</p>
