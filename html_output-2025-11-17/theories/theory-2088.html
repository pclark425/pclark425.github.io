                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can programmatically generate, test, and refine candidate quantitative laws by iteratively hypothesizing equations, simulating their predictions against extracted data, and updating their internal models based on empirical fit and logical consistency.</p>
