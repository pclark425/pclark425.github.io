                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Task- and Model-Dependent Optimization</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the efficacy of self-reflection in large language models (LLMs) is a function of both the nature of the task and the internal architecture and training of the model. Iterative generate-then-reflect cycles act as a form of meta-optimization, where each reflection step selectively amplifies or suppresses internal representations and reasoning paths based on the model's prior outputs and the task's demands. The improvement in answer quality is thus not uniform, but modulated by the alignment between the model's learned priors, the structure of the task, and the reflection mechanism.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that reflection improves performance more on complex reasoning tasks (e.g., multi-step math, code synthesis) than on simple fact recall. </li>
    <li>Models with instruction tuning or chain-of-thought pretraining benefit more from reflection on structured tasks. </li>
    <li>Reflection is less effective or even detrimental on tasks where the model's priors are misaligned with the task structure. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on reflection and chain-of-thought prompting, the explicit conditionality on both task complexity and model alignment is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that reflection can improve LLM performance, especially on complex tasks, and that model alignment with task structure (e.g., via chain-of-thought) is beneficial.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly links the degree of improvement from reflection to the interaction between task complexity and model-task alignment, predicting non-uniform gains.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For tasks with low complexity (e.g., single-fact retrieval), iterative reflection will yield negligible or no improvement in answer quality.</li>
                <li>For models not trained with chain-of-thought or instruction tuning, reflection will be less effective, especially on unstructured tasks.</li>
                <li>The optimal number of reflection steps will vary by task and model, with more complex tasks and better-aligned models benefiting from more steps.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For tasks with adversarial or ambiguous structure, reflection may lead to oscillation or degradation in answer quality.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained with explicit meta-reflection objectives, the optimal number of reflection steps may increase or the diminishing returns curve may flatten.</li>
                <li>Reflection efficacy may be non-monotonic for tasks with deceptive intermediate states (e.g., tasks with misleading partial solutions).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection consistently improves answer quality on all tasks, regardless of complexity or model alignment, this theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If increasing the number of reflection steps always leads to monotonic improvement, the law of diminishing returns would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection introduces new errors not present in the initial output, especially due to hallucination or overfitting to prior mistakes. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
