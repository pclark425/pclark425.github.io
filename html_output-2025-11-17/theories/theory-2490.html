                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Microenvironmental Modulation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by the local microenvironment, including glial cell activity, vascular integrity, and extracellular matrix composition. Populations embedded in microenvironments with efficient Aβ clearance, robust neurovascular coupling, and anti-inflammatory glial phenotypes are resistant, while those in compromised microenvironments are vulnerable.</p>
