                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (General 1: Integrated Homeostatic Network Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is determined by the intrinsic molecular resilience of each population, which is a function of the cohesiveness and integration of their homeostatic pathways (including proteostasis, mitochondrial quality control, antioxidant defenses, and stress response signaling). Neurons with highly integrated and robust homeostatic networks are more resistant to Aβ and tau pathology, while those with fragmented or weakly coordinated pathways are selectively vulnerable.</p>
