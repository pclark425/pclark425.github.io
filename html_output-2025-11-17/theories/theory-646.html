                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can accurately estimate the probability of specific future real-world scientific discoveries when (1) provided with contemporaneous, relevant external information via retrieval, (2) prompted or fine-tuned to perform explicit probabilistic reasoning, and (3) their outputs are aggregated (ensembled) across diverse models or prompts. The accuracy and calibration of these probability estimates depend critically on the quality and recency of retrieved evidence, the model's ability to integrate this evidence, and the diversity of reasoning strategies represented in the ensemble.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new LLM is provided with up-to-date, high-quality retrieved scientific literature and prompted for probabilistic reasoning, its forecasts for future discoveries will outperform its non-retrieval baseline.</li>
                <li>Aggregating forecasts from a diverse set of LLMs (with different architectures, prompts, or web access) will yield better-calibrated and more accurate probability estimates for scientific discoveries than any single model.</li>
                <li>LLM confidence metrics (e.g., perplexity difference, interval width) will be predictive of actual forecast accuracy across new scientific domains.</li>
                <li>Ablation of retrieval or ensemble diversity in a high-performing LLM forecasting system will result in a measurable drop in accuracy and calibration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A sufficiently large and diverse LLM ensemble, with optimal retrieval and fine-tuning, could consistently outperform the best human crowd in forecasting the probability of major scientific breakthroughs (e.g., Nobel-level discoveries) before they occur.</li>
                <li>LLMs with real-time retrieval and self-updating fine-tuning could autonomously identify and forecast the likelihood of entirely novel scientific paradigms or 'unknown unknowns' before human consensus emerges.</li>
                <li>If retrieval sources are expanded to include multimodal (e.g., figures, code, data) scientific evidence, LLM forecasting accuracy for discoveries in data-rich fields will improve beyond current text-only systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If retrieval-augmented LLMs do not outperform non-retrieval baselines on forecasting future scientific discoveries, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If ensemble aggregation of diverse LLMs does not improve accuracy or calibration over single models, the ensemble diversity law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLM confidence metrics (e.g., perplexity difference) are not correlated with actual forecast accuracy in new domains, the calibration-confidence law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If retrieval-augmented LLMs perform worse than non-retrieval baselines on a large, representative set of scientific discovery forecasts, the retrieval-dependence law would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs sometimes fail to improve over human crowd even with retrieval and ensembling, especially on highly uncertain or unprecedented scientific events. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5823.html#e5823.0" class="evidence-link">[e5823.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5790.html#e5790.0" class="evidence-link">[e5790.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Some prompt-based interventions (e.g., rationale prompting, superforecasting strategies) do not reliably improve LLM forecasting accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5706.html#e5706.1" class="evidence-link">[e5706.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5706.html#e5706.2" class="evidence-link">[e5706.2]</a> </li>
    <li>PaLM2 with News API grounding and structured forecasting strategies did not outperform the basic baseline, suggesting that retrieval and prompt engineering alone are insufficient if not well-integrated. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5706.html#e5706.4" class="evidence-link">[e5706.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5706.html#e5706.2" class="evidence-link">[e5706.2]</a> </li>
