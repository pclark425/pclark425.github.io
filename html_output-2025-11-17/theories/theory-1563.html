                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1563</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Causal Integrity and Energy Conservation in Positive-Energy Warp Bubbles</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that positive-energy, non-Natário-class warp bubbles can be constructed in such a way that they preserve global causality and energy conservation, avoiding the paradoxes and instabilities associated with negative-energy solutions. By carefully designing the bubble's geometry and energy-momentum distribution, the theory predicts that FTL travel can be achieved without violating the known laws of physics, provided the bubble's boundary conditions and propagation velocity are appropriately constrained.</p>
