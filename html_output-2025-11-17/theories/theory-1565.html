                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Realizability via Non-Natário-Class Metric Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by engineering spacetime metrics that do not belong to the Natário class, specifically by constructing positive-energy warp bubbles using physically realizable stress-energy tensors. The approach leverages advanced field configurations, such as electromagnetic, plasma, or quantum vacuum states, to generate the required spacetime curvature without invoking exotic negative energy densities. The theory further asserts that with current or near-future technology and realistic budgets, laboratory-scale demonstration of such effects is possible, providing a pathway to scalable FTL propulsion.</p>
