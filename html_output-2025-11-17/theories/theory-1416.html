                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Internalized Critic-Generator Duality Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that during generate-then-reflect cycles, a language model implicitly simulates a dual process: an internal 'generator' produces candidate answers, while an internalized 'critic' evaluates and guides revisions. This duality enables the model to iteratively refine its outputs by leveraging both generative and evaluative capacities, even though both are instantiated within the same model weights. The theory further predicts emergent internal specialization for these roles, even in the absence of explicit architectural separation.</p>

                <li>Increasing the number of generate-then-reflect cycles will lead to diminishing returns in answer quality, as the critic and generator roles converge on a local optimum.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training models with explicit architectural separation of critic and generator components may further enhance self-reflective capabilities.</li>
                <li>If adversarial reflection (where the critic intentionally misleads the generator) is introduced, the model may develop robustness to self-deception or hallucination.</li>
                <li>Emergent specialization may be more pronounced in larger models or those trained with more diverse reflection data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no distinct activation patterns are found between reflection and generation, the emergent specialization law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If explicit separation of critic and generator roles does not improve or changes answer quality, the duality law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If repeated generate-then-reflect cycles do not improve answer quality, the theory's core mechanism is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection fails to improve answers despite apparent critic-like behavior. </li>
    <li>Instances where the model's critic role reinforces incorrect reasoning, leading to degraded answer quality. </li>
