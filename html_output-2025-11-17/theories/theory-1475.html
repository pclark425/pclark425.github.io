                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Contextual Modulation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains is fundamentally dynamic and context-sensitive. Rather than static encodings, conceptual representations are actively constructed in real time through the interaction of core conceptual structures and context signals (including task demands, recent experience, and environmental cues). The format is thus a contextually modulated, high-dimensional activation pattern, where the same concept can be instantiated in multiple, context-dependent forms, supporting flexible generalization and rapid adaptation.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuroimaging shows that the neural pattern for a given concept (e.g., 'dog') varies systematically with task context (e.g., thinking about pets vs. police dogs). </li>
    <li>Behavioral priming and context effects demonstrate that the same concept can be flexibly adapted to different situations. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context effects are known, the claim that contextually modulated instantiation is the fundamental representational format is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context effects in conceptual processing are well-documented, and context-dependent neural coding is observed.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law asserts that context modulation is not just an influence but a core property of the representational format itself, making conceptual codes inherently dynamic.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The novelty lies in treating rapid adaptive reconfiguration as a defining feature of the representational code, not merely a process acting on static codes.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Rapid context-dependent adaptation in conceptual processing is observed in behavioral and neural data.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law posits that this rapid reconfiguration is a core property of the representational format, not just a downstream effect.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neural representations of the same concept will show systematic, context-dependent variation even within the same individual.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificial neural networks with explicit context-modulated representational layers will better match human context-dependent generalization patterns.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual representations are found to be invariant across all contexts, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If rapid context-driven reconfiguration is not observed in neural or behavioral data, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the underlying mechanism for how context signals interact with core conceptual structures. </li>
