                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Augmenting LLMs with explicit symbolic belief tracking modules improves performance on theory-of-mind benchmarks by providing structured representations of characters' beliefs and enabling deeper reasoning. However, this approach does not endow models with genuine mental state understanding, as errors and incorrect assumptions still occur, and the models rely on underlying LLM outputs.</p>

                <li>Hybrid symbolic-neural approaches are promising but not sufficient for full ToM.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The SYMBOLICTOM algorithm applied to GPT-3-Davinci increased ToM benchmark accuracy by 38 points, reaching 92%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Incorporating explicit belief state representations improved GPT-4's second-order ToM task accuracy to 69.4%. <a href="../results/extraction-result-82.html#e82.0" class="evidence-link">[e82.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Limitations include assumptions about story chronology and error propagation from base models. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Despite improvements, models still produce incorrect belief attributions and lack full human-level accuracy. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-82.html#e82.0" class="evidence-link">[e82.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Further development of symbolic belief trackers will continue to improve ToM task performance.</li>
                <li>Combining symbolic tracking with instruction tuning and prompting will yield synergistic gains.</li>
                <li>Symbolic belief tracking will improve model robustness to task perturbations and adversarial examples.</li>
                <li>Applying symbolic tracking to multimodal LLMs will enhance grounding of mental state reasoning.</li>
                <li>Symbolic belief tracking will enable better handling of multi-agent and recursive belief scenarios.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether symbolic belief tracking can enable genuine recursive mental state understanding is unknown.</li>
                <li>The scalability of symbolic belief tracking to real-world complex social interactions is uncertain.</li>
                <li>Whether symbolic tracking can reduce hallucinations and biases in ToM reasoning remains to be seen.</li>
                <li>The potential for symbolic belief tracking to integrate with embodied or interactive learning is unclear.</li>
                <li>Whether symbolic belief tracking can generalize across diverse narrative structures is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If symbolic belief tracking fails to improve ToM task performance in new models, its utility would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If symbolic modules introduce new errors or reduce performance, the approach would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If symbolic tracking does not improve robustness to adversarial or perturbed tasks, its benefits would be limited.</li>
                <li>If symbolic belief tracking cannot scale to multi-agent or higher-order ToM tasks, its applicability would be constrained.</li>
                <li>If symbolic tracking does not integrate well with prompting or instruction tuning, hybrid approaches would be less effective.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some ToM task improvements may be due to better task-specific heuristics rather than genuine belief tracking. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Symbolic belief tracking assumes chronological story order, which may not hold in all narratives. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
