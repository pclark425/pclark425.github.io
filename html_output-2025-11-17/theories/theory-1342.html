                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Skill Acquisition and Task Decomposition Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through iterative generate-then-reflect cycles by acquiring meta-skills—generalizable, abstract strategies for error detection, correction, and reasoning—and by decomposing complex tasks into sub-tasks. Through self-reflection, LLMs develop higher-order cognitive routines that allow them to abstract, evaluate, and adapt their outputs, leading to systematic performance gains that transcend rote memorization or surface-level pattern matching. The theory further asserts that these meta-skills and decomposition strategies can be transferred across tasks with similar structures, enabling broad generalization.</p>
