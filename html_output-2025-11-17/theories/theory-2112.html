                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Synthesis Theory (IRAST) – Theory Convergence Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that, under IRAST, repeated cycles of retrieval and synthesis by LLMs will, given sufficient and representative evidence, converge toward theory statements that reflect the dominant scientific consensus or, in the absence of consensus, will surface the principal axes of debate. The convergence is driven by the LLM's ability to weigh, reconcile, and abstract over conflicting or heterogeneous evidence, and is modulated by the diversity and quality of the input corpus.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While surfacing debate axes is known in human review, its emergence from LLM-driven iterative synthesis is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Systematic review methods for surfacing debate axes are established; LLMs can enumerate competing positions.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes this as an emergent property of iterative LLM-driven synthesis, not just as a result of explicit prompting.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to propose novel resolutions to scientific debates by synthesizing across conflicting evidence.</li>
                <li>The rate and stability of convergence may depend on the diversity and structure of the input corpus in ways not yet characterized.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to converge on consensus theory statements despite sufficient evidence, the convergence law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs do not surface principal axes of debate in contentious fields, the debate axis surfacing law is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of biased or incomplete corpora on convergence and debate surfacing is not fully addressed. </li>
