                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Emergence and Modularization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the emergence of strict logical reasoning in language models is a hierarchical process, where lower-level representational modules (e.g., for syntax, semantics, and memory) must first reach sufficient specialization and integration before higher-level logical reasoning modules can emerge. The theory asserts that modularization at multiple levels—both within and across layers—enables the abstraction and manipulation of logical forms, and that the transition to strict logical reasoning is marked by the formation of explicit, reusable submodules for logical operations.</p>
