                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Context-Action Horizon Mismatch Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory explaining the dissociation between strong QA performance and weak interactive procedural performance in LLM-based agents, and the architectural/training interventions required to close the gap.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs exhibit strong QA performance but weak interactive procedural performance due to a fundamental mismatch between their context processing horizon and the action-feedback horizon required for interactive tasks. In QA tasks, all relevant context is available within a single forward pass, allowing the model to leverage its full reasoning capacity over the complete information space. In interactive procedural tasks, however, relevant context is distributed across multiple interaction cycles, requiring the model to: (1) maintain task-relevant state across actions, (2) integrate new observations with historical context beyond the immediate prompt window, and (3) reason about action consequences that extend beyond the temporal horizon of single inference steps. LLMs are pretrained on static text where causal relationships and their consequences are presented simultaneously within local context windows, not on interactive sequences where actions create new contexts that must be integrated with prior state. This creates a horizon mismatch: the model's effective reasoning horizon (single forward pass over available context) is shorter than the task's required action-consequence horizon (multiple steps of state evolution). Architectural interventions must either extend the model's temporal integration capabilities or provide external scaffolding to compress long-horizon tasks into shorter reasoning episodes.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The effective reasoning horizon of LLMs is bounded by their context window and single forward pass architecture, while interactive tasks require reasoning over action-consequence chains that extend across multiple inference steps.</li>
                <li>QA tasks succeed because they compress all relevant context into a single inference episode, matching the model's natural reasoning horizon.</li>
                <li>Interactive task performance degrades as a function of the ratio between the task's required action-consequence horizon and the model's effective reasoning horizon.</li>
                <li>LLMs lack architectural mechanisms for maintaining and updating task-relevant state representations across multiple interaction cycles, leading to context fragmentation.</li>
                <li>Pretraining on static text provides exposure to complete causal narratives but not to the process of incrementally building and revising understanding through interaction.</li>
                <li>Interventions that either extend the model's temporal integration capabilities (e.g., memory architectures, recurrent processing) or compress task horizons (e.g., hierarchical decomposition, planning) can reduce the horizon mismatch.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs achieve near-human performance on complex QA tasks where all information is provided in the prompt, but fail on interactive tasks requiring similar reasoning depth distributed across multiple steps. </li>
    <li>LLM agents frequently fail to maintain consistent goals and strategies across extended interaction sequences, often forgetting earlier observations or decisions. </li>
    <li>Performance on interactive tasks degrades significantly as the number of required interaction steps increases, even when total reasoning complexity remains constant. </li>
    <li>Providing explicit memory mechanisms or state summarization significantly improves long-horizon interactive task performance. </li>
    <li>Methods that compress multi-step interactive tasks into single reasoning episodes (e.g., tree search, planning then execution) show improved performance. </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate reasonable high-level plans when all task information is provided upfront, but fail to execute these plans when they must be revised based on environmental feedback. </li>
    <li>LLM agents show better performance on tasks where the state space can be fully observed and described within the context window compared to tasks with partial observability or large state spaces. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agent performance will show a monotonic decrease as the number of required interaction steps increases, even when controlling for total task complexity.</li>
                <li>Augmenting LLMs with explicit episodic memory systems that store and retrieve past observations will improve performance more on long-horizon tasks than short-horizon tasks.</li>
                <li>Training LLMs on synthetic interactive trajectories where state evolution is explicitly annotated will improve interactive task performance more than training on equivalent static task descriptions.</li>
                <li>Prompting methods that explicitly summarize task state at each step will show greater benefits on longer-horizon tasks compared to shorter-horizon tasks.</li>
                <li>LLM agents will perform better on interactive tasks where natural checkpoints allow the task to be decomposed into shorter episodes that fit within the model's reasoning horizon.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Architectures with recurrent state mechanisms (e.g., state space models, recurrent transformers) might show qualitatively different scaling properties on interactive tasks, potentially maintaining performance as horizon length increases.</li>
                <li>Training with auxiliary losses that predict future state evolution multiple steps ahead might create internal representations that extend the effective reasoning horizon, enabling better zero-shot transfer to novel interactive tasks.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning on interactive tasks with gradually increasing horizon lengths (curriculum learning) might enable models to learn temporal abstraction strategies that generalize beyond training horizon lengths.</li>
                <li>Models trained with explicit temporal credit assignment signals (e.g., which past actions led to current outcomes) might develop better long-horizon reasoning capabilities than models trained only on action-outcome pairs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If providing explicit memory systems does not improve long-horizon task performance, this would challenge the theory that state maintenance across interactions is a key limiting factor.</li>
                <li>If LLM performance does not degrade with increasing interaction steps when task complexity is controlled, this would contradict the horizon mismatch hypothesis.</li>
                <li>If training on interactive trajectories with explicit state annotations shows no improvement over training on static descriptions, this would suggest the issue is not learnable through exposure to temporal structure.</li>
                <li>If compressing multi-step tasks into single planning episodes does not improve performance, this would challenge the theory that reasoning horizon limitations are the primary bottleneck.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some short-horizon interactive tasks still show poor LLM performance, suggesting factors beyond horizon mismatch contribute to the QA-interactive gap. </li>
    <li>LLMs sometimes fail on interactive tasks even when provided with complete state information and memory of all past actions, suggesting issues beyond context availability. </li>
