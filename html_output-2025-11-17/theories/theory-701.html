                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Fourier-Modular Decomposition Theory of LLM Arithmetic (Generalization and Robustness)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the Fourier-Modular Decomposition framework to explain how LLMs generalize arithmetic to novel contexts and maintain robustness to input perturbations. It posits that the superposition of frequency and modular encodings enables LLMs to interpolate and extrapolate arithmetic relations, while the distributed nature of these encodings provides resilience to noise and tokenization artifacts.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on arithmetic with highly non-standard encodings (e.g., random bases), the resulting robustness and generalization properties will depend on the decomposability of those encodings into Fourier and modular components.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are forced to use only local (non-distributed) representations, their arithmetic robustness will decrease sharply.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with explicit anti-periodic or anti-modular constraints, their generalization in arithmetic will be impaired.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs' arithmetic performance collapses with minor input perturbations, the robustness claim is falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize arithmetic to numbers outside the training set, the generalization claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' internal representations do not show distributed, periodic, or modular structure, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs' failure modes on adversarially constructed arithmetic tasks are not fully explained by this theory. </li>
