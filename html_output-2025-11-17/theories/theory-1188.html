                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness and Modality Integration Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by leveraging robust internal representations of chemical and application domains, and by integrating multiple modalities (e.g., text, molecular graphs, property data) to generalize beyond seen data. The theory asserts that the robustness of these representations and the ability to integrate diverse modalities are necessary and sufficient for successful chemical synthesis and application targeting.</p>
