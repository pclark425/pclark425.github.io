                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured and Modular Memory Enables Generalization and Robustness in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with structured and modular memory architectures—where memory is organized into distinct, interacting modules (e.g., episodic, semantic, procedural)—achieve superior generalization and robustness in text game environments. By enabling selective retrieval, targeted updating, and compositional reasoning, such architectures allow agents to flexibly adapt to novel tasks, avoid catastrophic forgetting, and transfer knowledge across diverse game scenarios.</p>
