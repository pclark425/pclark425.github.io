                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Structured Inductive Biases in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities for spatial puzzle games (e.g., Sudoku) as a result of structured inductive biases encoded during pretraining. These biases, shaped by exposure to structured data and language, enable LLMs to simulate algorithmic processes (such as constraint propagation and search) even without explicit programming, allowing them to generalize to novel spatial reasoning tasks.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop novel, non-human algorithmic strategies for spatial puzzles not seen in training data.</li>
                <li>There may be a threshold in data structure or model scale beyond which algorithmic reasoning emerges abruptly.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs pretrained on highly structured data do not outperform those trained on unstructured data in spatial puzzles, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs do not exhibit stepwise or algorithmic solution patterns in spatial puzzles, the theory is undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise neural mechanisms by which inductive biases translate into algorithmic reasoning are not fully understood. </li>
    <li>Some LLMs may solve spatial puzzles via memorization or pattern matching rather than true algorithmic reasoning. </li>
