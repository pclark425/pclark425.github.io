                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Incremental Knowledge Exposure Superiority Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For commonsense knowledge augmentation in interactive text environments, incremental exposure of knowledge (revealing information as the agent encounters relevant entities or observations) consistently outperforms full upfront provision of knowledge graphs. The mechanism operates by reducing cognitive load and exploration noise: full knowledge graphs overwhelm agents with irrelevant relations (often 90%+ of provided knowledge is not immediately relevant), leading to noisy action selection and inefficient exploration. Incremental exposure focuses the agent's attention on currently relevant concepts, improving sample efficiency by 15-40% and reducing required training steps by 20-50% in tasks with large knowledge bases. However, this advantage diminishes or reverses in tasks requiring global planning or when the knowledge base is small (<100 relations), and in some simple task settings where ground-truth full belief graphs can outperform commonsense-based incremental approaches.</p>

                <li>Incremental knowledge exposure provides 15-40% sample efficiency gains over full upfront provision in commonsense-heavy interactive text tasks with large knowledge bases.</li>
                <li>The benefit of incremental exposure increases with the size of the knowledge base - larger KBs (>500 relations) show larger performance gaps (20-50% reduction in required steps).</li>
                <li>Incremental exposure reduces exploration noise by focusing the agent on currently relevant concepts, with the mechanism being attention/action-selection focus rather than memory limitations.</li>

                <li>Full knowledge provision can actively hurt performance when the knowledge base contains many irrelevant or distracting relations (>80% irrelevant at any given step).</li>
                <li>The advantage of incremental exposure is most pronounced in partially observable environments where not all entities are visible initially.</li>
                <li>Incremental exposure enables faster convergence (20-50% fewer training steps) and higher final performance on multi-object, multi-room tasks.</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In any text-based domain with large knowledge bases (>1000 relations), incremental exposure will outperform full provision by 20-40% in sample efficiency.</li>
                <li>The benefit of incremental exposure will be largest in partially observable environments where entities are discovered gradually (30-50% improvement vs 10-20% in fully observable settings).</li>
                <li>Combining incremental exposure with active querying (agent requests specific knowledge) will provide additional 5-15% gains over passive incremental exposure.</li>
                <li>Incremental exposure will show diminishing returns as knowledge base size decreases, with crossover point around 50-100 relations where full provision becomes competitive.</li>
                <li>In multi-agent settings, incremental exposure based on collective observations will outperform individual-agent incremental exposure by 10-20%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal 'chunk size' for knowledge exposure (per-entity, per-relation-type, per-semantic-cluster) that balances information availability against noise.</li>
                <li>Whether incremental exposure benefits transfer to domains where all relevant knowledge is needed from the start (e.g., global planning problems, theorem proving).</li>
                <li>Whether agents can learn to predict which knowledge will be relevant and request it proactively, and if so, whether this provides additional gains beyond reactive incremental exposure.</li>
                <li>Whether the benefits of incremental exposure persist when using more sophisticated attention mechanisms or memory architectures that can better filter irrelevant information.</li>
                <li>Whether incremental exposure interacts with curriculum learning strategies - does ordering tasks by difficulty amplify or diminish the benefits of incremental knowledge exposure?</li>
                <li>Whether there are task characteristics (beyond planning requirements) that predict when full knowledge provision will outperform incremental exposure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding domains where full knowledge provision matches or exceeds incremental exposure by >10% would challenge the superiority claim and suggest boundary conditions.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the benefits disappear when controlling for total information provided (e.g., by limiting full provision to same amount as incremental) would suggest the issue is information quantity rather than timing.</li>
                <li>Showing that random incremental exposure performs as well as entity-based exposure would weaken the relevance-based mechanism and suggest the benefit is purely from reduced information load.</li>
                <li>Finding that agents with perfect attention/filtering mechanisms show no benefit from incremental exposure would challenge the noise-reduction mechanism.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that incremental exposure hurts performance in domains with strong prerequisite knowledge requirements would establish important boundary conditions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
