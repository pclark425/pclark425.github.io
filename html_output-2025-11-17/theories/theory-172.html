                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Learning procedural knowledge in abstract text-based environments before transferring to grounded embodied environments provides substantial sample efficiency and generalization advantages over direct embodied learning, particularly for tasks where high-level procedural structure dominates over low-level perceptual-motor skills. Abstract environments enable faster iteration (5-10× speedup), cleaner credit assignment through reduced perceptual noise, and acquisition of transferable high-level procedural knowledge including action sequences, subgoal decomposition, and systematic exploration heuristics. The magnitude of benefit scales with procedural complexity and task horizon length, but is moderated by the perceptual complexity of the embodied domain and the degree of alignment between abstract and embodied action spaces. Transfer is most effective when abstract training includes interactive learning (e.g., DAgger with expert annealing) rather than passive behavior cloning, and when intermediate representations (e.g., knowledge graphs, templated observations) bridge the modality gap.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Abstract text-based training provides 5-10× sample efficiency gains (measured in training time or environment interactions) over direct embodied training for learning the same high-level procedural knowledge.</li>
                <li>High-level procedural knowledge—including action sequences, subgoal decomposition, and systematic exploration strategies—transfers across modalities despite perceptual differences, with transfer effectiveness proportional to the alignment between abstract and embodied action spaces.</li>
                <li>The modality gap (performance drop from abstract to embodied execution) is primarily attributable to perception errors, low-level control failures, and physical feasibility constraints, rather than failures in high-level procedural reasoning.</li>
                <li>Interactive learning methods (e.g., DAgger with annealed expert assistance) in abstract environments produce better transfer than passive behavior cloning, with online correction enabling recovery from mistakes and learning of robust heuristics.</li>
                <li>The benefit of abstract pretraining scales with task horizon length and procedural complexity, but is moderated by perceptual complexity—tasks where perception dominates procedure show smaller benefits.</li>
                <li>Intermediate representations (knowledge graphs, templated observations, structured state) that bridge abstract and embodied modalities enhance transfer effectiveness by providing shared semantic grounding.</li>
                <li>Abstract environments enable discovery of systematic exploration heuristics (e.g., exhaustive search patterns, prerequisite ordering) that are difficult to learn through embodied exploration alone due to higher exploration costs.</li>
                <li>Curriculum learning within abstract environments (ordered by task difficulty or prerequisite structure) provides additional benefits beyond single-task abstract pretraining, with gains of 10-30 percentage points in generalization performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>TextWorld pretraining (TW-ONLY) achieves 19% seen/10% unseen embodied success in ALFWorld zero-shot transfer, compared to 6% seen/5% unseen for behavior cloning from static corpora, with approximately 7× faster training time than embodied-only approaches. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.0" class="evidence-link">[e1530.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.2" class="evidence-link">[e1530.2]</a> </li>
    <li>DAgger with annealed expert assistance (100%→1% over 50K episodes) in TextWorld achieves 40% seen/37% unseen generalization compared to 10%/9% for Seq2Seq behavior cloning, with successful transfer to embodied tasks and learning of transferable heuristics like systematic drawer search. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.2" class="evidence-link">[e1530.2]</a> </li>
    <li>With oracle state estimator and controller, TextWorld-pretrained policies (BUTLER-ORACLE) achieve 37% seen/26% unseen embodied success, demonstrating that high-level procedural knowledge transfers despite modality gaps, with performance primarily limited by perception and low-level control errors rather than high-level reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.0" class="evidence-link">[e1530.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Curriculum learning in text-based cooking games (tiered difficulty training) achieves 64% overall test performance versus 50-54% for mixed training without curriculum, with largest gains on mid-complexity tiers (Tier5: 64% vs 40%). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1565.html#e1565.0" class="evidence-link">[e1565.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1565.html#e1565.1" class="evidence-link">[e1565.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM-generated text-game pretraining (STARLING, ~200K params) on 75 procedurally generated games achieves 0.72±0.063 normalized score on held-out games and outperforms vanilla TBRL and larger LLM baselines on multiple ScienceWorld tasks, with particular benefits for tasks sharing procedural skills (boiling, cooking) with pretraining games. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1482.html#e1482.0" class="evidence-link">[e1482.0]</a> </li>
    <li>QA pretraining on oracle traces from simple TextWorld games improves both initial reward (e.g., Afflicted: 4.3±1.34 vs lower baselines) and final reward (Anchorhead: 24.8±0.6 vs 6.8±0.42 without pretraining), with substantial reductions in steps to convergence. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1575.html#e1575.1" class="evidence-link">[e1575.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1609.html#e1609.1" class="evidence-link">[e1609.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Knowledge graph seeding from static guides combined with QA pretraining and parameter transfer yields up to 80% improvement in convergence steps and enables learning on otherwise intractable games (e.g., Anchorhead final reward 39.9±0.53 for full pipeline vs 6.8±0.42 baseline). <a href="../results/extraction-result-1609.html#e1609.0" class="evidence-link">[e1609.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1609.html#e1609.1" class="evidence-link">[e1609.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1609.html#e1609.2" class="evidence-link">[e1609.2]</a> </li>
    <li>E2WM (embodied experiences from world models) improves LM performance on plan generation (Rouge-L: 34.31→51.23), counting (30.41%→67.01%), and object path tracking (LCS: 33.86→98.67) while preserving pretraining perplexity (3.443→3.537), demonstrating that abstract embodied simulation can enhance language models for embodied reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1559.html#e1559.0" class="evidence-link">[e1559.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Pretraining on simpler game levels then fine-tuning on harder levels (Level-1→Level-2 in Mario) yields mean distance 466±37.9 vs 399.7±22.5 for training from scratch at same iteration budget, with zero-shot Level-1→Level-3 transfer achieving ~319.3±9.7 mean distance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1597.html#e1597.0" class="evidence-link">[e1597.0]</a> </li>
    <li>TextWorld's procedural generation enables creation of unlimited training instances and difficulty-controlled curricula, supporting large-scale pretraining and systematic evaluation of generalization across unseen game instances. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1529.html#e1529.0" class="evidence-link">[e1529.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1529.html#e1529.1" class="evidence-link">[e1529.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1508.html#e1508.3" class="evidence-link">[e1508.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1518.html#e1518.0" class="evidence-link">[e1518.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Transfer of LSTM encoder trained on Homeworld to shuffled Homeworld2 accelerates learning on the new layout, demonstrating that learned sequential representations transfer across compositionally similar but spatially rearranged tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1529.html#e1529.2" class="evidence-link">[e1529.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Commonsense priors learned from text-games (via ALFWorld framework) improve generalization in visually grounded environments, with text-to-vision transfer curriculum enabling agents to adapt abstract policies to embodied constraints. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1508.html#e1508.0" class="evidence-link">[e1508.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Any new embodied task domain requiring multi-step procedures (e.g., robot manipulation, drone navigation, household robotics) will benefit from abstract text-based or symbolic pretraining of high-level action sequences, with expected 5-10× training speedup for tasks with horizon >10 steps.</li>
                <li>For a given embodied task, the optimal abstract pretraining curriculum will order tasks by increasing procedural complexity (number of steps, prerequisite depth) rather than by perceptual complexity, with largest transfer gains when abstract training includes the full range of high-level actions needed in the embodied domain.</li>
                <li>Agents pretrained in abstract environments will show 20-40% better systematic generalization to novel task compositions (unseen combinations of learned subtasks) compared to agents trained only in embodied environments, with the gap increasing for longer-horizon compositions.</li>
                <li>Hybrid training that interleaves abstract and embodied episodes will provide intermediate benefits (between pure abstract and pure embodied) but will not exceed pure abstract pretraining for zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, due to the efficiency advantage of abstract iteration.</li>
                <li>Adding intermediate representation learning (e.g., learning to map embodied observations to abstract state descriptions) during or after abstract pretraining will reduce the modality gap by 30-50% compared to direct policy transfer.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal 'abstraction level' that maximizes transfer—too abstract may lose critical procedural details (e.g., object affordances, spatial constraints), while too concrete may not provide sufficient efficiency gains. The optimal level may vary by domain.</li>
                <li>Whether modality-specific curricula that gradually reduce abstraction level (e.g., text → text+simple-graphics → full-embodied) outperform direct abstract-to-embodied transfer, and if so, what the optimal granularity and pacing of such curricula should be.</li>
                <li>Whether the benefits of abstract pretraining scale indefinitely with task complexity, or plateau at some level of procedural sophistication where the modality gap becomes the dominant bottleneck.</li>
                <li>Whether abstract pretraining can successfully transfer to embodied domains with fundamentally different action spaces (e.g., continuous control, parallel actions) or whether transfer requires approximate action-space alignment.</li>
                <li>Whether the learned exploration heuristics from abstract environments (e.g., systematic search) transfer to embodied domains with different spatial or temporal constraints, or whether they must be relearned in the embodied context.</li>
                <li>Whether combining multiple abstract pretraining modalities (e.g., text + symbolic planning + simple simulation) provides super-additive benefits compared to single-modality pretraining.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding embodied task domains where direct embodied training matches or exceeds abstract pretraining in both sample efficiency and final performance would challenge the generality of the abstraction advantage and suggest boundary conditions based on task characteristics.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that abstract-trained agents fail to adapt to embodied constraints even with substantial fine-tuning (e.g., >10× the abstract training time) would invalidate the claim that high-level procedural knowledge transfers across modalities.</li>
                <li>Showing that the wall-clock time saved in abstract training is lost or exceeded in embodied adaptation time would challenge the practical efficiency argument, suggesting that the modality gap is too costly to bridge.</li>
                <li>Finding that abstract pretraining leads to negative transfer (worse performance than training from scratch) for certain task classes would identify important boundary conditions and challenge the universality of the approach.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the learned heuristics from abstract environments are brittle and fail to generalize to embodied environments with even minor perceptual or physical differences would challenge the robustness of transferred knowledge.</li>
                <li>Showing that hybrid training (mixing abstract and embodied) consistently outperforms pure abstract pretraining would challenge the claim that abstract iteration efficiency is the primary driver of benefits.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact features of procedural knowledge that transfer robustly versus those that must be substantially relearned in embodied settings—e.g., which aspects of navigation strategies, object interaction sequences, or exploration heuristics are modality-invariant. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.0" class="evidence-link">[e1530.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1482.html#e1482.0" class="evidence-link">[e1482.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Why some abstract representations (e.g., learned systematic search heuristics) transfer better than others (e.g., specific navigation patterns), and what properties of the abstract representation predict transfer success. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.2" class="evidence-link">[e1530.2]</a> </li>
    <li>The mechanisms by which abstract pretraining enables faster embodied learning—whether through better initialization of policy parameters, improved exploration strategies, or more efficient credit assignment—and their relative contributions. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.0" class="evidence-link">[e1530.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1609.html#e1609.1" class="evidence-link">[e1609.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Why abstract pretraining sometimes fails to help with navigation-heavy or long-horizon planning tasks, as seen in STARLING's struggles with some ScienceWorld tasks, despite helping with procedural skill tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1482.html#e1482.0" class="evidence-link">[e1482.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The role of action-space alignment in transfer success—how much overlap or structural similarity is required between abstract and embodied action spaces for effective transfer. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1530.html#e1530.0" class="evidence-link">[e1530.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1482.html#e1482.0" class="evidence-link">[e1482.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Whether the benefits of abstract pretraining persist when embodied environments have very fast simulation speeds (approaching abstract environment speeds), or whether the advantage is purely computational. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1491.html#e1491.2" class="evidence-link">[e1491.2]</a> </li>
