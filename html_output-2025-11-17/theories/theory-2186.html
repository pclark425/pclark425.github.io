                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative process in which automated systems and human experts interact, with each providing feedback that refines both the evaluation criteria and the theories themselves. The theory asserts that this co-evolutionary process leads to higher-quality scientific theory generation and assessment than either humans or AI alone.</p>
