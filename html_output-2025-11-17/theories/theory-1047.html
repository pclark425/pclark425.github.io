                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1047</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Spatial Relational Reasoning in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs develop emergent representations of spatial relations (such as adjacency, exclusion, and containment) that allow them to reason about the structure of spatial puzzles. These representations are not explicitly programmed but arise from exposure to spatially-structured data and enable the model to generalize to novel puzzles.</p>
