                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic Memory for Adaptive Text Game Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by constructing and maintaining a hierarchical episodic memory, where experiences are stored at multiple levels of abstraction (from atomic actions to high-level episodes). This structure enables agents to flexibly retrieve, recombine, and adapt past experiences to novel situations, supporting efficient exploration, planning, and generalization across diverse text game environments.</p>
