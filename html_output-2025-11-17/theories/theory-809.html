                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Driven Memory Compression Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents optimize memory usage by compressing past experiences and knowledge into task-relevant representations, selectively retaining only information that is predicted to be useful for future reasoning or action. Compression is dynamically adjusted based on the agent's evolving understanding of the task, context, and feedback, enabling efficient use of limited memory resources while preserving essential information.</p>

            <ol>
