                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-alignment, where each reflection step acts as a meta-cognitive filter that re-weights, re-contextualizes, and re-generates outputs based on internalized criteria of correctness, coherence, and informativeness. The process is analogous to a form of internalized peer review, where the model's own outputs are critiqued and revised, leading to convergence toward higher-quality answers.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that models using 'generate-then-reflect' pipelines produce more accurate and detailed answers than single-pass generation. </li>
    <li>Reflection steps often explicitly point out flaws or missing information in the initial answer, leading to corrections. </li>
    <li>Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) demonstrates that LMs can self-critique and revise outputs, improving factuality and completeness. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-Thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) shows that multi-step reasoning and self-critique can improve answer quality. </li>
    <li>Reflection steps can sometimes introduce new errors or hallucinations, indicating the process is not infallible. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to chain-of-thought and self-consistency, this law formalizes the reflection step as a meta-cognitive filter, which is a new abstraction.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Reflection and self-critique have been explored in prompt engineering and chain-of-thought literature.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of reflection as a meta-cognitive filter that re-weights and re-contextualizes outputs is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If repeated generate-then-reflect cycles do not improve answer quality or lead to convergence, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If reflection steps consistently fail to identify errors or omissions in initial answers, the meta-cognitive filtering law is falsified.</li>
