                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy (Interactional Generalization)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory generalizes the threshold concept to include the interaction between model capability, task complexity, and the structure of the self-reflection process. It posits that the threshold for effective self-reflection is not fixed, but is a function of both the model's internal capabilities and the complexity of the task at hand. The efficacy of self-reflection emerges only when the model's representational and reasoning abilities exceed a task-dependent threshold, and this threshold can be modulated by the structure and guidance of the reflection process.</p>

                <li>If task complexity does not modulate the threshold for self-reflection efficacy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
