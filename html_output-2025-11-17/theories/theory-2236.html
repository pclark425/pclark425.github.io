                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Contextual Alignment for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must account for the alignment between the context in which the theory is generated (including prompt, training data, and intended application) and the context in which it is evaluated or applied. Misalignment between these contexts can lead to misinterpretation, overestimation, or underestimation of the theory's value. The theory posits that context-aware evaluation is necessary to ensure fair, accurate, and meaningful assessment of LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
