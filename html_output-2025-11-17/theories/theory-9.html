                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models performing arithmetic and mathematical reasoning are sensitive to irrelevant or distracting context within input prompts or problem statements. This distractibility leads to errors such as using incorrect numbers or misinterpreting problem conditions, limiting overall accuracy despite model size or prompting strategies.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs rely heavily on surface token patterns and context, making them vulnerable to distractions from irrelevant information.</li>
                <li>Irrelevant context can cause the model to select incorrect operands or misapply arithmetic operations.</li>
                <li>Prompt engineering can mitigate but not fully resolve distractibility to irrelevant context.</li>
                <li>Model size alone does not eliminate sensitivity to irrelevant context.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Codex and GPT-3.5 show significant performance drops on GSM-IC (arithmetic with irrelevant context) compared to clean datasets, with common errors involving use of irrelevant numbers. <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.0" class="evidence-link">[e28.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.1" class="evidence-link">[e28.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Prompting strategies that instruct models to ignore irrelevant context improve performance but do not fully eliminate distractibility. <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.0" class="evidence-link">[e28.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.1" class="evidence-link">[e28.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training models explicitly on datasets with irrelevant context and instructions to ignore distractions will improve robustness.</li>
                <li>Architectural modifications that enhance context filtering or attention mechanisms may reduce distractibility.</li>
                <li>Combining external symbolic tools with context filtering will further improve accuracy on noisy inputs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether fundamentally new architectures or training paradigms can eliminate distractibility to irrelevant context is unknown.</li>
                <li>The extent to which human-like selective attention mechanisms can be emulated in LLMs to improve arithmetic reasoning remains to be explored.</li>
                <li>Whether distractibility limits the ceiling of arithmetic reasoning performance in LLMs is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models trained on irrelevant context datasets do not improve robustness, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If larger models show no sensitivity to irrelevant context, the theory's claim about size independence would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If prompt engineering fails to mitigate distractibility, the role of prompting in controlling context sensitivity would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models with external tool integration or symbolic reasoning show improved robustness to irrelevant context. <a href="../results/extraction-result-23.html#e23.0" class="evidence-link">[e23.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-25.html#e25.0" class="evidence-link">[e25.0]</a> </li>
