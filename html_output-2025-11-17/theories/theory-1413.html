                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Self-Reflection as a Dynamic Equilibrium between Correction and Entrenchment</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative self-reflection in language models establishes a dynamic equilibrium between error correction (leading to improved answer quality) and entrenchment (the reinforcement of initial errors or biases). The direction and stability of this equilibrium are determined by the diversity, criticality, and external grounding of the reflection process. The theory predicts that, depending on these factors, self-reflection can either drive the model toward more accurate, calibrated answers or entrench it in its initial (possibly erroneous) beliefs.</p>
