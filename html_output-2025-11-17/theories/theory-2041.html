                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Quantitative Law Extraction via Literature-Pretrained LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs pretrained on large-scale scholarly literature can synthesize new, emergent quantitative laws by integrating distributed, fragmented, or implicit knowledge across many papers. The LLM's internal representations enable it to generalize and abstract over diverse findings, allowing the discovery of laws not explicitly stated in any single source.</p>

                <li>LLMs will outperform traditional meta-analyses in identifying emergent relationships across fragmented literature.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to formalize implicit relationships into explicit mathematical expressions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new classes of scientific laws by integrating knowledge across disciplines.</li>
                <li>LLMs could reveal meta-laws about the structure of scientific knowledge itself.</li>
                <li>The process may uncover hidden biases or gaps in the scientific literature.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot synthesize new quantitative laws from distributed evidence, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce explicit statements and fail to abstract implicit relationships, the theory's claims would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs hallucinate unsupported laws, the reliability of emergent law synthesis is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of conflicting or low-quality literature on the accuracy of emergent law synthesis is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The limitations of LLMs in handling highly technical or domain-specific quantitative data are not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior theory formalizes LLMs as synthesizers of emergent quantitative laws from literature.</p>
