                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Translation and Action Space Projection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents performing planning with external tools in partially observable text environments operate through a dual-process mechanism: (1) Semantic Translation - converting between high-level semantic representations of goals/states and low-level tool-specific operations and outputs, and (2) Action Space Projection - dynamically projecting the full action space onto task-relevant subspaces based on current belief states. The theory posits that effective planning requires agents to maintain a semantic belief state that is continuously updated through bidirectional translation of tool outputs, and that shortest-path planning is achieved by projecting actions onto semantically-relevant subspaces that reduce the effective branching factor. The translation process acts as a semantic compiler that maps abstract intentions to concrete tool invocations, while the projection process acts as a dynamic filter that constrains the planning search space based on belief-state relevance. This dual mechanism enables tractable planning in large action spaces while maintaining semantic coherence between high-level goals and low-level tool operations.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents maintain a semantic belief state B_s that represents their understanding of the environment in natural language or structured semantic form, which is distinct from raw observational history.</li>
                <li>For each external tool T, there exists a bidirectional semantic translation function: τ_T: (B_s, Intent) → ToolOperation that maps semantic intentions to tool-specific operations, and τ_T^(-1): ToolOutput → ΔB_s that extracts semantic content from tool outputs to update beliefs.</li>
                <li>The full action space A (including all possible tool invocations and parameters) is dynamically projected onto a relevant subspace A_r ⊆ A based on the current belief state: A_r = π(A, B_s), where π is the projection function that filters actions by semantic relevance.</li>
                <li>The projection function π prioritizes actions that are semantically aligned with the current goal and belief state, effectively reducing the branching factor for planning from |A| to |A_r| where |A_r| << |A| in most states.</li>
                <li>Shortest-path planning is achieved not in the full action space A, but in the projected space A_r, making planning tractable: path* = argmin_path∈Paths(A_r) |path|, where the path length is measured in the projected space.</li>
                <li>The quality of semantic translation directly impacts belief-state accuracy: more accurate translations τ_T^(-1) lead to more informative belief states B_s, which in turn enable better-informed projections π and shorter paths to goals.</li>
                <li>Tool outputs are translated into semantic belief updates through a process that extracts task-relevant information and discards tool-specific formatting details, maintaining semantic consistency across different tool formats.</li>
                <li>The projection function π is adaptive and changes as the belief state evolves: π_t(A, B_s^t) ≠ π_{t+1}(A, B_s^{t+1}), creating a dynamic planning landscape that narrows as more information is gathered.</li>
                <li>Agents that successfully use tools exhibit a semantic consistency property: the composition of translation and inverse translation preserves semantic content: τ_T^(-1)(execute(τ_T(B_s, i))) ≈ B_s + Δ_expected, where Δ_expected is the anticipated belief update.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of action space projection is proportional to the semantic specificity of the belief state: more specific beliefs enable more aggressive projection (smaller |A_r|) and faster planning, while vague beliefs require larger projected spaces.</li>
                <li>The semantic translation process operates hierarchically: high-level intentions are first decomposed into sub-intentions, which are then translated into specific tool operations, enabling complex multi-step tool use.</li>
                <li>Belief-state updates from tool outputs are weighted by the reliability and relevance of the tool: ΔB_s = α(T, B_s) · τ_T^(-1)(output), where α is a context-dependent weighting function.</li>
                <li>The projection function π incorporates both goal-relevance (how likely an action is to advance toward the goal) and information-gain (how much an action would reduce uncertainty in B_s), balancing exploitation and exploration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Language models can successfully learn to use external tools like calculators, search engines, and APIs through self-supervised learning, demonstrating that they can perform translation between semantic intent and tool operations without explicit supervision for each tool. </li>
    <li>Agents that interleave reasoning traces with action execution (combining thought, action, and observation steps) achieve better performance on knowledge-intensive and decision-making tasks, suggesting that explicit semantic processing of tool outputs improves planning. </li>
    <li>Browser-assisted question-answering systems that maintain explicit representations of information gathered from web searches outperform systems that don't track this information, indicating the importance of belief-state tracking for tool outputs. </li>
    <li>Agents using automatic multi-step reasoning with tools benefit from explicit reasoning steps that interpret and integrate tool outputs into their knowledge state, supporting the semantic translation mechanism. </li>
    <li>Foundation models can learn general tool-use capabilities that transfer across different tools and domains, suggesting that semantic translation operates at an abstract level rather than being tool-specific. </li>
    <li>Maintaining explicit belief states about environment properties and agent knowledge is fundamental to effective planning in partially observable stochastic domains, providing theoretical grounding for belief-state tracking. </li>
    <li>Epistemic planning approaches that explicitly represent and reason about belief states achieve better performance in partially observable environments than approaches that don't maintain such representations. </li>
    <li>Tree-of-thoughts approaches that explore multiple reasoning paths and prune irrelevant branches demonstrate that selective exploration of the action space (a form of projection) improves planning efficiency. </li>
    <li>Language models used as planners with world models demonstrate that reasoning about actions in semantic space before execution improves planning quality, supporting the action space projection mechanism. </li>
    <li>Grounding language in robotic affordances shows that semantic representations of actions must be connected to executable operations, analogous to the semantic translation from intentions to tool operations. </li>
    <li>Language models can perform zero-shot planning by translating high-level goals into sequences of actions, demonstrating semantic translation capabilities without task-specific training. </li>
    <li>Hierarchical action abstractions and temporal abstraction frameworks reduce the effective action space during planning by grouping low-level actions into higher-level options, providing precedent for action space reduction mechanisms. </li>
    <li>Using language as an abstraction layer in hierarchical reinforcement learning enables agents to operate at multiple levels of semantic granularity, supporting the concept of semantic projection. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents that explicitly maintain semantic belief states and perform structured translation of tool outputs will achieve 20-40% shorter solution paths than agents that treat tool outputs as raw text to be appended to context, particularly in multi-step planning tasks requiring 5+ tool invocations.</li>
                <li>In environments with 10+ available tools, agents that project the action space based on semantic relevance will scale sub-linearly in planning time with respect to the number of tools, while agents that consider all tools equally will scale linearly or worse.</li>
                <li>Training agents with intermediate supervision on semantic translation (e.g., requiring them to explicitly state what information was extracted from tool outputs) will improve their zero-shot performance on novel tool combinations by 15-30%.</li>
                <li>Agents will make 30-50% fewer redundant tool calls when they maintain accurate semantic belief states that explicitly track what information has already been obtained versus agents without explicit belief tracking.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of planning will scale with O(|A_r|^d) rather than O(|A|^d) where d is the planning depth, making belief-informed projection crucial for efficiency in domains where |A_r|/|A| < 0.3.</li>
                <li>Agents using semantic projection will show a characteristic pattern where the size of the projected action space |A_r| decreases monotonically as planning progresses and beliefs become more specific, until near the goal state.</li>
                <li>In tasks requiring information gathering before action, agents with explicit semantic translation will spend more initial steps on information-gathering tools (search, query) before switching to action tools, showing a two-phase planning pattern.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If semantic translation functions could be learned end-to-end through reinforcement learning rather than hand-crafted or prompted, would agents discover more efficient translation strategies that compress tool outputs more aggressively, potentially leading to 10x faster planning but with risks of information loss?</li>
                <li>In highly ambiguous partially observable environments where multiple hypotheses about the world state are plausible, could agents maintain a distribution over semantic belief states and perform parallel action space projections for each hypothesis, leading to more robust planning but potentially O(n) computational costs where n is the number of hypotheses?</li>
                <li>Would agents that learn to actively query tools specifically to reduce belief-state uncertainty (information-seeking behavior) discover fundamentally different planning strategies, such as front-loading all information gathering before any goal-directed actions, versus interleaving information gathering and goal pursuit?</li>
                <li>If the semantic translation process were made differentiable and trained jointly with the planning policy, could agents learn that certain 'lossy' translations that discard seemingly relevant information actually improve planning efficiency by reducing cognitive load, challenging assumptions about information preservation?</li>
                <li>Could adversarial perturbations to tool outputs that preserve surface semantics but alter deep semantic content (e.g., subtly incorrect search results) cause catastrophic failures in belief-state updates that propagate through the entire planning process, revealing fundamental brittleness of semantic translation approaches?</li>
                <li>If agents were given access to meta-tools that provide information about other tools' reliability and applicability, would they develop sophisticated tool-selection strategies that dramatically reduce the need for action space projection by pre-filtering tools at a meta-level?</li>
                <li>In multi-agent settings where tools are shared and tool outputs depend on other agents' actions, would agents develop theory-of-mind reasoning about other agents' belief states and tool usage, leading to emergent coordination strategies not predicted by single-agent theory?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents perform equally well when tool outputs are randomly shuffled, permuted, or have their semantic content replaced with random but grammatical text, this would suggest semantic translation is not actually being performed and agents are relying on surface patterns.</li>
                <li>If providing agents with explicit, structured belief-state representations (e.g., knowledge graphs updated after each tool use) does not improve performance over implicit context-based approaches that simply concatenate all observations, this would challenge the necessity of explicit semantic belief states.</li>
                <li>If agents show no preference for semantically relevant actions over random actions when the belief state is highly informative (e.g., after gathering comprehensive information), this would contradict the action space projection mechanism and suggest projection is not belief-dependent.</li>
                <li>If planning efficiency (measured in time or computational cost) does not improve as belief states become more specific and informative throughout a planning episode, this would challenge the claimed relationship between belief specificity and projection effectiveness.</li>
                <li>If agents cannot generalize to new tools that require similar semantic translations to known tools (e.g., a new search engine after training on a different search engine), this would suggest the translation process is not operating at a semantic level but rather at a surface pattern-matching level.</li>
                <li>If artificially constraining agents to use only a small random subset of actions (bypassing belief-based projection) does not significantly impair performance compared to belief-based projection, this would suggest that action space projection is not providing substantial value.</li>
                <li>If agents that are explicitly trained to ignore or not process tool outputs (treating them as noise) achieve similar planning performance to agents that perform semantic translation, this would fundamentally undermine the theory's core mechanism.</li>
                <li>If the correlation between belief-state specificity (measured by entropy or information content) and projected action space size |A_r| is weak or non-existent, this would contradict the predicted relationship between beliefs and projection.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how agents should handle contradictory information from multiple tool outputs, such as when two search engines return conflicting information, or how to resolve conflicts in belief-state updates through evidence reconciliation or source reliability assessment. </li>
    <li>The computational complexity of the projection function π itself is not characterized - computing optimal semantic projections may require reasoning over the entire action space, potentially making it as expensive as planning in the full space, creating a computational paradox. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how agents should handle tools with stochastic or non-deterministic outputs, where the same tool invocation may produce different results, requiring probabilistic belief updates rather than deterministic ones. </li>
    <li>Tools that have side effects on the environment (e.g., sending an email, making a purchase) are not covered by this theory, which focuses on information-gathering tools, yet such tools require different planning considerations around irreversibility and commitment. </li>
    <li>Multi-agent scenarios where tools are shared resources, have usage limits, or where tool outputs depend on other agents' actions are not covered by this single-agent theory. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how agents should handle tool failures, timeouts, or errors, and how such failures should update belief states (e.g., does a failed search mean the information doesn't exist, or just that the tool failed?). </li>
    <li>The learning dynamics of how agents acquire semantic translation functions are not specified - whether through few-shot learning, fine-tuning, or in-context learning, and how the quality of translation improves with experience. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle tools with complex input requirements (e.g., APIs requiring specific authentication, format, or multi-step setup) where the translation from intent to tool operation is non-trivial. </li>
