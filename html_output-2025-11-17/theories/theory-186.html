                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Task-Sensitive Fidelity Requirements Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about sim-to-real transfer for scientific discovery agents that specifies environment fidelity requirements and skill-transfer conditions from virtual labs to real robotics labs, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Sim-to-real transfer success depends on achieving adequate fidelity in a hierarchy of simulation aspects, where the required fidelity level for each aspect is determined by the task's sensitivity to that aspect and the policy's reliance on observations affected by that aspect. The hierarchy consists of: (1) Task-critical physics (contact dynamics for contact-rich tasks, projectile dynamics for ballistic tasks, actuator dynamics for high-frequency control), (2) Sensor modality representation (depth precision, semantic accuracy, or photorealistic appearance depending on task), (3) Temporal consistency (observation delays, action latencies, control frequencies), (4) Environmental stochasticity and perturbations, and (5) Non-critical parameters (masses, inertias for non-dynamic tasks). Successful transfer requires meeting fidelity thresholds only for aspects the task is sensitive to, and can be achieved through: (a) high-fidelity modeling of critical aspects, (b) domain randomization covering real-world variation, (c) abstraction to task-relevant representations, or (d) online adaptation. Critically, simulator artifacts that enable unrealistic behaviors (e.g., sliding through obstacles, interpenetration) must be eliminated even if they don't directly affect nominal task execution.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For contact-rich manipulation, contact dynamics fidelity (friction coefficients, contact stiffness, penetration handling) is the highest-priority requirement. Errors >20% in friction or missing contact modeling cause transfer failure.</li>
                <li>For locomotion, actuator dynamics (torque limits, saturation curves, delays, motor friction) must be modeled explicitly. Omission causes complete transfer failure regardless of other fidelity aspects.</li>
                <li>For vision-based tasks, successful transfer requires ONE of: (a) photorealistic rendering with domain randomization, (b) semantic/geometric abstraction (>85% accuracy), or (c) high-precision depth sensing (industrial-grade). Raw non-photorealistic pixels without abstraction or randomization fail to transfer.</li>
                <li>Temporal fidelity (action delays, observation latencies, control frequencies) must be modeled when control frequency is >10 Hz or when the task involves dynamic interactions. Errors >50ms in latency modeling cause degradation in high-frequency tasks.</li>
                <li>Mass and inertia parameters need only ~20-30% accuracy for quasi-static manipulation tasks, but friction and contact stiffness require <20% error for contact-rich tasks.</li>
                <li>Visual domain randomization can compensate for lack of photorealism if randomization covers the real-world distribution, but requires extensive variation (thousands of textures, lighting conditions).</li>
                <li>Simulator artifacts that enable unrealistic behaviors (sliding exploits, interpenetration, collision shortcuts) must be eliminated even if they don't affect nominal task metrics, as they allow policies to learn non-transferable strategies.</li>
                <li>The minimum fidelity threshold for any aspect is determined by: (task sensitivity to that aspect) × (policy reliance on observations affected by that aspect) × (magnitude of sim-real discrepancy).</li>
                <li>Deformable object manipulation requires either: (a) high-fidelity continuum mechanics (FEM), (b) accurate discrete approximations (articulated chains with identified stiffness/damping), or (c) learned residual models trained on real data.</li>
                <li>For tasks with multimodal parameter sensitivity (e.g., friction AND restitution), achieving adequate fidelity in ALL sensitive parameters is necessary; high fidelity in one cannot compensate for poor fidelity in another task-critical parameter.</li>
                <li>Observation abstraction (feature tracks, semantic masks, affordances) can reduce fidelity requirements for visual appearance by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to raw pixel inputs.</li>
                <li>Online adaptation can compensate for moderate fidelity errors (10-30%) in non-critical parameters but cannot overcome poor fidelity in task-critical aspects.</li>
                <li>Sensor modality choice affects fidelity requirements: depth-based policies require high-precision sensors OR accurate depth simulation, while RGB-based policies require photorealism OR domain randomization OR abstraction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Contact-rich manipulation tasks (peg-in-hole, assembly, wiping, drawer opening) require high-fidelity contact dynamics, friction modeling, and penetration handling. System identification of friction, stiffness, and damping parameters substantially reduces sim-to-real gap. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1654.html#e1654.0" class="evidence-link">[e1654.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1654.html#e1654.2" class="evidence-link">[e1654.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1788.html#e1788.0" class="evidence-link">[e1788.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1681.html#e1681.0" class="evidence-link">[e1681.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1681.html#e1681.2" class="evidence-link">[e1681.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1650.html#e1650.0" class="evidence-link">[e1650.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1657.html#e1657.2" class="evidence-link">[e1657.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1672.html#e1672.0" class="evidence-link">[e1672.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Dexterous in-hand manipulation requires accurate multi-contact dynamics, friction coefficients, and contact force modeling. Physics randomization and modeling of unmodeled effects are critical for transfer. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1651.html#e1651.0" class="evidence-link">[e1651.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1791.html#e1791.0" class="evidence-link">[e1791.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1791.html#e1791.1" class="evidence-link">[e1791.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1783.html#e1783.1" class="evidence-link">[e1783.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Visual navigation tasks can succeed with photorealistic rendering even when physics is approximate, but require either accurate depth sensing (with high-precision sensors), semantic segmentation (>85% accuracy), or heavy visual domain randomization with RGB. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1802.html#e1802.0" class="evidence-link">[e1802.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1768.html#e1768.0" class="evidence-link">[e1768.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1665.html#e1665.2" class="evidence-link">[e1665.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1674.html#e1674.0" class="evidence-link">[e1674.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1674.html#e1674.1" class="evidence-link">[e1674.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1813.html#e1813.1" class="evidence-link">[e1813.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Actuator dynamics fidelity (DC motor models, torque saturation curves, PWM-to-torque mapping, delays) is critical for locomotion and high-frequency control. Omission causes complete transfer failure for quadruped and bipedal locomotion. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1780.html#e1780.0" class="evidence-link">[e1780.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1643.html#e1643.1" class="evidence-link">[e1643.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1643.html#e1643.2" class="evidence-link">[e1643.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1660.html#e1660.0" class="evidence-link">[e1660.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1660.html#e1660.2" class="evidence-link">[e1660.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Soft robotics and deformable object manipulation require high-fidelity deformation modeling (FEM-level for soft bodies, articulated models for cables) but can use learned residuals or latent projections to bridge remaining gaps. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1775.html#e1775.0" class="evidence-link">[e1775.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1835.html#e1835.0" class="evidence-link">[e1835.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1644.html#e1644.2" class="evidence-link">[e1644.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1764.html#e1764.0" class="evidence-link">[e1764.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1811.html#e1811.0" class="evidence-link">[e1811.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1799.html#e1799.0" class="evidence-link">[e1799.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Depth-only transfer requires high-precision industrial-grade sensors (25-500 μm accuracy) while RGB with domain randomization works with commodity sensors. Sensor quality matters more than simulation fidelity for some modalities. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1674.html#e1674.0" class="evidence-link">[e1674.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1674.html#e1674.1" class="evidence-link">[e1674.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Observation abstraction (feature tracks, semantic segmentation, affordances) can reduce fidelity requirements for visual appearance. Quadrotor acrobatics succeeded with feature-track abstraction despite visual domain gap. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1790.html#e1790.0" class="evidence-link">[e1790.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1802.html#e1802.0" class="evidence-link">[e1802.0]</a> </li>
    <li>System identification of key task-critical parameters (gravity, mass, damping, friction, stiffness) substantially reduces sim-to-real gap when those parameters affect task execution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1654.html#e1654.0" class="evidence-link">[e1654.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1654.html#e1654.2" class="evidence-link">[e1654.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1764.html#e1764.0" class="evidence-link">[e1764.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1814.html#e1814.0" class="evidence-link">[e1814.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1648.html#e1648.0" class="evidence-link">[e1648.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1795.html#e1795.0" class="evidence-link">[e1795.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Temporal aspects (action delays, observation latencies, control frequencies) must be modeled accurately for high-frequency control and dynamic tasks. Including action history in observations helps for non-Markovian dynamics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1780.html#e1780.0" class="evidence-link">[e1780.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1641.html#e1641.0" class="evidence-link">[e1641.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1790.html#e1790.0" class="evidence-link">[e1790.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Simulator artifacts that enable unrealistic behaviors (sliding through obstacles, mesh interpenetration, collision exploits) must be eliminated as they allow policies to learn non-transferable strategies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1633.html#e1633.1" class="evidence-link">[e1633.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1681.html#e1681.2" class="evidence-link">[e1681.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-specific parameter sensitivity varies dramatically. Some tasks are highly sensitive to specific parameters (friction for sliding, restitution for bouncing, buoyancy for floating robots) while tolerating large errors in others. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1785.html#e1785.1" class="evidence-link">[e1785.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1785.html#e1785.2" class="evidence-link">[e1785.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1678.html#e1678.1" class="evidence-link">[e1678.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1799.html#e1799.0" class="evidence-link">[e1799.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Tactile sensing requires either high-fidelity physics-based simulation (FEM with accurate material properties) OR learned latent projections from physics to sensor space. Pure geometric rendering is insufficient. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1835.html#e1835.0" class="evidence-link">[e1835.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1823.html#e1823.1" class="evidence-link">[e1823.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1644.html#e1644.2" class="evidence-link">[e1644.2]</a> </li>
    <li>For locomotion on varied terrain or with perturbations, dynamics randomization and explicit perturbation training improve robustness more than increasing nominal fidelity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1780.html#e1780.0" class="evidence-link">[e1780.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1660.html#e1660.0" class="evidence-link">[e1660.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1798.html#e1798.0" class="evidence-link">[e1798.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Kinematic properties (link lengths, joint limits, workspace geometry) transfer more readily than dynamic properties (masses, inertias, friction). Trajectories learned in sim often transfer well even when compliance parameters do not. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1650.html#e1650.0" class="evidence-link">[e1650.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1764.html#e1764.0" class="evidence-link">[e1764.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-scale or hierarchical representations (coarse-to-fine maps, multi-resolution observations) can reduce sensitivity to fine-grained fidelity errors. <a href="../results/extraction-result-1641.html#e1641.0" class="evidence-link">[e1641.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1665.html#e1665.2" class="evidence-link">[e1665.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A pick-and-place task with minimal contact forces (<5N) will transfer successfully with approximate contact modeling (±50% friction error) but require accurate kinematics (±1cm position error) and visual localization (±2cm).</li>
                <li>A ball-catching task will require accurate projectile dynamics (gravity within 5%, air resistance within 20%) but can tolerate ±50% errors in gripper contact modeling at the catch point.</li>
                <li>A door-opening task will require accurate hinge friction (±15%) and handle geometry (±5mm) but can tolerate ±30% errors in link masses and ±50% errors in non-contact link inertias.</li>
                <li>Visual servoing tasks will transfer with semantic segmentation even when RGB appearance differs dramatically, as long as segmentation accuracy is >85% and update frequency matches control frequency.</li>
                <li>A pushing task on a flat surface will require accurate planar friction (±10%) but can tolerate ±40% errors in object mass and ±60% errors in vertical friction components.</li>
                <li>Bipedal walking will transfer with accurate actuator models (torque curves within 10%) even if foot-ground contact model is approximate (±30% friction), as long as the robot doesn't slip.</li>
                <li>Aerial navigation with visual odometry will transfer with feature-track abstraction even when lighting changes by 200%, as long as feature detection rate stays >80%.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether multi-modal tasks requiring both precise contact AND visual precision can achieve transfer with moderate fidelity (50-70% of ideal) in both domains, or require high fidelity (>90%) in at least one domain.</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal 'fidelity budget' where high fidelity in one aspect can compensate for low fidelity in another, or if each task-critical aspect has independent minimum thresholds that cannot be traded off.</li>
                <li>Whether learned world models or dynamics predictors can effectively replace high-fidelity simulation for aspects that are difficult to model accurately (e.g., soft-body deformation, fluid dynamics, complex friction), and what accuracy threshold the learned model must achieve.</li>
                <li>Whether the fidelity hierarchy changes fundamentally when using foundation models or large-scale pretraining versus task-specific training from scratch, and whether pretrained representations reduce fidelity requirements.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist tasks where increasing fidelity in non-critical aspects actually harms transfer by enabling overfitting or exploitation of simulator-specific behaviors.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal fidelity allocation strategy differs between offline learning (where all training is in sim) versus online adaptation (where real-world data is available during deployment).</li>
                <li>Whether temporal consistency in visual rendering (frame-to-frame coherence) is a separate fidelity dimension or can be subsumed under visual appearance fidelity.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-robot or human-robot interaction scenarios require modeling of other agents' behaviors as a separate fidelity dimension, and at what accuracy threshold.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a contact-rich task that transfers successfully with >50% error in friction coefficients without online adaptation would challenge the contact-fidelity requirement and suggest the task is not truly contact-sensitive.</li>
                <li>Finding a locomotion task that transfers without explicit actuator modeling (using only kinematic or simplified dynamics) would challenge the actuator-dynamics requirement and suggest the task operates in a quasi-static regime.</li>
                <li>Finding a vision-based task that transfers with raw non-photorealistic pixels without abstraction, randomization, or learned adaptation would challenge the visual-fidelity requirement and suggest the task relies on geometry rather than appearance.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that increasing fidelity in task-critical aspects (e.g., improving contact model from 50% to 90% accuracy) does NOT improve transfer would challenge the hierarchical sensitivity principle.</li>
                <li>Finding a task where high fidelity in a non-critical aspect (e.g., accurate link inertias for a quasi-static task) improves transfer more than moderate fidelity in a critical aspect would challenge the hierarchy ordering.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that eliminating simulator artifacts (e.g., fixing sliding exploits) reduces transfer success would challenge the artifact-elimination principle and suggest the artifacts were actually helping.</li>
                <li>Finding a deformable object task that transfers with purely kinematic (non-physics) simulation would challenge the deformation-fidelity requirement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

The hierarchy consists of: (1) Task-critical physics (contact dynamics for contact-rich tasks, projectile dynamics for ballistic tasks, actuator dynamics for high-frequency control), (2) Sensor modality representation (depth precision, semantic accuracy, or photorealistic appearance depending on task), (3) Temporal consistency (observation delays, action latencies, control frequencies), (4) Environmental stochasticity and perturbations, and (5) Non-critical parameters (masses, inertias for non-dynamic tasks). Successful transfer requires meeting fidelity thresholds only for aspects the task is sensitive to, and can be achieved through: (a) high-fidelity modeling of critical aspects, (b) domain randomization covering real-world variation, (c) abstraction to task-relevant representations, or (d) online adaptation. Critically, simulator artifacts that enable unrealistic behaviors (e.g., sliding through obstacles, interpenetration) must be eliminated even if they don't directly affect nominal task execution.",
