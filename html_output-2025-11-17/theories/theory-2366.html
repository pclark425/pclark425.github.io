                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bidirectional Platelet-CNS Pathology Feedback Loop in Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that not only do platelet tau/Aβ signatures reflect CNS pathology, but that platelets themselves may actively participate in the propagation or modulation of neurodegenerative processes. Platelets can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) under certain conditions, release pro-inflammatory and amyloidogenic factors, and interact with cerebral endothelium, thus creating a feedback loop where peripheral and central pathologies reinforce each other.</p>

                <li>Platelet signatures may predict the onset of neuroinflammation before CNS pathology is detectable by imaging.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reducing platelet activation does not alter CNS pathology in AD models, the feedback loop is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If platelet-derived Aβ/tau cannot cross the BBB or seed CNS pathology, the bidirectional model is weakened.</li>
                <li>If systemic inflammation does not correlate with platelet or CNS pathology, the amplification law is challenged.</li>

    <li>Some AD patients do not show increased platelet activation or systemic inflammation. </li>
