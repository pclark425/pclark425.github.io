                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1511</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Relational Network Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in the brain is functionally represented as a dynamic network of multimodal nodes, where each node encodes a concept as a set of relations among sensory, motor, affective, and abstract features. The network structure allows for flexible composition, context-dependent activation, and integration of new information. Concepts are not stored as static symbols or images, but as distributed patterns of relations that can be reconfigured based on task demands and context.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially manipulating the relational structure (e.g., via TMS) will alter conceptual retrieval in predictable ways.</li>
                <li>Training on tasks requiring rapid reconfiguration of conceptual relations will enhance context-sensitive conceptual processing.</li>
                <li>Novel concepts with no prior multimodal associations will initially show less distributed activation, but become more distributed with learning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts are retrieved as static, amodal symbols regardless of context, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If cross-modal priming does not occur for multimodal concepts, the multimodal node law is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If context does not modulate the pattern of conceptual activation, the relational reconfiguration law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the mechanism for initial formation of multimodal nodes for novel concepts. </li>
    <li>The role of language in shaping the relational network is not explicitly addressed. </li>
