                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Representation and Application Alignment Theory for LLM Chemical Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs capable of synthesizing novel chemicals for specific applications do so by constructing and manipulating hierarchical representations of chemical knowledge, ranging from atomic-level features to functional group patterns and application-level properties. The alignment between these hierarchical representations and the target application's requirements determines the LLM's success in generating useful molecules. Robustness is achieved when the model can maintain this alignment across diverse chemical and application spaces.</p>
