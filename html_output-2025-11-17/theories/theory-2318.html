                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2318</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory (Regulatory Network Emphasis)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory extends the flux concept by positing that the regulation of biomarker fluxes between CNS and periphery is governed by a complex, adaptive network of molecular, cellular, and physiological feedback loops. These include BBB transporters, glymphatic/lymphatic flow, immune signaling, and metabolic state, all of which dynamically modulate both the direction and magnitude of biomarker movement. Disruption of this regulatory network, rather than any single pathway, is proposed as a root cause of both AD pathogenesis and the variability in biomarker-based detection.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Targeted modulation of specific feedback loops (e.g., blocking inflammatory amplification) will halt or reverse AD progression.</li>
                <li>Systems-level network modeling will predict individual risk and biomarker profiles more accurately than single-pathway models.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If restoring regulatory network elements (e.g., improving glymphatic flow) does not affect biomarker flux or AD progression, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If individuals with multiple regulatory disruptions do not show increased flux dysregulation or AD risk, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Cases where AD develops in the absence of detectable regulatory network disruption. </li>
