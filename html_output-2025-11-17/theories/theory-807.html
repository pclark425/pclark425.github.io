                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance when they dynamically allocate, update, and prune memory contents based on task demands, context, and feedback. Rather than static or fixed memory, agents benefit from adaptive memory management strategies that prioritize relevant information and minimize interference.</p>
