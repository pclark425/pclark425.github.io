                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The brain dynamically adjusts the dimensionality of neural population codes to optimize the trade-off between interference and generalization when learning multiple tasks. For tasks requiring independent solutions (different rules for same stimuli), the brain expands representations into high-dimensional space and then partitions them into orthogonal low-dimensional subspaces, with each task occupying its own subspace. This compression of task-irrelevant dimensions and separation of task-relevant dimensions minimizes interference. Conversely, for tasks sharing common structure, the brain maintains mixed selectivity and high-dimensional codes that multiplex task variables, enabling flexible linear readout and positive transfer. The choice between partitioning (low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces) and multiplexing (high-dimensional mixed codes) is determined by task statistics, learning schedule, and the degree of shared structure. Unsupervised learning mechanisms (Hebbian plasticity) discover the latent structure and determine the appropriate dimensionality, while supervised mechanisms fine-tune readouts. This adaptive dimensionality strategy allows the brain to flexibly allocate representational resources based on task demands.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The brain adaptively adjusts representational dimensionality based on task structure: low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces for independent tasks, high-dimensional mixed codes for tasks with shared structure</li>
                <li>Task-irrelevant dimensions are compressed while task-relevant dimensions are preserved and either separated (for independent tasks) or multiplexed (for related tasks)</li>
                <li>Unsupervised Hebbian learning mechanisms discover latent task structure and determine appropriate dimensionality through principal component analysis-like operations</li>
                <li>The degree of dimensionality expansion or compression is proportional to the amount of shared vs. independent structure across tasks</li>
                <li>Blocked learning promotes low-dimensional partitioning by allowing unsupervised mechanisms to discover independent task structure, while interleaved learning may promote mixed selectivity by exposing shared structure</li>
                <li>High-dimensional mixed selectivity enables flexible linear readout of many task mappings, supporting rapid learning of new tasks that recombine existing features</li>
                <li>Low-dimensional orthogonal partitioning minimizes interference but may limit generalization, while high-dimensional multiplexing enables generalization but may increase interference</li>
                <li>Prefrontal and parietal cortices implement adaptive dimensionality adjustments for cognitive control</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>fMRI shows orthogonal low-dimensional task representations with compression of irrelevant dimensions and preservation of relevant dimensions on separate neural planes <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Mixed selectivity in prefrontal cortex produces high-dimensional population codes that can represent many task combinations and support flexible readout <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.1" class="evidence-link">[e228.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Hebbian mechanisms (Oja's rule) can perform dimensionality reduction (PCA) and orthogonalize independent inputs while grouping shared features <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.8" class="evidence-link">[e228.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational models show that unsupervised pretraining on latent structure facilitates subsequent supervised learning and transfer <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-specific recruitment of neurons (partitioning) vs. mixed selectivity represent different points on the dimensionality spectrum <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.2" class="evidence-link">[e228.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.3" class="evidence-link">[e228.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.1" class="evidence-link">[e228.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Tasks with partial shared structure should produce intermediate dimensionality: higher than fully partitioned but lower than fully mixed, with shared dimensions multiplexed and independent dimensions partitioned</li>
                <li>The dimensionality of neural population codes (measured via participation ratio or other metrics) should predict the degree of transfer between tasks: higher dimensionality predicts more transfer</li>
                <li>Unsupervised pretraining that exposes task structure should reduce the dimensionality needed for subsequent supervised learning and improve sample efficiency</li>
                <li>Brain regions earlier in processing hierarchies (e.g., sensory cortex) should show higher dimensionality and more mixed selectivity, while later regions (e.g., motor cortex) should show lower dimensionality and more partitioning</li>
                <li>Individual differences in the ability to adaptively adjust dimensionality should predict differences in multi-task learning ability</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially constraining neural populations to low-dimensional representations might improve learning of independent tasks but impair learning of related tasks—the optimal dimensionality for natural task distributions is unknown</li>
                <li>There might be a critical period or learning phase during which dimensionality is determined; interventions during this period might have outsized effects on final task performance and transfer</li>
                <li>The brain might use different dimensionality strategies in different regions simultaneously (e.g., high-dimensional in PFC, low-dimensional in parietal cortex), and the coordination between these strategies is unknown</li>
                <li>Extreme task diversity might require such high dimensionality that capacity limits are reached, potentially explaining limits on cognitive control and working memory</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neural dimensionality does not differ between independent and related tasks, this would challenge the adaptive dimensionality hypothesis</li>
                <li>If artificially imposing high-dimensional mixed codes on independent tasks does not increase interference, this would question the functional importance of dimensionality for interference</li>
                <li>If unsupervised learning mechanisms are blocked but appropriate dimensionality still emerges, this would challenge the role of unsupervised learning in discovering task structure</li>
                <li>If dimensionality does not predict transfer or generalization at the individual subject or trial level, this would question the functional relevance of dimensionality</li>
                <li>If blocked and interleaved training produce identical dimensionality despite different behavioral outcomes, this would challenge the link between learning schedule, dimensionality, and interference</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the exact neural mechanisms that implement dimensionality adjustments or how the brain 'decides' on appropriate dimensionality </li>
    <li>The relationship between structural allocation (dendritic spines on different branches) and functional dimensionality is not explained <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.4" class="evidence-link">[e228.4]</a> </li>
    <li>How hippocampal systems interact with cortical dimensionality adjustments during consolidation is not addressed <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.5" class="evidence-link">[e228.5]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for catastrophic forgetting in artificial neural networks under blocked training, which suggests dimensionality alone is insufficient <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Capacity limits on dimensionality and how they relate to neural population size are not specified </li>
