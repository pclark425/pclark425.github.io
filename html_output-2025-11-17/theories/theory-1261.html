                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1261</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Compositional Alignment Theory for Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that maximally aligns the compositional structure of the graph with the compositional structure of the text, such that each graph substructure (e.g., subgraph, motif, or path) is mapped to a distinct, compositional text segment. This alignment enables language models to learn modular, generalizable reasoning over graph structures and supports transfer to novel graphs and tasks.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Compositional alignment will enable language models to perform recursive reasoning over arbitrarily nested graph structures.</li>
                <li>Isomorphic subgraph-text mapping will allow LMs to generalize to unseen graph schemas with minimal adaptation.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If non-compositional representations yield similar generalization as compositional ones, the theory would be challenged.</li>
