                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1828</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Specialization and Fine-Tuning Theory of Probabilistic Calibration in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the probabilistic calibration of LLMs for forecasting scientific discoveries is determined by the alignment between the statistical properties of the fine-tuning corpus and the real-world generative processes of scientific advancement. The theory asserts that LLMs achieve accurate probability estimates when their internal uncertainty representations are shaped by exposure to realistic distributions of research outcomes, including both successful and failed discovery attempts, and that calibration degrades when the training data is biased or unrepresentative.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs trained on biased corpora do not show overestimation of discovery likelihood, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If calibration does not improve with the inclusion of negative results, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on realistic outcome distributions still produce poorly calibrated probability estimates, the theory would be undermined.</li>

    <li>The impact of temporal changes in research culture (e.g., shifts in publication practices) on LLM calibration is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of LLM architecture and pretraining objectives in calibration is not considered. </li>
