                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Salience-Driven Memory Law for Dialogue Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the salience of contextual cues in ongoing dialogue determines both which memories are consolidated and how frequently they are recalled. Agents that prioritize salient cues—such as user intent, emotional tone, or task-critical information—will more effectively personalize responses and solve tasks, as their memory systems are tuned to the most relevant aspects of interaction.</p>
