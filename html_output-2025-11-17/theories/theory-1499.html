                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Precision-Weighted Selection Mechanism for Conceptual Format Arbitration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the brain arbitrates between different representational formats (e.g., sensory, motor, symbolic, schematic) for conceptual knowledge by assigning a precision weight to each format based on its expected reliability and task relevance. The format(s) with the highest precision weight are preferentially selected for active use in conceptual processing, and this arbitration is dynamic, context-sensitive, and can operate at multiple levels of abstraction.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a task manipulates the reliability of a given representational format (e.g., adding noise to visual input), participants will shift to formats with higher precision (e.g., verbal or schematic).</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will show increased activation in brain regions associated with the selected format as its precision weight increases.</li>
                <li>Training that increases the precision of a specific format (e.g., perceptual learning) will increase its selection for relevant conceptual tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially boosting the perceived precision of a less-reliable format (e.g., via neurofeedback) will cause maladaptive format selection and impair performance.</li>
                <li>Disorders that disrupt precision estimation (e.g., schizophrenia) will show abnormal format arbitration patterns in conceptual tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If participants do not shift representational formats when precision is manipulated, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If neuroimaging does not show predicted changes in format-specific brain regions with changes in precision, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the neural or computational mechanisms by which precision weights are computed for abstract or symbolic formats. </li>
    <li>It does not address how multiple formats may be co-activated or integrated rather than exclusively selected. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and extends known mechanisms from perception/action to the domain of conceptual format selection, which is not previously formalized.</p>
