                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-optimization, wherein each cycle of generate-then-reflect enables the model to identify, evaluate, and correct deficiencies in its prior outputs. The process leverages the model's internal representations and learned heuristics to progressively refine responses, with each iteration acting as a feedback loop that enhances both factual accuracy and alignment with task requirements.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is allowed to perform more generate-then-reflect cycles, answer quality will improve up to a plateau.</li>
                <li>Reflection cycles that fail to identify new deficiencies will not further improve output quality.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In highly complex or ambiguous tasks, the number of cycles required for convergence may increase or fail to plateau.</li>
                <li>If models are trained with explicit feedback on reflection quality, convergence may accelerate or reach higher quality levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative reflection does not improve answer quality, the feedback loop hypothesis would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If error rates do not decrease with additional reflection cycles, the convergence law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection introduces new errors or hallucinations not present in the original output. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work formalizes these mechanisms as general laws, though related empirical findings exist.</p>
