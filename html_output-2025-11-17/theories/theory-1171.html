                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic-Constraint Guided Chemical Synthesis Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by leveraging their ability to encode and manipulate semantic constraints expressed in natural language. The LLM translates application requirements into chemical design constraints, generates candidate molecules that satisfy these constraints, and uses semantic reasoning to ensure novelty, feasibility, and application relevance.</p>
