                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1854</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Signal Extraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by extracting and aggregating latent signals embedded in the scientific literature, such as citation patterns, argumentation structures, and the frequency of precursor hypotheses. The LLM's ability to synthesize these signals into calibrated probability estimates depends on the richness and diversity of such signals in its training data, as well as its capacity to model complex, multi-step scientific reasoning.</p>
