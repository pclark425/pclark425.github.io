                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by aligning their internal knowledge representations with the epistemic state of the scientific community, as reflected in their training data and prompt context. The LLM's probabilistic outputs are a function of the density, recency, and consensus of scientific discourse in their training data, and can be calibrated to real-world likelihoods under certain conditions.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs trained on recent scientific literature tend to reflect current scientific consensus and trends in their outputs. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs' predictions about near-future events are more accurate when the events are widely discussed in recent literature. </li>
    <li>LLMs' outputs are sensitive to the prevalence and recency of topics in their training data, as shown in multiple benchmarking studies. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to work on LLMs' knowledge representation, this law formalizes the alignment between LLM outputs and the epistemic state of science, which is not previously articulated as a predictive law.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that LLMs reflect the distribution of their training data and can echo scientific consensus.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit connection between the epistemic state of the scientific community and the calibration of LLM probability estimates for future discoveries is novel.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs with more recent training data provide more accurate predictions about near-future events. </li>
    <li>Calibration studies show that LLMs' outputs degrade as their training data becomes outdated. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the effect of data recency is acknowledged, its formalization as a law for probability calibration in scientific discovery prediction is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that LLMs' knowledge is limited by their training data cutoff.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law connecting data recency to calibration of probability estimates for future discoveries is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is trained on scientific literature up to 2024, it will assign higher probabilities to discoveries that are actively discussed in 2023-2024.</li>
                <li>LLMs will underestimate the probability of discoveries in fields with sparse or outdated literature in their training data.</li>
                <li>Updating an LLM's training data with the latest scientific discourse will improve its calibration for predicting imminent discoveries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is fine-tuned on a niche but rapidly advancing field, it may outperform domain experts in predicting imminent discoveries.</li>
                <li>LLMs trained on simulated or synthetic scientific discourse may develop novel probability calibration behaviors not seen in models trained on real data.</li>
                <li>LLMs exposed to conflicting or polarized scientific discourse may produce probability estimates that reflect the epistemic uncertainty of the field.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM assigns high probability to a discovery in a field with little or no recent discourse, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If updating the training data with recent literature does not improve calibration of probability estimates, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates are insensitive to the density or recency of scientific discourse in their training data, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may be influenced by non-scientific sources or biases in their training data, which are not accounted for in this theory. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address the impact of LLM architecture or prompt engineering on probability calibration. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
