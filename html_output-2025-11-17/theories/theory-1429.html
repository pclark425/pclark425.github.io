                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-alignment, where each reflection step acts as a meta-cognitive filter that re-weights, re-contextualizes, and re-generates outputs based on internalized error signals and emergent self-evaluation heuristics. The process is not merely a re-generation, but a dynamic, context-sensitive adjustment of the model's internal representations and output distributions, leading to a convergence toward higher-quality, more coherent, and more accurate answers.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that models using 'generate-then-reflect' pipelines produce more accurate and self-consistent answers than single-pass models. </li>
    <li>Reflection steps often explicitly identify and correct prior mistakes, indicating an internal error signal is being used. </li>
    <li>Self-refinement approaches (e.g., Self-Refine, STaR) demonstrate that models can improve their own outputs by critiquing and revising them. </li>
    <li>Analysis of model activations shows changes in internal representations after reflection steps. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to self-consistency and chain-of-thought prompting, this law introduces a novel mechanism of meta-cognitive error signaling and internal adjustment.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Existing work recognizes that reflection can improve model outputs, and that models can be prompted to critique or revise their own answers.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the existence of an emergent, internal error signal and its role in dynamically adjusting internal representations and output distributions, not just surface-level re-generation.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>If reflection steps are adversarially perturbed (e.g., by introducing misleading self-critiques), the model's convergence may be disrupted or lead to lower-quality answers.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve or even degrades with additional reflection cycles, the theory's convergence law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If models do not adjust their internal representations or output distributions after reflection, the meta-cognitive error signal law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If reflection steps do not identify or correct errors, the theory's core mechanism is undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
