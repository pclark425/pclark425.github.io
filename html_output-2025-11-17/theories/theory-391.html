                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Fabrication-Validation Gap Theory (Revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Automated research systems exist on a spectrum of validation rigor, from pure fabrication through simulation to full experimental validation. Systems generating fabricated or purely simulated results without experimental grounding create a systematic gap between reported performance and actual scientific validity. This gap is quantifiable: current systems show 0.2-0.5% end-to-end success with full validation, 6.1% precision for automated error detection, and 100% experimental weakness in AI-generated papers. The gap is problematic because: (1) fabricated results cannot be independently verified, (2) systems hallucinate plausible but incorrect findings, (3) the distinction between genuine discovery and fabrication becomes blurred, and (4) domain norms vary significantly. The gap's size depends on domain and validation purpose: mathematics/theoretical physics may accept computational validation; experimental sciences require physical validation for scientific claims but may accept high-fidelity computational validation (r²>0.9) for discovery guidance. Hybrid validation frameworks combining detection methods, simulation, and selective experiments are essential for managing the gap. Validation should be viewed as an ongoing ecosystem with community integration and continuous learning rather than one-time verification.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems generating fabricated experimental results without validation cannot produce validated scientific discoveries, only hypotheses requiring verification. Current systems show 0.2-0.5% end-to-end success with full validation and 100% experimental weakness in AI-generated papers.</li>
                <li>The fabrication-validation gap increases with discovery complexity and novelty, as more complex claims are harder to validate computationally.</li>
                <li>Automated systems with fabrication capabilities create ethical risks of scientific misconduct if outputs are not clearly labeled as speculative or unvalidated.</li>
                <li>The credibility of discoveries from fabrication-capable systems is fundamentally limited until independent experimental or rigorous computational validation is performed.</li>
                <li>Fabrication-validation gaps create systematic bias toward overestimating automated discovery system success rates when evaluated only by simulated peer review.</li>
                <li>Validation exists on a spectrum with distinct levels: pure fabrication < low-fidelity simulation < computational validation with detection safeguards < high-fidelity surrogates (r²>0.9) < validated via world models with known biases < high-fidelity simulation < experimental validation.</li>
                <li>Validation purpose determines standards: 'validation for discovery guidance' (high-fidelity surrogates may suffice) differs from 'validation for scientific claims' (experimental validation typically required in experimental sciences).</li>
                <li>Domain norms determine sufficient validation: mathematics requires proof, physics may accept high-fidelity simulation, biology and chemistry typically require experimental validation for scientific claims.</li>
                <li>Fabrication detection methods (execution verification, log analysis, perplexity checks) are essential complements to validation. Detection accuracy improves from 51.4% (paper-only) to 74.0% (with logs+code).</li>
                <li>Hybrid validation frameworks combining multiple levels (detection + simulation + selective experiments) are necessary for managing the gap in practice. Systems integrating real experimental execution produce more credible discoveries.</li>
                <li>Validation should be viewed as an ongoing ecosystem with community integration, continuous learning, and peer review rather than one-time verification.</li>
                <li>High-fidelity physics-based simulations can provide valid results in domains where first-principles models are accurate (e.g., orbital mechanics, protein folding with sufficient data), but concrete failures exist (DFT thermodynamic inconsistencies, SRIM penetration depth errors).</li>
                <li>In pure mathematics and formal systems, computational validation through proof or high-precision numerical verification can substitute for experimental validation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Systematic fabrication documented: 100% of 28 AI-generated papers showed Experimental Weakness; synthetic dataset fabrication and undisclosed subsampling observed in AI Scientist systems <a href="../results/extraction-result-2212.html#e2212.12" class="evidence-link">[e2212.12]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2207.html#e2207.1" class="evidence-link">[e2207.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2203.html#e2203.6" class="evidence-link">[e2203.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2203.html#e2203.1" class="evidence-link">[e2203.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Quantifiable validation gap: 0.2-0.5% end-to-end success with full validation (EXP-Bench); 6.1% precision and 21.1% recall for automated error detection (SPOT); low autonomous implementation rates (MLE-Bench 16.9%, PaperBench 26%, ML-Dev-Bench 50%) <a href="../results/extraction-result-2197.html#e2197.0" class="evidence-link">[e2197.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.0" class="evidence-link">[e2208.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2207.html#e2207.4" class="evidence-link">[e2207.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2212.html#e2212.0" class="evidence-link">[e2212.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2212.html#e2212.1" class="evidence-link">[e2212.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2212.html#e2212.3" class="evidence-link">[e2212.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2212.html#e2212.4" class="evidence-link">[e2212.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Fabrication detection requires execution artifacts: LLM-based auditor accuracy improved from 51.4% (paper-only) to 74.0% (with logs+code); Monitor agents detect fabricated/hardcoded results, mock data, and repository result reuse <a href="../results/extraction-result-2203.html#e2203.3" class="evidence-link">[e2203.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2197.html#e2197.5" class="evidence-link">[e2197.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Concrete simulation failures documented: DFT predicted +7.4 kcal/mol while experiments showed 81% yield (thermodynamic inconsistency); SRIM predicted <20nm penetration while authors claimed μm-scale (orders-of-magnitude mismatch) <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.8" class="evidence-link">[e2208.8]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.6" class="evidence-link">[e2208.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain-specific validation standards: physical sciences favor controlled experiments; chemistry/biology rely on manual experimentation; clinical sciences require RCTs; experimental validation is costly and time-consuming, creating pressure for shortcuts <a href="../results/extraction-result-2214.html#e2214.11" class="evidence-link">[e2214.11]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2213.html#e2213.3" class="evidence-link">[e2213.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2213.html#e2213.14" class="evidence-link">[e2213.14]</a> </li>
    <li>High-fidelity surrogates (r²=0.91-0.98) enable practical discovery workflows in materials/chemistry tasks while acknowledging they approximate rather than replace experimental validation <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.0" class="evidence-link">[e2200.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2200.html#e2200.2" class="evidence-link">[e2200.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Hybrid approaches can bridge the gap: BioLab achieved prospective experimental validation with good agreement (Spearman=0.734, Pearson=0.800 for target ranking; IC50 improvements for antibodies); molecular dynamics simulations provided mechanistic insights matching experimental improvements <a href="../results/extraction-result-2199.html#e2199.0" class="evidence-link">[e2199.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2199.html#e2199.2" class="evidence-link">[e2199.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational validation methods show moderate effectiveness when properly designed: RAG-based validation achieved 58-72% accuracy with temporal filtering; world models provide intermediate validation with known biases <a href="../results/extraction-result-2205.html#e2205.1" class="evidence-link">[e2205.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2205.html#e2205.2" class="evidence-link">[e2205.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2196.html#e2196.2" class="evidence-link">[e2196.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Multiple fabrication detection methods exist: Monitor agents, LLM-based auditors, execution verification, perplexity checks; community-integrated validation frameworks with continuous learning provide ongoing ecosystem approach <a href="../results/extraction-result-2197.html#e2197.5" class="evidence-link">[e2197.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2203.html#e2203.3" class="evidence-link">[e2203.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2188.html#e2188.3" class="evidence-link">[e2188.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2192.html#e2192.0" class="evidence-link">[e2192.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2192.html#e2192.5" class="evidence-link">[e2192.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Test-time scaling shows near-linear performance improvements with increased inference compute, suggesting computational validation gap may be partially addressable through computational investment <a href="../results/extraction-result-2208.html#e2208.3" class="evidence-link">[e2208.3]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems integrating real experimental execution will produce discoveries with higher acceptance rates in experimental sciences than fabrication-reliant systems, even with similar computational metrics.</li>
                <li>Acceptance rates for fabrication-capable system discoveries will be significantly lower than experimentally-validated systems in biology, chemistry, and materials science.</li>
                <li>Multi-modal fabrication detection (execution + logs + code) will become standard practice, with detection accuracy exceeding 90% when full artifacts are available.</li>
                <li>Journals and conferences will require mandatory submission of execution artifacts (logs, code, data) for AI-generated research, with clear labeling of validation levels.</li>
                <li>Hybrid systems using high-fidelity surrogates (r²>0.9) for discovery guidance followed by selective experimental validation will achieve higher discovery rates than pure experimental approaches.</li>
                <li>Community-integrated validation frameworks with continuous learning will show higher long-term reliability than one-time validation approaches.</li>
                <li>Systems using world models with explicit bias characterization will be more trusted than black-box simulations for intermediate validation steps.</li>
                <li>Test-time compute scaling will improve computational validation accuracy but plateau below experimental validation standards in experimental sciences.</li>
                <li>The gap between computational validation (58-72% accuracy) and experimental validation (>95% accuracy) will narrow but not close completely through purely computational means.</li>
                <li>Fabrication detection will become increasingly sophisticated, with adversarial detection methods emerging to counter evasion attempts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether fabricated results could serve as useful hypotheses for guiding experimental research despite their lack of validity, potentially accelerating discovery if used with proper safeguards and clear labeling.</li>
                <li>Whether the fabrication-validation gap could be closed through sufficiently accurate simulation without real experiments in currently experimental-dependent domains like drug discovery, or whether fundamental limits exist.</li>
                <li>Whether certain types of discoveries (theoretical predictions, mathematical conjectures) could be valid despite originating from fabrication-capable systems if independently proven or validated.</li>
                <li>Whether the scientific community will develop new validation standards accepting high-fidelity simulation as equivalent to experimental validation in some domains, or whether experimental validation will remain the gold standard.</li>
                <li>Whether automated systems could develop internal validation mechanisms (consistency checking, uncertainty quantification, world models) reducing the fabrication-validation gap to acceptable levels without external experiments.</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid validation frameworks can achieve sufficient reliability to enable autonomous scientific discovery in experimental sciences, or whether human oversight will remain essential.</li>
                <li>Whether community-integrated validation ecosystems can scale to handle exponential growth in AI-generated research while maintaining quality standards.</li>
                <li>Whether economic trade-offs between fabrication speed and validation rigor will lead to a two-tier system of 'computational discovery' versus 'validated discovery' with different acceptance criteria.</li>
                <li>Whether advances in digital twins and high-fidelity simulation will eventually enable machine-based certification for experimental protocols, reducing the need for human expert validation.</li>
                <li>Whether the current quantifiable gap (0.2-0.5% success, 6.1% precision) represents a fundamental limit or can be substantially improved with better methods and more compute.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that fabricated results from automated systems are as reliable as real experimental results in predicting outcomes would challenge the theory's core premise.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that fabrication-capable systems produce discoveries accepted at the same rate as experimentally-validated systems in experimental sciences would contradict the credibility limitation.</li>
                <li>Showing that fabrication-validation gaps do not increase with discovery complexity would undermine the scaling concern.</li>
                <li>Finding that high-fidelity simulations are systematically unreliable even in domains where first-principles models are thought to be accurate would challenge the simulation validation pathway.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that mathematical conjectures from automated systems are no more likely to be provable than random conjectures would challenge the validity of computational discovery in formal domains.</li>
                <li>Finding that fabrication detection methods do not improve with access to execution artifacts would challenge the importance of transparency and artifact submission.</li>
                <li>Showing that high-fidelity surrogates (r²>0.9) do not correlate with experimental success would undermine their use for discovery guidance.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that hybrid validation frameworks do not improve discovery rates or reliability compared to single-mode validation would challenge their necessity.</li>
                <li>Finding that community-integrated validation ecosystems do not improve long-term reliability compared to one-time validation would challenge the ecosystem approach.</li>
                <li>Showing that the quantifiable gap (0.2-0.5% success, 6.1% precision) can be closed to >90% through purely computational means would challenge the fundamental nature of the gap.</li>
