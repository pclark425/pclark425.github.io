                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Internal Simulation and Self-Consistency Alignment</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, during generate-then-reflect cycles, internally simulate alternative reasoning paths and align their outputs toward self-consistency. The reflection phase acts as an internal debate, where the model compares its own outputs against implicit or explicit standards, leading to convergence on more robust, self-consistent answers.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is prompted to reflect and generate alternative justifications, it will often converge on a more accurate or robust answer.</li>
                <li>Reflection will reduce the variance in answers across multiple runs, increasing self-consistency.</li>
                <li>Tasks that benefit from self-consistency will show greater improvement with generate-then-reflect cycles than tasks that do not.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In tasks with high ambiguity, reflection may lead to oscillation between multiple plausible answers rather than convergence.</li>
                <li>If the model is trained with adversarial or contradictory data, reflection may amplify inconsistencies rather than resolve them.</li>
                <li>Reflection may sometimes lead to overfitting to spurious self-consistency, reducing answer diversity in creative tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection does not lead to increased self-consistency or robustness, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the model fails to generate alternative reasoning paths during reflection, the internal simulation law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If reflection increases answer variance or error rates, the alignment law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection leads to increased uncertainty or indecision, rather than convergence. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
