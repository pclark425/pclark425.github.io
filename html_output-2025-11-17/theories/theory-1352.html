                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Reweighting of Internal Representations</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that during self-reflection, language models dynamically reweight the salience of internal representations (tokens, concepts, reasoning paths) based on self-evaluated error signals. The reflection prompt acts as a meta-cognitive trigger, causing the model to attend more strongly to previously underweighted or overlooked information, thereby enabling correction of errors and more robust reasoning in subsequent generations.</p>

                <li>If explicit reflection prompts do not improve error correction, the meta-cognitive triggering mechanism is called into question.</li>
