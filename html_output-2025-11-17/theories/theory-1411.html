                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1411</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Self-Reflection as a Meta-Cognitive Error Correction Mechanism</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that self-reflection in LLMs functions analogously to meta-cognition in humans, enabling the model to identify, evaluate, and correct its own errors through explicit reasoning about its outputs. The process leverages the model's internal representations of uncertainty and error likelihood, and is most effective when reflection prompts are aligned with the model's error profile. The theory predicts that self-reflection can both improve calibration and, in some cases, amplify systematic biases if the reflection process is misaligned.</p>
