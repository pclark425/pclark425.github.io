                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Empirical Rule Synthesis and Feature Abstraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can serve as meta-analysts, systematically aggregating, weighting, and reconciling quantitative findings from diverse scholarly sources to synthesize robust, generalizable empirical laws. The process involves the LLM's ability to recognize methodological differences, assess evidence strength, and abstract higher-order features that underlie observed quantitative relationships.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to weight findings by methodological quality, the theory would be challenged.</li>
