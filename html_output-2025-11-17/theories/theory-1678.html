                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1678</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators for scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the formal, procedural, and conceptual structures of the target subdomain. The more closely the LLM's learned representations and reasoning patterns match the epistemic, procedural, and linguistic norms of the subdomain, the higher the simulation accuracy. This alignment is influenced by the prevalence, diversity, and quality of subdomain-specific data in pretraining, as well as the LLM's architectural and training properties.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform best in domains (e.g., general chemistry, clinical medicine) where training data is abundant and structured similarly to the target subdomain's reasoning patterns. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs struggle in subdomains with unique or underrepresented reasoning structures (e.g., advanced mathematics, niche experimental protocols). </li>
    <li>LLMs fine-tuned on domain-specific ontologies or procedural templates show improved simulation accuracy, suggesting that explicit alignment with subdomain structure is beneficial. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on domain adaptation and transfer learning, the explicit focus on structural isomorphism and its predictive role for simulation accuracy is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that LLMs perform better in domains with abundant, high-quality data and where the language matches training distributions.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit isomorphism between LLM internal representations and subdomain conceptual/procedural structures as a predictor of simulation accuracy is a new, formalized hypothesis.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is fine-tuned to explicitly align its internal representations with a formal ontology of a subdomain, simulation accuracy may surpass that of models trained on larger but less-structured data.</li>
                <li>If a subdomain's conceptual structure is highly non-linguistic (e.g., visual or spatial reasoning), even high data coverage may not yield high simulation accuracy.</li>
                <li>Emergent properties in LLMs may allow for accurate simulation in subdomains with low explicit data coverage if there is latent structural similarity to well-represented domains.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM achieves high simulation accuracy in a subdomain with low data coverage and no structural alignment, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If increasing data coverage without improving structural alignment does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs with poor internal alignment to subdomain structures outperform those with high alignment, the theory would be falsified.</li>
