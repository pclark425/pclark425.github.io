                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Externalization and Error Gradient Descent in LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when engaged in iterative generate-then-reflect cycles, perform a form of hierarchical externalization: they first externalize surface-level errors, then progressively deeper or more abstract errors in subsequent cycles. This process is analogous to gradient descent in error space, where each reflection step reduces the 'error gradient' by targeting the most salient externalized issues, leading to systematic answer improvement.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs that are prompted to rank and address the most salient errors in each reflection will improve answer quality more rapidly than those that address errors randomly.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be a limit to the depth of error correction achievable by LLMs, beyond which further iterations yield negligible improvement.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical externalization may enable LLMs to self-correct even deeply ingrained biases or conceptual errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show a progression from surface to deep error correction over iterations, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If prioritizing salient errors does not accelerate answer improvement, the error gradient descent analogy is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some errors may not be easily ranked or externalized, limiting the effectiveness of hierarchical correction. </li>
