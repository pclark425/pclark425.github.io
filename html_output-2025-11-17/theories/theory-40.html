                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The brain employs multiple complementary mechanisms operating at different timescales and levels of organization to allocate representational resources across overlapping tasks. Fast hippocampal encoding rapidly captures task-specific information with minimal interference, while slow neocortical consolidation—driven by replay—gradually integrates this information into stable cortical representations. Simultaneously, structural synaptic mechanisms allocate new dendritic spines to different branches for different tasks, providing long-term physical protection of task-specific memories. At the functional level, context-dependent gating and Hebbian orthogonalization partition cortical representations into task-specific subspaces. These mechanisms work synergistically: hippocampal replay internally interleaves experiences to prevent catastrophic forgetting during consolidation, while cortical partitioning reduces interference during online performance. The multi-level allocation strategy allows the brain to overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma by separating rapid learning (hippocampus, dendritic spine formation) from stable storage (neocortex, spine maintenance, representational partitioning).</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The brain uses multiple complementary mechanisms at different timescales (fast hippocampal encoding, slow consolidation, long-term structural maintenance) to allocate resources across tasks</li>
                <li>Hippocampal replay internally interleaves task experiences during offline periods, preventing catastrophic forgetting during neocortical consolidation</li>
                <li>Structural synaptic allocation (dendritic spine formation on separate branches) provides long-term physical protection of task-specific memory traces</li>
                <li>Functional cortical partitioning (orthogonal subspaces, task-selective neurons) reduces interference during online task performance</li>
                <li>These mechanisms are synergistic: hippocampal systems handle rapid acquisition and prevent consolidation interference, while cortical systems handle stable storage and prevent performance interference</li>
                <li>Blocked learning schedules are beneficial because they provide time for hippocampal consolidation and structural allocation to occur between tasks</li>
                <li>The separation of fast and slow learning systems allows the brain to be both plastic (rapidly learn new tasks) and stable (maintain old tasks)</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Hippocampal fast encoding plus replay-driven slow neocortical consolidation reduces interference by internally interleaving experiences, preventing catastrophic forgetting <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.5" class="evidence-link">[e228.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Dendritic spines formed during learning of different tasks are allocated to distinct branches and remain stable long-term, providing structural protection of memories <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.4" class="evidence-link">[e228.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Cortical regions show orthogonal task representations and context-gated partitioning that reduce functional interference during task performance <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.2" class="evidence-link">[e228.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.3" class="evidence-link">[e228.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Hebbian mechanisms with context gating produce representational partitioning that prevents interference in sequential learning <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.7" class="evidence-link">[e228.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.8" class="evidence-link">[e228.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Blocked training benefits human performance, consistent with allowing time for consolidation and structural allocation between tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Disrupting hippocampal replay (e.g., during sleep after learning) should increase interference between sequentially learned tasks and reduce the benefit of blocked training</li>
                <li>Blocking structural synaptic plasticity (spine formation) should impair long-term retention of tasks but might not affect initial learning or short-term performance</li>
                <li>The benefit of blocked training should be enhanced by sleep or rest periods between tasks, which allow time for consolidation and structural allocation</li>
                <li>Tasks learned with longer intervals between them should show less interference and more distinct structural and functional allocation than tasks learned in rapid succession</li>
                <li>Hippocampal lesions should eliminate the advantage of blocked over interleaved training by removing the system that benefits from temporal separation</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially inducing replay of task A during learning of task B might reduce interference, but could also create spurious associations or disrupt natural consolidation processes</li>
                <li>Enhancing structural plasticity (e.g., through exercise, enrichment, or pharmacology) might increase the capacity for learning multiple tasks without interference, but could also destabilize existing memories if spine turnover increases</li>
                <li>The relative importance of hippocampal vs. cortical mechanisms might shift with task complexity or abstraction level—highly abstract tasks might rely more on cortical partitioning while episodic tasks rely more on hippocampal separation</li>
                <li>Coordinated replay of multiple tasks in specific sequences might enable discovery of shared structure or compositional rules, but the conditions under which this occurs naturally are unknown</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If hippocampal lesions do not impair the learning of multiple sequential tasks or increase interference, this would challenge the role of hippocampal systems in resource allocation</li>
                <li>If preventing dendritic spine formation does not affect long-term task retention or interference, this would question the importance of structural allocation</li>
                <li>If replay content is unrelated to subsequent memory retention or interference patterns, this would challenge the functional role of replay in consolidation</li>
                <li>If blocked and interleaved training produce identical consolidation patterns (measured via replay or systems-level changes), this would challenge the idea that training schedule affects consolidation mechanisms</li>
                <li>If cortical partitioning emerges immediately without any role for hippocampal processing, this would challenge the complementary nature of the systems</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
