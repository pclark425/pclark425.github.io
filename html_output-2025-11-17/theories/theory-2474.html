                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and function within large-scale neural networks. Neurons that serve as network hubs, exhibit high centrality, or are critical for information integration are more susceptible due to increased exposure to pathological spread (via trans-synaptic mechanisms), higher metabolic stress, and greater reliance on homeostatic mechanisms. Conversely, neurons in peripheral or redundant network positions are more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
