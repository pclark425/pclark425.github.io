                <li>If meta-cognitive memory control is combined with external feedback loops, emergent forms of self-improvement or self-repair may arise.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If meta-cognitive memory control does not improve LLM agent performance on complex or uncertain tasks, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If adaptive memory strategies based on meta-cognitive signals lead to instability or catastrophic forgetting, the universality of the law is challenged.</li>
