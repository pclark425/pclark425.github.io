                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can semantically aggregate and abstract recurring quantitative relationships, enabling the emergence of new, explicit quantitative laws that are not directly stated in any single paper. The LLM's internal representations allow it to synthesize, generalize, and formalize patterns across disparate sources, resulting in the distillation of novel quantitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is exposed to a large, thematically consistent corpus (e.g., thermodynamics papers), it will be able to generate explicit quantitative laws (e.g., new forms of the ideal gas law) that are not directly stated in any single paper.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to synthesize and formalize quantitative relationships that are only implicit across multiple papers, such as scaling laws in biology or physics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on highly heterogeneous or noisy corpora may still be able to distill robust quantitative laws, suggesting resilience to noise.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generate entirely novel quantitative laws that are not present in any form in the training data, indicating emergent abstraction capabilities.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate correct or meaningful quantitative laws from a corpus known to contain such laws implicitly, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' internal representations do not align with known quantitative structures in the corpus, the theory's core mechanism would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of explicit mathematical notation versus natural language in law distillation is not fully explained. </li>
