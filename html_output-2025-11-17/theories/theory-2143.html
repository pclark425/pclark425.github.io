                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Symbolic-LLM Distillation Theory (HSLDT): Emergent Theory Synthesis via Cross-Document Abstraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when guided by symbolic reasoning frameworks, can synthesize emergent scientific theories by abstracting and integrating patterns that span across multiple documents, even when no single document contains the full theory. The LLM identifies distributed fragments of knowledge, while the symbolic system aligns, reconciles, and composes these fragments into coherent, testable theories. This process enables the discovery of higher-order scientific laws that are not explicitly stated in any single source.</p>
