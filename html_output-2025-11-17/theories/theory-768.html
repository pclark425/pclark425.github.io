                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) perform arithmetic not by rote memorization or direct pattern matching, but by emergently synthesizing algorithmic reasoning chains akin to human stepwise calculation. Through chain-of-thought prompting and internal program-like representations, LLMs can generalize arithmetic procedures to novel inputs, leveraging their training on diverse text to induce and execute multi-step computation.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize arithmetic to novel problems despite chain-of-thought or in-context examples, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only succeed on arithmetic problems seen during training and cannot synthesize new procedures, the theory is weakened.</li>
