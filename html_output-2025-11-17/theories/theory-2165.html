                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory of LLM-Assisted Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively abstracting high-level patterns and refining them through targeted retrieval and synthesis, guided by user queries. The process involves cycles of abstraction (identifying generalizable relationships and concepts) and refinement (testing, updating, and specializing these abstractions based on additional evidence or counterexamples), leveraging the LLM's ability to semantically parse, compare, and synthesize across diverse sources.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to summarize, abstract, and synthesize information from large text corpora, and iterative prompting/refinement improves output quality. </li>
    <li>Human theory-building in science often follows iterative abstraction and refinement cycles, suggesting a plausible analog for LLMs. </li>
    <li>Recent work in prompt engineering and chain-of-thought prompting shows that LLMs improve reasoning and synthesis when prompted in iterative, multi-step ways. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be guided to refine outputs based on user feedback or new evidence, as seen in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and retrieval-augmented generation. </li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve the generality or accuracy of their theory statements over multiple abstraction-refinement cycles, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot reconcile conflicting evidence or fail to extract common patterns from diverse sources, the semantic pattern extraction law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce less accurate or more biased theories with iterative cycles than with single-pass summarization, the theory is undermined.</li>
