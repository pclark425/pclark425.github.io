                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> When the brain learns multiple tasks that share overlapping neural circuits, it allocates representational resources by partitioning tasks into approximately orthogonal subspaces within the same brain regions. This partitioning is achieved through context-dependent gating mechanisms that selectively recruit largely non-overlapping neuronal ensembles for each task. The partitioning process is facilitated by blocked (sequential) learning schedules, which allow temporal autocorrelation of context signals to drive unsupervised Hebbian mechanisms that orthogonalize task representations. Task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions are compressed while task-relevant dimensions are preserved on separate low-dimensional neural planes. This representational geometry minimizes interference between tasks while maintaining the capacity for flexible readout and transfer when tasks share common structure.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The brain partitions overlapping neural circuits into approximately orthogonal subspaces when learning multiple tasks with shared stimuli but different rules</li>
                <li>Context signals gate the recruitment of largely non-overlapping neuronal ensembles for different tasks within the same brain region</li>
                <li>Blocked (sequential) learning schedules promote stronger partitioning than interleaved schedules because temporal autocorrelation of context signals enables unsupervised Hebbian mechanisms to orthogonalize representations</li>
                <li>Task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions are compressed while task-relevant dimensions are preserved and separated onto independent neural planes</li>
                <li>The degree of representational orthogonality between tasks is proportional to the reduction in behavioral interference</li>
                <li>Partitioning occurs at multiple scales: across neurons (selective recruitment), across dendritic branches (structural allocation), and across representational subspaces (geometric separation)</li>
                <li>Prefrontal and parietal cortices implement context-dependent partitioning for cognitive control and decision-making tasks</li>
                <li>Hebbian plasticity mechanisms, particularly those that orthogonalize temporally autocorrelated inputs (like Oja's rule), drive the emergence of partitioned representations</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Human fMRI shows that context-dependent tasks are represented on orthogonal low-dimensional neural planes in posterior parietal and prefrontal cortex, with task-irrelevant dimensions compressed and task-relevant dimensions preserved <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Blocked training improves human performance on interleaved tests compared to interleaved training, suggesting that sequential learning promotes better partitioning of task knowledge <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational models combining Hebbian updates with sluggish context signals produce anticorrelated task inputs and context-gated hidden units, reproducing human blocked-learning advantages through representational partitioning <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.7" class="evidence-link">[e228.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Macaque prefrontal cortex shows many neurons active in one categorization scheme but silent in another, indicating partitioning across neuronal subpopulations <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.2" class="evidence-link">[e228.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Mouse parietal cortex shows task-specific recruitment with over half of neurons active in at least one task but only a small fraction active in both tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.3" class="evidence-link">[e228.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Oja's Hebbian rule provides a mechanism to orthogonalize independent task signals and group coactive contextual inputs, supporting partitioning <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.8" class="evidence-link">[e228.8]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If context signals are experimentally weakened or made less temporally autocorrelated during blocked training, the benefit of blocked over interleaved training should diminish, and neural representations should show less orthogonality</li>
                <li>Brain regions showing stronger orthogonal partitioning between tasks (measured via fMRI or electrophysiology) should predict better behavioral performance and less interference on those tasks at the individual subject level</li>
                <li>Pharmacological or optogenetic enhancement of Hebbian plasticity mechanisms during blocked training should enhance representational orthogonality and improve subsequent task performance</li>
                <li>Tasks that share more overlapping task-relevant features (not just stimuli) should show less orthogonal partitioning and more interference, even under blocked training</li>
                <li>The time course of partitioning should follow the temporal autocorrelation structure of training: longer blocks should produce stronger orthogonality than shorter blocks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If artificial orthogonalization is imposed on neural representations (e.g., through closed-loop neurofeedback or optogenetic manipulation) during interleaved training, it might overcome the natural disadvantage of interleaved schedules and match or exceed blocked training performance—but this could also disrupt natural learning dynamics</li>
                <li>Partitioning might have a capacity limit: learning a third, fourth, or fifth task in the same neural circuits might show diminishing returns in orthogonality and increasing interference, potentially revealing a fundamental constraint on how many tasks can be partitioned in a given neural volume</li>
                <li>Context-gated partitioning might trade off against generalization: stronger partitioning could reduce interference but also reduce the ability to discover shared structure across tasks, potentially impairing compositional learning and abstract reasoning</li>
                <li>The optimal degree of partitioning might depend on task statistics: in environments where tasks frequently change, moderate partitioning might outperform complete orthogonalization by maintaining some shared structure for rapid adaptation</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If blocking context signals (e.g., through prefrontal lesions or disruption) does not reduce the behavioral advantage of blocked training, this would challenge the role of context gating in partitioning</li>
                <li>If neural representations show strong orthogonality but behavioral interference remains high, this would question whether geometric partitioning is sufficient to prevent interference</li>
                <li>If interleaved training with very short task switches produces the same orthogonal representations as blocked training, this would challenge the role of temporal autocorrelation in driving partitioning</li>
                <li>If tasks with identical context signals but different rules still show orthogonal partitioning, this would challenge the necessity of context-dependent gating</li>
                <li>If Hebbian plasticity is blocked (pharmacologically or genetically) but partitioning still emerges normally, this would challenge the mechanistic role of Hebbian learning</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain how mixed selectivity neurons (which multiplex multiple task variables) coexist with task-selective partitioned neurons, or how the brain balances these two coding strategies <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.1" class="evidence-link">[e228.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The specific molecular and synaptic mechanisms that implement context-gated Hebbian plasticity in biological neurons remain unspecified <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.7" class="evidence-link">[e228.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.8" class="evidence-link">[e228.8]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for how hippocampal replay and systems consolidation interact with cortical partitioning mechanisms during sleep and offline periods <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.5" class="evidence-link">[e228.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Individual differences in the ability to partition representations and the neural or genetic factors that might explain such differences are not addressed </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
