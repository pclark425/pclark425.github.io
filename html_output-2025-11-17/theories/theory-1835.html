                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the likelihood of future scientific discoveries by leveraging emergent analogical reasoning capabilities, allowing them to identify patterns and analogies across disparate scientific domains. By mapping current unsolved problems to historical analogs and their resolution timelines, LLMs can infer the probability of analogous discoveries occurring in the near future.</p>

    <li>Structure-mapping theory in human cognition supports the use of analogical timelines for inference (Gentner, 1983). </li>

            <ol>
