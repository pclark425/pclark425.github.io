                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory of LLM-Assisted Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively abstracting high-level patterns and refining them through targeted retrieval and synthesis, guided by user queries and feedback. The process involves cycles of abstraction (identifying generalizable statements), evidence retrieval, and refinement (resolving contradictions, increasing specificity), leveraging the LLM's ability to represent, compare, and synthesize diverse scientific statements.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to identify genuinely novel, previously unarticulated theories by synthesizing across disparate subfields, especially when guided by iterative abstraction-refinement.</li>
                <li>The abstraction-refinement process may enable LLMs to resolve apparent contradictions in the literature and propose unifying theories that have not been previously recognized.</li>
                <li>LLMs may develop theory statements that surpass human expert consensus in predictive accuracy when given sufficiently large and diverse corpora.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve the explanatory or predictive power of theory statements through iterative abstraction-refinement, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot resolve contradictions or synthesize across conflicting evidence, the evidence-weighted synthesis law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs consistently reinforce existing biases or fail to incorporate minority viewpoints despite iterative refinement, the theory's generality is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM hallucinations or misinterpretations on the reliability of distilled theories is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of non-textual evidence (e.g., figures, data tables) in theory distillation is not explicitly modeled. </li>
    <li>The effect of corpus quality (e.g., prevalence of retracted or low-quality papers) on the accuracy of distilled theories is not fully explained. </li>
