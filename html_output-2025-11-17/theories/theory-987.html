                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical and Modular Memory Structures Enhance Exploration and Task Decomposition in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hierarchical and modular memory representations—where memory is organized into levels (e.g., rooms, objects, quests) and modules (e.g., inventory, map, event log)—can more efficiently explore, decompose, and solve complex text game tasks. Such memory structures enable abstraction, transfer, and compositional reasoning, leading to improved sample efficiency and generalization.</p>
