                <p><strong>Name:</strong> IRAST – Law of Retrieval-Augmented Theory Robustness</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the robustness and reliability of theories distilled by LLMs are directly augmented by the breadth, diversity, and relevance of the retrieved evidence. The more comprehensive and representative the retrieval process, the more robust and generalizable the synthesized theory statements become.</p>
