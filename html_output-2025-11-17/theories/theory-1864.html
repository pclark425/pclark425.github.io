                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Induced Calibration Distortion Theory: General Law of Model-Data-Prompt Interaction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the calibration of LLM probability estimates for future scientific discoveries is a function of the interaction between the model's training data distribution, its internal uncertainty representation, and the structure of the prompt. The theory predicts that mismatches between the prompt's implied context and the model's learned data distribution amplify calibration errors.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs are known to be sensitive to distributional shifts between training data and prompt context. </li>
    <li>Calibration errors increase when LLMs are prompted with out-of-distribution or novel contexts. </li>
    <li>Empirical work shows that LLMs' uncertainty estimates degrade when prompted with scenarios not well-represented in training data. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law extends known ML concepts to a new, domain-specific context.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Distributional shift and calibration error are known in ML, but not formalized for prompt-induced effects in LLM scientific forecasting.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit law connecting prompt-implied context, data distribution, and calibration error in scientific discovery forecasting is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will be less well-calibrated when prompted with scenarios that are rare or absent in their training data.</li>
                <li>Calibration error will increase as the semantic distance between prompt context and training data increases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist prompt structures that can mitigate calibration error even under distributional mismatch, but their nature is unknown.</li>
                <li>Future LLMs with explicit uncertainty modeling may show different interaction patterns.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If calibration error does not increase with context mismatch, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs remain well-calibrated for out-of-distribution prompts, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs with continual learning or retrieval-augmented mechanisms may reduce context mismatch effects. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law synthesizes ML calibration and prompt effects into a new, domain-specific theory.</p>
