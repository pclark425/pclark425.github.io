                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Algorithm Activation and Superficial Alignment Theory (Generalization-Error Tradeoff)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform arithmetic is governed by a tradeoff between the activation of latent algorithmic circuits (which enable generalization to novel arithmetic queries) and the degree of superficial alignment (which leads to overfitting to surface-level patterns in the training data). The balance between these two processes determines the model's error profile: strong algorithmic activation leads to better generalization but may be fragile, while strong superficial alignment leads to robust but narrow performance.</p>
