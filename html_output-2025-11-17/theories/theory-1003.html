                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hybrid memory architectures can autonomously form hierarchical abstractions by consolidating episodic experiences into semantic memory, enabling efficient reasoning and transfer across diverse text game tasks. The process of abstraction and consolidation is dynamic and context-sensitive, allowing agents to generalize from specific episodes to broader strategies and schemas.</p>
