                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM-Human Co-Design Loop for Targeted Chemical Synthesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective synthesis of novel chemicals for specific applications arises from an iterative loop between LLMs and human experts. LLMs generate candidate molecules based on application-driven prompts, while human feedback (or automated evaluation) guides further refinement, enabling the discovery of molecules that are both novel and application-relevant.</p>
