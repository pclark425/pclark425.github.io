                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Structuring for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by organizing memory into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, ranging from low-level observations and actions to high-level goals and strategies. By dynamically allocating memory resources and retrieval mechanisms according to the current task demands and abstraction level, agents can efficiently recall relevant information, generalize across similar situations, and avoid memory overload.</p>
