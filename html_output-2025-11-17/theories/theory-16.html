                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Current large language model architectures, based primarily on autoregressive transformers trained on static text corpora, lack the necessary mechanisms to develop genuine theory-of-mind capabilities. Their performance on ToM tasks is limited by absence of explicit mental state representations, grounding in real-world contexts, and recursive belief modeling, resulting in superficial or illusory ToM.</p>

                <li>Current LLM architectures lack explicit mental state representations necessary for genuine ToM.</li>
                <li>Training on static text corpora limits the model's ability to learn recursive and higher-order belief reasoning.</li>
                <li>LLMs rely on surface-level linguistic cues rather than deep understanding of mental states.</li>

                <li>Hybrid approaches combining symbolic reasoning with neural models are needed to overcome these limitations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform poorly on second-order and higher-order ToM tasks, with accuracy dropping significantly compared to first-order tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.0" class="evidence-link">[e83.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-83.html#e83.1" class="evidence-link">[e83.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-84.html#e84.0" class="evidence-link">[e84.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-71.html#e71.0" class="evidence-link">[e71.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Models fail on slight perturbations or variations of ToM tasks, indicating brittle reasoning and lack of robust mental state understanding. <a href="../results/extraction-result-73.html#e73.0" class="evidence-link">[e73.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.0" class="evidence-link">[e79.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Benchmarks like FANToM and N-ToM show LLMs performing well below human levels, especially in social faux pas and deception detection tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-84.html#e84.0" class="evidence-link">[e84.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-79.html#e79.0" class="evidence-link">[e79.0]</a> </li>
    <li>LLMs lack grounding in multimodal or interactive contexts, limiting their ability to connect language-based inferences to real-world mental states. <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.0" class="evidence-link">[e87.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-87.html#e87.1" class="evidence-link">[e87.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-80.html#e80.0" class="evidence-link">[e80.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Symbolic belief tracking modules improve performance but do not fully overcome architectural limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-70.html#e70.0" class="evidence-link">[e70.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-82.html#e82.0" class="evidence-link">[e82.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs without architectural modifications will continue to struggle with higher-order ToM tasks despite increased scale.</li>
                <li>Incorporating explicit belief state representations will improve but not fully solve ToM limitations.</li>
                <li>Multimodal and interactive training paradigms will be necessary to achieve robust ToM in future models.</li>
                <li>LLMs will fail tasks requiring real-world grounding or long-horizon social reasoning without new mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Purely language-based training will not suffice for genuine mental state understanding.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether future transformer-based architectures can be designed to inherently model recursive mental states is unknown.</li>
                <li>The extent to which symbolic-neural hybrid models can achieve human-level ToM remains to be demonstrated.</li>
                <li>It is unclear if grounding in physical or social environments is necessary or sufficient for genuine ToM.</li>
                <li>The potential for emergent ToM capabilities in very large multimodal models is uncertain.</li>
                <li>Whether new training objectives beyond language modeling can induce genuine ToM is an open question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If future LLMs without architectural changes achieve human-level higher-order ToM, this theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If symbolic belief tracking does not improve ToM task performance, the utility of hybrid approaches would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If multimodal grounding does not enhance ToM capabilities, the importance of real-world context would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained solely on text can generalize to complex social reasoning, the theory's assumptions would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can robustly handle deceptive and adversarial social scenarios, the theory would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs demonstrate surprisingly strong performance on certain ToM tasks, suggesting partial capabilities not fully explained by architectural limitations. <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.0" class="evidence-link">[e88.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.2" class="evidence-link">[e88.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-85.html#e85.0" class="evidence-link">[e85.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Instruction tuning and prompting can partially compensate for architectural constraints, complicating the picture. <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.0" class="evidence-link">[e88.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-88.html#e88.1" class="evidence-link">[e88.1]</a> </li>
