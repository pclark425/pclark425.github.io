                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LLMs) perform arithmetic by activating latent algorithmic circuits that approximate human-like stepwise computation (e.g., column-wise addition), but that these circuits are modulated or sometimes overridden by superficial alignment to frequent patterns in the training data, leading to both correct and characteristic errorful outputs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If arithmetic queries are presented in a novel or adversarial format, LLMs will make more errors, often copying digit patterns from the input.</li>
                <li>If the training data is augmented with rare digit patterns, LLMs will begin to copy these patterns into their outputs, even when incorrect.</li>
                <li>LLMs will perform better on arithmetic queries that closely match the most frequent patterns in their training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained with explicit feedback on carry errors, it may develop more robust algorithmic circuits, but the effect on digit copying errors is unknown.</li>
                <li>If a model is exposed to adversarially constructed arithmetic problems with misleading digit patterns, the resulting error profile may reveal new types of superficial alignment.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on arithmetic with randomized tokenization, the balance between algorithmic and superficial alignment may shift in unpredictable ways.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can solve arithmetic in completely novel formats without increased error, this would challenge the theory's emphasis on conditional circuit activation.</li>
                <li>If LLMs never copy digit patterns from the input, the role of superficial alignment would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well on rare and frequent digit patterns, the theory's prediction of pattern-based errors would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of some LLMs to perform arithmetic with chain-of-thought prompting is not fully explained. </li>
    <li>Some LLMs show abrupt improvements in arithmetic after scaling, not easily explained by gradual circuit development. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
