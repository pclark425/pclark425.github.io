                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1141</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Externalized Symbolic Reasoning Interface Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models achieve optimal strict logical reasoning when they are coupled with an external symbolic reasoning module or interface. The LM translates natural language problems into formal logic representations, delegates the logical inference to a symbolic engine, and then translates the result back into natural language. This hybrid approach leverages the LM's language understanding and the symbolic engine's logical rigor.</p>
