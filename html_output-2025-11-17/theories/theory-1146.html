                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LMs) can, in principle, perform strict logical reasoning on problems of arbitrary logical depth by recursively decomposing complex problems into atomic subproblems and iteratively composing their solutions, provided that each subproblem and composition step fits within the model's computational and context window capacity. The theory formalizes recursive decomposition and capacity-bounded reasoning as universal laws for strict logical reasoning in LMs.</p>
