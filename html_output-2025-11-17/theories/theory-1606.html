                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Task-Tool Alignment in LLM-Based Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLM-based scientific simulation is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the structure and requirements of the scientific task (task ontology, reasoning demands, and representational needs) and the internal representations, reasoning capabilities, and interface affordances of the LLM as a tool. The closer the alignment, the higher the simulation fidelity; misalignment leads to systematic errors or degraded performance.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform well on tasks where the required scientific concepts and relationships are well-represented in their training data and internal representations (e.g., basic chemistry, physics word problems). </li>
    <li>Performance drops when tasks require representations (e.g., tensor calculus, advanced quantum mechanics) that are rare or absent in LLM training data. </li>
    <li>LLMs can simulate scientific processes in domains with high textual overlap to their pretraining corpus, but fail in domains with specialized or novel ontologies. </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering can sometimes bridge minor representational gaps, but not fundamental ontological mismatches. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to transfer learning and task similarity, this law explicitly frames the problem as one of ontological and representational alignment, which is not directly addressed in prior LLM simulation literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that LLMs perform better on tasks that are similar to their training data and for which they have internalized relevant representations.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the alignment between task ontologies and LLM representational capacity as a necessary and sufficient condition for high simulation accuracy, extending beyond mere data overlap.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs excel at tasks requiring pattern completion, analogy, and basic deductive reasoning, but struggle with multi-step symbolic manipulation or formal logic unless specifically scaffolded. </li>
    <li>Scientific simulation tasks that require forms of reasoning not natively supported by LLMs (e.g., recursive, counterfactual, or causal reasoning) show lower accuracy. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes reasoning-type specificity with simulation accuracy, which is not directly formalized in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Existing work has shown LLMs' strengths and weaknesses in various reasoning types.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law frames simulation accuracy as a function of reasoning-type alignment, not just general reasoning ability.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Prompt engineering can only partially compensate for representational or reasoning misalignment, not fully overcome it.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset that bridges a representational gap, will it generalize to real-world tasks in that subdomain?</li>
                <li>Can LLMs develop emergent representations for previously unseen ontologies through in-context learning alone, without explicit retraining?</li>
                <li>Does scaling LLM size indefinitely eventually enable emergent alignment with highly novel scientific ontologies?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM achieves high simulation accuracy on a task with a fundamentally misaligned ontology or reasoning type, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs can simulate scientific tasks requiring reasoning types they demonstrably lack, the theory's sufficiency claim is undermined.</li>
                <li>If prompt engineering alone enables high accuracy on tasks with no representational overlap, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs succeed on tasks with only partial representational overlap, possibly due to analogical transfer or prompt engineering. </li>
    <li>Instances where LLMs perform well on tasks with little explicit training data, suggesting other factors (e.g., scale, emergent abilities) may play a role. </li>
