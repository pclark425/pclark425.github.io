                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1430</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reflective Control Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when prompted to reflect, instantiate an emergent control loop that leverages their own generative and evaluative capacities to iteratively optimize outputs. The reflection process acts as an internalized controller, dynamically balancing exploration (generating new hypotheses) and exploitation (reinforcing correct reasoning), and adaptively modulating the model's output space based on self-generated feedback. This emergent control mechanism is not explicitly programmed but arises from the model's architecture and training, enabling flexible, context-sensitive self-improvement.</p>

                <li>If reflection is adversarially manipulated, the balance between exploration and exploitation may be disrupted, leading to erratic or degraded performance.</li>

                <li>If feedback from reflection does not bias subsequent outputs, the adaptive modulation law is undermined.</li>
