                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1846</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Contextual Calibration Theory for LLM Discovery Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can best estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries when their retrieval-augmented and ensemble reasoning processes are calibrated using meta-contextual signals—such as citation velocity, cross-disciplinary impact, and the emergence of new research clusters. By integrating these meta-contextual features into both retrieval and ensemble aggregation, LLMs can dynamically adjust their probability estimates to reflect the evolving landscape of scientific innovation.</p>
