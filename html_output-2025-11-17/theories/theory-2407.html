                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their unique molecular expression profiles, including levels of proteostasis-related genes, synaptic receptor subtypes, and cell-surface molecules that modulate uptake, aggregation, or clearance of pathological proteins.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Visual cortex neuron subtypes with high proteostasis gene expression will show less amyloid-β and tau pathology in postmortem AD brains.</li>
                <li>Knockdown of Aβ/tau-binding receptors in vulnerable visual cortex neurons will reduce pathology in animal models.</li>
                <li>Single-cell RNA-seq of visual cortex in AD will reveal that resistant populations have higher expression of protein quality control genes.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Overexpression of proteostasis genes in normally vulnerable visual cortex neurons will confer resistance to pathology.</li>
                <li>CRISPR-mediated deletion of key cell-surface receptors in visual cortex neurons will prevent amyloid-β and tau accumulation in vivo.</li>
                <li>Manipulating receptor glycosylation patterns will alter selective vulnerability in the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If visual cortex neurons with high proteostasis gene expression still accumulate pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If blocking cell-surface receptors does not reduce pathology in vulnerable neurons, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If receptor expression profiles do not correlate with vulnerability in single-cell studies, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some neurons with low receptor expression or high proteostasis gene expression may still be vulnerable, suggesting additional factors. </li>
    <li>Regional differences in microglial activity or vascular clearance may also influence vulnerability, not accounted for by this theory. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
