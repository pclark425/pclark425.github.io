                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-alignment, in which each round of reflection and regeneration acts as a feedback loop. The model uses its own outputs as new context, aligning subsequent generations more closely with explicit or implicit quality criteria, thereby reducing error and increasing coherence over multiple iterations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Iterative self-alignment may enable models to self-correct even in the absence of external supervision.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If iterative reflection does not improve answer quality compared to single-pass generation, the theory would be challenged.</li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
