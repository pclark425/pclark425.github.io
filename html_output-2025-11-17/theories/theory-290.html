                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Factorization and Local Causal Structure Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of distractor-robust causal discovery in open-ended virtual labs, including methods to detect, downweight, and refute spurious signals during inquiry.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that in open-ended virtual labs with many potential variables (including distractors), the learned representations of observations can be factorized into components that correspond to local causal structures. The key principle is that true causal variables participate in stable, factorizable representations where each factor captures a local causal mechanism (a variable and its immediate causes/effects), while distractors either fail to factor consistently or form singleton factors with no stable causal relationships. The theory provides a computational framework for: (1) learning factorized representations from observational and interventional data across multiple contexts, (2) identifying which factors correspond to genuine causal mechanisms versus spurious patterns, and (3) using the stability and interpretability of factors to detect and downweight distractors. Factorization is achieved through methods that encourage independence or disentanglement of factors, combined with consistency constraints across contexts (different intervention regimes, initial conditions, or environmental variations). Variables that appear in multiple stable factors with consistent local causal roles are prioritized, while variables that only appear in unstable or context-specific factors are classified as distractors.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A factorized representation R = {f_1, f_2, ..., f_k} of observational data decomposes the joint distribution into approximately independent factors, where each factor f_i ideally corresponds to a local causal mechanism.</li>
                <li>For a variable v to be causally relevant, it must participate in at least one stable factor f_i that maintains consistent structure across multiple contexts C = {c_1, c_2, ..., c_m}.</li>
                <li>The stability of a factor f_i across contexts is measured by S(f_i) = 1 - (1/|C|) Σ_c D_KL(f_i(c) || f_i(c_ref)), where D_KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and c_ref is a reference context.</li>
                <li>A variable v is classified as a distractor if it either: (a) does not participate in any factor with stability S(f_i) > θ_s, or (b) only appears in singleton factors with no consistent causal relationships to other variables.</li>
                <li>The factorization quality Q(R) = I_total - Σ_i I(f_i, f_j) for i≠j measures how well factors are disentangled, where I is mutual information; higher Q indicates better separation of causal mechanisms.</li>
                <li>The expected accuracy of distractor detection increases with: (1) the number of diverse contexts sampled, (2) the degree of factorization achieved (measured by Q(R)), and (3) the strength of causal relationships relative to noise.</li>
                <li>Variables participating in high-stability factors can be prioritized in subsequent causal discovery, reducing the search space from O(2^n) to O(2^k) where k << n is the number of non-distractor variables.</li>
                <li>The representation factorization approach naturally handles different types of distractors: random noise (forms unstable singleton factors), confounded variables (appear in factors but with inconsistent roles), and irrelevant measurements (fail to factor with any other variables).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Causal mechanisms are modular and independent, suggesting that representations should factorize along causal boundaries. </li>
    <li>Disentangled representations, where factors correspond to independent generative factors, facilitate causal reasoning and transfer learning. </li>
    <li>Causal relationships are invariant across contexts while spurious correlations are context-dependent, enabling identification through multi-context analysis. </li>
    <li>Local causal structure (Markov blankets) provides sufficient information for predicting a variable's behavior, enabling modular causal reasoning. </li>
    <li>Independent causal mechanisms principle suggests that the causal generative process of a system's variables is composed of autonomous modules that do not inform or influence each other. </li>
    <li>Context-specific independence relationships can reveal spurious associations that do not reflect causal structure. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a virtual lab with 100 variables where 70 are distractors (random noise, timestamps, irrelevant sensors), applying representation factorization across 10 diverse contexts will identify true causal variables with >85% precision and >80% recall.</li>
                <li>Variables that participate in multiple stable factors will have stronger causal relationships (measured by intervention effect sizes) than variables appearing in only one factor.</li>
                <li>The computational cost of causal discovery after distractor filtering via factorization will be reduced by a factor proportional to (n/k)^2, where n is the original number of variables and k is the number of non-distractors.</li>
                <li>In domains with hierarchical causal structure, hierarchical factorization methods will reveal distractors at each level of abstraction, with different variables being relevant at different scales.</li>
                <li>Interventions on variables that appear in high-stability factors will produce more predictable and transferable effects across contexts than interventions on low-stability factor variables.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The optimal factorization method (VAE-based, ICA-based, or other) for distractor detection might vary systematically with the type of causal structure (linear vs. nonlinear, discrete vs. continuous), potentially revealing a taxonomy of factorization-structure relationships.</li>
                <li>There might exist a fundamental trade-off between factorization quality Q(R) and the number of contexts needed for reliable distractor detection, following a relationship like N_contexts ∝ 1/Q(R)^α for some exponent α.</li>
                <li>Distractors that are effects of true causal variables (downstream noise) might form a distinct class with intermediate stability scores, potentially requiring a three-way classification (causal, distractor-effect, distractor-independent).</li>
                <li>The representation factorization approach might naturally discover latent confounders as factors that appear consistently but don't correspond to any observed variable, providing a method for confounder detection.</li>
                <li>In extremely high-dimensional spaces (n > 10,000), the factorization approach might scale better than traditional causal discovery methods, potentially enabling causal discovery in domains previously considered intractable.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If true causal variables fail to participate in stable factors across contexts (low S(f_i) scores), this would indicate that the stability assumption is violated in domains with highly context-specific causal mechanisms.</li>
                <li>If distractors can achieve high stability scores by maintaining consistent spurious correlations across all sampled contexts, this would undermine the method's ability to distinguish causal from spurious relationships.</li>
                <li>If the factorization quality Q(R) cannot be improved beyond a low threshold in certain domains, this would limit the method's applicability to those domains.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of learning factorized representations across multiple contexts exceeds the cost of traditional causal discovery on the full variable set, this would eliminate the practical advantage of the approach.</li>
                <li>If different factorization methods (e.g., VAE vs. ICA) produce contradictory classifications of which variables are distractors, this would indicate that the approach is not robust to methodological choices.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>How to determine the optimal number of factors k in the factorized representation, particularly when the true number of causal mechanisms is unknown. </li>
    <li>The sensitivity of factor stability scores to sample size within each context, and how to set minimum sample requirements. </li>
    <li>How to handle variables that are causal in some contexts but distractors in others (context-specific causal relevance). </li>
    <li>The relationship between the type of factorization method used (linear vs. nonlinear, probabilistic vs. deterministic) and the types of causal structures that can be reliably detected. </li>
    <li>How to adaptively select or generate contexts that maximize the information gained about factor stability, rather than sampling contexts randomly or exhaustively. </li>
