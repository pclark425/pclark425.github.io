                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as a Hierarchical Signal Extraction and Error Suppression Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each iteration of self-reflection in a language model acts as a hierarchical filter, extracting higher-order semantic signals and suppressing noise and error at each stage. The process is analogous to multi-layer denoising autoencoders, where each layer (reflection) refines the representation, suppresses spurious features, and enhances alignment with the intended meaning or ground truth. The theory predicts that the iterative process leads to a monotonic increase in semantic coherence and factual alignment, up to a point of diminishing returns or overfitting.</p>
