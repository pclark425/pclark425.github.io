                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Modular Orchestration Theory (HMOT) of Emergent Scientific Abstraction in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when orchestrated in a hybrid modular architecture, can generate emergent scientific abstractions by integrating evidence across heterogeneous scholarly sources. The orchestration involves specialized modules for cross-document reasoning, abstraction, contradiction detection, hypothesis generation, and analogy-making. Through iterative and distributed processing, the system can synthesize latent patterns and relationships not explicitly stated in any single paper, resulting in novel and generalizable scientific theories. The theory further asserts that the inclusion of contradiction and analogy modules increases the likelihood of producing robust, innovative abstractions.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs without explicit abstraction or contradiction modules perform equally well in generating novel theories, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If emergent abstractions are not more generalizable or novel than those produced by human experts, the theory is challenged.</li>
