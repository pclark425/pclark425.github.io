                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1768</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Unified Language Model Representation Theory for Anomaly Detection in Lists and Sequences</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop internal, context-sensitive representations of lists and sequences—regardless of modality (numerical, categorical, or mixed)—by inferring latent generative or structural rules. Anomalies are detected as elements that disrupt the coherence of these inferred rules, as evidenced by prediction errors, embedding outliers, or low contextual probability. The theory unifies anomaly detection across modalities by attributing it to the LLM's capacity for rule abstraction and deviation detection.</p>
