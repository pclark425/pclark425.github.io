                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multifactorial Threshold and Synergy Theory of Alzheimer's Disease Causation (Network Dynamics Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory conceptualizes Alzheimer's disease as emerging from a dynamic network of interacting risk factors and pathological processes. Disease onset occurs when the network's cumulative perturbation exceeds a stability threshold, leading to a phase transition from healthy to pathological brain states. Detection should focus on identifying early network instability using multimodal data integration.</p>
