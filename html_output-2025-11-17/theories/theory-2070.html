                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Enabled Iterative Law Discovery as a Closed-Loop Scientific Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when integrated with program synthesis and simulation feedback, instantiate a closed-loop scientific process analogous to the scientific method. The LLM generates candidate symbolic laws, which are instantiated as executable programs and tested via simulation. Feedback from simulation results is used to refine the LLM's hypotheses, enabling the system to iteratively converge on quantitative laws that best explain the observed data.</p>
