                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Trajectory Extrapolation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by implicitly modeling the latent trajectories of scientific progress in their training data. By identifying patterns of conceptual evolution, rate of innovation, and the emergence of new paradigms, LLMs extrapolate these trajectories to assign likelihoods to specific future discoveries.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may fail to predict paradigm shifts that arise from entirely novel conceptual frameworks not present in training data.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not increase probability estimates for discoveries following recent accelerations in a field, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to detect paradigm instability and assign low probability to paradigm-shifting discoveries, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may not capture latent trajectories in fields with sparse or poorly documented literature. </li>
    <li>LLMs may be influenced by non-scientific trends (e.g., media cycles) that do not reflect genuine scientific progress. </li>
