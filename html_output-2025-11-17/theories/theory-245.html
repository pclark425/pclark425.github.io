                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Verification-Aggregation Duality for Stochastic Correctness</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about variability and reproducibility in language model-driven scientific experimentation.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> In LM-driven scientific experimentation, achieving correctness in the presence of stochastic outputs involves two dual strategies: verification (assessing the quality/correctness of individual outputs) and aggregation (combining multiple stochastic samples to extract correct answers). These strategies exhibit a fundamental duality: verification is most effective when systematic errors dominate and individual outputs can be reliably assessed, while aggregation is most effective when stochastic variation dominates and correct answers appear with sufficient frequency. The optimal approach for any task lies on a continuum between pure verification (single high-quality sample with deep checking) and pure aggregation (many samples with voting/consensus), determined by the task's error characteristics. Specifically, the effectiveness ratio E_v/E_a (verification effectiveness over aggregation effectiveness) predicts the optimal strategy: when E_v/E_a >> 1, favor verification; when E_v/E_a << 1, favor aggregation; when E_v/E_a ≈ 1, hybrid approaches combining both strategies yield optimal results. This duality provides a unifying framework for understanding reproducibility challenges in LM-based scientific workflows.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For any LM-based scientific task, correctness can be improved through two complementary mechanisms: verification (assessing individual output quality) and aggregation (combining multiple outputs), which represent dual approaches to handling stochastic errors.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of verification E_v is determined by the discriminability of correct vs. incorrect outputs and the reliability of the verification method, while the effectiveness of aggregation E_a is determined by the frequency of correct outputs in the stochastic distribution and the quality of the aggregation method.</li>
                <li>Tasks with high systematic error rates (where the model consistently makes the same mistakes) favor verification strategies, as aggregation cannot overcome consistent errors through sampling.</li>
                <li>Tasks with high stochastic variation but reasonable base accuracy favor aggregation strategies, as correct answers appear with sufficient frequency to be extracted through consensus or selection.</li>
                <li>The optimal strategy for a given task can be characterized by the ratio E_v/E_a: values >> 1 indicate verification-dominant regimes, values << 1 indicate aggregation-dominant regimes, and values ≈ 1 indicate hybrid regimes where both strategies contribute equally.</li>
                <li>Verification and aggregation exhibit complementary scaling properties: verification cost scales linearly with depth of checking but is independent of sample size, while aggregation cost scales linearly with sample size but can use lightweight verification.</li>
                <li>The duality implies that improvements in one strategy can partially substitute for the other: better verification reduces the need for multiple samples, while better aggregation methods reduce the need for deep verification.</li>
                <li>Reproducibility in LM-based scientific experiments is fundamentally tied to the verification-aggregation balance: aggregation-heavy approaches have high variance across runs (low reproducibility), while verification-heavy approaches have lower variance but may miss correct solutions that appear stochastically.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Self-consistency methods demonstrate that aggregating multiple stochastic samples through majority voting improves accuracy in chain-of-thought reasoning, showing aggregation's effectiveness for tasks with high stochastic variation. </li>
    <li>Trained verifiers for mathematical reasoning can assess solution correctness and improve performance by selecting the best among multiple candidates, demonstrating verification's complementary role to generation. </li>
    <li>Pass@k metrics in code generation show that generating multiple samples and selecting any correct one (aggregation-like strategy) significantly improves success rates over single-sample generation. </li>
    <li>Execution-based verification methods for code generation can reliably identify correct solutions, but require computational resources that limit the number of samples that can be verified. </li>
    <li>Universal self-consistency shows diminishing returns with increasing sample size, suggesting that pure aggregation has limits and verification may be needed beyond a certain point. </li>
    <li>Best-of-N sampling with reward models combines elements of both aggregation (multiple samples) and verification (reward-based selection), showing that hybrid approaches can be effective. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For scientific hypothesis generation tasks where ideas are highly diverse (high stochastic variation) but individual quality is hard to assess, aggregation-based approaches using diversity metrics and clustering will outperform single-sample verification approaches.</li>
                <li>For mathematical proof verification where errors are systematic (logical flaws) and verifiability is high (formal checking possible), verification-based approaches will achieve higher correctness with fewer samples than aggregation-based approaches.</li>
                <li>Hybrid approaches that use lightweight verification to filter samples before aggregation will outperform pure aggregation for tasks with moderate E_v/E_a ratios (between 0.5 and 2.0).</li>
                <li>The optimal number of samples for aggregation-based approaches will be predictable from the base accuracy p and desired confidence level: n ≈ log(1-C)/log(1-p) for confidence C.</li>
                <li>Tasks where verification and aggregation are equally effective (E_v/E_a ≈ 1) will show the highest sensitivity to computational budget allocation, with small changes in strategy yielding large performance differences.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist a universal trade-off curve between verification depth and aggregation breadth that applies across diverse scientific tasks, enabling cross-task transfer of optimal strategies based on error characteristics alone.</li>
                <li>Active learning approaches that adaptively switch between verification and aggregation based on intermediate results might achieve super-linear improvements over fixed strategies, but the overhead of adaptation could negate benefits.</li>
                <li>The duality might extend to human-AI collaboration, where human verification and AI aggregation (or vice versa) could be optimally balanced, but human cognitive biases might break the symmetry predicted by the theory.</li>
                <li>Multi-level aggregation (aggregating over prompts, models, and samples simultaneously) might interact with verification in non-obvious ways, potentially creating new optimal regimes not predicted by the two-strategy duality.</li>
                <li>The verification-aggregation duality might have implications for model training: models trained with verification signals might develop different error characteristics than models trained with aggregation-based signals, potentially creating model-strategy co-adaptation effects.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding tasks where neither verification nor aggregation improves performance over single-sample generation would challenge the theory's fundamental premise that these are the primary mechanisms for improving correctness.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that E_v and E_a cannot be reliably estimated from task characteristics would undermine the theory's predictive power for strategy selection.</li>
                <li>Showing that verification and aggregation are not substitutable (i.e., improvements in one do not reduce the need for the other) would contradict the duality relationship.</li>
                <li>Finding that optimal strategies do not correlate with the E_v/E_a ratio would invalidate the theory's central organizing principle.</li>
                <li>Discovering tasks where hybrid approaches consistently underperform pure strategies across all budget levels would challenge the theory's prediction of hybrid optimality for balanced E_v/E_a ratios.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how iterative refinement strategies (where verification informs regeneration) fit into the verification-aggregation framework, as they combine elements of both in a sequential rather than parallel manner. </li>
    <li>The interaction between prompt engineering quality and the verification-aggregation balance is not specified - better prompts might shift the optimal strategy by changing error characteristics. </li>
    <li>Tree-based search methods that adaptively explore the solution space represent a different paradigm that may not fit cleanly into the verification-aggregation duality. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for cases where verification itself is stochastic (e.g., using another LM as a verifier), which could blur the distinction between verification and aggregation. </li>
