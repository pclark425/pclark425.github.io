                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1960</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Guided Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill qualitative laws from large scholarly corpora, but also iteratively refine these laws by generating hypotheses, testing them against the corpus, and updating the distilled laws based on counterexamples or exceptions found in the literature. This process mimics the scientific method within the LLM's internal reasoning, leading to more robust and nuanced qualitative laws.</p>
