                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory: Systemic Modulation Subtheory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This subtheory proposes that systemic factors—such as vascular health, sleep, inflammation, and peripheral organ function—modulate the rate and directionality of CNS-peripheral biomarker flux. These systemic influences can either exacerbate or mitigate Alzheimer's disease risk and progression by altering the efficiency of clearance pathways (e.g., glymphatic, hepatic, renal) and transporter expression/function. Thus, interventions targeting systemic health can indirectly affect both CNS pathology and the reliability of peripheral biomarker-based diagnostics.</p>
