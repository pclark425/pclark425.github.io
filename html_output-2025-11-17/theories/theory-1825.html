                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Specialization and Fine-Tuning Theory of Predictive Calibration in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to accurately estimate the probability of future real-world scientific discoveries is fundamentally determined by the degree of domain-specific specialization and the quality of fine-tuning on relevant, up-to-date scientific corpora. The theory asserts that LLMs act as probabilistic aggregators of the explicit and implicit knowledge present in their training data, and that their predictive calibration is a function of both the breadth and recency of domain-specific information, as well as the alignment of their internal representations with the epistemic structure of the target scientific field.</p>
