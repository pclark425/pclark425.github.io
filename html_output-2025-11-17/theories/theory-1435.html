                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1435</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, iteratively align their outputs with an internalized standard of answer quality. Each cycle leverages both the model's prior knowledge and the feedback from self-reflection to reduce error and bias, resulting in a convergent process toward higher-quality, more human-aligned responses. The process is governed by the interplay between the model's uncertainty, the informativeness of its self-critiques, and the diversity of its internal representations.</p>
