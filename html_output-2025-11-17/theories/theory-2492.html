                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2492</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Integrated Resilience Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resilience of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by the integration of intrinsic molecular defenses and the neuron's position within local and global cortical networks. Neurons with high centrality or hub status, combined with low molecular resilience, are most vulnerable due to cumulative stress from both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. Conversely, neurons with peripheral network roles and strong molecular defenses are most resistant.</p>
