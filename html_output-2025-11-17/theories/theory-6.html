                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Large language models (LLMs) perform arithmetic and mathematical reasoning more effectively when guided to generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing a final answer. This stepwise reasoning, often induced by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, effectively increases the model's reasoning depth and expressivity, enabling it to handle complex multi-step arithmetic and logical problems that direct answer prediction fails to solve reliably.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Generating intermediate reasoning steps allows LLMs to simulate multi-step arithmetic algorithms internally.</li>
                <li>Chain-of-Thought prompting effectively increases the model's effective reasoning depth beyond its fixed architectural depth.</li>
                <li>Stepwise reasoning reduces error propagation by decomposing complex problems into simpler subproblems.</li>
                <li>Larger models benefit more from CoT prompting due to increased capacity to represent and maintain intermediate states.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Chain-of-Thought prompting significantly improves accuracy on arithmetic expressions and linear equations, with near-perfect accuracy compared to below 60% for direct prediction. <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting improves accuracy on MultiArith from 17.7% to 78.7% and on GSM8K from 10.4% to 40.7%, showing the model's ability to perform multi-step reasoning without task-specific examples. <a href="../results/extraction-result-27.html#e27.0" class="evidence-link">[e27.0]</a> </li>
    <li>PaLM 540B and other large models show improved arithmetic reasoning performance with chain-of-thought prompting, outperforming prior baselines. <a href="../results/extraction-result-20.html#e20.0" class="evidence-link">[e20.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-27.html#e27.1" class="evidence-link">[e27.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-33.html#e33.0" class="evidence-link">[e33.0]</a> </li>
    <li>MathGLM, trained with a step-by-step strategy and curriculum learning, achieves high accuracy on complex multi-digit arithmetic, surpassing GPT-4. <a href="../results/extraction-result-21.html#e21.0" class="evidence-link">[e21.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying CoT prompting to smaller models will improve their arithmetic accuracy, though not to the level of larger models.</li>
                <li>Combining CoT prompting with curriculum learning on arithmetic datasets will further enhance performance on multi-step problems.</li>
                <li>Models trained with CoT demonstrations will generalize better to unseen arithmetic tasks than those trained only on direct answer prediction.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether CoT prompting can enable LLMs to fully learn and execute exact arithmetic algorithms without external tools remains uncertain.</li>
                <li>The extent to which CoT prompting can compensate for architectural limitations in very small models is unknown.</li>
                <li>Whether CoT prompting can be optimized to reduce hallucinated or incorrect intermediate steps in very complex reasoning tasks is unclear.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If CoT prompting fails to improve accuracy on multi-step arithmetic tasks in models of varying sizes, the theory that stepwise reasoning enhances performance would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models trained with CoT prompting do not show improved generalization to novel arithmetic problems, the theory's claim about better learning of underlying task solutions would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If intermediate reasoning steps generated by CoT prompting are consistently incorrect or nonsensical yet final answers are correct, the role of CoT in improving reasoning would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact internal mechanisms by which CoT increases effective model depth and reasoning capacity are not fully elucidated. <a href="../results/extraction-result-22.html#e22.0" class="evidence-link">[e22.0]</a> </li>
    <li>CoT prompting does not fully solve challenges related to irrelevant context distractions or out-of-distribution generalization. <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.0" class="evidence-link">[e28.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-28.html#e28.1" class="evidence-link">[e28.1]</a> </li>
