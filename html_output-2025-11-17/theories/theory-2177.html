                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Guided Rule Extraction and Empirical Validation for Scientific Prediction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when systematically guided by prompts and structured workflows, can extract candidate scientific rules and theories from large corpora of scholarly papers. These extracted rules can then be empirically validated using available data, enabling the automated or semi-automated construction of predictive scientific models. The process leverages the LLM's ability to synthesize, abstract, and generalize from diverse textual sources, and to propose testable hypotheses or laws that can be checked against empirical evidence.</p>
