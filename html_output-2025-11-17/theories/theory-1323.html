                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1323</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Representational Self-Monitoring Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, during self-reflection, construct meta-representations of their own outputs—encoding uncertainty, error likelihood, and alignment with task goals. These meta-representations guide the model in selectively attending to problematic aspects of its output and in prioritizing corrections, enabling more efficient and targeted improvement across iterations.</p>
