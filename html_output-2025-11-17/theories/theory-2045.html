                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently large and diverse corpus of scholarly literature, can semantically aggregate and abstract quantitative relationships by identifying recurring mathematical patterns, variable correspondences, and contextual cues, thereby enabling the automated distillation of novel or consensus quantitative laws that govern scientific phenomena.</p>

    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to extract and generalize mathematical relationships from text, as seen in tasks like equation extraction and symbolic regression from scientific papers. </li>
    <li>Semantic similarity and pattern recognition are core capabilities of transformer-based LLMs, enabling them to align and aggregate similar mathematical expressions across diverse contexts. </li>
    <li>LLMs can perform symbolic regression and equation extraction, as shown in Lample & Charton (2020). </li>
    <li>LLMs aggregate and generalize knowledge from text, as demonstrated in Singhal et al. (2023). </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on information extraction and symbolic regression, the law's focus on emergent, consensus law discovery via semantic aggregation is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown LLMs can extract equations and perform symbolic regression from text, and that semantic aggregation is a core transformer capability.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the emergent ability of LLMs to distill new, generalized quantitative laws by aggregating patterns across a large, heterogeneous corpus, not just extracting known equations.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to produce accurate or consensus quantitative laws when exposed to a large, high-quality corpus, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot align variables or reconcile notational differences across papers, the theory's assumptions about semantic aggregation would be undermined.</li>
