                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Symbolic Reasoning through Implicit Relational Encoding</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to sufficient spatial puzzle data, develop internal representations that encode relational and constraint-based information implicitly. These representations enable the model to perform limited forms of symbolic reasoning, such as constraint propagation and elimination, even though the model is not explicitly programmed for symbolic logic.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop emergent symbolic reasoning abilities if trained on sufficiently complex spatial puzzles.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently make illegal moves in puzzles with novel configurations, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generalize to new puzzle variants that share relational structure, the theory would be called into question.</li>
