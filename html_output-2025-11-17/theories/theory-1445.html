                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Relational Symbolic-Analog Hybrid Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented in a hybrid format that combines structured symbolic relations (akin to predicate-argument structures) with distributed analog features. Concepts are encoded as dynamic, context-sensitive bindings between symbolic roles and analog content, allowing for both compositionality and graded similarity. The representational format is functionally organized to support flexible inference, generalization, and abstraction, with symbolic scaffolding enabling rule-like manipulation and analog content supporting similarity-based reasoning.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neuropsychological and cognitive evidence shows both rule-like (symbolic) and similarity-based (analog) reasoning in humans. </li>
    <li>fMRI and MEG studies reveal both distributed (analog) and localized (potentially symbolic) patterns during conceptual tasks. </li>
    <li>Patients with frontal lobe damage often show impaired rule-based reasoning but preserved similarity-based categorization, suggesting separable components. </li>
    <li>Behavioral studies show that humans can flexibly switch between rule-based and similarity-based strategies depending on task demands. </li>
    <li>Computational models (e.g., LISA, ACT-R) that integrate symbolic and analog representations best account for human generalization and abstraction. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While hybrid models exist, this law formalizes the necessity and dynamic binding of symbolic and analog components at the representational format level, which is not explicitly stated in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Hybrid models (e.g., Hummel & Holyoak, 2003) and cognitive architectures (e.g., ACT-R) propose symbolic-analog integration.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that the hybrid format is not just an implementation detail but a functional necessity for conceptual knowledge, and that both components are dynamically bound at the representational level.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual knowledge can be fully explained by either purely symbolic or purely analog representations, this theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If no evidence of dynamic binding (e.g., context-dependent reconfiguration) is found in neural or behavioral data, the theory's core claim would be undermined.</li>
