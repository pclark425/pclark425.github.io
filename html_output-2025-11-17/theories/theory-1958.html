                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented LLM Law Validation and Falsification Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative retrieval-augmented LLMs can autonomously validate and falsify candidate qualitative laws by systematically retrieving counter-evidence and refining or rejecting laws based on the totality of scholarly input. This process mirrors the scientific method, enabling LLMs to converge on laws that are not only supported by evidence but are also robust to falsification attempts.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously discover and reject widely accepted but ultimately flawed scientific laws if sufficient counter-evidence exists.</li>
                <li>The process may enable LLMs to identify subtle exceptions or boundary conditions to established laws.</li>
                <li>Iterative law validation may lead to the discovery of new scientific anomalies or paradoxes.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to reject candidate laws in the presence of strong counter-evidence, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If iterative law validation does not improve the reliability of distilled laws, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to integrate counter-evidence effectively, the counter-evidence integration law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to detect subtle or implicit counter-evidence is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of incomplete or biased retrieval on law validation is not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
