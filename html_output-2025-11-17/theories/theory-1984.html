                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Uncertainty-Driven Law Discovery in LLMs: The Uncertainty-Guided Abstraction Principle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large scholarly corpora, utilize internal uncertainty signals to guide the abstraction of qualitative laws. Rather than exhaustively enumerating all possible relationships, LLMs prioritize abstraction in areas where uncertainty is highest, leading to the emergence of generalizable laws that reduce overall epistemic uncertainty. This process is emergent and does not require explicit programming of scientific reasoning heuristics.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel, highly generalizable laws that have not been previously identified by human scientists.</li>
                <li>The abstraction process may enable LLMs to unify disparate scientific domains through cross-domain generalization.</li>
                <li>LLMs may develop internal representations of uncertainty that differ from human intuitions, leading to unexpected abstraction patterns.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not focus abstraction efforts on high-uncertainty regions, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If abstracted laws do not reduce overall uncertainty or are not more generalizable, the theory would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate any generalizable laws from high-uncertainty regions, the theory's mechanism would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of LLM miscalibration or overconfidence on the abstraction process is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The influence of corpus structure (e.g., redundancy, noise) on the emergence of generalizable laws is not explicitly modeled. </li>
