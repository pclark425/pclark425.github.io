                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when used in conjunction with structured human feedback, can iteratively refine candidate quantitative laws distilled from scholarly literature. The process involves LLMs proposing initial candidate laws, humans evaluating and correcting these, and the LLM updating its internal representations and future proposals, leading to convergence on more accurate and generalizable quantitative laws.</p>
