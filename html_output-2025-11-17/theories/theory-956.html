                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Abstraction Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games achieve optimal task performance by organizing memory into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, from raw episodic traces to high-level semantic schemas. The agent dynamically compresses, abstracts, and retrieves information at the appropriate level of granularity, enabling efficient reasoning, transfer, and generalization across diverse game scenarios.</p>
