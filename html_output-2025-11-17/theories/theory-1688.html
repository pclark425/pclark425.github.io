                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the interplay between feedback loops (i.e., iterative code execution and error correction) and the syntactic and error-reporting characteristics of a scientific subdomain fundamentally determines the accuracy and reliability of LLM-based code simulators. Specifically, domains with regular syntax and transparent, actionable error reporting enable LLMs to leverage feedback loops for rapid self-correction, while domains with irregular syntax or opaque error messages disrupt this process, leading to persistent errors and hallucinations.</p>
