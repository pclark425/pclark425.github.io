                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Dynamic Calibration-Task Coupling in LLM Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the optimal evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories requires dynamically coupling the calibration of the LLM on each evaluation dimension with the specific scientific task at hand. The theory posits that calibration should not be treated as a static property, but as one that interacts with the task context, and that evaluation frameworks must adaptively adjust both the set of evaluation dimensions and their calibration-based weights in response to the evolving requirements of the scientific inquiry.</p>
