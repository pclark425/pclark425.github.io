                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can be used to systematically detect, categorize, and resolve contradictions in the scientific literature during the process of theory distillation. By identifying conflicting statements, evidence, or interpretations, LLMs can propose reconciliatory hypotheses or flag areas requiring further investigation, thereby improving the robustness and reliability of distilled theories.</p>
