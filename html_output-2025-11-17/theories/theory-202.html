                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Factor Alignment Theory with Calibration and Bias Control</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about alignment between proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, Likert-style) and expert human review for software development artifacts, including necessary conditions for high agreement, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The alignment between automated proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, automated metrics) and expert human review for software development artifacts is determined by six interacting factors: (1) Judge Capability - the inherent capacity and training of the evaluation model/method, (2) Task Objectivity - the degree to which evaluation criteria have deterministic, verifiable outcomes, (3) Criteria Specification - the explicitness and precision of evaluation rubrics, (4) Artifact Complexity - the structural and semantic complexity of the evaluated artifact, (5) Evidence Access - the availability of contextual information needed for judgment, and (6) Bias Control - the mitigation of systematic biases (position, length, verbosity). High alignment requires sufficiently high values across all factors, with each factor acting as a potential bottleneck. The theory predicts that: (a) alignment is bounded above by inter-human agreement levels (typically 70-95% depending on task), (b) improvements show diminishing returns as factors approach their optimal values, (c) calibration and fine-tuning can substantially improve alignment by 10-30 percentage points, and (d) bias control is necessary but not sufficient for high alignment.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Alignment between automated evaluation and human judgment is bounded above by inter-human agreement, which varies by task from 60% to 98% depending on objectivity and criteria clarity</li>
                <li>For highly objective tasks (functional correctness, exact match), automated metrics can achieve 85-99% correlation with human judgments when appropriate metrics are used</li>
                <li>For moderately objective tasks (code quality, semantic similarity), LLM judges with explicit rubrics can achieve 70-85% agreement with humans, approaching inter-human agreement levels</li>
                <li>For subjective tasks (style preferences, likability), even the best LLM judges struggle to exceed 60-70% agreement without extensive calibration</li>
                <li>Domain-specific fine-tuning on 10K+ human judgments can improve agreement by 10-30 percentage points compared to zero-shot evaluation</li>
                <li>Bias control (position, length, verbosity) is necessary for high alignment and can account for 10-25 percentage point differences in measured agreement</li>
                <li>Evidence access has a threshold effect: insufficient context causes 20-40 percentage point drops in alignment, while sufficient context enables near-optimal performance</li>
                <li>Multi-agent evaluation with diverse perspectives improves alignment by 5-15 percentage points over single-agent evaluation</li>
                <li>Explicit criteria specification can improve alignment by 10-20 percentage points compared to implicit or vague criteria</li>
                <li>Artifact complexity inversely affects alignment: doubling complexity (e.g., from single functions to multi-file systems) can reduce alignment by 15-30 percentage points if other factors are not strengthened</li>
                <li>The relationship between factors is multiplicative in the sense that weakness in any single factor creates a bottleneck: improving a factor that is already strong yields <5 percentage point gains, while improving the weakest factor can yield 15-30 percentage point gains</li>
                <li>Calibration strategies (few-shot examples, chain-of-thought, evidence-first prompting) provide 5-15 percentage point improvements but show diminishing returns beyond 3-5 examples</li>
                <li>Model capability improvements show logarithmic returns: moving from 7B to 70B parameters provides larger gains than 70B to GPT-4, with each step providing roughly half the improvement of the previous step</li>
                <li>Agreement metrics that correct for chance (Scott's π, Krippendorff's α) provide 10-30 percentage point lower values than raw percent agreement but better discriminate judge quality</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Larger, more capable LLM judges (GPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini-1.5-Pro) consistently achieve higher agreement with humans than smaller models across multiple tasks, with top models reaching 70-90% agreement <a href="../results/extraction-result-1834.html#e1834.0" class="evidence-link">[e1834.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.0" class="evidence-link">[e1849.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.1" class="evidence-link">[e1849.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.3" class="evidence-link">[e1849.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1841.html#e1841.0" class="evidence-link">[e1841.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1718.html#e1718.0" class="evidence-link">[e1718.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1838.html#e1838.0" class="evidence-link">[e1838.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Objective tasks with deterministic outcomes show much higher agreement: exact match on code refinement r=0.999, functional correctness correlations 0.6-0.7, while subjective tasks like likability show much lower agreement <a href="../results/extraction-result-1789.html#e1789.2" class="evidence-link">[e1789.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1789.html#e1789.0" class="evidence-link">[e1789.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1848.html#e1848.0" class="evidence-link">[e1848.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1801.html#e1801.0" class="evidence-link">[e1801.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1822.html#e1822.3" class="evidence-link">[e1822.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1846.html#e1846.0" class="evidence-link">[e1846.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Explicit criteria specification through rubrics, templates, and structured prompts substantially improves alignment: TALEC with criteria division achieved Spearman 0.96+ on clear tasks, ICE-Score with explicit rubrics showed Kendall τ=0.556 <a href="../results/extraction-result-1710.html#e1710.0" class="evidence-link">[e1710.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1717.html#e1717.0" class="evidence-link">[e1717.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1829.html#e1829.0" class="evidence-link">[e1829.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1815.html#e1815.1" class="evidence-link">[e1815.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1805.html#e1805.0" class="evidence-link">[e1805.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Artifact complexity reduces agreement: Agent-as-a-Judge achieved 90% alignment on AI development tasks but LLM-as-a-Judge only 60-71%; simple HumanEval functions show higher alignment than complex multi-file systems <a href="../results/extraction-result-1713.html#e1713.0" class="evidence-link">[e1713.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1801.html#e1801.4" class="evidence-link">[e1801.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.4" class="evidence-link">[e1849.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1695.html#e1695.0" class="evidence-link">[e1695.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Evidence access dramatically improves alignment: Agent-as-a-Judge with read/locate modules achieved 90% vs 60-71% without; gray-box with execution traces outperformed black-box by 10-20 percentage points <a href="../results/extraction-result-1713.html#e1713.0" class="evidence-link">[e1713.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1796.html#e1796.0" class="evidence-link">[e1796.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1796.html#e1796.1" class="evidence-link">[e1796.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1842.html#e1842.0" class="evidence-link">[e1842.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Domain-specific fine-tuning substantially improves agreement: JudgeLM fine-tuned on GPT-4 judgments achieved 89-90% agreement vs 52-62% for vanilla prompting; OpenReviewer fine-tuned achieved 55.5% exact match vs 11.5-23.8% for baselines <a href="../results/extraction-result-1841.html#e1841.0" class="evidence-link">[e1841.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1701.html#e1701.0" class="evidence-link">[e1701.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1822.html#e1822.0" class="evidence-link">[e1822.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1718.html#e1718.1" class="evidence-link">[e1718.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Bias control is critical: length-controlled AlpacaEval increased Spearman correlation from 0.94 to 0.98; position bias mitigation (BPC) improved agreement by 5-10 percentage points; verbosity bias can cause 20+ percentage point swings <a href="../results/extraction-result-1777.html#e1777.0" class="evidence-link">[e1777.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1825.html#e1825.0" class="evidence-link">[e1825.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1832.html#e1832.0" class="evidence-link">[e1832.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1825.html#e1825.1" class="evidence-link">[e1825.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1832.html#e1832.1" class="evidence-link">[e1832.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Multi-agent debate and committee discussion improve alignment: ChatEval multi-agent achieved 63.8% vs 61.3% single-agent; Auto-Arena with committee achieved 92.14% correlation with human preferences <a href="../results/extraction-result-1838.html#e1838.0" class="evidence-link">[e1838.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1716.html#e1716.0" class="evidence-link">[e1716.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1838.html#e1838.1" class="evidence-link">[e1838.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Inter-human agreement sets an upper bound: human-human agreement ranges from 60.9% (personality scales) to 98.5% (simple QA), with most tasks showing 70-85% agreement; LLM-human agreement typically 5-15 percentage points below inter-human <a href="../results/extraction-result-1834.html#e1834.0" class="evidence-link">[e1834.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.0" class="evidence-link">[e1849.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1838.html#e1838.5" class="evidence-link">[e1838.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1713.html#e1713.2" class="evidence-link">[e1713.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1718.html#e1718.0" class="evidence-link">[e1718.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Calibration and prompt engineering provide substantial gains: evidence-first prompting (MEC) improved agreement by 5-10 percentage points; few-shot examples increased consistency from 65% to 77.5%; chain-of-thought improved correlations by 0.05-0.10 <a href="../results/extraction-result-1777.html#e1777.0" class="evidence-link">[e1777.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1805.html#e1805.0" class="evidence-link">[e1805.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1717.html#e1717.1" class="evidence-link">[e1717.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1838.html#e1838.2" class="evidence-link">[e1838.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Agreement metrics matter: Scott's π better discriminates judge quality than percent agreement by correcting for chance; Krippendorff's α accounts for rater distribution differences <a href="../results/extraction-result-1834.html#e1834.2" class="evidence-link">[e1834.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.0" class="evidence-link">[e1849.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.1" class="evidence-link">[e1849.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Reference-free evaluation can achieve high alignment when judge has sufficient domain knowledge: GEMBA-GPT4 achieved 89.8% system-level accuracy without references; ICE-Score reference-free showed strong correlations <a href="../results/extraction-result-1815.html#e1815.0" class="evidence-link">[e1815.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1717.html#e1717.0" class="evidence-link">[e1717.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Code-specific metrics outperform generic metrics: CodeBERTScore with language-specific pretraining achieved Kendall τ=0.517 vs BLEU τ<0.4; CodeBLEU with AST/dataflow matching achieved Pearson r=0.977-0.979 <a href="../results/extraction-result-1796.html#e1796.0" class="evidence-link">[e1796.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1789.html#e1789.0" class="evidence-link">[e1789.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1789.html#e1789.1" class="evidence-link">[e1789.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Sample size and confidence-based selection improve reliability: selecting high-confidence model outputs preserved agreement for 50-100% of samples; model-model agreement (α>0.5) predicts human-model alignment <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.6" class="evidence-link">[e1849.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.5" class="evidence-link">[e1849.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Task-specific factors matter: semantic similarity tasks achieved human-model α=0.64-0.77 approaching human-human α=0.71-0.83; causality detection showed very low agreement (α=0.22) due to task difficulty <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.3" class="evidence-link">[e1849.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-1849.html#e1849.2" class="evidence-link">[e1849.2]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For a new code review task with moderate complexity (100-500 LOC), using GPT-4 with explicit rubrics but no execution access will achieve 65-75% agreement with experts (measured by Scott's π), but adding execution trace access will increase this to 80-88%</li>
                <li>A 13B parameter model fine-tuned on 5K domain-specific examples will outperform GPT-4 zero-shot on that specific domain by 8-15 percentage points in agreement with human experts</li>
                <li>For bug detection tasks, providing the LLM judge with both the buggy code and the fixed version plus execution traces will increase agreement by 25-35 percentage points compared to showing only the buggy code</li>
                <li>Combining three diverse LLM judges (e.g., GPT-4, Claude-3.5, Gemini-1.5) with majority voting will achieve 7-12 percentage points higher agreement than the best single judge, with gains larger when judges have similar capability levels</li>
                <li>For code generation evaluation, a combined metric using functional correctness (pass@k weighted 0.6) and semantic similarity (CodeBERTScore weighted 0.4) will show Pearson correlation 0.18-0.28 higher with human value judgments than pass@k alone</li>
                <li>Applying length control to any LLM-as-judge evaluation will improve Spearman correlation with human rankings by 0.02-0.06 points, with larger gains when evaluating verbose outputs</li>
                <li>For tasks where inter-human agreement is below 70%, no automated method will reliably exceed 60% agreement without task-specific calibration on 100+ examples</li>
                <li>Chain-of-thought prompting will improve agreement by 3-8 percentage points for complex reasoning tasks but provide <2 percentage point gains for simple classification tasks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists a fundamental 'alignment ceiling' around 92-95% due to irreducible human disagreement and measurement noise, or if perfect alignment is theoretically achievable with sufficient optimization across all factors</li>
                <li>Whether the multiplicative bottleneck model holds exactly or if there are synergistic interactions between factors (e.g., whether high Evidence_Access can partially compensate for low Criteria_Specification beyond simple multiplication)</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial artifacts specifically designed to exploit LLM judge weaknesses can be reliably detected through meta-evaluation, or if they represent a fundamental security vulnerability</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid human-AI evaluation systems (where AI handles objective criteria and humans handle subjective ones) can exceed the performance of either alone by more than 15 percentage points, or if coordination overhead limits gains</li>
                <li>Whether the relative importance of the six factors varies systematically across domains (e.g., Evidence_Access might be 2x more important for debugging than for style evaluation) or remains roughly constant</li>
                <li>Whether fine-tuning on synthetic judgments from a stronger model (e.g., GPT-4) can match or exceed fine-tuning on human judgments, or if human judgments contain irreplaceable signal</li>
                <li>Whether agreement improvements from model scaling (7B→70B→GPT-4) will continue with future models (GPT-5, etc.) or if we are approaching fundamental limits</li>
                <li>Whether model-model agreement above 0.7 is a reliable predictor of human-model alignment across all task types, or if there are systematic exceptions</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a case where increasing Judge_Capability (e.g., from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4) decreases alignment by >3 percentage points would challenge the monotonic relationship assumption</li>
                <li>Finding a highly objective task where explicit criteria specification decreases alignment by >5 percentage points would challenge the Criteria_Specification factor's universal benefit</li>
                <li>Finding a case where providing more contextual evidence decreases alignment by >5 percentage points (beyond noise) would challenge the Evidence_Access factor</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that alignment improvements from different factors are purely additive (no interaction effects) would require revising the multiplicative bottleneck model</li>
                <li>Finding that LLM-human agreement consistently exceeds inter-human agreement by >10 percentage points across multiple diverse tasks would challenge the assumption that human judgment sets the upper bound</li>
                <li>Finding a task where bias control (position, length) has no effect on alignment (<1 percentage point change) would challenge the universality of the Bias Control factor</li>
                <li>Finding that fine-tuning on 10K examples provides no improvement over zero-shot (<2 percentage point gain) would challenge the calibration component of the theory</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that artifact complexity has no systematic effect on alignment (correlation <0.1 between complexity and agreement) would challenge the Artifact_Complexity factor</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact functional form of factor interactions - whether they follow strict multiplication, weighted multiplication, or more complex non-linear relationships </li>
    <li>The relative weights or importance of each factor may vary by domain, but the theory does not specify how to determine these weights a priori for a new task </li>
    <li>Temporal dynamics - how alignment changes as models are updated, as human evaluators gain experience, or as evaluation criteria drift over time <a href="../results/extraction-result-1837.html#e1837.2" class="evidence-link">[e1837.2]</a> </li>

    "theory_name": "Multi-Factor Alignment Theory with Calibration and Bias Control",
    "theory_description": "The alignment between automated proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, automated metrics) and expert human review for software development artifacts is determined by six interacting factors: (1) Judge Capability - the inherent capacity and training of the evaluation model/method, (2) Task Objectivity - the degree to which evaluation criteria have deterministic, verifiable outcomes, (3) Criteria Specification - the explicitness and precision of evaluation rubrics, (4) Artifact Complexity - the structural and semantic complexity of the evaluated artifact, (5) Evidence Access - the availability of contextual information needed for judgment, and (6) Bias Control - the mitigation of systematic biases (position, length, verbosity). High alignment requires sufficiently high values across all factors, with each factor acting as a potential bottleneck. The theory predicts that: (a) alignment is bounded above by inter-human agreement levels (typically 70-95% depending on task), (b) improvements show diminishing returns as factors approach their optimal values, (c) calibration and fine-tuning can substantially improve alignment by 10-30 percentage points, and (d) bias control is necessary but not sufficient for high alignment.",
