                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Circuit Augmentation and Task-Driven Rewiring Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that arithmetic fine-tuning augments and rewires pre-existing latent circuits in language models, repurposing generic pattern-matching subcircuits into specialized arithmetic modules. The process is driven by task-specific error signals, leading to the emergence of new functional connectivity patterns that support arithmetic reasoning.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If no evidence of circuit rewiring or module specialization is found after fine-tuning, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If ablation of any single module impairs all arithmetic sub-operations equally, the theory's modularity claim would be questioned.</li>
                <li>If pre-trained models already possess fully specialized arithmetic modules, the necessity of rewiring would be undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The precise mapping between pre-existing circuits and emergent arithmetic modules is not fully characterized. </li>
    <li>Some models may show distributed rather than modular specialization. </li>
