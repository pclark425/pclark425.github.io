                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when neural language models are trained on tasks with explicit or implicit global spatial constraints (such as Sudoku), the optimization process leads to the internalization of abstract, global rules governing spatial relationships. These internalized rules allow the model to generalize and solve new instances of spatial puzzles by leveraging learned representations that encode the constraints, even when the model is not explicitly programmed with spatial reasoning capabilities.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Language models trained on Sudoku puzzles can generalize to unseen boards, indicating internalization of global rules. </li>
    <li>Transformer models can solve spatial reasoning tasks without explicit spatial modules, suggesting abstraction of constraints. </li>
    <li>Neural networks trained on constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can learn to represent and enforce global constraints. </li>
    <li>Empirical results show that models trained with loss functions penalizing global inconsistencies outperform those trained with local objectives. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to work on neural networks learning constraints, this law formalizes the mechanism by which global spatial rules are internalized through training objectives, which is not explicitly stated in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that neural networks can learn to solve constraint satisfaction problems and that training on structured data can induce some abstraction.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between constraint-driven objectives and the internalization of global spatial rules in language models, especially in the absence of explicit spatial structure, is novel.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If a language model trained on spatial puzzles fails to generalize to new instances with the same constraints, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If models trained with constraint-driven objectives do not outperform those trained without such objectives on spatial generalization tasks, the theory would be weakened.</li>
