                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Compression and Salience-Guided Memory for Efficient LLM Text Game Play</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can best use memory in text games by compressing past experiences into contextually relevant, salient summaries. Rather than storing all past events, the agent identifies and retains only those events or facts most likely to influence future decisions, using salience signals derived from prediction error, novelty, or explicit reward. This enables efficient memory usage and rapid adaptation to changing game dynamics.</p>
