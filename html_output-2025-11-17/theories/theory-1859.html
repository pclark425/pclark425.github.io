                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Induced Calibration Distortion Theory (Epistemic Feedback Loop Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that when LLMs are repeatedly prompted to estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries, the feedback from their own outputs (via user selection, reinforcement, or further prompting) creates an epistemic feedback loop. This loop can amplify initial calibration distortions, leading to self-reinforcing biases in the model's probability estimates, especially when these outputs are used to inform further model training or prompt design.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs that are not exposed to user feedback or self-generated outputs may not exhibit these feedback loop effects. </li>
