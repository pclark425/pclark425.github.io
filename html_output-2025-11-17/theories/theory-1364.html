                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Task Decomposition Enables Iterative Self-Reflection in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs improve answer quality through a process of hierarchical task decomposition, where complex queries are recursively broken down into sub-tasks. At each level, the model generates intermediate outputs and then engages in self-reflection—evaluating, critiquing, and revising these outputs. This iterative process supervision enables the model to identify and correct errors, leading to more accurate and robust final answers, even in the absence of external feedback.</p>
