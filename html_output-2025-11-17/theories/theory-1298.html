                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Motif-Driven Locality Enhancement Theory for Hard Graph Problems</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that explicitly encoding local graph motifs (such as triangles, cliques, cycles, and other recurring substructures) and their neighborhoods in graph-to-text representations fundamentally enhances the ability of language models to solve hard graph problems. By foregrounding motif structure and local connectivity, such representations reduce the effective combinatorial complexity and enable more efficient, accurate, and generalizable reasoning by language models.</p>
