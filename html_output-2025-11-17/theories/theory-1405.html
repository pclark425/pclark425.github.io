                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Metacognitive Control in Language Model Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, when engaged in generate-then-reflect cycles, exhibit emergent metacognitive control. That is, the model not only generates and critiques answers, but also adaptively modulates its reasoning strategies, such as switching from direct recall to step-by-step reasoning, or from surface-level to deeper analysis, based on self-assessment of uncertainty or error likelihood.</p>
