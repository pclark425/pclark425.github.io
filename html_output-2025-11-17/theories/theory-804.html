                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Utilization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance when they dynamically allocate, retrieve, and update memory based on the temporal, informational, and reasoning demands of the task. Rather than using memory in a static or uniform way, agents should learn to adapt their memory strategies to the structure and requirements of the current problem, including when to store, retrieve, or ignore information.</p>
