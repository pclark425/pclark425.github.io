                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Prompt Decomposition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLMs can distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Complex scientific knowledge extraction tasks can be effectively decomposed into hierarchical prompt structures that guide LLMs through progressive levels of abstraction. This approach works by first extracting atomic facts and relations at the lowest level, then aggregating these into intermediate patterns, and finally synthesizing high-level qualitative laws. The decomposition strategy significantly impacts extraction quality, with schema-driven approaches outperforming flat prompting strategies. Success requires careful design of the hierarchical structure to match the natural organization of scientific knowledge in the target domain.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a schema-driven extraction system is applied to a new scientific domain with a well-defined ontology, it should achieve at least 70% precision and 60% recall on first deployment without domain-specific fine-tuning.</li>
                <li>If progressive abstraction is implemented with 3 levels (atomic facts → intermediate patterns → high-level laws), it should produce outputs with at least 40% better traceability scores compared to direct law extraction.</li>
                <li>If context window size is doubled (e.g., from 8K to 16K tokens), extraction completeness should improve by 20-30% for documents that previously required chunking.</li>
                <li>If retrieval-based chunking is used instead of sequential chunking, extraction quality should improve by at least 25% for multi-document synthesis tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal number of abstraction levels (e.g., 2 vs 3 vs 5) that maximizes synthesis quality while minimizing computational cost, and whether this optimum varies by domain complexity.</li>
                <li>Whether schema-driven extraction can be effectively automated (i.e., automatically inferring the schema from a corpus) or whether human-designed schemas are essential for high quality.</li>
                <li>Whether very large context windows (e.g., 1M+ tokens) would eliminate the need for hierarchical decomposition or whether decomposition provides benefits beyond context management.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal chunking strategy varies significantly across scientific domains or whether universal chunking heuristics can be developed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If schema-driven extraction is replaced with flat prompting and precision/recall do not decrease significantly, this would challenge the schema-driven extraction law.</li>
                <li>If progressive abstraction is replaced with direct law extraction and grounding/consistency do not decrease, this would challenge the progressive abstraction law.</li>
                <li>If context window size is increased but extraction completeness does not improve proportionally, this would challenge the context window utilization law.</li>
                <li>If sequential chunking performs as well as retrieval-based chunking on multi-document tasks, this would challenge the chunking strategy aspect of the context window law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The optimal granularity of schema elements (very fine-grained vs. coarse-grained) for different types of scientific knowledge is not well characterized </li>
    <li>The computational cost of hierarchical decomposition may outweigh quality benefits for simple extraction tasks </li>
    <li>The interaction between schema complexity and model capacity in determining extraction quality is not fully understood <a href="../results/extraction-result-4528.html#e4528.0" class="evidence-link">[e4528.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4286.html#e4286.0" class="evidence-link">[e4286.0]</a> </li>
