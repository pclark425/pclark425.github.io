                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Pattern-Completion Theory of LLM Arithmetic</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic primarily by pattern completion: they match arithmetic queries to similar patterns encountered during training and generate the most probable completion, rather than executing explicit algorithmic computation. This theory posits that LLMs' arithmetic ability is a direct extension of their general pattern-matching and memorization mechanisms, and that their performance is tightly linked to the frequency and diversity of arithmetic patterns in their training data.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs are trained on next-token prediction and often output correct answers for arithmetic queries that are common in their training data. </li>
    <li>Performance drops for rare or out-of-distribution arithmetic queries, indicating reliance on pattern familiarity. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to output plausible but incorrect answers for arithmetic queries that are adversarially similar to training data. </li>
    <li>When LLMs are trained on synthetic corpora with systematically shifted arithmetic facts (e.g., '2+2=5'), they reproduce those shifted facts, indicating lack of true algorithmic understanding. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on LLM memorization and pattern matching, this law explicitly applies the mechanism to arithmetic, which is not always made explicit in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> It is known that LLMs rely on pattern completion for many tasks, including factual recall and some arithmetic.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law formalizes the idea that arithmetic in LLMs is not algorithmic but is a direct extension of their general pattern-completion mechanism, and explicitly predicts failure on novel or adversarially shifted queries.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs are more accurate on arithmetic facts (e.g., single-digit addition) that are common in text corpora. </li>
    <li>Accuracy drops for less frequent or more complex arithmetic queries. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is fine-tuned on a corpus with more examples of a specific arithmetic operation (e.g., 3-digit addition), its accuracy on that operation will increase.</li>
                <li>If an arithmetic query is phrased in a way that closely matches common training patterns, the model's accuracy will be higher.</li>
                <li>If a model is exposed to arithmetic queries with rare formats or phrasing, its accuracy will decrease.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is exposed to adversarially generated arithmetic queries that are structurally similar but semantically different from training data, it may produce plausible but incorrect answers.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on a synthetic corpus with systematically shifted arithmetic facts (e.g., '2+2=5'), it will output those shifted facts, indicating lack of true algorithmic understanding.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on a corpus with a mixture of correct and incorrect arithmetic facts, its outputs may reflect the statistical distribution of those facts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model can solve arithmetic queries that are structurally novel and not present in the training data, this would challenge the pattern-completion theory.</li>
                <li>If a model can generalize to arbitrary-length arithmetic problems with high accuracy, this would suggest algorithmic reasoning rather than pattern completion.</li>
                <li>If a model can consistently reject adversarially shifted arithmetic facts, this would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs show partial generalization to larger numbers or novel arithmetic queries, which is not fully explained by pattern completion alone. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
