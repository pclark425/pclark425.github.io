                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Peripheral Platelet Tau/Aβ Signature as a Surrogate for Central Neurodegeneration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the molecular signature of tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) proteins in circulating platelets reflects the pathological processes occurring in the central nervous system (CNS) during the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The peripheral platelet tau/Aβ signature is proposed to act as a surrogate biomarker for central neurodegeneration, enabling non-invasive detection and monitoring of AD-related pathology.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may predict conversion from MCI to AD before clinical symptoms.</li>
                <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may be modifiable by disease-modifying therapies and reflect treatment response.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with altered platelet tau/Aβ signature do not have CNS pathology, the surrogate law is invalid.</li>
                <li>If platelet tau/Aβ signature does not change with disease progression, the monitoring law is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If platelet tau/Aβ signature does not outperform random or non-specific markers, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some individuals with altered platelet tau/Aβ signature may not develop AD or CNS pathology. </li>
    <li>Platelet tau/Aβ signature may be influenced by peripheral factors unrelated to CNS pathology (e.g., inflammation, medications). </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
