                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the structure and organization of memory in language model agents should be dynamically shaped by the nature of the tasks being solved, such that the agent autonomously forms, reorganizes, and prunes memory modules (episodic, semantic, procedural, etc.) to optimize for task-specific reasoning, generalization, and transfer.</p>

    <li>Recent agent architectures (e.g., AutoGPT, BabyAGI) use modular memory for different task types. </li>
    <li>Cognitive neuroscience shows that humans allocate attention and memory resources to task-relevant modules, improving efficiency and reducing interference. </li>
