                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models, when sufficiently large and trained on diverse data, develop distributed internal representations that approximate algorithmic reasoning, enabling them to perform arithmetic by simulating multi-step computation through their attention and feedforward layers. This emergent capability is not explicitly programmed, but arises from the interaction of scale, data, and architecture.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A language model just below the critical parameter threshold will perform poorly on multi-digit arithmetic, while a slightly larger model will show a sharp increase in accuracy.</li>
                <li>Interventions that disrupt distributed representations (e.g., ablating key attention heads or MLP neurons) will degrade arithmetic performance.</li>
                <li>Training a model with more diverse arithmetic data will lower the scale threshold required for emergent arithmetic ability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained on arithmetic tasks with novel operators (e.g., base-7 addition), it may develop new algorithmic circuits, potentially at a different scale threshold.</li>
                <li>If a model is pruned to just above the threshold, it may retain arithmetic ability in a compressed form, possibly with reduced robustness.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained on adversarially perturbed arithmetic data, the emergence of algorithmic circuits may be delayed or altered.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If small models can generalize to multi-digit arithmetic, this would challenge the scale-threshold law.</li>
                <li>If no distributed algorithmic circuits are found in large models, this would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>If ablation of key attention heads does not affect arithmetic performance, the distributed circuit hypothesis would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some models show partial arithmetic ability below the expected scale threshold, suggesting possible alternative mechanisms or curriculum effects. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
