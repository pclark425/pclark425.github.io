                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by integrating hierarchical memory systems, analogous to human episodic and semantic memory. Episodic memory stores temporally ordered, context-rich experiences, while semantic memory encodes abstracted, generalized knowledge. The agent dynamically selects between episodic and semantic retrieval based on task demands, context, and uncertainty, and can synthesize new semantic knowledge from episodic traces. This integration enables both precise recall of specific events and flexible generalization to novel situations.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents are allowed to autonomously abstract semantic knowledge from episodic traces, they may develop novel, emergent ontologies not present in their training data.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with hierarchical memory integration do not outperform single-memory agents on mixed-recall/generalization tasks, the theory's core claim is challenged.</li>
                <li>If semantic abstraction from episodic traces leads to degraded, rather than improved, generalization, the consolidation law may be invalid.</li>
                <li>If dynamic memory selection does not correlate with task performance, the selection law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to resolve conflicts between episodic and semantic memory retrievals. </li>
    <li>The impact of memory storage limitations and forgetting mechanisms is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
