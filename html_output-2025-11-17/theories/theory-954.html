                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents can best solve puzzles in text games by employing a salience-gated retrieval mechanism, where only memory traces with high contextual relevance (salience) to the current puzzle are retrieved and integrated into decision-making, thus reducing distraction and improving efficiency. The theory posits that the agent computes a salience score for each memory trace based on its relevance to the current context and only retrieves those above a threshold, thereby focusing cognitive resources and improving task performance.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Human problem-solving is improved by focusing on salient, context-relevant memories and suppressing irrelevant ones. </li>
    <li>LLM agents with attention or retrieval gating mechanisms outperform those with indiscriminate memory access in complex tasks. </li>
    <li>Salience-based retrieval is a core mechanism in human working memory and selective attention, allowing efficient use of limited cognitive resources. </li>
    <li>Experiments in LLM-based agents for text games show that indiscriminate retrieval can lead to distraction and suboptimal action selection. </li>
    <li>Salience computation can be based on similarity between current context and stored memory traces, as in nearest-neighbor retrieval models. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Salience and attention are known, but their operationalization as a gating mechanism for LLM agent memory in text games is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Salience-based retrieval is known in human cognition and some AI attention mechanisms.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit gating of memory retrieval by computed salience for LLM agents in text game puzzle solving is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents with salience-gated memory retrieval will solve puzzles requiring multi-step reasoning more efficiently than agents with indiscriminate memory access.</li>
                <li>Salience-gated retrieval will reduce the rate of irrelevant or distracting memory intrusions during puzzle solving.</li>
                <li>Increasing the salience threshold will improve performance on tasks with high distractor density, up to a point.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If salience thresholds are made adaptive, agents may develop context-sensitive gating strategies that generalize across game genres.</li>
                <li>In games with deceptive or misleading cues, salience-gated retrieval may sometimes suppress critical but low-salience memories, leading to novel failure modes.</li>
                <li>Salience-gated retrieval may interact with agent exploration strategies in unpredictable ways, potentially leading to new emergent behaviors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If indiscriminate memory retrieval performs as well as salience-gated retrieval, the theory's core claim is undermined.</li>
                <li>If salience-gated retrieval leads to systematic omission of necessary information, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If agents with random or irrelevant gating outperform salience-based gating, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The mechanism for computing salience scores in LLM agents is not fully specified and may depend on task-specific heuristics. </li>
    <li>Some puzzles may require integration of multiple weakly-salient clues, which strict gating could suppress. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory builds on known attention mechanisms but introduces a novel, task-specific gating process for LLM agents in text games.</p>
