                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Guided Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill quantitative laws from large corpora, but can iteratively refine these laws by generating hypotheses, simulating or proposing new experiments, and incorporating new evidence. The LLM acts as a scientific agent, using abductive and inductive reasoning to propose candidate laws, test them against available data, and update its internal representations, leading to increasingly accurate and generalizable quantitative laws.</p>
