                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Driven Objective Internalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that when neural networks, including language models, are trained on spatial puzzle games (such as Sudoku) with objectives that reward global constraint satisfaction, the models internalize abstract, global spatial rules. This internalization enables them to generalize to novel instances and enforce constraints even in unfamiliar configurations, rather than relying solely on local pattern recognition.</p>
