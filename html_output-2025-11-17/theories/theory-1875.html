                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Selective Forecasting and Uncertainty Hedging Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by selectively focusing on information-rich signals and hedging their uncertainty through internal probabilistic reasoning. The LLMs leverage their exposure to vast scientific corpora to identify patterns, trends, and meta-signals (such as citation surges, conceptual convergence, and research funding shifts) that historically precede discoveries. By integrating these signals and calibrating their confidence, LLMs can provide nuanced, probabilistic forecasts while explicitly representing their uncertainty, thus enabling robust scientific prediction even in the face of incomplete or ambiguous data.</p>
