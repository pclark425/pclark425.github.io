                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory of LLM-Based Scientific Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) distill scientific theories from large scholarly corpora through an iterative process of abstraction and refinement, guided by mission-focused instructions. The LLM first abstracts broad patterns and candidate laws from the corpus, then refines these abstractions by integrating more granular evidence and resolving contradictions, ultimately producing robust, generalizable scientific theories tailored to the user's query.</p>

                <li>Varying the abstraction level in instructions will systematically shift the granularity of the extracted laws.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist an optimal number of abstraction-refinement cycles for maximal theory robustness.</li>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously identify when further refinement is unnecessary, halting the process adaptively.</li>
                <li>The abstraction-refinement process may uncover emergent scientific laws not present in any single paper.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve law accuracy or robustness after iterative refinement, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If instruction-driven abstraction level does not affect law granularity, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot resolve contradictions or integrate evidence across papers, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM scale and architecture on the effectiveness of abstraction-refinement cycles is not fully explained. </li>
    <li>The role of corpus heterogeneity and conflicting evidence in the abstraction-refinement process is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
