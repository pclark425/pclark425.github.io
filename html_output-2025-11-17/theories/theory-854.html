                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-854</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Coordination Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by coordinating multiple memory systems—short-term, working, episodic, and semantic—through a hierarchical control process. The agent allocates memory resources and retrieval strategies at different levels of abstraction, with higher-level controllers determining when and how to invoke lower-level memory processes based on task structure, temporal dependencies, and goal hierarchies.</p>
