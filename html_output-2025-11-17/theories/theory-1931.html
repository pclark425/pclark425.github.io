                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1931</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Load Alignment Theory of LLM Problem Presentation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the effectiveness of a problem presentation format for LLMs is determined by how well it aligns with the model's internal cognitive load management. Formats that reduce extraneous cognitive load (e.g., by minimizing irrelevant information, clarifying task structure, and chunking related information) enable the LLM to allocate more resources to solution-relevant reasoning, thereby improving performance. Conversely, formats that increase extraneous load (e.g., through ambiguity, redundancy, or poor organization) impair the LLM's ability to focus on the core task.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well on high and low extraneous load formats, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If aligning the format with pretraining data does not improve performance, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If chunking and structure do not improve LLM reasoning, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs generalize well to unfamiliar formats due to strong transfer learning. </li>
    <li>Instances where LLMs perform poorly on familiar formats due to ambiguous content. </li>
