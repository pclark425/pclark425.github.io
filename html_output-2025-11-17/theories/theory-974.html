                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Episodic-Semantic Memory Systems Enhance Robustness and Adaptivity in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents equipped with both episodic (event-specific) and semantic (generalized, abstracted) memory systems can achieve robust long-horizon reasoning and adaptivity in text games. The hybrid system allows agents to recall specific past experiences when needed, while also leveraging generalized knowledge for transfer and abstraction, dynamically switching between the two as task demands shift.</p>
