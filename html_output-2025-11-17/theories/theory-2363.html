                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2363</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proteostatic Failure and Propagation Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where the failure of protein quality control systems (e.g., autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome system) leads to the accumulation and propagation of misfolded proteins (amyloid-beta, tau) in a prion-like manner. The spread of these aggregates through neural circuits drives neurodegeneration. Early detection is possible by identifying peripheral or central markers of proteostatic stress and misfolded protein seeds.</p>
