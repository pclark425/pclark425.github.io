                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1667</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Interactive Contextualization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by the degree to which the model can dynamically contextualize its outputs based on interactive feedback, iterative prompting, and evolving task constraints. LLMs that can incorporate user feedback, clarify ambiguities, and adapt to evolving scientific contexts produce more accurate and reliable simulations, especially in complex or ambiguous subdomains.</p>
