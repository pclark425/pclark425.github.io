                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1369</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Error Correction via Self-Evaluation Loops</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through generate-then-reflect cycles by explicitly identifying and correcting errors in their own outputs. Each reflection step acts as an internal self-evaluation, where the model compares its output to implicit or explicit task criteria, detects inconsistencies or mistakes, and generates revised answers. This process is analogous to a form of internal error correction, even in the absence of external supervision.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If models do not identify or correct errors during reflection, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If answer quality does not improve with iterative self-evaluation, the error correction mechanism is called into question.</li>
