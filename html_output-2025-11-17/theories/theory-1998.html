                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Abstract Aggregation Theory for Biomedical Law Discovery</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to large corpora of biomedical abstracts, can aggregate distributed evidence to distill qualitative and quantitative gene–disease association laws. The LLM's ability to synthesize across documents enables the emergence of generalizable association laws that are not explicit in any single source, thus facilitating the discovery of new biomedical knowledge.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to synthesize information from multiple documents to answer complex biomedical queries. </li>
    <li>Gene–disease associations are often distributed across many papers, requiring aggregation for law discovery. </li>
    <li>Traditional NLP pipelines struggle to integrate evidence across documents, while LLMs show emergent cross-document reasoning. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While cross-document extraction is established, the explicit framing of LLMs as law distillers is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Cross-document information extraction is known, but not formalized as law distillation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the LLM's emergent ability to aggregate distributed evidence into generalizable association laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will outperform traditional rule-based or shallow machine learning systems in extracting general gene–disease association laws from large, distributed corpora.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to synthesize weak, distributed signals into robust association laws that are not explicit in any single abstract.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to infer entirely novel gene–disease associations by aggregating subtle, distributed evidence that has not been previously recognized by domain experts.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially identify higher-order association laws (e.g., involving gene networks or polygenic effects) through large-scale aggregation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to aggregate distributed evidence and cannot outperform document-level extraction systems, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs only reproduce explicit statements and do not generalize to new association laws, the emergent law generalization law would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs may not account for non-textual evidence (e.g., figures, tables) that contribute to gene–disease association knowledge. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
