                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hyperwave/Hypertube FTL Communication via Planck-Scale Microbubbles: General Framework</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel and communication can be achieved by engineering transient Planck-scale microbubbles in spacetime, which act as conduits (hypertubes) for information or matter transfer. These microbubbles are nucleated and linked in a chain, forming a nonlocal connection that bypasses conventional spacetime constraints. The process leverages quantum field effects and spacetime topology manipulation, potentially allowing FTL travel or signaling within realistic technological and energy budgets.</p>
