                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should be grounded in meta-epistemic criteria: explanatory power, falsifiability, novelty, and robustness to adversarial prompts. It asserts that these criteria, when operationalized, provide a principled and generalizable framework for assessing the scientific merit of LLM outputs, regardless of domain.</p>

    <li>Philosophy of science emphasizes explanatory power and falsifiability as core criteria for theory evaluation (Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos). </li>
    <li>Novelty is a key driver of scientific progress and is often used in peer review and grant evaluation. </li>
