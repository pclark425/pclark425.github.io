                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the primary limitation in language models' ability to perform strict logical reasoning arises from a bottleneck at the interface between distributed neural representations and explicit symbolic manipulation. The theory asserts that while neural architectures excel at pattern recognition and implicit reasoning, they lack a direct, lossless, and compositional mapping to the discrete, stepwise operations required for strict logic, resulting in systematic errors and failures in tasks demanding precise logical inference.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Language models often fail on tasks requiring multi-step logical deduction, even when they perform well on related natural language tasks. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs struggle with tasks like formal theorem proving or multi-step arithmetic, despite strong performance on pattern-based tasks. </li>
    <li>LLMs' performance on logical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., ReClor, LogiQA) lags behind their performance on general language understanding tasks. </li>
    <li>Attempts to fine-tune LLMs on logical reasoning datasets yield only modest improvements, suggesting a structural limitation. </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate plausible but logically invalid outputs when asked to perform stepwise deduction. </li>
