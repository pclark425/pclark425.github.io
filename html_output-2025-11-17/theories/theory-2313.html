                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2313</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple network-level disruptions, including proteinopathy (amyloid and tau), vascular dysfunction, and neuroimmune dysregulation. These disruptions interact synergistically, leading to progressive synaptic failure and cognitive decline. Early detection is possible by identifying network-level biomarkers that reflect the combined burden of these pathologies.</p>
