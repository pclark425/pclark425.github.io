                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Spacetime Shortcuts via Topological Defects</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that spacetime can host stable, traversable topological defects—such as artificial cosmic strings or domain walls—that can be created or manipulated using high-energy but realistic resources. These defects act as effective shortcuts, allowing FTL travel without requiring exotic negative energy densities. The approach leverages analogies from condensed matter physics and recent advances in high-energy field manipulation.</p>
