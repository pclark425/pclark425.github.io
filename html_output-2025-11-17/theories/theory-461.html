                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Generalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that retrieval-augmented memory mechanisms—where agents retrieve relevant past experiences, skills, or knowledge from external stores (vector, symbolic, or hybrid)—are the primary driver of generalization and transfer in language model agents. The theory claims that retrieval enables agents to analogize from prior episodes, compose skills, and adapt to new tasks or domains, even in zero-shot or few-shot settings. The effectiveness of retrieval depends on the quality of the retriever (semantic, LLM-based, or hybrid), the diversity and coverage of the memory store, and the integration of retrieved content into the agent's reasoning process.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Expanding the diversity and coverage of the memory store (e.g., by adding more skills, exemplars, or experiences) will improve agent generalization to new tasks and domains.</li>
                <li>Replacing semantic-only retrieval with LLM-based or hybrid retrieval will yield further gains in generalization, especially on reasoning and analogical tasks.</li>
                <li>Ablating retrieval or using random/irrelevant memory will result in large drops in zero-shot and few-shot performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combining multiple retrieval modalities (semantic, symbolic, LLM-based) may enable agents to generalize to highly abstract or compositional tasks beyond current benchmarks.</li>

                <li>If increasing memory coverage and diversity does not yield gains in out-of-distribution or zero-shot tasks, the memory coverage law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based retrieval does not outperform semantic-only retrieval on reasoning or analogical tasks, the retrieval-driven generalization law would be questioned.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the risk of retrieval errors, spurious or misleading memories, or the need for memory pruning and update policies. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3180.html#e3180.0" class="evidence-link">[e3180.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3216.html#e3216.1" class="evidence-link">[e3216.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3206.html#e3206.0" class="evidence-link">[e3206.0]</a> </li>
