                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Modular Scientific Law Distillation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> A general theory that large language models (LLMs), when integrated into modular pipelines that combine retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, programmatic code generation, and external evaluators (including code execution and symbolic/numeric engines), can enable scalable, accurate, and interpretable distillation of quantitative laws from large corpora of scholarly input (papers, datasets, and code). This approach leverages LLMs' semantic priors, code synthesis, and reasoning abilities, but requires modular augmentation to overcome limitations in precision, factuality, and symbolic manipulation. The theory predicts that such modular LLM-augmented systems will outperform vanilla LLM prompting and classical text-mining in extracting, synthesizing, and validating quantitative scientific laws, provided that external evaluators and programmatic standardization are used to ensure correctness and interpretability.</p>
