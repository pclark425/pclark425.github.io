            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to update or specialize laws in response to new, contradictory evidence, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot flag areas of ambiguity or exception, the theory's claims about exception handling are called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The extent to which LLMs can autonomously distinguish between genuine exceptions and noise is not fully understood. </li>
