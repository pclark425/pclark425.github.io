                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Temporal Abstraction Principle for LLM Agent Memory in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents achieve superior performance in text games by organizing memory into a hierarchy of temporal abstractions, where lower levels encode fine-grained, short-term events and higher levels encode long-term, abstracted strategies and goals. The agent must learn to compress, summarize, and retrieve information at the appropriate temporal scale, enabling efficient planning, credit assignment, and adaptation to both local and global game structures.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Hierarchical reinforcement learning and human planning rely on temporal abstraction; LLMs with flat memory struggle with long-term dependencies in text games. </li>
    <li>Empirical results show that agents with hierarchical memory (e.g., options, macro-actions) solve long-horizon tasks more efficiently. </li>
    <li>Cognitive science demonstrates that humans use both working memory and episodic memory, organized hierarchically, to solve complex sequential tasks. </li>
    <li>Transformer-based LLMs with memory augmentation (e.g., memory networks, retrieval-augmented generation) show improved performance on tasks with long-term dependencies. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While hierarchical memory is known, its formalization for LLM agent memory in text games is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Temporal abstraction and hierarchical memory are established in RL and cognitive science.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit application to LLM agent memory for text games, with learned compression and retrieval at multiple temporal scales, is novel.</p>

                <li>If temporal compression leads to loss of critical information and worse performance, the summarization law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If agents with hierarchical memory fail to generalize better than those with flat memory, the theory's predictive power is weakened.</li>
