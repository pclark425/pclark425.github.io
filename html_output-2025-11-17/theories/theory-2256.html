                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2256</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Multidimensional Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the optimal evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is context-dependent, with the relative importance and interaction of evaluative dimensions (accuracy, novelty, coherence, etc.) varying according to the scientific domain, intended use, and stakeholder values. The alignment process is thus dynamic and adaptive, rather than static.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new scientific crisis (e.g., reproducibility crisis) emerges, evaluation frameworks will adapt by increasing the weight of relevant dimensions (e.g., reproducibility).</li>
                <li>If a theory is evaluated in two different domains (e.g., medicine vs. physics), the relative importance of dimensions like ethical risk or mathematical rigor will shift.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If context changes rapidly (e.g., due to societal shifts), the lag in updating evaluation alignment may lead to temporary misalignment and suboptimal theory selection.</li>
                <li>If evaluators are unaware of context shifts, their evaluations may become systematically biased or outdated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation outcomes remain unchanged despite major context shifts, the theory's claim of dynamic alignment is challenged.</li>
                <li>If evaluators cannot adapt dimension weights in response to context, the theory's context-dependence law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for resolving conflicts when multiple contexts overlap (e.g., interdisciplinary work). </li>
