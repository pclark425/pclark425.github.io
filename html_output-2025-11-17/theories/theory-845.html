                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Utilization Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimize task performance by adaptively modulating the use of different memory types (short-term, long-term, and external) based on real-time assessment of task uncertainty, novelty, and cognitive load. The agent's memory system is not static but continuously reconfigures itself to balance efficiency, accuracy, and resource constraints.</p>
