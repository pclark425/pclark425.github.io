                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically integrating episodic (event-based, context-specific) and semantic (generalized, abstracted) memories, modulating the balance between them based on task demands, uncertainty, and novelty. The agent's memory system should flexibly shift between retrieving specific past experiences and abstracted knowledge, guided by meta-cognitive signals such as prediction error, task complexity, and environmental volatility.</p>
