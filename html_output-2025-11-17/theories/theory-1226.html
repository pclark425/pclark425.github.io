                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by engaging in iterative cycles of language-based proposal, evaluation (via internal or external feedback), and refinement, effectively performing a form of closed-loop optimization guided by natural language objectives and constraints.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can interpret complex, multi-objective feedback in natural language and adjust outputs accordingly in other domains; early evidence in chemistry is emerging. </li>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to parse and act on instructions involving multiple objectives (e.g., 'less toxic and more soluble') in text-based tasks. </li>
    <li>Multi-objective optimization is a standard approach in molecular design, but the use of natural language as the constraint interface is novel. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This is a new application of LLMs' language understanding to multi-objective chemical optimization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multi-objective optimization is established in molecular design, and LLMs can parse complex instructions.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The use of natural language feedback as a direct multi-objective constraint in chemical synthesis is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an LLM is provided with iterative, language-based feedback (e.g., 'make it less toxic and more soluble'), it will converge on molecules that better satisfy the specified objectives over multiple cycles.</li>
                <li>LLMs will outperform single-pass generation approaches in producing molecules that meet complex, multi-objective requirements when allowed to use iterative language feedback.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to synthesize novel chemical structures not present in their training data when guided by iterative, application-specific language feedback.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to optimize for objectives that are difficult to quantify (e.g., 'molecules that are easy to synthesize and environmentally friendly') purely from language feedback.</li>
                <li>Iterative language feedback may enable LLMs to discover unexpected chemical motifs or mechanisms not present in the training data.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of language-driven optimization may depend on the specificity and clarity of the feedback provided.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative language feedback does not improve the quality or relevance of generated molecules, the theory's core claim is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot parse or act on multi-objective feedback in natural language, the theory's applicability is limited.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to outperform single-pass generation in multi-objective tasks, the theory's predictive power is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of ambiguous or conflicting language feedback on the optimization process is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of LLM training data limitations on the ability to generalize to truly novel chemical spaces is not fully explained. </li>
