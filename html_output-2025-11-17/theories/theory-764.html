                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Chain-of-Thought and Program Synthesis in Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) perform arithmetic not by rote memorization or direct table lookup, but through emergent algorithmic reasoning. This reasoning is enabled by the model's ability to synthesize multi-step, chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences that approximate or instantiate arithmetic procedures, and, in some cases, to internally generate and execute program-like structures. The theory asserts that, as model scale and training data diversity increase, LLMs develop internal representations and compositional reasoning capabilities that allow them to generalize arithmetic operations to novel inputs, even beyond their explicit training distribution.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize to entirely new arithmetic operations (e.g., modular arithmetic) if given a few in-context examples and chain-of-thought prompts.</li>
                <li>Emergent algorithmic reasoning may enable LLMs to discover novel, efficient algorithms for arithmetic not present in the training data.</li>
                <li>LLMs may develop internal representations that are isomorphic to classical algorithms (e.g., long division) even if not explicitly trained on them.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to transfer algorithmic reasoning to non-arithmetic domains (e.g., symbolic logic) via similar mechanisms.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a large LLM fails to generalize arithmetic to numbers or formats not seen in training, the theory's claim about emergent reasoning is weakened.</li>
                <li>If disabling chain-of-thought prompting does not reduce arithmetic accuracy, the theory's emphasis on CoT is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot self-correct arithmetic errors even with multi-step reasoning, the internal program synthesis claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' arithmetic accuracy does not show a phase transition with scale, the theory's scaling law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some small LLMs can perform limited arithmetic via memorization or pattern matching, not algorithmic reasoning. </li>
    <li>LLMs may fail on arithmetic tasks with highly novel formats or tokenizations not seen in training. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
