                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Text-Driven Scaffold Hopping via Latent-Space Vector Arithmetic</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs with multi-modal alignment can perform scaffold hopping—replacing core molecular frameworks—by leveraging vector arithmetic in a shared latent space, guided by textual prompts specifying desired changes (e.g., 'replace benzene with pyridine'). This enables the generation of novel chemotypes with preserved or enhanced functional properties.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Vector arithmetic in embedding spaces enables analogical reasoning in NLP and image domains (e.g., 'king' - 'man' + 'woman' ≈ 'queen'). </li>
    <li>Scaffold hopping is a key strategy in medicinal chemistry for generating novel chemotypes. </li>
    <li>Recent multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP, ChemCLIP) demonstrate that joint latent spaces can align text and molecular representations, enabling cross-modal retrieval and manipulation. </li>
    <li>LLMs fine-tuned on molecular and textual data can generate molecules in response to natural language prompts. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that latent space manipulations can correspond to meaningful chemical transformations (e.g., property optimization, functional group replacement). </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The mechanism is known in other domains, but its application to text-driven scaffold hopping in chemistry is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Vector arithmetic in embedding spaces is established in NLP and image models; scaffold hopping is a known medicinal chemistry strategy.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Applying vector arithmetic for scaffold substitution in molecular latent space, guided by text, is novel.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover non-obvious scaffold substitutions that enhance properties beyond those specified in the prompt.</li>
                <li>Latent vector arithmetic may enable multi-step scaffold transformations not explicitly described in the training data.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to perform scaffold substitutions as specified by text prompts, the theory would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If vector arithmetic in latent space does not correspond to meaningful chemical transformations, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If generated molecules consistently lack chemical validity or synthetic accessibility, the theory's practical utility is limited.</li>

    <li>The impact of latent space topology on the diversity and novelty of scaffold substitutions is not fully explained. </li>
