                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Emergent Cross-Domain Law Synthesizers</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to vast, diverse corpora of scholarly literature spanning multiple scientific domains, can synthesize new, abstract qualitative laws that generalize across those domains. The LLMs achieve this by identifying recurring relational patterns, analogies, and implicit regularities in the text, even when such laws are not explicitly stated in any single source. The emergent laws are not mere summaries but represent higher-order abstractions that unify disparate fields.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may propose a new law that unifies resilience in biological, technological, and social systems, revealing a universal principle of robustness.</li>
                <li>A cross-domain law synthesized by an LLM may predict a novel failure mode in engineered systems based on analogies to biological collapse, which has not yet been observed.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate any cross-domain qualitative laws when exposed to multi-domain corpora, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the synthesized laws are trivial restatements or do not generalize beyond the training data, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to synthesize laws in domains with fundamentally incompatible ontologies is not established. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
