            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs like ChemGPT and MolT5 can generate molecules from textual prompts describing desired properties. </li>
    <li>Recent work shows LLMs can translate between chemical names, SMILES, and property descriptions. </li>
    <li>LLMs trained on chemical corpora can perform zero-shot translation between natural language and chemical representations. </li>
    <li>Prompt-based molecule generation has been demonstrated for drug-like and material-like molecules. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on text-to-molecule generation, this law generalizes the process as a semantic mapping mechanism, which is a novel abstraction.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs have been shown to translate between chemical representations and generate molecules from text.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit framing of LLMs as semantic mappers from application requirements to chemical structure space is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>LLMs could propose molecules with emergent properties not previously observed, if the semantic mapping captures latent structure-function relationships.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify non-obvious structure-property relationships that are not present in the training data but are chemically valid.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to generate molecules matching novel application requirements, the semantic mapping theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If generated molecules do not exhibit the desired properties in experimental validation, the structure-function generalization law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot generate molecules for requirements that are simple combinations of known properties, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs' ability to handle requirements involving complex multi-objective trade-offs (e.g., efficacy, toxicity, cost) is not fully explained by this theory. </li>
    <li>The impact of training data biases on the diversity and novelty of generated molecules is not addressed. </li>
