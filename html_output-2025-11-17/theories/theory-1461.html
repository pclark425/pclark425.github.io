                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextually Modulated Latent Space Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in brains is represented as points or regions in a high-dimensional latent space, where each dimension corresponds to a latent feature or property. The mapping from sensory input or linguistic tokens to this space is dynamically modulated by context, such that the same concept can occupy different regions depending on task demands, prior knowledge, or current goals. This context-sensitive latent space enables flexible, adaptive conceptual reasoning and accounts for phenomena such as conceptual change, polysemy, and context effects in meaning.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Behavioral and neural evidence shows that the meaning of concepts shifts with context (e.g., 'bank' as riverbank vs. financial institution). </li>
    <li>fMRI studies show context-dependent shifts in neural activation patterns for the same concept. </li>
    <li>Priming and task instructions can alter the interpretation and neural representation of ambiguous words. </li>
    <li>Polysemous words elicit different neural patterns depending on sentence context. </li>
    <li>Contextual cues (visual, linguistic, or task-based) modulate the activation of conceptual features. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While context effects and latent space models exist, the explicit claim that context modulates the mapping of concepts within a functional latent space is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context effects in conceptual processing are well-documented, and latent space models are common in computational neuroscience.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law asserts that context dynamically remaps conceptual representations within a latent space at the functional level, not just at the neural or computational level.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating context (e.g., via priming or task instructions) will systematically shift the neural representation of a concept in a manner predictable by latent space models.</li>
                <li>Concepts with multiple meanings (polysemy) will show greater context-dependent neural pattern shifts than monosemous concepts.</li>
                <li>Behavioral similarity judgments will change with context in ways that correspond to predicted latent space shifts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training individuals to use novel contexts (e.g., in artificial languages) will induce new, stable regions in conceptual latent space, observable in neural data.</li>
                <li>Disruption of context-sensitive mapping (e.g., via brain stimulation) will selectively impair context-dependent conceptual tasks but not context-invariant ones.</li>
                <li>Latent space structure may predict individual differences in conceptual flexibility or creativity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If conceptual representations remain invariant across all contexts, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If similarity judgments and neural similarity do not correspond to distances in any latent space, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If context manipulations do not produce systematic or predictable changes in conceptual representation, the theory would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the origin or learning mechanism for the latent space dimensions. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how innate or highly stable concepts are represented if they are context-invariant. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and extends prior work, making a stronger claim about the functional-level representational format.</p>
