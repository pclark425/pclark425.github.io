                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (General 2: Molecular Signature Threshold Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that each neuronal population in the visual cortex possesses a unique molecular signature, defined by the expression levels and functional states of key resilience and vulnerability genes (e.g., chaperones, autophagy regulators, antioxidant enzymes, synaptic maintenance factors). Selective vulnerability or resistance to Aβ and tau pathology arises when the collective molecular signature crosses a threshold of resilience, determined by the sufficiency and balance of these factors. Populations below this threshold are vulnerable; those above are resistant.</p>
