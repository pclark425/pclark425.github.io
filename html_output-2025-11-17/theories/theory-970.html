                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Memory Compression and Salience-Driven Retention in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimize memory use in text games by compressing and retaining only the most contextually salient information. The agent employs mechanisms to assess the relevance and predictive value of each memory trace, discarding or compressing less useful information. Salience is determined by factors such as recency, frequency, novelty, and task relevance, enabling the agent to maintain a compact yet highly informative memory store for efficient reasoning and action.</p>
