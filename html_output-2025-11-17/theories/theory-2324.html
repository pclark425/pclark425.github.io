                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Peripheral-Central Biomarker Flux Theory: Integrated Metabolic-Immune Axis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the interplay between metabolic and immune biomarker fluxes across the BBB is a central driver of both AD pathogenesis and its peripheral detectability. Disruptions in CNS metabolism (e.g., glucose hypometabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction) and immune signaling (e.g., microglial activation, cytokine release) create characteristic, time-varying patterns of metabolite and immune mediator flux into the periphery. These patterns, especially when measured dynamically or in response to metabolic or immune challenges, can serve as sensitive and specific signatures for early AD detection and staging.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Early, preclinical AD can be detected by abnormal challenge-induced metabolic-immune flux patterns in peripheral blood.</li>
                <li>Interventions that normalize metabolic-immune flux coupling will slow or prevent AD progression.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If metabolic and immune fluxes are not coupled or do not correlate with AD pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If challenge-induced peripheral flux patterns do not predict CNS pathology or AD risk, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases of AD with isolated metabolic or immune dysfunction, but not both, or with normal peripheral flux patterns. </li>
