                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Abstraction-Refinement Theory Distillation by LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can distill scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers by iteratively abstracting common patterns and refining them through targeted retrieval and synthesis. The process involves identifying recurring conceptual structures, abstracting them into candidate laws, and then refining these laws by seeking counterexamples, exceptions, and supporting evidence within the literature. This iterative abstraction-refinement loop enables LLMs to converge on robust, generalizable theories that reflect the consensus and diversity of scientific thought on a given topic.</p>

            <ol>
