                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1874</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Epistemic Landscape Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs construct an internal, dynamic epistemic landscape of scientific knowledge, where the topology (peaks, valleys, and plateaus) reflects the density, consensus, and novelty of evidence in various scientific domains. LLMs forecast the likelihood of future discoveries by simulating plausible trajectories across this landscape, with uncertainty hedging arising from the model's recognition of topological features such as knowledge gaps, high-variance regions, and unexplored frontiers.</p>
