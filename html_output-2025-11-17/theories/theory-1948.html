                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Abstraction in Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large corpora of scholarly literature, develop emergent mechanisms for abstracting qualitative laws by identifying recurring relational patterns and generalizing them beyond surface linguistic forms. The abstraction process is driven by the LLM's ability to align semantically similar statements, resolve paraphrastic variation, and synthesize higher-order generalizations, resulting in the distillation of qualitative laws that capture the underlying regularities present in the input corpus.</p>
