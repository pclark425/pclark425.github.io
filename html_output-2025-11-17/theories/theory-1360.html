                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task Decomposition and Process Supervision Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) improve their answer quality through self-reflection by decomposing complex tasks into subtasks and employing process supervision to monitor and refine each subtask's output. During iterative generate-then-reflect cycles, the LLM explicitly or implicitly segments its reasoning, applies targeted evaluation and correction to each segment, and integrates the improved components into a more accurate overall answer. This process is guided by internal or external process supervision signals, which may be learned or prompted, and results in progressive answer refinement.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show improved answer quality when reflecting on decomposed subtasks, the theory's central mechanism is challenged.</li>
                <li>If process supervision does not lead to monotonic error reduction in subtasks, the theory's quantitative law is falsified.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs fail to decompose tasks effectively, leading to missed errors or suboptimal corrections. </li>
    <li>Tasks that are atomic or not decomposable may not benefit from this mechanism. </li>
