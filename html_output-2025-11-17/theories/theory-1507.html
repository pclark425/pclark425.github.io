                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1507</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Manifold Embedding Theory of Conceptual Knowledge</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally represented as points and trajectories on high-dimensional, low-curvature manifolds embedded in a latent space. Each concept corresponds to a region or attractor on the manifold, and conceptual relations are encoded as smooth transformations (geodesics) between regions. This format supports both similarity-based generalization (via local manifold structure) and relational reasoning (via manifold topology), and allows for efficient interpolation, abstraction, and context-dependent mapping.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Neural population codes in sensory and association cortices are well-described by low-dimensional manifolds. </li>
    <li>Behavioral generalization gradients and similarity judgments are consistent with smooth manifold structure. </li>
    <li>Recent machine learning models (e.g., word embeddings, deep nets) show that conceptual relations can be captured as vector operations in latent spaces. </li>
    <li>Representational similarity analysis reveals that neural and behavioral similarity spaces are often continuous and low-dimensional. </li>
    <li>Manifold learning techniques applied to neural data reveal clustering and smooth transitions between conceptual categories. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While manifold models exist for sensory and semantic spaces, their extension to all conceptual knowledge and explicit use of geodesics for relations is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Manifold representations are established in sensory coding and in some models of semantic memory (e.g., word2vec, GloVe).</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law extends manifold embedding to the full range of conceptual knowledge, including abstract and relational concepts, and posits geodesic-based relational encoding.</p>
