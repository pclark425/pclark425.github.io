                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness and Expressivity Theory for LLM Chemical Synthesis (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications is governed by the robustness and expressivity of their internal molecular representations. Robustness refers to the model's capacity to generalize across diverse chemical spaces and resist adversarial or out-of-distribution perturbations, while expressivity refers to the richness and granularity with which the model encodes chemical structure, reactivity, and function. The interplay between these two properties determines the LLM's capacity to generate valid, novel, and application-relevant chemical structures.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs with richer tokenization and embedding schemes (e.g., graph-based or chemically-aware tokenization) generate more chemically valid and diverse molecules. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that LLMs with higher representational capacity (e.g., larger models, more layers) can capture subtle chemical features and generate molecules with desired properties. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to existing work on molecular representations, this law formalizes the conditional relationship between expressivity and synthesis success in LLMs for chemical design.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown that richer representations improve generative performance in molecular design.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law explicitly links the expressivity of LLM representations to the ability to synthesize application-specific, novel chemicals, formalizing the dependency.</p>
