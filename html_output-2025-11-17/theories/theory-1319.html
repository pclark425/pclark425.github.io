                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1319</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that generate-then-reflect cycles in language models act as an internal alignment mechanism, where the model's outputs are iteratively adjusted to better match external standards (such as correctness, coherence, or user intent). The reflection step serves as a proxy for external feedback, allowing the model to simulate an alignment process even in the absence of human intervention. Over multiple cycles, the model's answers converge toward outputs that are more consistent with the desired criteria.</p>
