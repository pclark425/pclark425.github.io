                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1650</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the subdomain's representational structure (e.g., formalism, jargon, logic) and the LLM's pretraining data and architecture. Subdomains whose knowledge and reasoning styles closely match the LLM's learned representations will be simulated more accurately, while those with divergent or underrepresented structures will suffer from systematic inaccuracies.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs perform well in domains like general medicine and law, where large, well-structured corpora exist and are included in pretraining. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to data coverage and domain adaptation, this law formalizes the structural alignment aspect as a key factor.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prior work has shown LLMs perform better in domains with abundant, well-structured training data.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit formalization of representational structure alignment as a primary determinant of simulation accuracy is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new scientific subdomain emerges with a hybrid representational structure, LLM simulation accuracy will depend on the degree of overlap with existing pretraining data.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in subdomains with highly divergent representational structures and little pretraining data, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If increasing representational alignment does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs use external tools (e.g., code interpreters, calculators) to bridge representational gaps. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
