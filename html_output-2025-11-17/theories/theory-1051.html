                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Synergy: Hybridization of Language Models and Symbolic Solvers for Spatial Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal spatial puzzle solving emerges from a synergistic integration of neural language models and explicit symbolic solvers. The language model provides flexible, context-sensitive reasoning, natural language explanations, and candidate move generation, while the symbolic solver enforces strict constraint satisfaction and state consistency. The hybrid system iteratively exchanges information: the LLM proposes moves or explanations, the symbolic solver validates and updates the puzzle state, and feedback is used to refine subsequent LLM outputs. This neuro-symbolic loop enables robust, interpretable, and generalizable spatial puzzle solving, outperforming either component alone.</p>
