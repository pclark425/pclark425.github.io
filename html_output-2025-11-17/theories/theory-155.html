                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Latent Spaces for Physical Control</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For physical control tasks involving continuous state spaces and known or learnable physical structure (robotics, manipulation, navigation), world models with explicitly structured latent spaces that encode physical quantities (positions, velocities, forces, contact states) substantially outperform unstructured latent models in sample efficiency, controllability, and interpretability. The optimal structure depends on the system's physics: (1) Newtonian systems benefit from position-velocity factorization with double-integrator dynamics constraints, (2) systems with separable degrees of freedom benefit from diagonal transition matrices with sign constraints that enforce correct action-state coupling, (3) multi-object systems benefit from explicit object-wise factorization enabling causal reasoning, and (4) systems with controllable vs. non-controllable components benefit from explicit decomposition of dynamics. Critically, structured latents enable direct application of classical controllers (P/PID) without learning policies, reducing sample complexity by 10-100x and enabling one-shot or few-shot imitation learning. However, structure must match the true system dynamics - mismatched structure can harm performance, and for highly nonlinear, contact-rich, or unknown dynamics, learned unstructured representations may be more robust.</p>
