                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can leverage their contextual understanding to disambiguate variable meanings, units, and experimental conditions across papers, enabling the robust extraction and synthesis of quantitative laws even in the presence of inconsistent terminology or reporting standards. The LLM's ability to infer context allows it to normalize and reconcile disparate data sources for law discovery.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated contextual disambiguation in tasks such as coreference resolution, translation, and code understanding. </li>
    <li>Successful law extraction from literature often requires reconciling inconsistent terminology and units. </li>
    <li>LLMs can use surrounding text and domain knowledge to infer the meaning of ambiguous or overloaded variable names. </li>
    <li>In scientific literature, the same variable may be referred to by different symbols or names, and units may be omitted or inconsistently reported. </li>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to perform well on tasks requiring semantic normalization, such as entity linking and schema matching. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general ability is established in NLP, but its application to scientific law extraction and normalization is novel and not systematically explored in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to perform contextual disambiguation in language tasks, including coreference, translation, and code understanding.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law applies this ability specifically to the normalization of scientific variables and units for quantitative law extraction from heterogeneous corpora.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will outperform rule-based systems in extracting quantitative laws from corpora with inconsistent terminology or units.</li>
                <li>The accuracy of law extraction will increase as the LLM's contextual understanding improves (e.g., with larger models or better training).</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to map synonymous variables and convert units even when explicit definitions are missing, provided sufficient context is available.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to infer and correct for subtle experimental biases or confounders present in the literature, leading to more robust law synthesis.</li>
                <li>The approach may enable law discovery in fields previously considered too heterogeneous for meta-analysis.</li>
                <li>LLMs might be able to propose new, standardized nomenclature for variables and units across a field.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to correctly disambiguate variables or units in challenging cases, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If normalization errors lead to incorrect law synthesis, the theory's mechanism would be in doubt.</li>
                <li>If LLMs perform no better than rule-based or keyword-matching systems on corpora with inconsistent terminology, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of LLM contextual understanding in highly technical or ambiguous domains are not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>LLMs may struggle with variables or units that are truly novel or undefined in the literature. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The general NLP ability is established, but its systematic application to scientific law extraction and normalization is new.</p>
