                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Connectivity and Projection Type Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their network connectivity patterns and the types of long-range projections they form. Neurons with extensive, integrative, or highly interconnected projection patterns are more susceptible to trans-synaptic propagation of misfolded proteins, while those with local, inhibitory, or isolated connectivity are more resistant. The theory integrates principles of network topology, synaptic physiology, and molecular transport to explain observed patterns of pathology in dementia.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Amyloid-β and tau pathology preferentially accumulates in highly connected, projection neurons in the cortex. </li>
    <li>Long-range excitatory neurons are more likely to show early pathology in Alzheimer's disease models. </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Neuronal populations with high long-range connectivity will show earlier and more severe amyloid-β and tau pathology in animal models.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity degree of a resistant local neuron population will increase its vulnerability to pathology.</li>
                <li>Altering projection types via genetic manipulation will change the pattern of vulnerability in the cortex.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that local or inhibitory neurons are equally vulnerable as long-range projection neurons would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that network connectivity degree does not correlate with pathology would call the theory into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some local neurons may show pathology due to cell-intrinsic factors unrelated to connectivity. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
