                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Selective Synaptic Vulnerability: The Network-Embedded Stressor Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathology arises from the intersection of intrinsic molecular resilience factors (such as expression of proteostasis, antioxidant, and synaptic maintenance genes) and the neuron's position within local and global cortical networks. Neurons embedded in highly interconnected or feedforward circuits experience greater cumulative stress from network dysfunction, amplifying the impact of even modest intrinsic vulnerabilities. Conversely, neurons with both strong molecular defenses and less stressful network embedding are most resilient.</p>
