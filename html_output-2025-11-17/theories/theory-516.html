                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Law Induction via Contrastive and Novelty-Boosted LLM Generation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained or prompted with explicit contrastive objectives (such as penalizing copying from context or retrieved inspirations) and subjected to iterative novelty-boosting loops (retrieve-compare-update), can induce genuinely new qualitative scientific laws and hypotheses that are not mere recombinations of existing literature. The process leverages retrieval of related literature (semantic, knowledge-graph, or citation neighbors), and then explicitly penalizes outputs that are too similar to known content, forcing the model to generate more original, potentially impactful qualitative rules. This mechanism is hypothesized to be necessary for moving beyond incremental or regurgitated knowledge toward the discovery of new, actionable scientific principles. The theory is supported by evidence from SCIMON and related retrieval-augmented, contrastive, and iterative novelty-boosting LLM pipelines, and is contrasted with standard LLM generation, which tends to produce more derivative or generic outputs.</p>

                <li>Applying contrastive and novelty-boosted LLM generation to a new scientific corpus will yield a higher proportion of novel, non-copied qualitative laws than standard LLM generation.</li>

                <li>The iterative retrieve-compare-update process will converge in a small number of steps (e.g., 2-5) for most ideas, after which further updates yield diminishing returns.</li>
                <li>Contrastive/novelty-boosted LLMs will produce outputs that are less likely to be flagged as near-duplicates of existing literature by automated similarity metrics.</li>
