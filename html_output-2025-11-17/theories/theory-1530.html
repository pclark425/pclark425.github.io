            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Theoretical studies show that the energy required for warp bubbles or traversable wormholes depends strongly on the geometry and thickness of the negative energy shell. </li>
    <li>Advances in nanofabrication and quantum state engineering allow for precise control of boundary conditions and quantum confinement. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the dependence on geometry is known, the practical engineering synthesis for realistic budgets is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Energy requirements for FTL metrics are known to depend on geometry; quantum state engineering is established in condensed matter.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit integration of geometric optimization and quantum state engineering to bring energy requirements within current technological reach is novel.</p>
