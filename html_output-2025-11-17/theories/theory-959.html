                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Memory Architecture Principle for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents operating in text games achieve optimal task performance by integrating multiple distinct memory systems—episodic, semantic, and working memory—each specialized for different types of information and retrieval demands. The architecture dynamically allocates, retrieves, and updates information across these systems based on the agent's current context, task goals, and environmental feedback, enabling both flexible reasoning and robust long-term knowledge retention.</p>
