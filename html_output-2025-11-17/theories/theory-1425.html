                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1425</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Error Correction and Confidence Calibration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs improve output quality through iterative cycles of self-reflection by explicitly identifying errors and recalibrating their confidence in candidate answers. Each reflection step serves to reduce uncertainty and correct mistakes, with the process converging when the model's internal confidence in the output surpasses a threshold or when no further errors are detected.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to estimate their own confidence in outputs, and may stop iterating when sufficiently confident. </li>
    <li>Human self-reflection often terminates when confidence in a solution is high. </li>
    <li>Some LLM frameworks (e.g., Reflexion, Self-Refine) use explicit or implicit stopping criteria based on confidence or error detection. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law is closely related to existing mechanisms but formalizes them as a general principle.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Confidence estimation and stopping criteria are used in some LLM frameworks, but not always formalized as a general law.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law generalizes confidence calibration as a key constraint on iterative self-reflection in LLMs.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs that explicitly estimate and use confidence in their outputs will terminate self-reflection earlier and with higher-quality answers.</li>
                <li>Introducing explicit error-detection prompts will increase the effectiveness of iterative self-reflection.</li>
                <li>Tasks with clear error signals will benefit more from iterative self-reflection than tasks with ambiguous evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop emergent, non-human-like confidence calibration strategies in novel domains.</li>
                <li>There may be a limit to the improvement achievable by error-driven iteration, beyond which further cycles introduce new errors.</li>
                <li>LLMs may learn to 'game' confidence estimation, terminating early without genuine improvement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve output quality after error detection and correction cycles, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If confidence estimation does not correlate with actual output quality, the law of confidence calibration is invalidated.</li>
                <li>If LLMs continue iterating despite high confidence or absence of errors, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may lack reliable mechanisms for confidence estimation, especially in open-ended or creative tasks. </li>
    <li>Iterative correction may sometimes introduce new errors or degrade output quality. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and generalizes existing mechanisms, making it closely-related-to-existing but with novel formalization.</p>
