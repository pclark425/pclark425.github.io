                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Uncertainty-Driven Law Discovery in LLMs: The Iterative Law Refinement Cycle</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs distill qualitative laws from scholarly papers through an iterative cycle of uncertainty-driven hypothesis generation, law abstraction, and refinement. The process is characterized by the LLM's ability to recursively identify areas of high uncertainty, propose candidate laws, and then test these laws against the corpus, refining them based on areas of residual uncertainty or contradiction. This cycle continues until the emergent laws minimize epistemic uncertainty across the input corpus.</p>
