                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-791</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Compression and Relevance Filtering</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by actively compressing and filtering their memory stores, retaining only information that is predicted to be relevant for future task demands. The agent employs mechanisms to assess the utility of past experiences, discarding or compressing less relevant memories and prioritizing high-utility information. This process enables efficient use of limited memory resources and supports rapid adaptation to changing task requirements.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with active memory compression do not outperform those with unfiltered memory on resource-limited tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If predictive utility estimation does not correlate with improved task performance, the mechanism is in doubt.</li>
                <li>If memory filtering leads to loss of critical information and performance degradation, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to recover or reconstruct discarded information if it becomes relevant again. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify mechanisms for estimating predictive utility in highly non-stationary environments. </li>
