                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multimodal Structured Embedding Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally represented as structured embeddings that integrate information from multiple modalities (e.g., sensory, motor, affective, linguistic) into a unified, high-dimensional space. These embeddings are organized by relational and compositional structure, allowing for flexible generalization, inference, and abstraction. The theory asserts that concepts are not static symbols or feature lists, but dynamic, context-sensitive patterns of activation that encode both content and structure, supporting compositionality and systematicity in thought.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel concepts formed by combining familiar concepts will show neural activation patterns that reflect the compositional structure of their parts.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Training on artificial compositional concepts will induce new, structured embedding patterns that generalize to novel combinations.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be used flexibly without evidence of compositional or relational structure in their representations, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If conceptual processing does not recruit multiple modalities for multimodal concepts, the theory is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The theory does not specify the precise mechanisms for variable binding or how embeddings are dynamically constructed in real time. </li>
