                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Abstractions Facilitate Generalization and Efficient Task Decomposition in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents equipped with hierarchical memory representations—organizing knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., rooms, objects, quests, subgoals)—can generalize strategies across tasks and decompose complex objectives into manageable subproblems. Such memory structures enable agents to recognize recurring patterns, transfer knowledge, and efficiently solve novel or composite tasks in text games.</p>
