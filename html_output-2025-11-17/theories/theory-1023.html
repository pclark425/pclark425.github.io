                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Entity-Centric Memory Graphs Enable Robust Object Tracking and Manipulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that memory modules structured as entity-centric graphs—where nodes represent objects, locations, and agents, and edges represent relations and actions—are particularly effective for tracking and manipulating objects in text games. Such memory graphs allow LLM agents to maintain up-to-date world models, resolve coreference, and plan object interactions, even under partial observability.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Graph-based memory modules have been shown to improve object tracking and manipulation in text games with many entities. </li>
    <li>Entity-centric graphs allow agents to update and query the state of objects even when not directly observed. </li>
    <li>Coreference resolution in text games is improved when agents maintain explicit representations of entities and their relations. </li>
    <li>Partial observability in text games often leads to ambiguous references, which can be disambiguated by maintaining a structured memory of entities and their states. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While entity graphs are used, their necessity and sufficiency for robust tracking is a novel, formalized claim.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Graph-based memory has been used for object tracking in text games.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the sufficiency and necessity of entity-centric graph memory for robust coreference and state tracking in LLM agents.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents with entity-centric graph memory will outperform those with flat or list-based memory on tasks requiring object tracking and manipulation.</li>
                <li>Entity graph memory will enable agents to resolve ambiguous references (e.g., 'it', 'the key') more accurately.</li>
                <li>Agents with entity-centric graph memory will require fewer steps to solve multi-object puzzles than those without such memory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Entity-centric graph memory may enable agents to generalize to new object types or relations not seen during training.</li>
                <li>Such memory structures may facilitate transfer to non-textual environments with similar relational structure.</li>
                <li>Entity-centric graph memory may allow for zero-shot adaptation to novel game mechanics involving new types of relations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with entity-centric graph memory do not outperform those with unstructured memory on object tracking tasks, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If coreference resolution does not improve with entity graph memory, the sufficiency claim is weakened.</li>
                <li>If agents with entity-centric graph memory fail to plan multi-step object manipulations more efficiently than baselines, the necessity claim is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some text games with very few objects or simple state transitions may not benefit from entity-centric graph memory. </li>
