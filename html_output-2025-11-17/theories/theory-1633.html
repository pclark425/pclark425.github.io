                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1633</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Knowledge Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is fundamentally determined by the degree of alignment between the model's internal knowledge representations and the formalized knowledge structures of the target scientific subdomain. The closer the alignment—achieved through pretraining, fine-tuning, or explicit knowledge injection—the higher the simulation fidelity and reliability.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs may sometimes simulate plausible but incorrect outputs due to overfitting to training data artifacts, not true knowledge alignment. </li>
