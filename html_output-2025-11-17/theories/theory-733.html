                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-733</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Algorithm Activation and Superficial Alignment Theory (Generalization-Error Tradeoff Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs' ability to perform arithmetic is governed by a tradeoff between the activation of latent algorithmic circuits (which enable generalization) and superficial alignment to training data patterns (which can introduce systematic errors). The degree of generalization or error depends on the relative strength of these two processes, which is modulated by the similarity of the input to the training distribution and the presence of surface cues.</p>
