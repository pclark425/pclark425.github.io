                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Domain Specialization Theory for LLM Scientific Forecasting</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs achieve optimal predictive calibration for scientific discovery by leveraging a hierarchical structure of domain specialization, where general scientific knowledge is progressively refined through layers of increasingly specific fine-tuning. The theory asserts that the interplay between broad foundational knowledge and targeted subdomain expertise enables LLMs to generalize across related fields while maintaining high accuracy in specialized prediction tasks.</p>
