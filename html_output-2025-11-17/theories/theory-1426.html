                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as a General Mechanism for Improving LLM Output Quality</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models (LLMs) can systematically improve their output quality through a process of iterative self-reflection, in which the model generates an initial response, evaluates or critiques its own output, and then revises its answer in light of this reflection. The process can be repeated multiple times, with each iteration leveraging the model's ability to identify and correct errors, ambiguities, or suboptimal reasoning, leading to progressively higher-quality outputs. The theory further asserts that this mechanism is general, not task-specific, and can be applied across a wide range of domains and prompt types.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>There may exist an optimal number of self-reflection iterations for each task, beyond which performance degrades due to over-editing or hallucination.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative self-reflection fails to improve or degrades output quality across most tasks, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If certain domains (e.g., highly structured tasks) do not benefit from self-reflection, the generality of the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some tasks may be inherently resistant to improvement via self-reflection, such as those requiring external knowledge not present in the model. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
