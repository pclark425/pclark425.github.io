                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> </p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents using verbal reinforcement learning combined with episodic memory buffers that store self-reflective feedback can iteratively improve their decision-making and task performance in complex text games. The episodic memory stores a limited number of past experiences due to LLM context constraints, but this memory enables the agent to learn from mistakes and adapt strategies without traditional gradient-based training.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Episodic memory buffers store verbal self-reflections that inform future decision-making.</li>
                <li>Verbal reinforcement learning allows the agent to learn from feedback signals rather than weight updates.</li>
                <li>Memory capacity is limited (1-3 experiences) due to LLM context window constraints, restricting the breadth of learning.</li>
                <li>Iterative self-reflection and memory integration lead to improved task success rates over baseline agents without memory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Reflexion agent stores self-reflective feedback in episodic memory buffers updated after each trial, leading to improved performance on the HumanEval coding benchmark and AlfWorld tasks. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6.html#e6.0" class="evidence-link">[e6.0]</a> </li>

                <li>Limiting or removing episodic memory buffers will reduce the agent's ability to learn from past mistakes.</li>
                <li>Incorporating more structured or summarized self-reflections will enhance memory efficiency and agent adaptation.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether expanding LLM context windows to allow larger episodic memory buffers will yield proportional performance gains.</li>
                <li>If verbal reinforcement learning combined with episodic memory can enable zero-shot generalization to novel text game domains.</li>
                <li>Whether episodic memory can be extended to include semantic or procedural knowledge beyond self-reflective feedback.</li>
                <li>If integrating external knowledge sources with episodic memory will further improve agent adaptability and reasoning.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Testing Reflexion agent performance with episodic memory buffers disabled to assess impact on learning and adaptation.</li>
                <li>Comparing agents trained with verbal reinforcement learning to those trained with traditional gradient updates on the same tasks.</li>
                <li>Evaluating if increasing episodic memory buffer size beyond 3 experiences leads to diminishing returns or context overload.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
