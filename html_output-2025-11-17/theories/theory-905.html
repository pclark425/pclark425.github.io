                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management via Utility-Driven Memory Allocation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games should actively manage their memory by allocating storage and retrieval resources based on the estimated utility of information for future decision-making. The agent continuously evaluates the expected future value of each memory trace (event, fact, or summary) and dynamically prioritizes, compresses, or discards information to maximize task performance under memory constraints.</p>
