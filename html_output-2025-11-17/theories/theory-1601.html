                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1601</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Simulation Capacity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is governed by the interplay between model scale, architectural inductive biases, and the complexity of the subdomain's reasoning patterns. Specifically, LLMs have a finite capacity for simulating multi-step, counterfactual, or causal reasoning, and this capacity is a function of both model size and the presence of architectural features (e.g., memory, attention span) that support complex reasoning. Subdomains that require reasoning beyond the LLM's capacity will see sharp drops in simulation accuracy.</p>
