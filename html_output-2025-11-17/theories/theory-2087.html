                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill quantitative laws from large scholarly corpora by hierarchically abstracting, clustering, and synthesizing mathematical relationships described in text, figures, and tables, ultimately generating generalized equations that capture the underlying phenomena across diverse studies.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel, previously unreported quantitative laws by synthesizing across disparate domains.</li>
                <li>LLMs could identify latent variables or hidden relationships not explicitly described in any single paper.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to abstract or generalize equations beyond verbatim extraction, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot integrate information across modalities to improve equation synthesis, the theory would be called into question.</li>
