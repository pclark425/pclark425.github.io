                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Driven Hypothesis Testing</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can not only distill qualitative laws from scholarly corpora, but can iteratively refine these laws by generating, testing, and updating hypotheses through simulated or real feedback loops. The process mirrors the scientific method, with the LLM acting as both hypothesis generator and evaluator, leading to increasingly accurate and generalizable qualitative laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover novel qualitative laws that are not present in the training corpus through iterative hypothesis generation and refinement.</li>
                <li>LLMs may self-correct spurious or biased laws if provided with adversarial or contradictory feedback.</li>
                <li>The degree to which LLMs can autonomously identify and resolve contradictions in candidate laws remains unknown.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve the accuracy or generality of distilled laws after multiple feedback cycles, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If iterative refinement leads to overfitting or loss of generality, the theory's assumptions would be questioned.</li>
