                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representational Compatibility Theory of Procedural Transfer</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how scientific procedural knowledge transfers across different experimental domains and contexts, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Scientific procedural knowledge transfers successfully across domains when the underlying data representations and structural assumptions are compatible between source and target domains. Transfer success is primarily determined by the degree of representational alignment across three key dimensions: (1) feature space compatibility (whether inputs can be meaningfully mapped), (2) structural assumption preservation (whether domain-specific constraints and inductive biases hold), and (3) semantic correspondence (whether learned patterns have analogous meaning). Methods requiring minimal representational assumptions (e.g., general optimization algorithms, statistical distances, attention mechanisms) transfer more broadly than those with strong structural priors (e.g., convolutional architectures assuming spatial locality, diffusion processes on directed graphs). However, methods with strong but appropriate priors can outperform general methods when representational compatibility is high. The theory predicts that transfer effort scales inversely with representational compatibility, and that successful transfer requires either natural alignment, explicit representation mapping, or architectural adaptation.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer success probability increases monotonically with representational compatibility between source and target domains</li>
                <li>Methods with weaker structural assumptions generalize to more diverse target domains than methods with strong priors, but may underperform when strong priors are appropriate</li>
                <li>Successful transfer requires at least one of: (a) natural representational alignment, (b) explicit representation mapping, (c) architectural adaptation to match target structure, or (d) learned representations that capture domain-invariant features</li>
                <li>The effort required for successful transfer is inversely proportional to the degree of representational compatibility</li>
                <li>Domain-specific physical constraints (e.g., free-flow reachability, temporal causality, spatial locality) must be explicitly encoded when transferring to domains where they apply</li>
                <li>Pretrained models can overcome some representational mismatch if they capture sufficiently general features through large-scale pretraining</li>
                <li>Ensemble or hybrid approaches can succeed where single-representation methods fail by combining multiple representation types</li>
                <li>Methods that learn to align representations (e.g., domain adaptation, manifold alignment) can bridge representational gaps that would otherwise prevent transfer</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Attention mechanisms will transfer more broadly than convolutional architectures because they make fewer assumptions about input structure</li>
                <li>Time-series methods from finance will transfer to climate modeling when temporal dependencies are the primary structure</li>

                <li>Domain randomization approaches will transfer successfully to new simulation-to-real problems by reducing reliance on specific representational assumptions</li>
                <li>Pretrained vision-language models will transfer to new multimodal tasks more easily than unimodal models because they learn cross-modal correspondences</li>
                <li>Methods that explicitly model domain shift (e.g., DANN, manifold alignment) will transfer better than methods assuming identical distributions when domains differ substantially</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether transformer architectures will transfer to protein structure prediction as effectively as they did to NLP, given the very different nature of sequence-structure relationships and the importance of 3D geometric constraints</li>
                <li>Whether methods successful in Euclidean domains can be effectively adapted to non-Euclidean manifolds in cosmological data analysis without fundamental architectural changes</li>
                <li>Whether procedural knowledge from deterministic physical simulations will transfer to stochastic biological systems, or if the representational mismatch is too severe</li>
                <li>Whether deep learning methods optimized for high-dimensional data will maintain advantages when transferred to low-dimensional but highly nonlinear scientific domains</li>
                <li>Whether quantum computing methods will transfer to classical optimization problems, or if the representational differences are fundamental</li>
                <li>Whether methods that succeed in supervised settings will transfer to self-supervised or unsupervised settings when representational assumptions change</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding cases where methods with identical representational assumptions show vastly different transfer success would challenge the theory's claim that representational compatibility is the primary determinant</li>
                <li>Demonstrating successful transfer of highly structure-specific methods (e.g., image convolutions) to domains with incompatible structure without any adaptation would contradict the theory</li>
                <li>Showing that representation mapping alone is sufficient without any architectural adaptation in cases of severe structural mismatch would challenge the theory's requirement for adaptation</li>
                <li>Finding that methods with strong structural priors consistently transfer more broadly than general methods would contradict the theory's prediction about generalization</li>
                <li>Discovering that transfer success is primarily determined by factors other than representational compatibility (e.g., dataset size, optimization difficulty) would undermine the theory's core claim</li>
                <li>Finding cases where natural representational alignment exists but transfer still fails would challenge the sufficiency of representational compatibility</li>
            </ol>
