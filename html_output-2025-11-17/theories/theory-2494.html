                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Selective Synaptic Vulnerability: The Proteostatic-Excitotoxicity Balance Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by the balance between intrinsic proteostatic capacity (ability to clear misfolded proteins and maintain synaptic homeostasis) and susceptibility to excitotoxic stress. Neurons with high proteostatic capacity and low excitatory drive are more resilient, while those with low proteostatic capacity and high excitatory input are selectively vulnerable.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing excitatory input to otherwise resilient neurons will render them vulnerable if proteostatic capacity is low.</li>
                <li>Boosting proteostatic mechanisms in hub neurons will have a disproportionate effect on network preservation.</li>
                <li>Chronic pharmacological enhancement of autophagy will shift the pattern of selective vulnerability in the visual cortex.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with low proteostatic capacity and high excitatory input are not more vulnerable than others, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If enhancing proteostatic capacity does not confer protection, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If reducing excitatory input does not alter vulnerability, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of glial-mediated clearance and neuroinflammation is not directly addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential compensatory mechanisms in chronic disease states are not incorporated. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
