                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Abstraction and Compression of Quantitative Laws in Molecular Sciences</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs, when exposed to large corpora of molecular science literature, can abstract and compress complex, multi-source quantitative relationships into concise, generalizable feature–property laws. The LLM acts as a semantic compressor, identifying redundancies, resolving contradictions, and synthesizing minimal sufficient rules that capture the essential quantitative relationships across diverse studies.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously develop new, more abstract representations of molecular features that outperform traditional descriptors.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to compress redundant quantitative laws into more general forms, the semantic compression claim would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot resolve contradictions in quantitative evidence, the theory's conflict resolution aspect would be weakened.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The impact of source quality and bias on the compression and resolution process is not explicitly modeled. </li>
