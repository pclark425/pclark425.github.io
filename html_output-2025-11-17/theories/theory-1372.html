                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models can improve their answer quality through iterative cycles of generation and self-reflection, where each reflection phase enables the model to identify and correct errors, ambiguities, or suboptimal reasoning in its previous outputs. The process leverages the model's internal representations and learned error patterns, resulting in a form of emergent self-optimization even without explicit external feedback.</p>
