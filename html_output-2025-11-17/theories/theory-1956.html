                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that iterative retrieval-augmented LLMs can not only distill candidate qualitative laws but also autonomously validate, correct, and reject them by seeking counter-evidence and updating their hypotheses, leading to a self-correcting, evidence-driven process of scientific law formation.</p>

                <li>LLMs will be able to identify and flag exceptions or boundary conditions in candidate laws.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may autonomously discover previously unknown exceptions or special cases in scientific laws.</li>
                <li>The process may enable LLMs to generate new, more nuanced forms of scientific law that account for exceptions.</li>
                <li>LLMs may develop emergent strategies for hypothesis testing not explicitly programmed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to reject or correct invalid laws despite counter-evidence, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If iterative retrieval does not improve law accuracy or robustness, the self-correcting law distillation law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are unable to identify exceptions or special cases, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of incomplete or biased corpora on the LLM's ability to self-correct is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>Potential for LLMs to overfit to spurious counter-evidence is not explicitly modeled. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
