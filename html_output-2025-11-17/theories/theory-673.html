                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the reliability and validity of evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories depend not only on the evaluation metrics themselves, but also on the coupling between the evaluation process (e.g., prompting, reference use, chain-of-thought, few-shot examples, and human-in-the-loop) and the properties of the LLM-generated outputs. The theory posits that evaluation outcomes are highly sensitive to process variables such as prompt design, inclusion of reference answers, chain-of-thought elicitation, and the use of iterative or self-critique protocols. Furthermore, the theory claims that process-aware evaluation (i.e., evaluation protocols that adapt to the generation process and output type) is necessary for robust, generalizable assessment of LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompt design, reference inclusion, or few-shot examples are changed in an LLM-based evaluation protocol, the evaluation outcome (e.g., agreement with human scores) will change significantly.</li>
                <li>If evaluation protocols are not matched to the generation process (e.g., do not account for chain-of-thought or iterative refinement), they will misjudge the quality of LLM-generated scientific theories.</li>
                <li>If human-in-the-loop or hybrid evaluation protocols are used, alignment with expert judgments and reliability will increase compared to fully automated LLM-based evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If process-aware, adaptive evaluation protocols are developed that dynamically adjust to the generation process and output type, they may achieve human-level or superhuman reliability in evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories.</li>
                <li>If LLM-based evaluators are trained or fine-tuned with process-coupled data (e.g., including chain-of-thought, reference use, and iterative feedback), their robustness and generalizability may surpass current human-in-the-loop protocols.</li>
                <li>If hybrid protocols are scaled to large, open-ended scientific domains, they may enable safe, semi-autonomous scientific ideation with minimal human oversight.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompt and reference variations do not significantly affect evaluation outcomes, the prompt and reference sensitivity law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If process-agnostic evaluation protocols are as reliable as process-aware protocols, the process-output coupling law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If fully automated LLM-based evaluation matches or exceeds human-in-the-loop or hybrid protocols in reliability and alignment, the human-in-the-loop law would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some evaluation settings (e.g., with highly constrained outputs or strong reference answers) may show low prompt or process sensitivity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6147.html#e6147.4" class="evidence-link">[e6147.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6011.html#e6011.2" class="evidence-link">[e6011.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6011.html#e6011.1" class="evidence-link">[e6011.1]</a> </li>
    <li>In some domains, LLM-based evaluators may outperform humans even without process-aware protocols, especially in low-level factuality detection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-6153.html#e6153.0" class="evidence-link">[e6153.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-6165.html#e6165.14" class="evidence-link">[e6165.14]</a> </li>
