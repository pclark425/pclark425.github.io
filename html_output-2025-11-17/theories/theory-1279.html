                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Graph-Text Representation Optimality Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the optimal textual representation for graph-to-text conversion in language model training is one that maximizes both structural faithfulness and the alignment of inductive biases, subject to the constraints of language model tokenization and processing. It posits that there exists a Pareto frontier between structural explicitness and representational efficiency, and that ideal representations are those that lie on this frontier, balancing information preservation with learnability.</p>
