                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when tuned with mission-focused instructions that explicitly guide the extraction and synthesis of scientific laws, can systematically distill high-level theories from large corpora of scholarly papers. The process leverages the LLM's ability to identify, abstract, and generalize patterns across diverse evidence, resulting in structured, interpretable scientific theories aligned with the user's query.</p>
