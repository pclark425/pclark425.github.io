                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Calibration and Fine-tuning Effectiveness Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about alignment between proxy evaluations (LLM-as-a-judge, Likert-style) and expert human review for software development artifacts, including necessary conditions for high agreement.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the effectiveness of calibration and fine-tuning for LLM-as-a-judge systems in evaluating software development artifacts depends on three critical factors: (1) the representativeness and diversity of the calibration dataset relative to the target evaluation space, (2) the alignment between the calibration method (few-shot prompting vs. fine-tuning) and the complexity/subjectivity of the evaluation criteria, and (3) the degree to which the calibration process captures not just expert judgments but also the reasoning patterns and contextual factors that inform those judgments. The theory predicts that high agreement with expert human review requires calibration datasets that span the full range of artifact quality levels, artifact types, and edge cases; that fine-tuning is more effective for complex, multi-dimensional evaluations while few-shot calibration suffices for more objective criteria; and that calibration effectiveness plateaus beyond a threshold of examples unless the additional examples introduce genuinely novel evaluation scenarios or reasoning patterns.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Calibration effectiveness increases with dataset diversity until a saturation point where additional examples provide diminishing returns unless they introduce novel evaluation scenarios.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning produces higher agreement with experts than few-shot calibration for subjective, multi-dimensional criteria (e.g., code maintainability, architectural quality), while few-shot calibration is sufficient for objective criteria (e.g., syntax correctness, test coverage).</li>
                <li>Calibration datasets that include expert reasoning explanations (not just ratings) produce 15-25% higher agreement than datasets with ratings alone, particularly for complex software artifacts.</li>
                <li>The minimum effective calibration set size scales with the dimensionality of the evaluation space: simple binary judgments require 10-20 examples, while multi-dimensional Likert-scale evaluations require 50-100 examples per artifact type.</li>
                <li>Calibration effectiveness degrades when the target evaluation domain differs from the calibration domain by more than 30% in terms of artifact characteristics (e.g., programming language, architectural patterns, complexity level).</li>
                <li>Iterative calibration with feedback loops (where LLM judgments are corrected and fed back into training) converges to expert-level agreement faster than single-pass calibration, typically requiring 2-3 iterations.</li>
                <li>The marginal benefit of fine-tuning over few-shot calibration increases with the complexity of the evaluation rubric, becoming significant (>10% improvement) when rubrics involve more than 5 interdependent criteria.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Few-shot learning in LLMs can achieve strong performance on structured tasks when examples are representative of the target distribution. </li>
    <li>Fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific data improves performance on specialized tasks compared to general pre-training alone. </li>
    <li>The quality and diversity of training data significantly impacts model generalization and performance on evaluation tasks. </li>
    <li>LLM performance on reasoning tasks improves when training includes explicit reasoning chains rather than just input-output pairs. </li>
    <li>Human expert evaluation of complex artifacts involves both explicit criteria and implicit contextual knowledge that may not be fully captured in simple rating scales. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An LLM judge fine-tuned on 200 diverse software artifact evaluations with expert reasoning explanations will achieve 20-30% higher agreement with held-out expert reviews than the same LLM using 50-shot prompting with ratings only.</li>
                <li>For evaluating code quality on a 5-point Likert scale across multiple dimensions (readability, efficiency, maintainability), fine-tuning will outperform few-shot calibration by 15-20%, but for binary pass/fail evaluations, the difference will be less than 5%.</li>
                <li>Adding 100 calibration examples that span edge cases and boundary conditions will improve agreement more than adding 100 examples from the center of the quality distribution, even when the latter provides more total examples.</li>
                <li>An LLM judge calibrated on Python code will show degraded performance (10-15% lower agreement) when evaluating Java code, even when the evaluation criteria are identical, unless the calibration set includes cross-language examples.</li>
                <li>Calibration datasets that include 'near-miss' examples (artifacts that almost meet criteria but fail on subtle points) will produce judges with 10-15% better discrimination ability than datasets with only clear positive and negative examples.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether active learning approaches (where the LLM judge identifies which examples would be most valuable for calibration) can reduce the required calibration set size by 50% or more while maintaining equivalent agreement levels.</li>
                <li>Whether calibration on synthetic software artifacts (generated by LLMs with known quality characteristics) can supplement or partially replace human-evaluated calibration data without degrading agreement with human experts.</li>
                <li>Whether multi-task calibration (training on diverse software artifact types simultaneously) produces judges that generalize better to novel artifact types than single-task calibration, or whether it dilutes specialization and reduces peak performance.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal balance between few-shot and fine-tuning approaches varies with LLM model architecture and size, such that smaller models benefit more from fine-tuning while larger models can achieve comparable results with sophisticated few-shot prompting.</li>
                <li>Whether incorporating uncertainty quantification in the calibration process (training the LLM to express confidence in its judgments) can improve overall system reliability and identify cases requiring human review.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If fine-tuning and few-shot calibration produce equivalent agreement levels across all types of evaluation criteria (objective and subjective), this would contradict the theory's prediction about method-complexity alignment.</li>
                <li>If calibration datasets without expert reasoning explanations produce the same agreement levels as datasets with explanations, this would challenge the theory's emphasis on capturing reasoning patterns.</li>
                <li>If calibration effectiveness continues to increase linearly with dataset size without plateauing, this would contradict the theory's prediction about saturation points and diminishing returns.</li>
                <li>If LLM judges calibrated on one programming language show no performance degradation when evaluating different languages, this would challenge the theory's claims about domain-specific calibration requirements.</li>
                <li>If single-pass calibration produces the same final agreement levels as iterative calibration with feedback, this would contradict the theory's predictions about the benefits of iterative refinement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how to measure 'representativeness' and 'diversity' of calibration datasets in a quantitative way that can guide dataset construction. </li>
    <li>The interaction between calibration effectiveness and the specific LLM architecture or model family (e.g., GPT vs. Claude vs. Llama) is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for temporal drift in expert judgments or evolving best practices in software development that might require recalibration over time. </li>
    <li>The role of prompt engineering and instruction design in mediating calibration effectiveness is not fully integrated into the theory. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
