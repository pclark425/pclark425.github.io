                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Modality Abstraction Advantage Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about optimal curricula for compositional acquisition of commonsense and science procedures in interactive text environments.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that interactive text environments provide a unique advantage for compositional acquisition of procedures because textual/linguistic modality naturally operates at a more abstract level than perceptual modalities (visual, sensorimotor). Text-based representations explicitly encode discrete actions, objects, and relations through symbolic tokens, which facilitates compositional recombination. The theory predicts that curricula leveraging text modality will enable faster compositional generalization because: (1) linguistic tokens naturally abstract over perceptual details, (2) text makes compositional structure explicit through syntax and semantics, (3) language provides consistent labels across different instantiations of the same abstract concept, and (4) text-based learning reduces the burden of perceptual grounding, allowing learners to focus on relational and procedural structure. The theory further predicts that optimal curricula should exploit this modality advantage by progressively increasing linguistic abstraction (from concrete descriptions to abstract action schemas) while maintaining grounding through interactive feedback.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Learners acquiring procedures through text-based interactive environments will show superior compositional generalization compared to learners acquiring equivalent procedures through visual or sensorimotor modalities, when both groups are tested on novel compositions.</li>
                <li>The advantage of text modality increases with the compositional complexity of the task: simple, non-compositional tasks show minimal modality effects, while highly compositional tasks show large advantages for text-based learning.</li>
                <li>Curricula that progressively increase the abstraction level of textual descriptions (from concrete 'take the red pot' to abstract 'take <container>') will outperform curricula that maintain constant abstraction levels throughout training.</li>
                <li>Text-based learning enables zero-shot transfer to novel object instantiations more effectively than perceptual learning because linguistic labels abstract over perceptual features.</li>
                <li>The modality advantage is mediated by the explicitness of compositional structure: text environments that make action-object-relation structure explicit through syntax will show greater advantages than text environments with less structured descriptions.</li>
                <li>Combining text modality with sparse interactive feedback is sufficient for compositional learning, whereas perceptual modalities may require dense feedback or demonstrations to achieve similar compositional generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Language provides a natural medium for abstract, compositional representations that facilitate generalization </li>
    <li>Symbolic representations in AI systems enable systematic compositional generalization that is difficult to achieve with purely perceptual representations </li>
    <li>Text-based instruction and learning can facilitate transfer across different perceptual instantiations of the same task </li>
    <li>Interactive text environments provide explicit symbolic state representations that reduce perceptual complexity </li>
    <li>Language-conditioned learning shows advantages in compositional task learning </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a cooking task domain, agents learning through text descriptions ('chop the onion', 'heat the pan') will show better zero-shot performance on novel recipes than agents learning through visual demonstrations, when tested on recipes requiring novel ingredient combinations.</li>
                <li>Agents trained in text-based interactive environments will transfer learned procedures to visually-grounded environments more successfully than agents trained only in visual environments transfer to text environments, because text learning produces more abstract representations.</li>
                <li>Curricula that gradually transition from concrete textual descriptions ('take the large red pot from the shelf') to abstract schemas ('take <size> <color> <container> from <location>') will produce better compositional generalization than curricula using only concrete or only abstract descriptions.</li>
                <li>In science procedure learning (e.g., chemistry experiments), text-based instruction will enable better transfer across different equipment and materials compared to video-based instruction, because text naturally abstracts over specific perceptual instantiations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be an optimal level of textual abstraction beyond which further abstraction harms learning by removing necessary grounding information - the location of this threshold may vary by domain and learner experience.</li>
                <li>Multimodal curricula that combine text with visual information might show non-linear interaction effects: the combination could be better than either modality alone (synergistic), or the visual information could interfere with the abstraction advantages of text (antagonistic).</li>
                <li>The modality advantage might reverse for certain types of procedures that are inherently spatial or continuous (e.g., tying knots, pouring liquids) where perceptual information is critical and difficult to convey through text.</li>
                <li>Individual differences in linguistic ability or prior experience with formal/symbolic systems might moderate the modality advantage, potentially making text-based learning disadvantageous for learners with limited linguistic skills.</li>
                <li>The advantage of text modality might diminish or disappear when using large-scale neural language models that have been pre-trained on both text and visual data, as these models may have already learned to ground text in perceptual representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If visual learning produces equal or better compositional generalization than text-based learning on highly compositional tasks, this would challenge the core premise of modality abstraction advantage.</li>
                <li>If curricula with constant concrete textual descriptions perform as well as curricula with progressive abstraction, this would challenge the prediction about optimal abstraction trajectories.</li>
                <li>If text-based learning shows no advantage for zero-shot transfer to novel object instantiations compared to perceptual learning, this would challenge the theory's claims about abstraction over perceptual features.</li>
                <li>If the modality advantage does not scale with compositional complexity (i.e., text shows equal advantage for simple and complex compositional tasks), this would challenge the predicted interaction between modality and compositional structure.</li>
                <li>If removing explicit syntactic structure from text (e.g., using ungrammatical word sequences) does not reduce the modality advantage, this would challenge the claim that explicit compositional structure mediates the effect.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to optimally combine text with other modalities in multimodal learning environments, or predict when multimodal learning would be superior to text-only learning. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how different linguistic properties (e.g., language complexity, vocabulary size, grammatical structure) might modulate the modality advantage. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for potential disadvantages of text modality, such as increased cognitive load from parsing or reduced engagement compared to visual modalities. </li>
    <li>The relationship between the modality advantage and the specific architecture of the learning agent (e.g., symbolic vs. neural, with or without attention mechanisms) is not fully specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
