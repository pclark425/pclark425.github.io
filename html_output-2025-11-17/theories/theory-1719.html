                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid and Retrieval-Augmented LLM Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that combining large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented and symbolic modules enables robust, context-aware anomaly detection in lists of data. The LLM provides semantic and contextual reasoning, retrieval modules supply relevant external or historical data, and symbolic modules enforce explicit rules. The hybrid system can detect both statistical and semantic anomalies, adapt to new anomaly types, and provide interpretable explanations by referencing both learned patterns and explicit knowledge.</p>
