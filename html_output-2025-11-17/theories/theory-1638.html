                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1638</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Simulation Fidelity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the fidelity of LLM-based scientific simulation is governed by a hierarchical interplay between model scale, domain alignment, and prompt/context design. Each layer imposes upper and lower bounds on achievable simulation accuracy, with emergent effects arising from their interactions. The theory asserts that simulation fidelity is not a simple function of model size or alignment alone, but is fundamentally constrained by the weakest link in the hierarchy, and that prompt/context design can both mitigate and exacerbate these constraints.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Empirical studies show that increasing model size alone does not guarantee improved simulation accuracy if alignment or prompt design is poor (e.g., GPT-4 vs. domain-tuned smaller models). </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering can dramatically improve or degrade LLM performance, even for large, well-aligned models. </li>
    <li>Domain alignment (via fine-tuning or RLHF) is necessary for high-fidelity simulation in specialized scientific domains. </li>
    <li>In some cases, small, well-aligned models outperform larger, less-aligned models, indicating that alignment can be a limiting factor. </li>
    <li>Prompt/context design can sometimes compensate for moderate deficiencies in model scale or alignment, but only up to a point. </li>

<ol>
    <li>Large, well-aligned models with carefully designed prompts can display sudden jumps in simulation accuracy and new, unexpected behaviors. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a large, well-aligned LLM is given a poorly designed prompt, simulation fidelity will be limited by the prompt, not the model or alignment.</li>
                <li>Improving prompt/context design for a fixed model and alignment will yield diminishing returns once the prompt quality exceeds the model or alignment bottleneck.</li>
                <li>Emergent simulation abilities (e.g., accurate multi-step reasoning) will only appear when all three factors are above a certain threshold.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist 'phase transitions' in simulation fidelity where small improvements in one factor (e.g., prompt design) suddenly unlock new emergent abilities.</li>
                <li>In some scientific subdomains, the minimum-bound relationship may be violated due to unknown synergistic effects, leading to higher-than-expected fidelity.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If increasing prompt/context quality continues to improve simulation fidelity even when model scale or alignment is low, the minimum-bound law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If emergent simulation abilities appear in models with only one or two strong factors (e.g., large scale but poor alignment), the emergent interaction law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of external tools (e.g., retrieval augmentation, calculators) in bypassing the minimum-bound constraint is not addressed. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
