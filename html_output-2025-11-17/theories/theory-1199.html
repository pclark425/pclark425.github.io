                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1199</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Chemical Design via Semantic-Functional Mapping</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on extensive chemical, functional, and application-specific corpora, develop internal semantic representations that map chemical structure to function and application context. This enables LLMs to generate novel chemical structures tailored to specific applications by leveraging learned associations between molecular features and desired properties, even in the absence of explicit reaction or property data.</p>

                <li>LLMs prompted with new application contexts (e.g., novel disease targets or material requirements) will generate molecules with predicted properties matching those contexts.</li>

            <ol>
