                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy: General Error Correction Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that above the capability threshold, language models can identify and correct their own errors through self-reflection, leading to improved answer quality. Below the threshold, self-reflection is more likely to reinforce or propagate errors, as the model lacks the metacognitive ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect outputs.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>High-capability models can identify and correct their own mistakes in multi-step reasoning tasks. </li>
    <li>Self-reflection in less capable models often fails to correct errors and may even reinforce them. </li>
    <li>Iterative self-reflection is most effective when the model can accurately evaluate its own outputs. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law formalizes the empirical trend as a conditional statement.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Error correction via self-reflection is observed in large models.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit conditional law linking error correction to a capability threshold is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Models above the threshold will show a measurable reduction in error rate after self-reflection.</li>
                <li>Models below the threshold will not show significant error reduction, or may even increase error rates.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may be intermediate regimes where some types of errors are corrected but others are not.</li>
                <li>Task-specific training may enable error correction below the general threshold.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models below the threshold consistently correct their own errors, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models above the threshold fail to reduce errors through self-reflection, the theory would be called into question.</li>
