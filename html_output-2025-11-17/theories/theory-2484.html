                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2484</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Connectivity-Driven Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their network connectivity patterns. Highly interconnected hub populations, especially those with long-range projections or high synaptic input/output, are more susceptible to trans-synaptic spread of pathological proteins, while sparsely connected or locally restricted populations are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Disrupting synaptic connectivity pharmacologically or genetically will reduce the spread of aggregates in the visual cortex.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the connectivity of a normally resistant population will render it vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Populations with high local but low long-range connectivity may show intermediate vulnerability.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a highly connected population that remains resistant to pathology would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that reducing connectivity does not alter vulnerability would call the theory into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some highly connected populations are resistant, possibly due to intrinsic molecular defenses. </li>
