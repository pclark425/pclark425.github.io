                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Generalized Language Model Representation and Adaptation Theory for Anomaly Detection in Lists and Tabular Data (GLMRAT-AD)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can learn and represent the statistical, semantic, and relational regularities of lists and tabular data, and that anomalies can be detected as deviations from these learned representations. The theory further asserts that LLMs can adapt their internal representations to new data distributions, enabling robust anomaly detection even in the presence of distributional shift or novel data types.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs can model statistical and semantic regularities in text and structured data, as shown by their ability to predict next tokens and fill in missing values. </li>

    <li>LLMs have been shown to generalize to unseen data structures and can flag entries that do not fit learned patterns. </li>
