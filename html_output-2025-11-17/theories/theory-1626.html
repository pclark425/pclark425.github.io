                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Prompt and Demonstration Structure as a Limiting Factor in LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the structure and explicitness of prompts and demonstrations provided to large language models (LLMs) fundamentally constrain their ability to accurately simulate scientific reasoning and processes. The theory asserts that there are structural, informational, and representational bottlenecks imposed by prompt design, which interact with the LLM's internal representations and pretraining to determine the upper bound of simulation fidelity in any scientific subdomain.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs default to general heuristics or surface-level reasoning when prompts omit domain-specific steps or terminology. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show that including explicit procedural steps in prompts (e.g., chain-of-thought) increases LLM accuracy in scientific tasks. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to prompt engineering literature, the explicit bottleneck framing and its generalization across scientific subdomains is novel.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt engineering and chain-of-thought prompting are known to improve LLM performance, but the explicit framing of prompt structure as a bottleneck is less formalized.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes prompt structure as a limiting factor, not just an enhancer, and ties it to the ceiling of simulation fidelity.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law extends alignment concepts to the specific context of prompt/demonstration structure and LLM scientific simulation.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Transfer learning and in-context learning literature discuss alignment, but not specifically in the context of demonstration structure and LLM scientific simulation.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the necessity of demonstration-representation alignment as a prerequisite for accurate simulation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompts omit domain-specific procedural cues, LLMs will fail to simulate subdomain-specific reasoning even if the underlying knowledge is present.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are fine-tuned on highly diverse demonstration structures, the bottleneck imposed by prompt structure may be reduced or eliminated.</li>
                <li>Emergent LLM architectures with more flexible internal representations may be less sensitive to prompt/demonstration structure bottlenecks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high-fidelity scientific simulation with minimal or unstructured prompts, the theory's bottleneck claim would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If misaligned demonstrations do not lead to systematic errors, the alignment law would be weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs generalize to new scientific subdomains with little or no domain-specific prompt structure, possibly due to emergent reasoning capabilities. </li>
