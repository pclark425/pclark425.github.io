                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most effective when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The process leverages the complementary strengths of humans (domain expertise, intuition, ethical judgment) and LLMs (pattern recognition, rapid synthesis, bias detection) to refine, critique, and validate scientific theories. The theory formalizes the necessity of both human and AI participation, and the importance of feedback loops, for robust scientific theory evaluation.</p>
