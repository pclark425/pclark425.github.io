                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Tool-Mediated Belief Update Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents perform planning with external tools in partially observable text environments, including belief-state updates that incorporate tool outputs and guide shortest-path actions.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents in partially observable environments maintain probabilistic belief states that are systematically updated through tool invocations, where each tool provides specific types of observational evidence that reduces uncertainty in targeted dimensions of the belief space. The theory posits that belief updates follow a structured integration process: (1) tools are selected based on their information gain relative to action preconditions, (2) tool outputs are interpreted as observations with tool-specific reliability weights, (3) belief states are updated via Bayesian-like integration that combines prior beliefs with tool-provided evidence, and (4) updated beliefs guide action selection toward shortest-path solutions by enabling more accurate precondition checking and effect prediction. The theory emphasizes that different tools provide different 'views' into the hidden state space, and effective planning requires strategic tool sequencing to build sufficient belief certainty for goal-directed action.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents maintain a belief state B(s) representing a probability distribution over possible world states s in partially observable environments.</li>
                <li>Each tool t provides observations o with tool-specific observation functions P(o|s,t) that depend on the true hidden state s and the tool's sensing capabilities.</li>
                <li>Tool outputs are integrated into belief states via Bayesian update: B'(s) ∝ P(o|s,t) × B(s), where B'(s) is the updated belief after observing o from tool t.</li>
                <li>Different tools have different observation models: some tools provide precise information about narrow state aspects (high precision, low coverage), while others provide noisy information about broad state aspects (low precision, high coverage).</li>
                <li>Tool reliability is represented by a confidence weight w(t) ∈ [0,1] that modulates the strength of belief updates: highly reliable tools cause larger belief shifts than unreliable tools.</li>
                <li>Agents select tools to maximize expected information gain: EIG(t) = H(B) - E[H(B'|o,t)], where H(·) is entropy, prioritizing tools that maximally reduce belief uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Belief updates are targeted: tools are selected to reduce uncertainty specifically about action preconditions and effects relevant to the current plan, not to achieve complete state knowledge.</li>
                <li>After belief updates, action selection uses the updated belief state to evaluate action feasibility: actions are chosen when E[success|B'] exceeds a threshold, enabling shortest-path planning under uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Sequential tool use follows a diminishing returns pattern: the first tool invocation provides the largest information gain, with subsequent tools providing progressively smaller gains as belief uncertainty decreases.</li>
                <li>When multiple tools provide conflicting evidence, belief updates weight tool outputs by their reliability: B'(s) ∝ [∏ᵢ P(oᵢ|s,tᵢ)^w(tᵢ)] × B(s), where i indexes over tools used.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Research on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) demonstrates that agents must maintain belief states over hidden variables and update these beliefs based on observations. </li>
    <li>Work on active perception and information gathering shows that agents can strategically select sensing actions to reduce uncertainty about environment state. </li>
    <li>Studies on tool use in AI agents demonstrate that external tools can provide observations that reduce state uncertainty and improve decision-making. </li>
    <li>Bayesian inference frameworks provide principled methods for integrating new evidence with prior beliefs to update probability distributions over hidden states. </li>
    <li>Research on sensor fusion demonstrates how multiple information sources with different reliability levels can be combined to improve state estimation. </li>
    <li>Work on information-theoretic action selection shows that agents can use entropy reduction and information gain to guide exploration and tool use. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Agents will preferentially use high-reliability tools early in planning when belief uncertainty is high, reserving low-reliability tools for refinement or when high-reliability tools are unavailable.</li>
                <li>In environments where tools have complementary observation models (e.g., one tool observes object locations, another observes object properties), agents will use multiple tools in sequence to build comprehensive belief states.</li>
                <li>When a tool provides unexpected output that strongly contradicts prior beliefs, agents will exhibit larger belief updates for high-reliability tools than low-reliability tools, even with identical observation content.</li>
                <li>Agents will use fewer tools when prior beliefs are already concentrated (low entropy) compared to when beliefs are diffuse (high entropy), as information gain is lower in the former case.</li>
                <li>In shortest-path planning scenarios, agents will prioritize tools that provide information about states along the suspected optimal path rather than tools that provide information about distant or irrelevant states.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether agents can effectively learn tool reliability weights w(t) from experience in non-stationary environments where tool accuracy changes over time is unclear.</li>
                <li>The optimal strategy for handling contradictory tool outputs when tool reliabilities are unknown or uncertain remains an open question.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist efficient approximations to full Bayesian belief updates that maintain sufficient accuracy for effective planning while reducing computational cost is unknown.</li>
                <li>How agents should balance exploration (using tools to gather information about unknown state dimensions) versus exploitation (using tools to refine beliefs about known relevant dimensions) in complex planning scenarios is not fully understood.</li>
                <li>Whether belief update strategies that work well in discrete state spaces generalize effectively to continuous or hybrid state spaces is uncertain.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents that ignore tool reliability and treat all tool outputs as equally trustworthy perform as well as agents that weight updates by reliability, this would challenge the theory's emphasis on tool-specific confidence weights.</li>
                <li>If agents that use tools randomly (without information gain considerations) achieve similar planning performance to agents that strategically select tools based on expected information gain, this would undermine the theory's information-theoretic foundation.</li>
                <li>If simple heuristic belief updates (e.g., 'if tool says X, believe X completely') perform comparably to principled Bayesian updates, this would question the necessity of probabilistic belief integration.</li>
                <li>If agents that gather complete information about all state dimensions before acting outperform agents that use targeted belief updates focused on action-relevant dimensions, this would challenge the theory's emphasis on selective information gathering.</li>
                <li>If the computational cost of maintaining and updating full belief distributions exceeds the performance benefits compared to simpler state estimation methods, this would limit the theory's practical applicability.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully specify how agents should handle tool outputs that are ambiguous or provide partial information that doesn't cleanly map to belief state dimensions. </li>
    <li>How belief states should be represented and updated in environments with very high-dimensional or continuous state spaces is not fully addressed, as exact Bayesian updates become intractable. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for temporal dynamics where the true world state changes during tool invocation, potentially invalidating observations by the time they are integrated. </li>
    <li>How agents should initialize belief states (prior distributions) in novel environments where no prior experience is available is not specified. </li>
    <li>The interaction between belief updates and learning (how agents should update their models of tool observation functions P(o|s,t) based on experience) needs more specification. </li>
