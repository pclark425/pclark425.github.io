                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Task-Sensitive Fidelity Requirements Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about sim-to-real transfer for scientific discovery agents that specifies environment fidelity requirements and skill-transfer conditions from virtual labs to real robotics labs.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that sim-to-real transfer success for scientific discovery agents depends on matching simulation fidelity to the hierarchical structure of discovery tasks. Scientific discovery tasks naturally decompose into a hierarchy of subtasks with different abstraction levels: strategic planning (hypothesis generation, experimental strategy selection), tactical execution (experimental sequencing, parameter selection, resource allocation), and operational control (physical manipulation, sensor processing, low-level control). Each hierarchical level exhibits different sensitivity to simulation fidelity, with higher-level cognitive tasks being relatively robust to low-level physics inaccuracies, while lower-level sensorimotor tasks require high-fidelity physics simulation. The theory predicts that optimal sim-to-real transfer is achieved through hierarchically-allocated fidelity that matches computational resources to the sensitivity requirements at each level, rather than uniform high fidelity across all aspects. This enables more efficient use of simulation resources and better transfer performance than either uniform low-fidelity or uniform high-fidelity approaches.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Scientific discovery tasks naturally decompose into at least three hierarchical levels with distinct computational characteristics: strategic (hypothesis generation, experimental strategy), tactical (experimental sequencing, parameter selection, resource allocation), and operational (physical manipulation, sensor processing, low-level control).</li>
                <li>Transfer success at each hierarchical level depends on whether simulation fidelity meets level-specific minimum requirements, with higher levels being less sensitive to low-level physics accuracy.</li>
                <li>Strategic-level tasks require only abstract state representations and approximate outcome distributions; they exhibit high transfer robustness even with coarse physics approximations and can succeed with qualitative or discrete simulation models.</li>
                <li>Tactical-level tasks require moderate fidelity in state transitions, timing relationships, and resource constraints, but remain relatively insensitive to precise contact dynamics, sensor noise characteristics, and actuator response details.</li>
                <li>Operational-level tasks require high fidelity in contact dynamics, friction models, sensor noise characteristics, actuator response, and geometric precision to achieve successful transfer.</li>
                <li>The overall sim-to-real transfer success is constrained by the minimum transfer success across all hierarchical levels required for task completion, creating a 'weakest link' dependency.</li>
                <li>Computational resources should be allocated non-uniformly across the simulation hierarchy, with highest fidelity reserved for task-critical operational components and lower fidelity acceptable for higher-level planning.</li>
                <li>Skills and policies learned at higher hierarchical levels exhibit greater transfer robustness and can partially compensate for lower-level transfer failures through adaptive replanning and strategy adjustment.</li>
                <li>The optimal fidelity allocation depends on the specific task structure, with tasks requiring tight coupling between levels needing more uniform fidelity than loosely-coupled tasks.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical decomposition enables more sample-efficient learning by allowing high-level exploration in low-fidelity simulation while reserving expensive high-fidelity simulation for operational-level refinement.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Hierarchical reinforcement learning demonstrates that high-level policies can transfer across different low-level implementations, with abstract skills showing greater transfer robustness than concrete motor skills. </li>
    <li>Domain randomization studies show that abstract task structure and high-level strategies transfer better than precise dynamics, supporting differential fidelity requirements across abstraction levels. </li>
    <li>Automated scientific discovery systems successfully use simplified models for experimental planning while requiring accurate physics for execution, demonstrating hierarchical fidelity requirements in practice. </li>
    <li>Task and motion planning research demonstrates successful hierarchical decomposition where high-level symbolic planning uses abstract models while low-level motion planning requires detailed geometric and dynamic models. </li>
    <li>Progressive neural networks and transfer learning show that abstract representations transfer better than low-level features, supporting the hierarchical sensitivity hypothesis. </li>
    <li>Studies of manipulation tasks show that contact-rich interactions require high-fidelity physics simulation while task-level planning is robust to physics approximations. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A scientific discovery agent trained with high-fidelity operational simulation (>90% accuracy) but low-fidelity strategic simulation (40% accuracy) will outperform one with reversed fidelity allocation (40% operational, 90% strategic) by 30-50% in overall task success, because operational failures cannot be compensated by strategic replanning.</li>
                <li>For liquid handling tasks in chemistry labs, pipetting motion control will require >85% fidelity in fluid dynamics and contact modeling for successful transfer, while experimental protocol sequencing will transfer successfully with only discrete state abstractions and 50-60% timing accuracy.</li>
                <li>Discovery agents with explicit hierarchical policy architectures will demonstrate 2-4x better sample efficiency in real-world deployment compared to end-to-end policies trained with equivalent total simulation time, due to more efficient fidelity allocation.</li>
                <li>In materials science experiments involving sample preparation and characterization, strategic-level decisions (which experiments to prioritize) will transfer with >75% success using only outcome statistics from simulation, while sample manipulation will require high-fidelity contact simulation.</li>
                <li>Training computational cost can be reduced by 50-70% by using low-fidelity simulation for strategic and tactical levels (consuming 20% of compute) while concentrating high-fidelity simulation on operational-level skills (80% of compute), compared to uniform high-fidelity simulation.</li>
                <li>For biology lab automation tasks, high-level experimental design will transfer successfully even when trained entirely in discrete-event simulation, while pipetting and plate handling will require continuous physics simulation with <5mm position errors.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists a universal fidelity threshold function F(h, c, d) where h is hierarchical level, c is task complexity, and d is domain, that predicts minimum required fidelity for successful transfer across all scientific discovery domains.</li>
                <li>If strategic-level policies learned entirely in abstract simulation can successfully guide real-world discovery when operational-level policies must be learned from scratch in the real world due to insurmountable sim-to-real gaps.</li>
                <li>Whether intermediate 'curriculum' simulations with gradually increasing fidelity at each hierarchical level would enable transfer for tasks that fail with single-fidelity approaches, and if so, what the optimal curriculum structure would be.</li>
                <li>If cross-domain transfer (e.g., chemistry to biology to materials science) is possible at the strategic level even when tactical and operational skills are completely domain-specific, enabling 'meta-discovery' agents.</li>
                <li>Whether adversarial training at hierarchical boundaries (where one level attempts to create challenging scenarios for adjacent levels) could automatically identify critical fidelity requirements without manual specification.</li>
                <li>If quantum chemistry simulations could provide sufficient tactical-level fidelity for molecular discovery tasks despite using classical approximations, or if quantum effects must be captured even at strategic levels for certain discovery domains.</li>
                <li>Whether the theory extends to human-AI collaborative discovery, where humans operate at strategic/tactical levels and AI handles operational execution, and what fidelity requirements apply in such hybrid systems.</li>
                <li>If there are discovery tasks where the hierarchical structure is fundamentally flat or inverted (operational decisions driving strategy), and how the theory would need to be modified for such cases.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding scientific discovery tasks where strategic-level decisions consistently require >80% physics fidelity while operational-level tasks succeed with <50% fidelity would contradict the hierarchical sensitivity ordering.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that uniform high-fidelity simulation across all levels produces significantly better transfer (>30% improvement) than hierarchically-allocated fidelity with equal computational budget would question the efficiency claims.</li>
                <li>Showing that end-to-end learned policies consistently outperform hierarchically decomposed policies in sim-to-real transfer across multiple discovery domains would challenge the fundamental decomposition premise.</li>
                <li>Finding that fidelity requirements are primarily task-instance specific rather than hierarchical-level specific, with high variance within levels and low variance across levels, would undermine the theory's generalizability.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that the sim-to-real gap affects all hierarchical levels equally in magnitude and character would contradict the differential sensitivity hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Discovering that operational-level skills learned in low-fidelity simulation transfer better than strategic-level skills learned in high-fidelity simulation would invert the theory's core prediction.</li>
                <li>Finding that hierarchical decomposition actually harms transfer compared to flat architectures due to error propagation or compounding uncertainties across levels would challenge the theory's utility.</li>
                <li>Showing that the 'weakest link' model is incorrect and that transfer success is determined by average performance across levels rather than minimum performance would require theory revision.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
