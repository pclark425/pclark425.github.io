                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as Dynamic Constraint and Information Bottleneck</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the format of a prompt acts as a dynamic constraint and information bottleneck, selectively filtering and shaping the flow of information through the LLM's attention and memory mechanisms. The prompt format determines which aspects of the input are foregrounded or backgrounded, influencing the LLM's ability to focus on relevant sub-tasks, suppress irrelevant details, and manage cognitive load. The effectiveness of a prompt format is thus a function of its ability to optimize the information bottleneck for the specific task and model architecture.</p>
