                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple, interacting disruptions in neural, vascular, and immune networks, rather than from a single pathological trigger. The interplay between amyloid-beta accumulation, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, vascular dysfunction, and synaptic network breakdown creates a self-reinforcing cycle that leads to progressive cognitive decline. Effective detection requires multi-modal biomarkers that capture this network-level dysfunction.</p>
