                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Driven Stochastic Search for Scientific Theory Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large collections of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that systematically exploring the space of prompt variants—using stochastic search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), beam search, or other prompt-variant exploration methods—enables large language models (LLMs) to extract higher-quality, more specific, and more accurate scientific theories from large collections of scholarly papers than static or hand-crafted prompts alone. By varying prompt structure, content, and constraints, and ranking outputs via domain-specific reward functions (which may be LLM-derived or externally computed), the system can escape local optima, avoid prompt sensitivity pitfalls, and uncover non-obvious, high-value scientific laws. The theory further asserts that the effectiveness of this approach depends on the alignment and informativeness of the reward function, the diversity of prompt actions, and the computational resources available for search.</p>

    <li>Monte Carlo Reasoner (MCR) and Monte Carlo Thought Search both show that MCTS-based prompt search outperforms static CoT and ToT prompting in catalyst discovery and scientific reasoning tasks, producing higher reward and more specific, property-focused reasoning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3873.html#e3873.0" class="evidence-link">[e3873.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3879.html#e3879.1" class="evidence-link">[e3879.1]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying MCTS or similar stochastic prompt search to new scientific domains (e.g., genomics, astrophysics) will yield more accurate and specific theory extractions than static prompt templates.</li>
                <li>Reward-guided prompt optimization will outperform random or hand-crafted prompt selection in multi-step scientific reasoning tasks, as measured by domain-specific reward functions.</li>
                <li>Combining prompt-space search with retrieval-augmented evidence (e.g., RAG pipelines) will further improve the quality and factual grounding of extracted theories.</li>
                <li>Prompt-space search will be especially beneficial in tasks where the LLM's output is highly sensitive to prompt structure or where the search space of possible explanations is large.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stochastic prompt search will uncover previously unknown or counterintuitive scientific laws that are later validated by experiments or expert review.</li>
                <li>Prompt-space search guided by external (non-LLM) reward functions (e.g., simulation, experimental data) will outperform LLM-derived rewards in theory extraction, especially in domains where LLMs are prone to hallucination.</li>
                <li>Prompt-space search will remain effective even as LLMs become more instruction-following and less sensitive to prompt variation, or it may become less effective if models become more robust to prompt changes.</li>
                <li>Prompt-space search may enable the discovery of cross-domain or interdisciplinary scientific laws that are not easily accessible via static prompts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If stochastic prompt search does not outperform static or hand-crafted prompts in theory extraction quality (as measured by domain-specific rewards or expert evaluation), the Prompt-Space Stochastic Search Law would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If reward-guided prompt optimization fails to converge or leads to overfitting or mode collapse (e.g., repeatedly selecting the same prompt variant without improvement), the Reward-Guided Prompt Optimization Law would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If prompt-space search produces only marginal improvements over random search or static prompting, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If prompt-space search is found to be ineffective in domains with low prompt sensitivity or where the LLM's knowledge is already well-structured, the generality of the theory would be limited.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some domains or tasks may be less sensitive to prompt variation, especially as LLMs become more instruction-following or as prompt engineering best practices become standardized. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3873.html#e3873.2" class="evidence-link">[e3873.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3879.html#e3879.6" class="evidence-link">[e3879.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Reward functions derived from LLM outputs may propagate hallucinations or biases, leading to optimization for outputs that are not truly high-quality scientific theories. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3873.html#e3873.0" class="evidence-link">[e3873.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational cost and API rate limits may restrict the practical application of stochastic prompt search in large-scale or real-time settings. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3873.html#e3873.0" class="evidence-link">[e3873.0]</a> </li>
