                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Memory Routing and Abstraction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLM agents achieve optimal memory usage by contextually routing information between memory layers based on abstraction level, recency, and task relevance. The agent dynamically abstracts, compresses, or expands memory traces to balance retrieval efficiency, generalization, and specificity, enabling robust performance across diverse tasks and environments.</p>
