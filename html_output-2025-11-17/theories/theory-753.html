                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Modular Arithmetic via Compositional Subspaces in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models implement arithmetic by decomposing numbers into hierarchical, compositional subspaces (e.g., digit-wise or place-value representations), and perform modular arithmetic within and across these subspaces using distributed transformations. This enables efficient, scalable, and generalizable arithmetic computation, including carry/borrow operations, within the model's architecture.</p>
