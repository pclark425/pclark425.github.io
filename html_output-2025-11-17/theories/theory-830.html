                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Deliberative Memory Control Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents can achieve superior task performance by not only employing deliberative and programmatic memory control, but also by engaging in meta-deliberation: the explicit, self-reflective selection and adaptation of memory control strategies based on ongoing task feedback and self-monitoring. The theory asserts that meta-deliberative control enables LLM agents to dynamically reconfigure their memory usage policies, leading to improved generalization, robustness, and adaptability across diverse and novel tasks.</p>
