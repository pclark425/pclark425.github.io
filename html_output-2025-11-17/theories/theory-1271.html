                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1271</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Information Bottleneck Theory of Graph-to-Text Representation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that optimally balances semantic completeness with representational efficiency, minimizing information loss while avoiding unnecessary redundancy. The theory asserts that there exists an optimal 'information bottleneck'—a representation that encodes all information necessary for downstream tasks, but no more, thus maximizing both model learning efficiency and generalization.</p>
