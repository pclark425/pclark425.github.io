                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory states that the Differentiable Neural Dictionary (DND) memory architecture in Neural Episodic Control (NEC) allows the agent to rapidly append and retrieve key-value pairs representing past experiences, which accelerates learning in complex environments like Atari games by enabling quick adaptation to new information during early training phases.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>DND memory is append-only, allowing the agent to accumulate a large set of past experiences without overwriting.</li>
                <li>Context-based lookups retrieve values associated with keys similar to the current state, enabling rapid action-value estimation.</li>
                <li>Memory updates are based on a mixture of on-policy and off-policy returns, improving value estimation accuracy.</li>
                <li>The semi-tabular representation of experience in DND accelerates learning speed, especially in early training stages.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>NEC uses DND memory modules for each action, allowing rapid updates and context-based lookups, resulting in faster learning compared to DQN and A3C. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3.html#e3.0" class="evidence-link">[e3.0]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>NEC agents will show faster initial learning curves than parametric-only agents in new environments with sparse rewards.</li>
                <li>Limiting the size of the DND memory will reduce learning speed and final performance.</li>
                <li>Incorporating mechanisms to prune or compress DND memory will maintain performance while reducing memory footprint.</li>
                <li>Using DND memory for other action-value based tasks beyond Atari will similarly improve learning speed.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether DND memory can be extended to support long-term planning by integrating hierarchical memory structures.</li>
                <li>If combining DND with parametric models can overcome long-term performance limitations observed in NEC.</li>
                <li>Whether DND memory can be adapted for use in language-based text games with symbolic or semantic keys.</li>
                <li>If DND memory architectures can be optimized to handle continual learning without catastrophic forgetting.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Testing NEC performance with DND memory disabled or replaced by parametric memory to assess impact on learning speed.</li>
                <li>Evaluating if DND memory growth leads to computational bottlenecks or degraded performance over very long training.</li>
                <li>Comparing NEC with and without off-policy return updates to determine their contribution to value estimation accuracy.</li>
                <li>Assessing if NEC can maintain performance when DND memory is randomly corrupted or partially inaccessible.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Long-term performance limitations of NEC compared to parametric agents are noted but not fully explained. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3.html#e3.0" class="evidence-link">[e3.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The impact of memory size growth on computational efficiency and scalability is not fully addressed. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3.html#e3.0" class="evidence-link">[e3.0]</a> </li>
