                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory and Reasoning Architectures Enable Scalable and Robust Text Game Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that hierarchical memory and reasoning architectures—where agents maintain both high-level abstract representations and low-level detailed memories—are essential for scalable and robust performance in complex text games. By enabling abstraction, decomposition, and flexible retrieval, such architectures allow agents to manage large state spaces, adapt to dynamic environments, and transfer knowledge across tasks.</p>
