                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) pretrained on vast corpora of scientific literature can synthesize new, explicit quantitative laws by integrating, abstracting, and reconciling findings from multiple scholarly sources. The LLM's internal representations encode latent scientific relationships, which can be surfaced through targeted prompting and structured input, enabling the discovery of generalizable, literature-consistent quantitative models.</p>
