                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Active Memory Management and Compression Theory for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by actively managing their memory through selective retention, prioritization, and compression of information, balancing the trade-off between memory capacity, retrieval speed, and relevance to current goals. The theory draws on analogies to human cognition and information theory, but formalizes these principles for the unique demands of LLM-based agents in interactive, partially observable environments.</p>
