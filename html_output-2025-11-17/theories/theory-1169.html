                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Language-Guided Optimization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be used in an iterative, closed-loop process where language-based feedback (from users or automated evaluators) is used to refine and optimize generated chemical structures for specific applications. The LLM acts as a generative engine, while language-based evaluation and feedback guide the search toward optimal solutions.</p>
