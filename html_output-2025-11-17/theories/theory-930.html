                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured and Modular Memory Enables Generalization and Robustness in LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM text game agents equipped with structured and modular memory systems—where memory is organized into distinct, functionally specialized modules (e.g., episodic, semantic, procedural)—achieve superior generalization to novel tasks and robustness to perturbations. The modular structure allows for selective retrieval, compositional reasoning, and isolation of errors, thereby supporting flexible adaptation and error correction in complex, dynamic text game environments.</p>
