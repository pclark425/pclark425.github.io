                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is achieved through an iterative, interactive process that alternates between automated AI-based screening and human expert review. Each stage leverages the unique strengths of AI (scale, speed, consistency) and humans (deep contextual understanding, creativity, domain expertise). Feedback from both AI and human evaluations is used to refine both the evaluation criteria and the LLM's generation process, creating a virtuous cycle of improvement.</p>
