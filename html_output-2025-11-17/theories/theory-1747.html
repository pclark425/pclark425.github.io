                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Relational Structure Disruption Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models can detect anomalies in lists by modeling the relational structure among items. Anomalies are items that disrupt the expected relational patterns (e.g., semantic, syntactic, or logical relationships) that the language model has learned from data. This theory posits that LMs can implicitly or explicitly model higher-order relationships, and anomalies are detected as items that do not fit into the relational structure of the list.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Language models will be able to detect relational anomalies in lists with complex, abstract, or novel relational patterns.</li>
                <li>Relational structure-based anomaly detection will generalize to lists with multimodal or cross-domain relationships.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If language models fail to flag items that disrupt relational structure, the theory would be challenged.</li>
