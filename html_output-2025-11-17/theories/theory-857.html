                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents can best use memory by organizing it hierarchically, with multiple levels of abstraction. Lower levels store fine-grained, instance-specific information, while higher levels store abstracted, generalized knowledge. The agent navigates this hierarchy based on task complexity and required specificity, retrieving and integrating information from appropriate levels to optimize reasoning and decision-making.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Emergent hierarchical concepts may arise, enabling agents to invent new abstractions not present in training data.</li>
                <li>Hierarchical memory may enable agents to perform zero-shot generalization to novel task structures.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If flat memory structures outperform hierarchical ones on complex tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If abstraction-driven compression leads to loss of critical information, the theory's mechanism would be questioned.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The theory does not address how to automatically discover optimal abstraction levels for new domains. </li>
