                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic-Semantic Memory Integration for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by dynamically integrating two distinct but interacting memory systems: episodic memory (detailed, temporally ordered records of past actions and observations) and semantic memory (abstracted, generalized knowledge about the game world, rules, and object properties). The agent must learn when to retrieve, update, and synthesize information from both systems to support planning, inference, and adaptation to novel situations.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If agents with only one memory type (episodic or semantic) perform as well as those with both, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If adaptive memory updating does not improve performance in dynamic games, the law is called into question.</li>
