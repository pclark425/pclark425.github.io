                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Integration Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve superior task performance by integrating multiple levels of memory—short-term (working), medium-term (episodic), and long-term (semantic)—in a hierarchical and coordinated manner. The theory asserts that optimal task-solving requires agents to flexibly route information between these memory types, leveraging the strengths of each (e.g., rapid updating in working memory, pattern abstraction in semantic memory) and resolving conflicts or redundancies through meta-memory processes.</p>
