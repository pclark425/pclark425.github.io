                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Theory of LLM Simulation Accuracy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the model's internal representations and the epistemic structure of the target subdomain. When the LLM's learned representations, reasoning patterns, and knowledge organization closely mirror the formal and informal structures of the scientific subdomain (e.g., its ontologies, causal models, and discourse conventions), simulation accuracy is maximized. Misalignment leads to systematic errors, regardless of model size or training data volume.</p>
