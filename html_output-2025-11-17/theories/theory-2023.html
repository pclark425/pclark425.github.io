                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, by virtue of their broad training across diverse scientific literature, can identify analogous quantitative relationships in different disciplines and transfer or adapt laws from one field to another. This cross-disciplinary transfer enables the discovery of universal or near-universal quantitative laws, as well as the adaptation of known laws to new contexts.</p>
