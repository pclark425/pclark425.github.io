                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1603</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Generalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the subdomain's representational, linguistic, and inferential structures and those present in the LLM's pretraining data. The more a subdomain's language, concepts, and reasoning patterns overlap with the LLM's learned priors, the higher the simulation accuracy; conversely, subdomains with idiosyncratic or underrepresented structures in pretraining data will see reduced accuracy.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a subdomain's language and reasoning patterns are made more similar to those in LLM pretraining data (e.g., by rephrasing tasks), simulation accuracy will increase.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a subdomain develops new representational conventions (e.g., new symbolic notations), will LLMs adapt if exposed to only a small amount of such data?</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on synthetic data with novel inferential structures, can they generalize to real subdomain tasks with similar structures?</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in subdomains with little or no overlap with pretraining data, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing domain-linguistic alignment does not improve simulation accuracy, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs use general world knowledge or memorized facts to answer correctly despite low domain alignment. </li>
