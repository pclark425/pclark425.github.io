                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1618</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Principle for LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators in scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations (as shaped by its training data and architecture) and the epistemic structure of the target subdomain. When the LLM's learned representations and reasoning patterns closely match the conceptual, methodological, and linguistic norms of the subdomain, simulation accuracy is high; misalignment leads to systematic errors, regardless of prompt engineering or superficial data augmentation.</p>

    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs are more accurate in subdomains with well-represented discourse styles and problem-solving schemas. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law extends known error patterns to a new explanatory mechanism based on epistemic misalignment.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLM hallucinations and systematic errors in unfamiliar subdomains are documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The propagation of errors as a function of representational misalignment, not just data scarcity, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs fine-tuned on subdomain-specific reasoning patterns (not just terminology) will outperform those fine-tuned on surface-level data.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with meta-learning objectives to align with subdomain epistemic structures, accuracy may improve even in low-data regimes.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs achieve high simulation accuracy in subdomains with fundamentally different epistemic structures from their training data, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If prompt engineering alone can fully overcome representational misalignment, the theory is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may generalize via analogical reasoning, achieving accuracy in misaligned subdomains unexpectedly. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
