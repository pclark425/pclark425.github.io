                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs solve spatial puzzle games by abstracting spatial relations and regularities into high-dimensional vector representations, allowing them to generalize spatial reasoning across different puzzle types and formats, even when explicit spatial structure is not present in the input sequence.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs trained on one type of spatial puzzle will perform above chance on structurally similar but visually different puzzles.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize spatial reasoning to non-grid-based puzzles (e.g., graph-based puzzles) if the relational structure is similar.</li>
                <li>LLMs may develop novel spatial abstractions when exposed to puzzles with non-Euclidean or topologically unusual structures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generalize to new puzzle formats with similar relational structure, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If probing fails to reveal any abstract spatial relation encoding in LLMs' representations, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how LLMs handle puzzles with entirely novel or unstructured relational forms. </li>
