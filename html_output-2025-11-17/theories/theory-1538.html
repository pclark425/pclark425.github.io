                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1538</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Localized Causality Loopholes via Quantum Entanglement Networks</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by constructing large-scale, highly entangled quantum networks, it is possible to create localized regions where the effective speed of information transfer exceeds the speed of light, not by transmitting classical information, but by exploiting nonlocal correlations and engineered measurement protocols. These networks could, in principle, be used to coordinate the reconfiguration of spacetime or matter at distant locations, enabling effective FTL travel or communication within the constraints of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p>
