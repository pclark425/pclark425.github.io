                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Inequality Confinement Principle for Macroscopic FTL Spacetime Engineering (QICP-MFSE)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the quantum inequalities restricting negative energy densities can be circumvented at macroscopic scales by engineering spacetime regions with macroscopic quantum coherence and topological stabilization. By coherently confining and phase-locking quantum field fluctuations, and employing topologically nontrivial boundary conditions, it becomes possible to sustain negative energy densities required for FTL spacetime geometries (such as warp bubbles or traversable wormholes) using realistic energy budgets and materials.</p>

    <li>The Casimir effect demonstrates negative energy densities in confined geometries, and recent advances in quantum engineering allow for manipulation of quantum states at macroscopic scales. </li>
    <li>Experiments with macroscopic quantum systems (e.g., superconducting circuits, BECs) show that phase coherence can be maintained over large scales under controlled conditions. </li>
