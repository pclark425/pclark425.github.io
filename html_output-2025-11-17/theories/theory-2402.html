                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience Theory: Cell-Intrinsic Proteostatic and Membrane Defense</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles is governed by intrinsic molecular features, including proteostatic capacity (e.g., chaperone expression, autophagy efficiency) and membrane defense mechanisms (e.g., lipid composition, receptor expression). Neurons with robust proteostasis and membrane properties that limit Aβ/tau entry or aggregation are more resilient.</p>

            <ol>
