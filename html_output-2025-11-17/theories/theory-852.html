                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Memory Utilization Theory for Language Model Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by dynamically modulating the retrieval, storage, and abstraction of memory based on task demands, context complexity, and uncertainty. The agent's memory system should adaptively balance between episodic (instance-based) and semantic (generalized) memory representations, guided by signals of task progress, novelty, and prediction error.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents with static (non-dynamic) memory retrieval outperform dynamically modulated agents on complex, uncertain tasks, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If prediction error-driven memory updates do not improve adaptation or continual learning, the theory's core mechanism would be called into question.</li>
