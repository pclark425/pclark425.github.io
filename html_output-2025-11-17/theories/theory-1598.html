                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1598</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Field-Driven Spacetime Engineering for Practical FTL Spacecraft</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that practical FTL spacecraft can be realized by using advanced electromagnetic field engineering, in conjunction with plasma, to locally manipulate spacetime metrics. The approach leverages known plasma physics and electromagnetic field control, scaled up to spacecraft dimensions, to create a controlled region of altered spacetime (metric bubble) that can be steered and stabilized for hyper-fast transport, all within plausible energy and budgetary constraints.</p>
