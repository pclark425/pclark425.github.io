                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Representation and Verification Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models achieve best strict logical reasoning when they are able to explicitly represent logical forms internally and verify their outputs against these representations. The theory asserts that strict logical reasoning is fundamentally limited by the model's ability to construct, manipulate, and check explicit logical structures (e.g., parse trees, formal proofs) during inference, and that mechanisms for explicit verification (such as internal consistency checks or external proof validation) are necessary for robust logical performance.</p>
