                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by aligning molecular and textual representations in a shared latent space. Through multi-modal alignment, LLMs interpret natural language prompts describing desired molecular properties or applications, and iteratively optimize molecular structures in the latent space to satisfy these constraints. The process leverages the LLM's ability to map between chemical and linguistic modalities, enabling text-guided molecule editing and de novo design.</p>
