                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Realizability via Non-Natário-Class Metric Engineering (General Framework)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that faster-than-light (FTL) travel can be achieved by engineering spacetime metrics that produce a 'warp bubble' using only positive energy densities, specifically by departing from the Natário class of metrics and leveraging advanced matter-geometry coupling. The theory suggests that, by exploiting non-Natário-class solutions to Einstein's field equations, it is possible to create a localized region of spacetime that moves superluminally relative to the external universe, while the local spacetime within the bubble remains subluminal. The approach relies on the manipulation of stress-energy tensors through advanced materials and field configurations, potentially realizable with near-future technology and realistic budgets.</p>
