                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1812</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Probabilistic Representation and Emergent Calibration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs internally encode probabilistic representations of scientific knowledge, and that their ability to estimate the likelihood of future discoveries emerges from the aggregation of these representations across diverse contexts. The theory asserts that calibration of these estimates is an emergent property, sensitive to both the diversity of training data and the prompt's specificity, and that LLMs' probability estimates are most reliable when the prompt context matches high-density knowledge clusters in the model's latent space.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt about a future scientific discovery is highly specific and matches a dense knowledge cluster in the LLM, the model's probability estimate will be well-calibrated.</li>

                <li>If a prompt is highly specific but concerns a knowledge cluster that is internally inconsistent or sparse in the LLM, the probability estimate may be poorly calibrated or erratic.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are fine-tuned on a small, high-quality dataset of scientific forecasts, their calibration may improve even for sparse knowledge clusters.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs provide well-calibrated probability estimates for generic or vague prompts, this would challenge the prompt specificity calibration law.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates are equally accurate regardless of latent knowledge density, this would contradict the latent knowledge aggregation law.</li>
