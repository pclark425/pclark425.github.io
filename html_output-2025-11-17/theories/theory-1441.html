                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task- and Model-Dependence of Self-Reflection Efficacy in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the efficacy of self-reflection in large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally determined by the interplay between the nature of the task (e.g., its structure, complexity, and error surface) and the model's internal capabilities (e.g., representation granularity, error localization, and metacognitive faculties). Reflection is most effective when both the task structure exposes intermediate reasoning steps and the model can represent, identify, and revise these steps. Otherwise, reflection yields limited or inconsistent improvements.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Reflection will yield greater improvements on tasks with explicit intermediate steps (e.g., math, logic puzzles) than on open-ended or creative tasks.</li>
                <li>Augmenting models with explicit metacognitive modules (e.g., error detectors) will increase the gains from reflection, especially on structured tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained to hallucinate plausible but incorrect intermediate steps, reflection may amplify rather than correct errors.</li>
                <li>Reflection may enable models to self-discover new intermediate representations that facilitate error correction, even on tasks without explicit step structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection yields large improvements on tasks with no explicit intermediate steps, this theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models without metacognitive faculties show large gains from reflection on structured tasks, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection leads to creative but incorrect intermediate steps that are not present in the original reasoning. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
