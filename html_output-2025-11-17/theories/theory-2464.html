                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Metabolic-Proteostatic Synergy Model)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective resistance of certain visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by the synergistic cohesiveness of their metabolic and proteostatic pathways. Neurons with tightly coupled energy metabolism, antioxidant defense, and protein quality control systems can more effectively buffer proteopathic stress, while those with decoupled or weakly integrated systems are more susceptible.</p>
