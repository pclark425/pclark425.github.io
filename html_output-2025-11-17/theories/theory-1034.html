                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1034</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Structured Inductive Biases in Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop emergent algorithmic reasoning abilities for spatial puzzle games, such as Sudoku, through structured inductive biases acquired during pretraining. These biases, shaped by exposure to hierarchical, compositional, and spatially-structured data in language, enable LLMs to internally simulate algorithmic processes (e.g., constraint propagation, backtracking) even when not explicitly trained for such tasks. The theory further asserts that LLMs leverage these inductive biases to construct internal representations that mirror the underlying structure of spatial puzzles, facilitating generalization and flexible problem-solving.</p>
