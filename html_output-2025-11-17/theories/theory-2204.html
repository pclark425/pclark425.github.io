                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2204</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the most effective evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories arises from an iterative process in which human experts and AI systems alternate in critiquing, refining, and scoring theories. The process leverages the complementary strengths of LLMs (breadth, speed, pattern recognition) and humans (deep domain knowledge, intuition, ethical judgment), and converges on higher-quality evaluations through repeated cycles. The theory predicts that this co-evaluation process will outperform either human-only or AI-only evaluation, especially for complex or novel theories.</p>
