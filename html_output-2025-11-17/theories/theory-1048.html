                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Synergy: Emergent Hybrid Reasoning in Language Models for Spatial Puzzle Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) solve spatial puzzles, such as Sudoku, by dynamically hybridizing neural pattern recognition with emergent symbolic reasoning. The LLM's neural substrate encodes statistical regularities and spatial priors, while, during inference, the model transiently instantiates symbolic-like structures (e.g., constraint graphs, candidate sets) in its internal activations, enabling it to perform multi-step logical deduction and constraint propagation akin to symbolic solvers. The synergy between these two modes is not hard-coded but emerges from the model's training on language and structured data, allowing flexible adaptation to novel spatial puzzles.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs show no evidence of internal symbolic-like representations during spatial puzzle solving, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot solve spatial puzzles above chance even with extensive language and structured data pretraining, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' performance does not degrade when either neural priors or logical reasoning is ablated, the theory would be undermined.</li>
