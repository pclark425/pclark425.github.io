                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cognitive Load Mediation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format in which a problem is presented to a large language model (LLM) modulates the model's effective cognitive load, thereby influencing its reasoning depth, error rate, and response quality. Formats that reduce ambiguity, segment information, or provide explicit structure lower the cognitive burden on the LLM, enabling more accurate and reliable performance, while formats that are ambiguous, unstructured, or information-dense increase the likelihood of shallow heuristics, errors, or hallucinations.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law synthesizes scattered observations into a formal, predictive relationship.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to rely on heuristics when faced with unclear prompts.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law formalizes the link between ambiguity in format and the shift to heuristic reasoning, mediated by cognitive load.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel format is designed to optimize cognitive load (e.g., adaptive segmentation), LLMs may outperform current best practices.</li>
                <li>There may exist a threshold of format complexity beyond which further structuring no longer improves, or even degrades, LLM performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLM performance is invariant to changes in problem presentation format, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If ambiguous formats do not increase error rates or heuristic responses, the mediation by cognitive load is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs perform well on ambiguous prompts due to memorized patterns or overfitting. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
