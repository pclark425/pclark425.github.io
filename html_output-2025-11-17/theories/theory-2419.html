                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Cellular State Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is primarily determined by intrinsic properties of the neurons themselves, including their gene expression profiles, proteostasis capacity, and stress response pathways. Neurons with lower expression of protective chaperones, impaired protein degradation machinery, or higher expression of receptors facilitating Aβ/tau uptake are more vulnerable, while those with robust proteostasis and stress response mechanisms are more resistant.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with low proteostasis gene expression are not more vulnerable to Aβ/tau pathology, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If overexpression of stress response genes does not confer resistance in visual cortex neurons, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If Aβ/tau receptor expression does not correlate with vulnerability, the theory would be undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some resistant neurons do not show higher proteostasis or stress response gene expression, suggesting other mechanisms may be involved. </li>
    <li>Certain visual cortex neurons with high proteostasis gene expression still accumulate pathology in late-stage disease. </li>
