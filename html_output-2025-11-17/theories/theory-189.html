                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contact-Rich Manipulation Transfer Requirements</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about sim-to-real transfer for scientific discovery agents that specifies environment fidelity requirements and skill-transfer conditions from virtual labs to real robotics labs, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For contact-rich manipulation tasks (assembly, insertion, wiping, grasping, bolting), successful sim-to-real transfer requires: (1) contact dynamics fidelity sufficient to predict contact forces and deformations accurately enough for the task clearance and compliance requirements, (2) friction modeling with coefficients within task-dependent tolerances, (3) either high-fidelity geometry (mesh-level for tight tolerances) or learned residual corrections, and (4) compliance/impedance parameters that match the task requirements or can be adapted. The required fidelity level depends on task characteristics: tight-tolerance tasks (<2mm clearance) require higher fidelity (force errors <15%, friction ±0.1) than loose-tolerance tasks (>5mm clearance, force errors <30%, friction ±0.2). Transfer can succeed with approximate physics if combined with: online adaptation (force-feedback, admittance learning), learned residuals from real contact data, or robust training (domain randomization with unmodeled-effect proxies). The choice between high-fidelity simulation and approximate simulation with adaptation depends on task complexity, available real-world data, and deployment constraints.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For tight-tolerance assembly tasks (clearance <2mm), contact force prediction errors must be <15% and friction coefficients within ±0.1 to succeed without online adaptation</li>
                <li>For moderate-tolerance manipulation tasks (clearance 2-5mm), contact force prediction errors <30% and friction within ±0.2 are sufficient with appropriate control strategies</li>
                <li>Mesh-level geometry accuracy (<1mm error) is required for assembly tasks with <2mm clearance when using rigid-body simulation</li>
                <li>Online adaptation of compliance/admittance parameters can compensate for 50-100% errors in simulated contact stiffness if force feedback is available</li>
                <li>Learned residual models can correct for systematic contact modeling errors if trained on 100-1000 real contact examples, achieving 2-5x improvement over physics-only models</li>
                <li>Explicit penetration detection and prevention in simulation is necessary to avoid policies exploiting simulation artifacts in tight-tolerance tasks</li>
                <li>Force-feedback control reduces sensitivity to contact modeling errors by enabling online adaptation and avoiding position-control instabilities</li>
                <li>Domain randomization of friction (range 0.5-1.5x nominal) combined with unmodeled-effect proxies can enable transfer without system identification for tasks with >5mm clearance</li>
                <li>For deformable object manipulation, FEM-level modeling or learned deformation-to-sensor mappings are required to achieve <5mm position errors</li>
                <li>Tactile-based manipulation requires either physics-based sensor simulation (FEM + optical model) or learned latent projections from physics to sensor space</li>
                <li>Multi-contact scenarios (e.g., multi-fingered grasping) require modeling of load distribution and contact redundancy, not just individual contact forces</li>
                <li>Quasi-static contact tasks are more tolerant of contact modeling errors than dynamic contact tasks, which require accurate impact and restitution modeling</li>
                <li>The choice between high-fidelity simulation and approximate simulation with adaptation depends on: task clearance (<2mm requires high fidelity), available real data (>100 samples enables residual learning), and deployment constraints (online adaptation requires force sensing)</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A screw-insertion task with 0.5mm clearance will require contact force prediction within ±10% and friction within ±0.05 to succeed without adaptation, or will require online force-feedback adaptation</li>
                <li>A cable-routing task with >10mm clearance will succeed with approximate contact modeling (30% force error) if combined with force-feedback control and online trajectory adaptation</li>
                <li>A snap-fit assembly task will require explicit modeling of contact mode transitions (free, contact, snap) and accurate restitution coefficients (±0.1) to avoid simulation artifacts</li>
                <li>A polishing task will require contact force control within ±5N and surface normal estimation within ±10° to achieve uniform pressure, or will require tactile feedback for adaptation</li>
                <li>A multi-fingered precision grasp will require modeling of load distribution across contacts with <20% error in individual contact forces to prevent object slip</li>
                <li>A deformable object manipulation task (e.g., cloth folding) will require FEM-level modeling or learned residuals trained on >500 real deformation examples to achieve <10mm position accuracy</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learned contact models (neural networks, GPs) can fully replace physics-based contact simulation for transfer, or if physics-based models provide essential inductive biases that cannot be learned from limited data</li>
                <li>Whether multi-modal sensing (vision + force + tactile) can compensate for poor contact modeling through closed-loop feedback, and what the minimum required contact model fidelity is when multi-modal feedback is available</li>
                <li>Whether contact-rich tasks can transfer to significantly different materials (e.g., trained on rigid objects, deployed on deformable objects with 10x different stiffness) with online adaptation alone, or if retraining is necessary</li>
                <li>Whether there exists a minimum contact complexity threshold (e.g., number of simultaneous contacts, contact area, or contact force magnitude) below which approximate modeling suffices and above which high-fidelity modeling is required</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid approaches (physics-based simulation + learned residuals) can achieve better sample efficiency than pure learning approaches for contact-rich tasks, and what the optimal balance is</li>
                <li>Whether contact modeling requirements change fundamentally for tasks involving impacts and collisions versus quasi-static contact, and what the critical velocity threshold is</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding a tight-tolerance assembly task (clearance <2mm) that transfers with >50% contact force errors would challenge the force-prediction requirement and suggest that other factors (e.g., compliance, feedback control) can compensate</li>
                <li>Demonstrating successful transfer of a contact-rich task without any friction modeling (or with friction errors >0.5) would challenge the friction requirement and suggest that friction is less critical than assumed</li>
                <li>Showing that position control transfers as well as force control for contact-rich tasks would challenge the force-feedback principle and suggest that accurate forward models can replace feedback</li>
                <li>Finding that coarse geometry (>5mm errors) enables transfer for tight-tolerance tasks (<2mm clearance) would challenge the geometry-accuracy requirement and suggest that other factors compensate</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that domain randomization alone (without system identification or online adaptation) enables transfer for tasks with <1mm clearance would challenge the high-fidelity requirement for tight-tolerance tasks</li>
                <li>Finding that learned residuals trained on <50 real examples achieve similar performance to those trained on >1000 examples would challenge the sample-complexity assumptions</li>
                <li>Showing that policies trained without explicit penetration detection transfer successfully to tight-tolerance assembly would challenge the artifact-prevention requirement</li>
