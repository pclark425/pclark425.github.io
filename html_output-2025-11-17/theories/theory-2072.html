                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2072</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Scientific Law Synthesis via Multi-Modal Reasoning and Data Integration</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can synthesize quantitative scientific laws by integrating information from text, figures, tables, and code in scholarly papers, using multi-modal reasoning to extract, correlate, and formalize relationships. The process involves LLMs parsing diverse data modalities, aligning variable definitions, and constructing symbolic representations that are validated and refined through simulation or empirical feedback.</p>
