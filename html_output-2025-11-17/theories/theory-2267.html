                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should be conducted through an iterative, multi-dimensional process that integrates criteria from philosophy of science, computational verification, and community feedback. The process involves repeated cycles of assessment across dimensions such as logical coherence, empirical adequacy, novelty, explanatory power, and potential for falsification, with each cycle refining the evaluation based on new evidence and expert/community input.</p>
