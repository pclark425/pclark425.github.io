                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Explicit Symbolic Interface Theory for LM Logical Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that language models can best perform strict logical reasoning when equipped with an explicit, external symbolic interface that allows them to represent, manipulate, and verify logical forms and inference steps outside of their native distributed representations. The theory posits that such an interface enables precise, verifiable logical operations and reduces errors due to representational ambiguity.</p>
