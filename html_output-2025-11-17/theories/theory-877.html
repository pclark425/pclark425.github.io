                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Reflective-Abstractive Memory Theory for Adaptive LLM Agent Task Solving</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve adaptive, long-term task-solving by organizing memory into a hierarchy of reflective and abstractive processes. At lower levels, episodic experiences are filtered and consolidated through reflection; at higher levels, abstractions and schemas are formed and updated. This hierarchical structure allows agents to flexibly retrieve, update, and generalize knowledge, supporting both stability (retaining important knowledge) and plasticity (adapting to new tasks) over time.</p>
