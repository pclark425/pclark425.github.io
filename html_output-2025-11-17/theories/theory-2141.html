                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hybrid Symbolic-LLM Distillation Theory (HSLDT): Dual-Process Theory of Scholarly Knowledge Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the most effective method for distilling scientific theories from large corpora of scholarly papers is a hybrid approach that combines the pattern recognition and abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the explicit, structured reasoning of symbolic systems. The LLM identifies candidate concepts, relationships, and patterns across papers, while the symbolic system formalizes, tests, and refines these into explicit, machine-interpretable theories. The interaction between these two systems enables both broad coverage and rigorous logical consistency, resulting in more robust and generalizable scientific theories.</p>
