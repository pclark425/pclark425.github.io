                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Prompt-Refinement Framework for LLM Quantitative Law Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the extraction of quantitative laws from scholarly corpora by LLMs is most effective when guided by an iterative prompt-refinement process. In this framework, initial LLM outputs are evaluated for accuracy and completeness, and subsequent prompts are refined based on feedback, error analysis, or targeted queries. This iterative process enables the LLM to converge on more precise, generalizable, and robust quantitative laws, even in the presence of noisy or incomplete data.</p>
