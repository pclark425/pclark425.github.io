                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness and Modality Integration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ability of large language models (LLMs) to synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications is fundamentally governed by two interdependent factors: (1) the robustness of their internal chemical representations (i.e., their capacity to maintain chemically meaningful structure and relationships under perturbation or generalization), and (2) their ability to integrate and reason across multiple modalities (e.g., text, molecular graphs, property tables, and application constraints). The theory asserts that only when both representation robustness and modality integration are sufficiently high can LLMs reliably generate novel, valid, and application-relevant molecules.</p>

    <li>Multimodal integration (e.g., combining SMILES, molecular graphs, and property tables) improves the alignment of generated molecules with application constraints. </li>
