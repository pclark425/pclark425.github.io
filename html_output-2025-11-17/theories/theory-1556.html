                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1556</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Engineering for FTL Corridors</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that by engineering the quantum vacuum (e.g., via Casimir-like effects or dynamic modulation of vacuum energy), it is possible to create transient, low-energy corridors in spacetime where the effective speed of light is locally increased. Spacecraft traversing these engineered corridors would experience effective FTL travel relative to external observers, without violating local causality. The approach leverages advances in quantum field manipulation, nanotechnology, and high-intensity field generation, and aims to achieve FTL effects with energy requirements within the reach of near-future technology.</p>
