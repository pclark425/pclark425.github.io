                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories should be conducted through a multi-dimensional meta-evaluative framework, integrating criteria from philosophy of science, empirical validation, and computational epistemology. The framework posits that LLM-generated theories must be assessed not only for empirical adequacy and internal consistency, but also for their explanatory depth, novelty, falsifiability, and alignment with scientific reasoning processes. The framework further asserts that the evaluation process itself should be transparent, reproducible, and subject to meta-evaluation.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Philosophy of science (e.g., Popper, Kuhn, Lakatos) emphasizes empirical adequacy, falsifiability, and explanatory power as core criteria for theory evaluation. </li>
    <li>LLMs can generate plausible but internally inconsistent or unfalsifiable theories, necessitating multi-criteria evaluation. </li>
    <li>Computational epistemology highlights the need for reproducibility and transparency in evaluation processes. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: orange; font-weight: bold;">somewhat-related-to-existing</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law synthesizes established scientific evaluation criteria into a new, systematic framework for LLM-generated theories.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Multi-criteria evaluation is established in philosophy of science, but not systematically applied to LLM-generated theories.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> Integrating these criteria into a formal, meta-evaluative framework for LLM-generated scientific theories is novel.</p>
