                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1643</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Alignment-Scale Tradeoff Theory for LLM Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that there is a fundamental tradeoff between model scale and alignment specificity in determining the simulation fidelity of LLMs for scientific subdomains. As model scale increases, the marginal benefit of further alignment (e.g., fine-tuning, RLHF) decreases, and vice versa. The optimal simulation fidelity is achieved at a balance point determined by the subdomain's knowledge structure and the LLM's pretraining distribution.</p>
