                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortex neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and function within local and global neural networks. Neurons with high synaptic connectivity, metabolic demand, or participation in recurrent excitatory circuits are more susceptible to pathological aggregation due to increased activity-dependent stress, while sparsely connected or inhibitory neurons are more resistant.</p>

                <li>Longitudinal imaging will reveal that neurons shifting from low to high network centrality over time become more vulnerable to pathology.</li>
                <li>Manipulating network topology in the visual cortex will alter the spatial pattern of amyloid and tau deposition.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If highly connected and active visual cortex neurons are not more vulnerable to pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex are found to be equally or more vulnerable than excitatory neurons, the theory would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If altering network activity does not affect vulnerability to amyloid-β and tau pathology, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some low-activity or inhibitory neurons may still accumulate pathology due to intrinsic molecular factors not explained by network position. </li>
    <li>Developmental or age-related changes in network topology may alter vulnerability in ways not fully captured by this theory. </li>
