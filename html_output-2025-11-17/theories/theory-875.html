                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Reinstatement and Adaptive Memory Retrieval</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents maximize task performance by adaptively retrieving memories based on contextual similarity and task goals. The agent uses a context-matching mechanism to reinstate relevant past experiences, modulating retrieval strength according to the degree of match and the current task objective. This enables flexible reuse of knowledge and rapid adaptation to novel situations.</p>
