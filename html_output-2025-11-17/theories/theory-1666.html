                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain-Alignment Generalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The accuracy of LLMs as text-based simulators for scientific subdomains is primarily determined by the degree of alignment between the LLM's internal representations and the epistemic, methodological, and linguistic structures of the target subdomain. When the LLM's training data and architecture encode patterns, reasoning styles, and knowledge structures that closely match those of the subdomain, simulation accuracy is maximized. Misalignment leads to systematic errors, hallucinations, or failures to capture domain-specific nuances.</p>
