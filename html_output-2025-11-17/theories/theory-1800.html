                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory: Dynamic Knowledge Integration Model</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs equipped with retrieval modules dynamically integrate internal and external knowledge to generate probabilistic forecasts about future scientific discoveries. The integration process is not static: the LLM's internal representations are continuously updated as new evidence is retrieved, allowing for adaptive reasoning. The theory posits that the temporal sequence and recency of retrieved evidence, as well as the LLM's ability to reconcile conflicting information, are critical determinants of forecast reliability.</p>
