                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Relevance Memory Theory for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents in text games should prioritize memory retrieval and storage based on the contextual relevance of information to the current task, using learned or adaptive mechanisms to assess and update the relevance of memory traces as the game progresses. The agent continuously evaluates which memories are most likely to inform successful action in the present context, rather than relying solely on recency or frequency.</p>
