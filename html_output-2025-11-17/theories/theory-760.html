                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic by leveraging emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities that arise from exposure to vast textual data, allowing them to approximate arithmetic operations through learned patterns, heuristics, and internal representations, rather than explicit symbolic computation.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will perform better on arithmetic problems that closely resemble patterns seen in their training data.</li>
                <li>LLMs will make systematic, repeatable errors on arithmetic problems that deviate from common patterns in the training set.</li>
                <li>Increasing the diversity and complexity of arithmetic examples in training will improve LLM arithmetic performance.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are exposed to entirely novel arithmetic operations (e.g., base-7 addition), their performance will depend on the similarity of these operations to known patterns.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are trained on adversarially generated arithmetic data, their emergent reasoning abilities may shift or degrade unpredictably.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can perform perfect arithmetic on problems far outside their training distribution, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs show no improvement with increased arithmetic data in training, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can perform multi-step arithmetic with high accuracy, suggesting possible internal algorithmic representations beyond simple heuristics. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
