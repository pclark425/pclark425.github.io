                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Preference-Hard Negative Feedback Loop for Logical Reasoning Robustness</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that robust multi-step logical reasoning in language models emerges from an iterative feedback loop: preference optimization over reasoning chains is alternated with the generation and incorporation of increasingly challenging hard negatives. This dynamic process continually sharpens the model's logical discrimination and generalization by adaptively targeting its current weaknesses.</p>
