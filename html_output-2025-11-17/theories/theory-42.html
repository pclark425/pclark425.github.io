                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The advantage of blocked over interleaved training for learning tasks with overlapping stimuli but different rules arises specifically from the temporal autocorrelation structure of context signals during blocked schedules. When context signals are temporally autocorrelated (sustained over many trials in blocked training), unsupervised Hebbian plasticity mechanisms can effectively orthogonalize the synaptic weight vectors associated with different contexts. This occurs because Hebbian rules like Oja's rule converge to principal components of the input covariance structure, and temporally sustained contexts create distinct covariance patterns. In contrast, rapidly switching contexts during interleaved training prevent Hebbian mechanisms from discovering and orthogonalizing these patterns because the covariance structure is mixed. The sluggish (exponentially decaying) nature of context signals further enhances this effect by providing a temporal integration window that smooths over trial-to-trial noise during blocked training but blurs context boundaries during interleaved training. This mechanism specifically explains why humans benefit from blocking while standard artificial neural networks (which lack Hebbian mechanisms and context gating) suffer catastrophic forgetting under the same conditions.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Blocked training creates temporally autocorrelated context signals that enable Hebbian plasticity to orthogonalize task representations</li>
                <li>The degree of temporal autocorrelation in context signals is proportional to the degree of representational orthogonalization achieved</li>
                <li>Interleaved training prevents orthogonalization because rapidly switching contexts create mixed covariance structures that Hebbian mechanisms cannot separate</li>
                <li>Sluggish (exponentially decaying) context signals enhance orthogonalization during blocked training by providing temporal integration, but blur context boundaries during interleaved training</li>
                <li>The blocked training advantage requires both Hebbian plasticity mechanisms and context-dependent gating; either alone is insufficient</li>
                <li>Standard supervised learning (gradient descent) without Hebbian components cannot produce the blocked training advantage and instead suffers catastrophic forgetting</li>
                <li>The timescale of context signal decay must match the timescale of task blocks for optimal orthogonalization</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Blocked training improves human performance on interleaved tests compared to interleaved training for context-dependent categorization tasks <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.0" class="evidence-link">[e228.0]</a> </li>
    <li>Computational models with Hebbian updates and sluggish context signals reproduce human blocked-learning advantages by producing anticorrelated task inputs and partitioned hidden units <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.7" class="evidence-link">[e228.7]</a> </li>
    <li>Oja's Hebbian rule orthogonalizes weight vectors for temporally independent inputs, providing a mechanistic basis for context-dependent partitioning <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.8" class="evidence-link">[e228.8]</a> </li>
    <li>Standard artificial neural networks show catastrophic forgetting under blocked training, contrasting with human performance <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Manipulating the temporal autocorrelation of context signals (e.g., by varying block length) should systematically modulate the blocked training advantage: longer blocks should produce stronger advantages up to a saturation point</li>
                <li>Artificially decorrelating context signals during blocked training (e.g., by adding noise or jitter) should reduce or eliminate the blocked training advantage</li>
                <li>The timescale of context signal decay (if measurable via neural recordings or inferred from behavior) should correlate with individual differences in blocked training benefits</li>
                <li>Tasks with naturally more distinct context signals should show larger blocked training advantages than tasks with subtle context differences</li>
                <li>Pharmacological or genetic manipulations that enhance Hebbian plasticity should increase the blocked training advantage</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There might be an optimal block length that balances temporal autocorrelation (favoring orthogonalization) against forgetting or drift (favoring shorter blocks); this optimum might depend on task difficulty and individual differences</li>
                <li>Artificially imposing temporally autocorrelated context signals during interleaved training (e.g., through sustained cues or neuromodulation) might rescue the interleaved training deficit, but could also interfere with natural task switching</li>
                <li>The mechanism might generalize beyond binary contexts to hierarchical or continuous context spaces, but the geometry of orthogonalization in high-dimensional context spaces is unknown</li>
                <li>Context signal timescales might be adaptive and adjust based on task statistics; if so, the learning dynamics of this meta-learning process are unknown</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If blocking context signals (e.g., through prefrontal disruption) does not eliminate the blocked training advantage, this would challenge the necessity of context gating</li>
                <li>If blocked training with very short blocks (approaching interleaved) still produces the same advantage as long blocks, this would challenge the role of temporal autocorrelation</li>
                <li>If artificial neural networks with Hebbian mechanisms but no context gating show the blocked training advantage, this would challenge the necessity of context signals</li>
                <li>If the timescale of context signals does not match the timescale of behavioral benefits, this would question the mechanistic link</li>
                <li>If Hebbian plasticity is blocked but the blocked training advantage persists, this would challenge the mechanistic role of Hebbian learning</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain how context signals are generated or maintained in the brain, or which neural systems implement them <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.7" class="evidence-link">[e228.7]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction between this mechanism and hippocampal consolidation processes is not specified <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.5" class="evidence-link">[e228.5]</a> </li>
    <li>Why artificial neural networks suffer catastrophic forgetting under blocked training (opposite to humans) is explained by the absence of Hebbian mechanisms, but the theory does not address whether other mechanisms could also prevent this <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Individual differences in the magnitude of the blocked training advantage are not explained <a href="../results/extraction-result-228.html#e228.6" class="evidence-link">[e228.6]</a> </li>
