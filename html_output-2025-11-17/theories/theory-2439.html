                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Cellular Stress Response Capacity Determines Selective Vulnerability in Visual Cortex Neurons</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the selective vulnerability or resistance of neuronal populations in the visual cortex to amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles is governed by the intrinsic capacity of each population to mount adaptive cellular stress responses, including proteostasis, antioxidant defense, and unfolded protein response. Neurons with robust stress response machinery are more resistant, while those with limited capacity are more vulnerable to pathological protein aggregation.</p>
