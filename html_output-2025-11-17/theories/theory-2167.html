                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Constraint-Guided Synthesis Theory of LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can distill scientific theories from scholarly papers by synthesizing candidate theories that are explicitly constrained by (a) the logical structure of the literature, (b) user-specified desiderata, and (c) internal consistency checks. The LLM acts as a constraint-satisfying synthesizer, generating and evaluating candidate theories against these constraints, and selecting those that best fit the evidence and requirements.</p>

    <li>LLMs can be prompted to follow explicit instructions and constraints, and can check for logical consistency in generated text. </li>
    <li>Constraint satisfaction is a core principle in symbolic AI and program synthesis, and LLMs have demonstrated some ability to emulate this behavior. </li>
    <li>Recent work shows LLMs can be guided by user-specified desiderata, such as factuality, coverage, or style, when generating summaries or syntheses. </li>
