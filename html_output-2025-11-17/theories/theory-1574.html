                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1574</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Field Resonance Propulsion</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by inducing resonant oscillations in quantum fields at macroscopic scales, it is possible to create spacetime distortions that enable effective FTL travel. The approach leverages advances in high-Q resonators, quantum coherence, and field amplification to generate transient, localized metric fluctuations that can be harnessed for propulsion.</p>
