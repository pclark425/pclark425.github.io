                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what LLM-as-a-judge style evaluations lose compared to human evaluations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Fine-tuned LLM judges, especially those trained on narrow evaluation schemes or with limited prompt diversity, become overfit to specific prompt formats and lose general instruction-following and aspect-specific evaluation capabilities. This overfitting leads to sharp drops in performance when evaluated on out-of-distribution prompts, aspect-specific tasks, or when required to generalize to new evaluation schemes. Prompt sensitivity is a key failure mode: small changes in prompt wording, format, or inclusion of examples can cause large, unpredictable shifts in agreement with human judgments. This theory is specific to fine-tuned LLM judges (as opposed to generalist LLMs like GPT-4), and is supported by extensive evidence of format bias, prompt ablation effects, and cross-scheme failures.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Fine-tuned judges lose general instruction-following and aspect-specific evaluation; cross-scheme performance drops sharply; format bias is severe. Classification-style judges produce similar outputs to each other but differ systematically from GPT-4 judgments; models lose generative/instruction-generalization ability and behave like narrow classifiers tied to their supervision signals. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3871.html#e3871.0" class="evidence-link">[e3871.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3871.html#e3871.4" class="evidence-link">[e3871.4]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4016.html#e4016.3" class="evidence-link">[e4016.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Prompt ablations show large differences in alignment with humans; additive prompts outperform multiple-choice, and mismatched formats cause large drops. Poor prompt choice can drastically reduce or invert agreement with humans; uncalibrated prompts can lead to systematically wrong or anti-correlated judgments. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4007.html#e4007.1" class="evidence-link">[e4007.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4015.html#e4015.2" class="evidence-link">[e4015.2]</a> </li>
    <li>Format bias: models fine-tuned with references perform poorly when evaluated without references and vice versa (mismatched formats can cause large drops in agreement/consistency and increase delta-bias up to ~26.63% in some settings). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4016.html#e4016.3" class="evidence-link">[e4016.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Vanilla instruction models (e.g., Vicuna-13B) sometimes fail to produce usable scores (77% failure rate reported) when prompt format mismatches fine-tuning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4016.html#e4016.3" class="evidence-link">[e4016.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Aspect-specific evaluation: fine-tuned judges perform substantially worse than GPT-4, often failing to learn correlations between aspects and evaluation results, and do not improve when provided aspect-specific prompts. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3871.html#e3871.2" class="evidence-link">[e3871.2]</a> </li>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prompt design (few-shot, explicit instructions) materially changes kappa agreement; some prompts help one model but hurt others. For example, on KILT NQ, GPT-4 kappa ranges from 0.518 (zero-shot) to 0.725 ('don't overthink'). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4015.html#e4015.2" class="evidence-link">[e4015.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4007.html#e4007.1" class="evidence-link">[e4007.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Prompt ablation: additive (score-counting) prompt yields much higher agreement with humans than multiple-choice prompt (pairwise accuracy 65.1% vs 26.6%, Spearman 0.25 vs -0.18). <a href="../results/extraction-result-4007.html#e4007.1" class="evidence-link">[e4007.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Prompting strategies (CoT, ICL) have little or negative effect on fine-tuned judges, and can even degrade performance, while proprietary models benefit. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3871.html#e3871.3" class="evidence-link">[e3871.3]</a> </li>
    <li>Prompt sensitivity is also observed in generalist LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), but fine-tuned judges are especially brittle: prompt changes can cause large, unpredictable shifts in agreement. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4012.html#e4012.0" class="evidence-link">[e4012.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4012.html#e4012.1" class="evidence-link">[e4012.1]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a fine-tuned LLM judge is evaluated on a new task with a prompt format not seen during training, its agreement with human judgments will drop sharply, and it may fail to produce valid outputs.</li>
                <li>If the prompt for a fine-tuned judge is modified (e.g., from additive scoring to multiple-choice), the judge's ranking of outputs will change unpredictably, and correlation with human judgments will decrease.</li>
                <li>If a fine-tuned judge is retrained with a diverse set of prompt formats and evaluation schemes, its prompt sensitivity will decrease and generalization will improve.</li>
                <li>If a fine-tuned judge is used for aspect-specific evaluation (e.g., factuality, toxicity) with prompts differing from its training, it will perform poorly compared to a generalist LLM like GPT-4.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a future fine-tuned judge is trained with meta-learning or prompt-agnostic objectives, it is unknown whether prompt sensitivity and format overfitting will be eliminated.</li>
                <li>If a judge is fine-tuned on a mixture of human and LLM-generated evaluation data, it is unknown whether prompt sensitivity will be reduced or new biases will emerge.</li>
                <li>If prompt sensitivity is tested in non-English or multimodal settings, it is unknown whether similar overfitting and sensitivity patterns will occur.</li>
                <li>If fine-tuned judges are trained with adversarial prompt augmentation, it is unknown whether they will generalize to unseen adversarial attacks or only to the seen ones.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a fine-tuned judge, when evaluated on out-of-format prompts, maintains high agreement with human judgments, this would challenge the format overfitting law.</li>
                <li>If prompt variants do not cause substantial changes in judge-human agreement, this would challenge the prompt sensitivity law.</li>
                <li>If a fine-tuned judge can generalize to aspect-specific evaluation tasks without explicit retraining, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If a fine-tuned judge, when exposed to new evaluation schemes, maintains or improves its agreement with humans, this would challenge the theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) retain instruction-following and benefit from prompt engineering, unlike fine-tuned open judges. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 show improvements from CoT and ICL, while fine-tuned judges do not. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3871.html#e3871.3" class="evidence-link">[e3871.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4012.html#e4012.0" class="evidence-link">[e4012.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4012.html#e4012.1" class="evidence-link">[e4012.1]</a> </li>
    <li>JudgeLM-33B, when fine-tuned with swap augmentation and reference support, achieves high agreement and consistency even on some out-of-distribution tasks, suggesting that prompt diversity and augmentation during fine-tuning can mitigate format overfitting. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4016.html#e4016.0" class="evidence-link">[e4016.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4016.html#e4016.1" class="evidence-link">[e4016.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Some open-source fine-tuned judges (e.g., PandaLM-70B) can outperform GPT-4 on certain test sets, possibly due to tailored training and noise mitigation. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4011.html#e4011.3" class="evidence-link">[e4011.3]</a> </li>
