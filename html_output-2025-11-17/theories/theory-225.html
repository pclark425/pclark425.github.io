                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Task World Model Synergy Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how agents can use memory to help solve text games.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that agents learning multiple text games simultaneously develop world models where knowledge components from different tasks create synergistic effects that enhance overall performance beyond what would be achieved by learning tasks independently. The synergy arises through three mechanisms: (1) cross-task pattern reinforcement, where similar patterns across games strengthen each other's representations; (2) complementary knowledge integration, where unique aspects of different games fill gaps in the world model; and (3) interference-driven refinement, where conflicts between task-specific knowledge force the agent to develop more robust, generalizable representations. The theory predicts that carefully selected task combinations will produce superadditive learning benefits, while poorly matched tasks may produce subadditive effects due to negative interference.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When an agent learns multiple text games simultaneously, patterns that appear in multiple games (e.g., 'containers can be opened', 'keys unlock doors') will be learned faster and represented more robustly than patterns that appear in only one game.</li>
                <li>The world model will develop a shared core of common knowledge (object types, action effects, causal relationships) that is accessible to all tasks, plus task-specific extensions for unique game mechanics.</li>
                <li>Learning performance on a new task will be enhanced when the agent has previously learned tasks that share complementary knowledge components, creating positive transfer through knowledge integration.</li>
                <li>When two tasks contain conflicting patterns (e.g., different rules for the same action), the agent will be forced to develop context-dependent representations that are more flexible and generalizable than those learned from a single task.</li>
                <li>The magnitude of synergistic benefit is proportional to the degree of partial overlap between tasks: tasks with no overlap provide no synergy, tasks with complete overlap provide redundant information, and tasks with moderate overlap provide maximal synergy.</li>
                <li>Multi-task world models will exhibit better sample efficiency on new tasks compared to single-task models because the shared knowledge base reduces the amount of task-specific learning required.</li>
                <li>Memory retrieval in multi-task world models will prioritize shared knowledge components over task-specific components when both are applicable, leading to more consistent behavior across similar situations in different games.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Multi-task learning in neural networks demonstrates that learning related tasks simultaneously can improve performance on individual tasks compared to learning them separately. </li>
    <li>Transfer learning research shows that knowledge from one task can facilitate learning in another task, particularly when tasks share underlying structure. </li>
    <li>World models in reinforcement learning enable agents to learn internal representations of environment dynamics that support planning and decision-making. </li>
    <li>Text games provide structured environments where agents must learn object properties, action effects, and goal structures that can be shared across different game instances. </li>
    <li>Shared representations across tasks in multi-task learning can lead to more robust and generalizable features. </li>
    <li>Catastrophic interference in neural networks shows that learning new tasks can disrupt previously learned knowledge, but this can be mitigated through various architectural and training strategies. </li>
    <li>Memory systems that support both shared and task-specific representations enable better multi-task performance. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An agent trained on three text games with overlapping mechanics (e.g., all involve inventory management and container manipulation) will learn a fourth game with similar mechanics faster than an agent trained on three games with non-overlapping mechanics.</li>
                <li>When learning two games simultaneously where Game A has complex inventory mechanics and Game B has complex navigation mechanics, the agent will develop a world model that performs better on a third game requiring both inventory and navigation than an agent trained on either game alone.</li>
                <li>Agents trained on multiple games will show more consistent action selection across games for common situations (e.g., always trying to 'open' containers before 'taking' items from them) compared to agents trained on single games.</li>
                <li>The learning curve for the Nth task in a multi-task training regime will show faster initial learning than the first task, demonstrating accumulated benefits from the shared world model.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist an optimal 'task diversity coefficient' that maximizes synergistic learning benefits, where tasks are similar enough to share knowledge but different enough to provide complementary information; this coefficient may vary non-linearly with the number of tasks.</li>
                <li>Multi-task world models might spontaneously develop emergent abstractions that were not present in any individual training task, representing meta-knowledge about text game structure that enables zero-shot generalization to entirely new game genres.</li>
                <li>The synergistic benefits might exhibit critical phase transitions at certain task combination thresholds, where adding one more task suddenly unlocks a qualitatively different level of understanding.</li>
                <li>Negative interference between conflicting tasks might paradoxically lead to better long-term generalization by forcing the development of more abstract, context-aware representations, even if it temporarily reduces performance on individual tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If agents trained on multiple related tasks show no performance advantage over agents trained on single tasks when tested on new related tasks, this would challenge the core synergy mechanism.</li>
                <li>If the world model does not develop distinguishable shared versus task-specific components, this would undermine the theory's architectural predictions.</li>
                <li>If learning curves for successive tasks in multi-task training do not show acceleration (i.e., each new task takes as long to learn as the first), this would challenge the accumulated benefit prediction.</li>
                <li>If agents show equal transfer performance regardless of whether source tasks have overlapping, complementary, or conflicting knowledge, this would challenge the theory's predictions about optimal task relationships.</li>
                <li>If preventing knowledge sharing between tasks (e.g., using completely separate world models) produces equal or better performance than shared world models, this would fundamentally challenge the synergy hypothesis.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the exact computational mechanisms by which the agent determines which knowledge components should be shared versus task-specific. </li>
    <li>The optimal number of tasks for maximizing synergistic benefits is not determined by the theory. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for temporal dynamics: how the order of task presentation affects the development of the world model. </li>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to quantitatively measure the degree of overlap or complementarity between tasks a priori. </li>
    <li>The mechanisms for resolving conflicts between tasks when they provide contradictory information are not fully specified. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
