                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Uncertainty-Driven Law Discovery in LLMs: The Iterative Law Refinement Hypothesis</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs distill qualitative laws from scholarly corpora through an iterative process of uncertainty-driven refinement. The model first generates broad candidate laws at points of high uncertainty, then recursively refines these laws by integrating new evidence and resolving ambiguities, leading to increasingly robust and generalizable scientific laws. The process is emergent, relying on the LLM's capacity to represent, track, and reduce epistemic uncertainty over multiple passes.</p>
