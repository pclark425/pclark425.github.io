                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Self-Reflection as a Calibration and Bias Amplification Process</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative self-reflection in language models acts as a calibration mechanism, but is susceptible to amplifying the model's own biases and overconfidence if not anchored by external or decorrelated feedback. When the model's self-evaluation is miscalibrated or biased, iterative self-refinement can reinforce errors, leading to overestimation of answer quality and reduced diversity. The theory predicts that self-reflection pipelines relying solely on the model's own feedback will plateau or degrade, especially in smaller models or on tasks where the model's prior is strong but incorrect.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a self-reflection pipeline is run for many iterations without external or decorrelated feedback, self-assessed scores will continue to rise while true answer quality plateaus or declines.</li>
                <li>Smaller models or models with strong but incorrect priors will amplify their own errors through self-reflection.</li>
                <li>Introducing external or decorrelated feedback (e.g., tool outputs, human feedback, or independent regeneration) will break the bias amplification and enable further improvements.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained to explicitly calibrate its self-evaluation, it may resist bias amplification and enable more effective self-reflection.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection is combined with adversarial or contrastive feedback, it may reduce bias amplification and increase robustness.</li>
                <li>If models are architecturally modified to separate self-evaluation from generation, the plateau effect may be mitigated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If self-reflection pipelines relying solely on self-evaluation continue to improve true answer quality indefinitely, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If bias amplification is not observed in small models or in models with strong priors, this would challenge the self-bias amplification law.</li>
                <li>If self-assessed scores and true answer quality remain tightly coupled across many iterations, this would challenge the calibration plateau law.</li>
