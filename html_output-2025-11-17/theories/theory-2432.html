                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Metabolic Load and Axonal Transport Stress Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of certain visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is governed by their metabolic load and axonal transport stress, which are determined by their projection type and network integration. Neurons with long-range projections and high synaptic output have greater metabolic and transport demands, making them more susceptible to disruptions in protein homeostasis and axonal transport caused by amyloid-β and tau accumulation.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Forcing a local neuron to increase its synaptic output without changing its projection type will increase its vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Artificially increasing the metabolic load of a resistant neuron will render it susceptible to amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that neurons with low metabolic load are equally or more vulnerable than high-load neurons would contradict the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that metabolic load has no effect on vulnerability within a given projection type would challenge the theory.</li>
