                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Error Localization and Correction Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM self-reflection and answer improvement are driven by an internal process of error localization and targeted correction. At each generate-then-reflect cycle, the model identifies specific segments or reasoning steps in its output that are likely erroneous or suboptimal, applies localized corrections, and re-evaluates the revised answer. This process continues until no further errors are detected or a stopping criterion is met, resulting in progressive answer refinement.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained to explicitly model error localization as a separate internal process, they may develop new forms of self-monitoring and self-improvement.</li>
                <li>Iterative error localization may enable LLMs to self-correct subtle, high-level reasoning errors that are not detectable by current methods.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show improved answer quality when localizing errors before correction, the theory's central mechanism is challenged.</li>
                <li>If error rates do not decrease with additional reflection cycles, the theory's quantitative law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLMs introduce new errors during reflection, or fail to detect existing errors due to limitations in self-monitoring. </li>
