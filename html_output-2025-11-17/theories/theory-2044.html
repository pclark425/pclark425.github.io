                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can identify and formalize the boundary conditions and exceptions to quantitative laws by synthesizing evidence from diverse scholarly sources. By comparing cases where a law holds and where it fails, the LLM can propose explicit conditions under which the law is valid, thus refining the generality and applicability of scientific laws.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover previously unrecognized boundary conditions or exceptions that have not been formalized in the literature.</li>
                <li>LLMs could propose new domains of validity for existing laws, leading to novel scientific insights.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to generalize boundary condition synthesis to highly interdisciplinary or poorly structured domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to identify known boundary conditions or exceptions, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot refine laws in light of exceptions, the theory's claims would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce spurious or incorrect boundary conditions when prompted, the theory's reliability is in question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to handle highly complex or subtle exceptions is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>LLMs' performance may degrade if the literature is sparse, biased, or lacks explicit discussion of exceptions. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
