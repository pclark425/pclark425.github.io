                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the relationship between scientific problem characteristics (including data availability, data structure, problem complexity, domain maturity, and mechanistic understanding requirements) and the applicability, effectiveness, and impact potential of different AI methodologies and approaches, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> When scientific problems have well-established governing equations, physical constraints, or symmetries, embedding these directly into machine learning systems (through architectural design, loss functions, feature engineering, or training procedures) substantially improves performance, generalization, physical consistency, and scientific credibility compared to purely data-driven approaches. The benefits are most pronounced in data-scarce regimes and for extrapolation tasks. The effectiveness scales with the strength, reliability, and completeness of the physical priors, and inversely with data abundance. Different encoding strategies (hard architectural constraints vs soft loss penalties vs physics-informed features) offer different trade-offs between flexibility, computational cost, and guarantee of physical consistency.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Embedding known physical constraints (PDEs, conservation laws, symmetries) into neural network systems improves accuracy, generalization, and physical consistency compared to unconstrained models, with benefits most pronounced when labeled data are limited (<10^3-10^4 examples) or when extrapolation beyond training distributions is required.</li>
                <li>The effectiveness of physics-informed approaches scales with the reliability and completeness of the physical priors: well-established physics (e.g., Navier-Stokes equations, rotational symmetries, conservation laws) provides stronger benefits than approximate or incomplete domain knowledge.</li>
                <li>Physics-informed architectures reduce the effective dimensionality of the learning problem by restricting the hypothesis space to physically plausible solutions, enabling better sample efficiency and reducing overfitting.</li>
                <li>Different encoding strategies offer distinct trade-offs: (1) Hard architectural constraints (equivariance) guarantee physical consistency but reduce flexibility; (2) Soft loss penalties (PINNs) allow flexibility but require careful weighting and may not guarantee constraint satisfaction; (3) Physics-informed feature engineering (SPOCK) provides interpretability and efficiency but requires domain expertise.</li>
                <li>When data are abundant (>10^5 examples) and physics priors are weak or uncertain, purely data-driven approaches may match physics-informed methods in interpolation tasks, but physics-informed methods maintain advantages in extrapolation, interpretability, and physical consistency.</li>
                <li>Architectural encoding of symmetries (equivariance) is more robust than soft constraints in loss functions for enforcing physical invariances, as it guarantees constraint satisfaction by construction.</li>
                <li>Physics-informed approaches enable order-of-magnitude computational speedups (10^2-10^5x) compared to traditional numerical solvers for repeated evaluations after training, though training costs can be substantial.</li>
                <li>Hybrid approaches that combine physics-based components with learned corrections (UDEs, multi-fidelity networks, predictor-corrector schemes) can outperform both pure physics and pure ML when physics is approximately known.</li>
                <li>The optimal balance between physics constraints and data-driven flexibility depends on: (1) data quantity and quality, (2) fidelity of available physics models, (3) computational budget, and (4) whether the task requires interpolation or extrapolation.</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A PINN approach to modeling chemical reaction kinetics with known rate equations embedded in the loss will outperform a standard neural network by >30% in RMSE when training data are limited to <1000 reaction trajectories, but the advantage will diminish to <10% with >10,000 trajectories.</li>
                <li>An equivariant graph neural network for predicting crystal properties will generalize better to novel crystal structures than a non-equivariant GNN with the same capacity, especially when training data cover <10% of the relevant space groups, with the performance gap widening for properties that depend strongly on symmetry (e.g., piezoelectric tensors).</li>
                <li>Adding conservation law constraints (mass, energy, momentum) to a neural weather model will reduce long-term drift by >50% and improve forecast skill beyond 10 days compared to an unconstrained model, with the benefit increasing with forecast horizon.</li>
                <li>A physics-informed neural network for heat transfer that encodes the heat equation will require 5-10x less training data than a generic neural network to achieve the same accuracy on interpolation tasks, and 20-50x less data for extrapolation to new boundary conditions.</li>
                <li>Feature engineering based on resonance theory (as in SPOCK) will enable accurate prediction of dynamical system stability with 10^4-10^5x speedup compared to direct simulation, while purely data-driven features will require 10-100x more training examples to achieve comparable accuracy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether physics-informed approaches can successfully handle problems where the governing equations are only approximately known (e.g., turbulence closure, biological systems with incomplete mechanistic models) or whether data-driven discovery of corrections is necessary - and if so, what the optimal ratio of physics to learned components should be.</li>
                <li>The existence of a universal scaling law that predicts the optimal balance point between physics constraints and data-driven flexibility as a function of data quantity, noise level, physics fidelity, and problem complexity - or whether this balance is fundamentally problem-dependent.</li>
                <li>Whether physics-informed architectures can be automatically discovered through neural architecture search rather than hand-designed, and if so, whether they would converge to similar designs as human experts or discover novel physics-encoding strategies.</li>
                <li>Whether physics-informed methods can effectively handle multi-scale problems where different physics operate at different scales (e.g., molecular dynamics with quantum and classical regimes, climate models with micro and macro scales) without requiring separate models for each scale.</li>
                <li>The extent to which physics-informed approaches can handle model misspecification - whether they fail catastrophically when encoded physics is incorrect, or whether they can learn to correct for systematic errors in the physics while maintaining the benefits of the approximate constraints.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist classes of scientific problems where physics-informed approaches provide no advantage over pure data-driven methods even in low-data regimes, and what characteristics define such problems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding cases where adding well-established, correct physical constraints to a neural network degrades performance compared to an unconstrained model with the same architecture and sufficient data (>10^5 examples) would challenge the theory's claims about universal benefits.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that physics-informed models fail to extrapolate better than data-driven models when tested on out-of-distribution physical regimes (e.g., different Reynolds numbers, temperature ranges, or material properties) would weaken the generalization claims.</li>
                <li>Showing that the computational cost of enforcing physics constraints (e.g., computing PDE residuals, enforcing equivariance) outweighs the data efficiency gains in practical applications would limit the theory's applicability.</li>
                <li>Finding that physics-informed approaches perform worse than data-driven methods when the encoded physics is even slightly incorrect or incomplete would challenge the robustness claims.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that purely data-driven foundation models trained on massive datasets can match or exceed physics-informed approaches even in extrapolation tasks would challenge the fundamental premise of the theory.</li>
                <li>Showing that the benefits of physics-informed approaches disappear when using modern data augmentation, regularization, or transfer learning techniques with data-driven models would suggest the advantages are not fundamental.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain when physics-informed approaches fail, such as in cases with model misspecification, incorrect physics encoding, or when the encoded physics is too restrictive for the actual system behavior <a href="../results/extraction-result-2313.html#e2313.7" class="evidence-link">[e2313.7]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal weighting between data loss and physics loss terms in PINNs remains problem-dependent and lacks general principles; dynamic loss weighting and adaptive training strategies are needed but not well understood <a href="../results/extraction-result-2313.html#e2313.7" class="evidence-link">[e2313.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2316.html#e2316.1" class="evidence-link">[e2316.1]</a> </li>
    <li>How to handle cases where multiple competing physical theories exist or where physics is only partially known - whether to encode all theories, select one, or learn corrections </li>
    <li>The theory does not address optimization pathologies specific to physics-informed training, such as stiff PDE residuals, ill-conditioning, and gradient pathologies that can make training difficult <a href="../results/extraction-result-2313.html#e2313.7" class="evidence-link">[e2313.7]</a> </li>
    <li>The computational cost trade-offs are not fully characterized - while inference is fast, training physics-informed models can be expensive due to PDE residual computation, and the break-even point is unclear <a href="../results/extraction-result-2313.html#e2313.5" class="evidence-link">[e2313.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2327.html#e2327.12" class="evidence-link">[e2327.12]</a> </li>
    <li>How physics-informed approaches interact with other modern ML techniques (transfer learning, meta-learning, foundation models) is not well understood <a href="../results/extraction-result-2321.html#e2321.7" class="evidence-link">[e2321.7]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2317.html#e2317.3" class="evidence-link">[e2317.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain why some physics-informed approaches (e.g., RWKV-6 for formula encoding) fail while others succeed, suggesting architecture-specific factors beyond just physics encoding <a href="../results/extraction-result-2294.html#e2294.4" class="evidence-link">[e2294.4]</a> </li>
