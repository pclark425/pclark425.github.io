                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Temporal-Contextual Scientific Forecasting Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by modeling the temporal and contextual evolution of scientific discourse, including shifts in terminology, emergence of new subfields, and the propagation of key concepts. By tracking the rate and context of change in scientific language and topic networks, LLMs can infer the momentum and directionality of research, allowing them to forecast the likelihood of imminent discoveries in specific domains.</p>
