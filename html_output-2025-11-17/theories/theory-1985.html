                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can distill qualitative laws by extracting and analyzing localized contradictions within clusters of related scholarly papers. By focusing on micro-level disagreements—such as conflicting experimental results or theoretical claims within a subfield—the LLM can abstract higher-level qualitative laws that reconcile or explain these contradictions, leading to the emergence of new scientific insights.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to identify and summarize contradictions in text, as seen in contradiction detection and fact-checking tasks. </li>
    <li>Scientific progress often arises from resolving localized contradictions, leading to new laws or theories. </li>
    <li>LLMs can cluster related documents and identify micro-level disagreements using embedding-based similarity and entailment models. </li>
    <li>Meta-analyses in science frequently focus on reconciling conflicting results to produce consensus statements or new theoretical frameworks. </li>
    <li>LLMs have been shown to perform multi-document summarization, which can include surfacing and reconciling conflicting findings. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">new</span></p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to contradiction detection and meta-analysis, the application to emergent law abstraction in LLMs is new and not formalized in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Contradiction detection is a known NLP task; scientific law often emerges from resolving contradictions.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit mechanism of using LLMs to extract and reconcile localized contradictions for law discovery is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will be able to generate new qualitative laws when exposed to clusters of papers with localized contradictions.</li>
                <li>The number and quality of emergent laws will increase with the density of contradictions in the input corpus.</li>
                <li>LLMs will outperform simple aggregation methods in surfacing higher-level laws from contradictory literature.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to resolve contradictions that have stymied human researchers, leading to paradigm shifts.</li>
                <li>The mechanism may generalize to cross-disciplinary contradictions, enabling the discovery of transdisciplinary laws.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent variables or hidden confounders underlying observed contradictions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to generate new laws from clusters with high contradiction density, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If the extracted laws do not reconcile the contradictions, the mechanism would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If LLMs produce spurious or trivial laws from contradiction-rich clusters, the theory's utility is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of spurious or non-informative contradictions on law abstraction is not fully explained. </li>
    <li>The impact of LLM hallucination or misinterpretation of technical contradictions is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> new</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> No prior work formalizes this mechanism for law discovery in LLMs, though related ideas exist in meta-analysis and contradiction detection.</p>
