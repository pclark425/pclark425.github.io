                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Guided Chemical Design via Semantic-Functional Mapping</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications by leveraging their ability to map semantic descriptions of desired properties or functions to chemical structure representations. The LLM's internal representations encode both linguistic and chemical knowledge, enabling the generation of molecules that fulfill user-specified criteria, even when such molecules are not present in the training data.</p>

    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to map between natural language and chemical structure representations. </li>
