                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that contamination in the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories can propagate through interconnected evaluation systems, compounding bias and undermining integrity. It provides a high-level model for how contamination can spread via shared evaluators, feedback loops, and protocol reuse.</p>
