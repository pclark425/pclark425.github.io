                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that actionable feedback is the primary driver for the adaptation and evolution of evaluation criteria in the assessment of LLM-generated scientific theories. As LLMs introduce novel forms of reasoning and error, only through the systematic incorporation of actionable feedback can evaluation criteria remain relevant, comprehensive, and robust.</p>
