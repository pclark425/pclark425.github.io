                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1117</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Reasoning Threshold Theory: General Representation Bottleneck Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the ability of language models to perform strict logical reasoning is fundamentally limited by a representational bottleneck: the model's internal representations must be sufficiently expressive to encode the logical structure of the task. When the logical structure exceeds the representational capacity, reasoning fails abruptly. This bottleneck is a function of both model architecture and the diversity of logical forms in the training data.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs fail on tasks requiring representations (e.g., nested quantifiers, deep recursion) beyond their capacity. </li>
    <li>Architectural changes (e.g., increased context window, memory) can extend reasoning ability. </li>
    <li>Training on more diverse logical forms improves reasoning on structurally similar tasks. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Representation bottlenecks are known, but not in the context of emergent logical reasoning thresholds.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Representation bottlenecks are discussed in deep learning, but not formalized for logical reasoning in LLMs.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit link between representational capacity and logical reasoning threshold is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Increasing the representational capacity (e.g., context window, hidden size) will raise the logical reasoning threshold.</li>
                <li>Tasks requiring representations beyond the model's capacity will result in abrupt reasoning failures.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Novel architectures (e.g., external memory, modular networks) may eliminate or shift the bottleneck.</li>
                <li>Training on synthetic logical forms may allow models to generalize beyond their nominal representational capacity.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a model can perform strict logical reasoning on tasks requiring representations beyond its capacity, the law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If reasoning degrades gradually as representational demands increase, the bottleneck hypothesis is weakened.</li>

    <li>Some models show partial reasoning ability on tasks just beyond their representational capacity. </li>
