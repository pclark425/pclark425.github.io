                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1207</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Robustness-Expressivity Tradeoff Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between the robustness and expressivity of internal chemical representations in LLMs for chemical synthesis. Highly expressive representations enable the generation of novel, application-specific molecules, but are more sensitive to noise, adversarial prompts, and data sparsity. Conversely, robust representations generalize well and resist perturbations, but may underperform in capturing subtle structure-property relationships required for advanced synthesis tasks.</p>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs with highly expressive representations (e.g., graph-based, 3D-aware) are more sensitive to small input perturbations, leading to invalid or off-target molecules. </li>
    <li>Simpler, more robust representations (e.g., SMILES tokenization) are less sensitive to prompt noise but fail to capture complex structure-property relationships. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs using hybrid representations (e.g., SMILES+graph) will outperform those using only highly expressive or only highly robust representations in application-specific synthesis tasks.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>There may exist adaptive representations that dynamically adjust expressivity and robustness based on the synthesis task or prompt context.</li>
                <li>The optimal balance point may shift depending on the chemical domain (e.g., small molecules vs. polymers) or application (e.g., drug design vs. materials discovery).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs with maximally expressive representations are both highly reliable and high-performing in all synthesis tasks, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If no tradeoff is observed between expressivity and robustness in LLM-driven chemical synthesis, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The role of external error correction or post-generation filtering in mitigating robustness issues is not addressed. </li>
