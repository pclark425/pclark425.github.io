                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1718</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Hybrid LLM Anomaly Detection Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that anomaly detection in lists using LLMs is most effective when performed hierarchically: first, by applying LLMs to identify semantic or relational inconsistencies at the item and list level; second, by integrating retrieval-augmented modules to provide external context; and third, by fusing outputs with explicit statistical or symbolic anomaly detectors. This layered approach allows for the detection of both subtle, context-dependent anomalies and overt statistical outliers, and enables the system to adaptively weight evidence from each layer based on the domain and data characteristics.</p>
