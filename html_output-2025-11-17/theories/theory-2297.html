                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Network Disruption Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease arises from the breakdown of large-scale brain network integrity, driven by the convergence of molecular pathologies (amyloid, tau, neuroinflammation), vascular dysfunction, and genetic risk factors. The earliest detectable changes are disruptions in functional connectivity and network synchrony, which can be identified by advanced neuroimaging and digital cognitive phenotyping before overt neurodegeneration.</p>
