                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs, when exposed to diverse chemical representations and property annotations, can navigate latent chemical space using analogical reasoning. By mapping relationships between known molecules and their properties, LLMs can infer plausible structures for new applications, even in chemical classes not previously encountered.</p>
