                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Task-Model Interaction Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the efficacy of self-reflection in LLMs is a function of the interaction between the cognitive affordances of the task (e.g., error detectability, decomposability) and the model's internal architecture (e.g., depth, attention span, self-critique capacity). The theory predicts that reflection is most effective when both the task and the model are aligned to support error identification and correction, and that mismatches between task structure and model capabilities limit the benefits of reflection.</p>

                <li>Training models on a diverse set of decomposable tasks will increase their reflection gains on similar tasks.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained to dynamically adapt their reasoning style to the task structure, reflection gains may generalize to previously unseen task types.</li>
                <li>Reflection may enable models to decompose tasks that are not obviously decomposable, leading to emergent problem-solving strategies.</li>
                <li>Task-model alignment may interact with model scale in non-linear ways, potentially leading to phase transitions in reflection efficacy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection is equally effective on non-decomposable and decomposable tasks, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If models with no stepwise reasoning capability outperform those with such capability on decomposable tasks via reflection, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If task-model alignment does not predict reflection gains across a wide range of tasks, the theory would be called into question.</li>

    <li>Cases where reflection leads to unexpected improvements on non-decomposable tasks, possibly due to emergent decomposition. </li>
