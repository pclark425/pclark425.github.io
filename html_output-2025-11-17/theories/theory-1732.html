                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Relational Consistency Theory for List Anomaly Detection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models can detect anomalies in lists by modeling the semantic and relational consistency among list elements. Anomalies are identified as elements that disrupt the learned semantic or relational patterns, such as category membership, ordering, or attribute consistency, as encoded in the LM's internal representations.</p>
