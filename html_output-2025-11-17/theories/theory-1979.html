                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1979</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Prompt-Refinement Theory for Law Extraction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that LLMs can be used in an iterative prompt-refinement loop, where initial candidate qualitative laws are extracted from scholarly texts, then systematically tested, critiqued, and refined through further targeted prompts. This process mimics the scientific method, with the LLM acting as both hypothesis generator and critic, leading to the distillation of robust qualitative laws.</p>
