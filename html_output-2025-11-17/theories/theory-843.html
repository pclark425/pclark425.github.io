                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Memory Organization Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by organizing memory into a hierarchy of temporal and conceptual scales, enabling efficient retrieval and storage of both short-term, context-specific information and long-term, abstract knowledge. The agent dynamically routes memory queries through this hierarchy based on task requirements, context, and resource constraints.</p>
