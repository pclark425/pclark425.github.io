                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memorization-Computation Spectrum Theory (Revised)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic through a dynamic spectrum of strategies ranging from pure memorization of training data patterns to emergent computational procedures. The position on this spectrum is determined by multiple factors including: (1) the frequency and format of arithmetic problems in training data, (2) the complexity and size of operands, (3) the model's scale and architecture, and (4) the specific arithmetic operation. Small, frequent problems (e.g., single-digit addition) are primarily solved through memorized lookup-like mechanisms encoded in early-to-middle layers, while larger problems require the model to compose multi-step computational procedures across deeper layers. Critically, this theory posits that models develop intermediate representations that blend both memorized 'arithmetic facts' and algorithmic steps, with the balance shifting based on problem characteristics. The theory further proposes that models learn multiple parallel pathways for arithmetic, with different circuits specializing in different ranges of the memorization-computation spectrum. These pathways can be selectively activated or suppressed through prompting strategies, and they compete or cooperate depending on problem characteristics. The theory also acknowledges that tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain which strategies are accessible, as they determine how numerical information is encoded and processed.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Language models employ a continuous spectrum of strategies for arithmetic, ranging from pure pattern matching/memorization to algorithmic computation, rather than using exclusively one approach.</li>
                <li>The position on the memorization-computation spectrum for any given arithmetic problem is primarily determined by: (a) training data frequency of similar problems, (b) operand magnitude and number of digits, (c) model capacity and depth, (d) operation type, and (e) tokenization scheme.</li>
                <li>Small operand arithmetic (e.g., single-digit operations) is predominantly solved through memorized associations encoded in early-to-middle layer weights, functioning similarly to lookup tables.</li>
                <li>Large operand arithmetic requires compositional multi-step procedures that emerge in middle-to-late layers, involving circuits for digit extraction, carrying/borrowing, and result aggregation.</li>
                <li>There exists a critical transition zone where problems shift from memorization-dominant to computation-dominant strategies, typically occurring when operands exceed the common range in training data (often around 2-3 digits).</li>
                <li>Models develop multiple parallel pathways for arithmetic: a fast, shallow memorization pathway for common problems and a slower, deeper computational pathway for novel problems, with these pathways competing or cooperating based on problem characteristics.</li>
                <li>The computational pathway involves learned algorithmic primitives (e.g., single-digit addition with carry, digit-wise operations) that are composed to solve larger problems.</li>
                <li>Attention mechanisms in computational pathways systematically attend to positionally-relevant digits (e.g., aligning digits by place value, tracking carry bits), mimicking traditional arithmetic algorithms.</li>
                <li>The balance between memorization and computation can be dynamically shifted through prompting strategies, with chain-of-thought prompting biasing toward computational pathways by encouraging explicit intermediate step generation.</li>
                <li>Model scale affects the spectrum by: (a) enabling more robust memorization of rare patterns, and (b) allowing more sophisticated computational circuits to emerge and stabilize during training.</li>
                <li>Different arithmetic operations occupy different default positions on the spectrum: addition/subtraction lean more computational (evidenced by off-by-one computational errors), while multiplication leans more toward memorization of times tables (evidenced by confusion between similar products).</li>
                <li>Training data format significantly influences which strategies develop: implicit arithmetic in natural text favors memorization, while explicit step-by-step examples favor computational procedures.</li>
                <li>Tokenization schemes fundamentally constrain the accessible strategies by determining how numerical information is chunked and processed, with digit-level tokenization favoring computational approaches and number-level tokenization favoring memorization.</li>
                <li>Models maintain multiple representational formats for numbers, including symbolic digit representations and approximate magnitude representations, which are utilized differently across the memorization-computation spectrum.</li>
                <li>The transition from memorization to computation during training (grokking) represents the emergence of generalizable computational circuits from initially overfitted memorized patterns, suggesting that computational strategies are built upon memorization foundations.</li>
                <li>Intermediate representations in the model blend memorized arithmetic facts with partial algorithmic computations, with the mixing ratio varying continuously across the spectrum rather than switching discretely between pure strategies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Language models show dramatically better performance on arithmetic problems that appear frequently in training data versus rare or out-of-distribution number combinations, suggesting memorization plays a significant role. </li>
    <li>Performance on arithmetic tasks degrades predictably with operand size, with sharp drops at boundaries that correspond to training data distribution cutoffs, indicating a transition from memorization to computation. </li>
    <li>Mechanistic interpretability studies reveal that different layers of transformer models specialize in different aspects of arithmetic: early layers encode digit representations, middle layers perform algorithmic steps, and late layers aggregate results. </li>
    <li>Models can 'grok' arithmetic tasks, showing a sudden transition from memorization to generalization after extended training, demonstrating that computational circuits can emerge from initially memorized patterns. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought prompting significantly improves arithmetic performance, suggesting models can be induced to use more computational (step-by-step) rather than memorization-based strategies. </li>
    <li>Larger models show better arithmetic performance and better length generalization, suggesting that scale enables more robust computational procedures beyond simple memorization. </li>
    <li>Models trained with scratchpad or intermediate step formats show improved arithmetic abilities, indicating that explicit computational traces help models learn algorithmic procedures. </li>
    <li>Attention patterns in arithmetic tasks show systematic structure, with specific heads attending to relevant digit positions for carrying and borrowing operations, suggesting learned computational circuits. </li>
    <li>Models show different error patterns for different arithmetic operations: addition errors often involve off-by-one mistakes (computational errors), while multiplication errors often involve confusion between similar products (memorization errors). </li>
    <li>Fine-tuning on arithmetic data can shift models toward more computational strategies, with improvements generalizing to larger operands not seen during fine-tuning. </li>
    <li>Tokenization schemes significantly affect arithmetic performance, with different tokenizations enabling or constraining different computational strategies. </li>
    <li>Models show evidence of learning numerical magnitude representations that are distinct from symbolic digit processing, suggesting multiple representational formats. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Models will show bimodal error distributions: low errors on small operands (memorization regime) and high errors on large operands (failed computation regime), with a sharp transition zone whose location varies by operation type.</li>
                <li>Intervening on early-layer activations will disproportionately affect small-operand arithmetic (memorization), while intervening on late-layer activations will disproportionately affect large-operand arithmetic (computation).</li>
                <li>Training data augmentation that systematically varies operand sizes while keeping operation types constant will shift the transition zone toward larger operands in a predictable manner.</li>
                <li>Models will show faster inference times (measured by computational depth or layer-wise processing) for small-operand problems compared to large-operand problems, reflecting the difference between shallow memorization pathways and deep computational pathways.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning on arithmetic with explicit intermediate steps will improve performance more on large operands than small operands, as it strengthens computational pathways while memorization pathways are already sufficient for small operands.</li>
                <li>Pruning experiments will reveal that different subnetworks are critical for different operand ranges, with early layers more critical for small operands and deeper layers more critical for large operands.</li>
                <li>Models will show better generalization to novel large operands when trained with curriculum learning that gradually increases operand size, as this encourages development of computational rather than memorization strategies.</li>
                <li>Analyzing activation patterns will reveal that problems near the transition zone show mixed activation of both memorization and computational circuits, with the model effectively 'hedging' between strategies.</li>
                <li>Models trained with digit-level tokenization will show better length generalization on arithmetic compared to models with number-level tokenization, as digit-level tokenization better supports compositional computational strategies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models are trained exclusively on very large operand arithmetic (e.g., 10+ digits) without exposure to small operand problems, they may develop purely computational strategies that actually perform worse on small operands than standard models, as they lack efficient memorization pathways and incur unnecessary computational overhead.</li>
                <li>Adversarially selected operands that are rare in training data but computationally simple (e.g., numbers with many zeros, or numbers that are powers of 10) might reveal whether models can flexibly switch between memorization and computation, or whether they rigidly apply one strategy based on operand size alone.</li>
                <li>Training models with explicit 'confidence scores' for each arithmetic answer might reveal a sharp metacognitive boundary where models 'know' they are transitioning from memorization to computation regimes, potentially enabling self-aware strategy selection.</li>
                <li>Hybrid architectures that combine transformer layers with external memory modules or symbolic computation modules might show qualitatively different spectrum characteristics, potentially maintaining computational performance across all operand sizes or showing entirely different transition dynamics.</li>
                <li>If the memorization-computation spectrum theory is correct, then models should show systematic differences in robustness to adversarial perturbations: memorization-regime problems should be robust to prompt perturbations but sensitive to operand perturbations, while computation-regime problems should show the opposite pattern.</li>
                <li>Cross-lingual transfer of arithmetic abilities might reveal whether computational circuits are more language-independent than memorization circuits, with implications for whether the spectrum is a fundamental architectural property or a training artifact dependent on linguistic context.</li>
                <li>Training models on arithmetic in multiple number bases simultaneously (decimal, binary, hexadecimal) might force the development of more abstract computational strategies that occupy a different position on the spectrum, potentially enabling better generalization.</li>
                <li>Introducing 'hybrid' problems that combine small and large operands (e.g., 7 + 1,234,567) might reveal how models arbitrate between memorization and computational pathways when both are partially applicable.</li>
                <li>Models might show different spectrum characteristics for approximate versus exact arithmetic, with approximate arithmetic potentially bypassing both memorization and exact computation in favor of magnitude-based heuristics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If models show uniform performance degradation across all operand sizes when trained on limited data, rather than sharp transitions at specific boundaries, this would challenge the existence of distinct memorization vs. computation regimes.</li>
                <li>If mechanistic interpretability reveals that the same circuits and attention patterns are used for both small and large operand arithmetic with no systematic differences, this would contradict the theory of separate memorization and computational pathways.</li>
                <li>If training data frequency has no correlation with performance on specific arithmetic problems (controlling for operand size and operation type), this would undermine the memorization component of the theory.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought prompting provides equal relative improvement across all operand sizes and operation types, this would challenge the idea that it specifically enhances computational pathways that are more important for large operands.</li>
                <li>If models trained exclusively on large operands show no ability to solve small operand problems even after extensive training, this would contradict the theory that computational procedures can be applied across the spectrum.</li>
                <li>If ablating early layers has equal impact on both small and large operand arithmetic, this would challenge the theory that early layers specifically encode memorized arithmetic facts.</li>
                <li>If models show no difference in error patterns between operations (e.g., addition vs. multiplication showing identical error types), this would contradict the theory that different operations occupy different positions on the memorization-computation spectrum.</li>
                <li>If changing tokenization schemes has no effect on the position of the transition zone or the types of strategies employed, this would challenge the theory's claim that tokenization fundamentally constrains accessible strategies.</li>
                <li>If models show no evidence of parallel pathways (e.g., no distinct fast/slow processing routes identifiable through mechanistic analysis), this would contradict the multiple-pathway component of the theory.</li>
                <li>If the transition from memorization to computation during training is gradual and continuous rather than showing grokking-like sudden transitions, this would challenge the theory's characterization of how computational circuits emerge.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The exact mechanisms by which models represent and manipulate numerical magnitudes (as opposed to digit symbols) remain unclear, and may involve additional pathways beyond memorization and algorithmic computation. While the theory acknowledges multiple representational formats, it doesn't fully specify how magnitude representations interact with the memorization-computation spectrum. </li>
    <li>Some models show unexpected capabilities on modular arithmetic and number theory problems that don't fit neatly into either memorization or standard algorithmic computation categories, suggesting additional specialized circuits or strategies. </li>
    <li>Models sometimes show 'reasoning shortcuts' where they use heuristics or approximations that are neither pure memorization nor correct algorithmic computation, representing a third category of strategy not fully captured by the binary spectrum framework. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully account for how models handle arithmetic with special structural properties (e.g., commutativity, associativity, distributivity) and whether these mathematical properties are explicitly represented or merely emergent from memorization and computation. </li>
    <li>The interaction between arithmetic capabilities and broader mathematical reasoning (e.g., algebra, calculus concepts) is not addressed, and it's unclear whether the memorization-computation spectrum extends to these higher-level mathematical tasks. </li>
