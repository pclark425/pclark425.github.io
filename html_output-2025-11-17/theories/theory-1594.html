                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1594</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hyper-Fast Soliton Transport in Engineered Plasma Channels</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by creating and guiding stable, high-energy solitons within engineered plasma channels using advanced electromagnetic field configurations, it is possible to transport macroscopic payloads at effective superluminal speeds. The soliton acts as a self-sustaining, localized energy structure that modifies the local spacetime metric, enabling FTL transport without violating causality or requiring exotic matter.</p>
