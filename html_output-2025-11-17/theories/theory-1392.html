                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Reflection as Hierarchical Multi-Stage Decorrelation and Error Correction</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-reflection, in which each stage acts to decorrelate the current output from prior errors and biases, and propagates error signals hierarchically. Early reflection stages primarily address surface-level errors, while subsequent stages propagate error signals to deeper representational and reasoning layers, enabling correction of subtle inconsistencies and logical flaws. The process is analogous to multi-layer error backpropagation and iterative denoising, but operates in the space of generated outputs and their self-evaluations.</p>

                <li>Hierarchical error correction may enable models to self-discover and correct biases not explicitly present in the prompt.</li>
                <li>Iterative decorrelation may eventually lead to loss of original context or answer drift in some tasks.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If deeper errors are not corrected with additional reflection passes, the hierarchical error correction law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If error patterns remain highly correlated across passes, the decorrelation law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If repeated reflection introduces new, unrelated errors, the theory's assumptions about error reduction are challenged.</li>
