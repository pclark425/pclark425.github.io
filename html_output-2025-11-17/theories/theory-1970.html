                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLMs as Emergent Cross-Domain Law Synthesizers</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when exposed to a sufficiently diverse and comprehensive corpus of scholarly literature, can autonomously synthesize qualitative laws that abstract and unify principles across disparate scientific domains. The emergent synthesis is not merely a collation of known laws, but a generative process that identifies deep structural analogies and produces new, generalizable scientific laws that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines.</p>

    <li>Emergent abilities in LLMs have been observed, where models perform tasks not explicitly present in training data, suggesting generative synthesis capabilities. </li>

    <li>Larger and more diverse training data have been shown to improve LLMs' ability to generalize and abstract. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may synthesize a new, unrecognized law that unifies principles from quantum mechanics and linguistics.</li>
                <li>A sufficiently large and diverse LLM may propose a law that predicts emergent phenomena in a domain not present in its training data.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs trained on multi-domain corpora fail to generate any new cross-domain qualitative laws, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the laws produced are merely trivial restatements or do not generalize beyond the input domains, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM architectural biases on the types of laws synthesized is not fully explained. </li>
    <li>The role of explicit prompt engineering in guiding law synthesis is not addressed. </li>
