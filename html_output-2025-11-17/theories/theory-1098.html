                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory (Representational Mismatch Variant)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This variant of the Neuro-Symbolic Interface Bottleneck Theory posits that the primary bottleneck in language models' logical reasoning arises from a fundamental representational mismatch between distributed neural encodings and the discrete, compositional nature of symbolic logic. The theory asserts that neural architectures, optimized for statistical pattern recognition, struggle to instantiate, manipulate, and preserve explicit symbolic structures required for strict logical inference, leading to systematic errors and brittleness in multi-step reasoning tasks.</p>
