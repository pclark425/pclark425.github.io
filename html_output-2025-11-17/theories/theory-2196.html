                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2196</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Weighting Theory of Multidimensional Alignment in LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the relative importance (weight) of each evaluation axis in the multidimensional alignment framework is not fixed, but dynamically determined by the context, field, and evaluators' priorities. The evaluation process thus adapts to the epistemic and practical needs of the scientific community, allowing for flexible, context-sensitive assessment of LLM-generated theories.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Rapid shifts in weighting may lead to instability or inconsistency in theory acceptance.</li>
                <li>Emergence of new axes (e.g., ethical alignment) may disrupt established evaluation patterns.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation outcomes remain static despite major contextual changes, the dynamic weighting law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If communities do not update weights in response to new priorities, the adaptive evaluation law is falsified.</li>

    <li>Cases where weighting is determined by external mandates (e.g., government policy) rather than community consensus. </li>
