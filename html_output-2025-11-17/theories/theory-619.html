                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-619</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the effectiveness of self-reflection and iterative self-correction in language models is fundamentally constrained by the underlying model's capability. Only models above a certain scale or capability threshold can reliably generate useful self-critiques, detect their own errors, and improve their outputs through self-reflection. Below this threshold, self-reflection may be ineffective or even harmful, as the model's self-critiques are unreliable or biased. The theory predicts that self-reflection, self-consistency, and related methods will yield substantial improvements only for sufficiently large or capable models, and that smaller/weaker models will fail to benefit or may amplify their own errors.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new, larger model is trained, it will show greater gains from self-reflection and self-consistency than a smaller model on the same tasks.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection is applied to a small model, it will yield little or no improvement, and may even degrade performance.</li>
                <li>If a model is scaled up (e.g., from 7B to 70B), the effectiveness of self-reflection will increase nonlinearly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a small model is augmented with external tools or feedback, it may cross the capability threshold and begin to benefit from self-reflection.</li>
                <li>If a model is trained specifically to generate high-quality self-critiques, the threshold for effective self-reflection may be lowered.</li>
                <li>If ensembles of small models are used for self-reflection, it is unknown whether they can collectively surpass the threshold.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a small model (<7B) consistently benefits from self-reflection and outperforms larger models, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If a large model fails to benefit from self-reflection, or is harmed by it, this would call the capability threshold law into question.</li>
                <li>If self-reflection is equally effective across all model sizes, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some methods (e.g., external feedback, tool-augmented reflection) may enable small models to benefit from self-reflection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5221.html#e5221.0" class="evidence-link">[e5221.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5221.html#e5221.1" class="evidence-link">[e5221.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5206.html#e5206.4" class="evidence-link">[e5206.4]</a> </li>
    <li>Certain tasks (e.g., code generation with execution feedback) may allow even small models to improve via self-reflection. <a href="../results/extraction-result-5455.html#e5455.0" class="evidence-link">[e5455.0]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-5444.html#e5444.0" class="evidence-link">[e5444.0]</a> </li>
