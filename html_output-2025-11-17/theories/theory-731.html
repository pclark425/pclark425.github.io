                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models can, under certain conditions, exhibit emergent algorithmic reasoning for arithmetic tasks, especially when prompted with intermediate steps or chain-of-thought reasoning. This theory posits that LLMs can simulate multi-step computation by generating intermediate representations, allowing for partial generalization beyond memorized patterns.</p>
