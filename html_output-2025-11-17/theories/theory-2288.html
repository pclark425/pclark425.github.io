                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that actionable feedback not only enables improvement but is the primary driver of convergence toward consensus and reliability in the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories. In the absence of actionable feedback, evaluators' judgments remain divergent and inconsistent, while the presence of such feedback systematically aligns evaluative criteria and outcomes.</p>

            <ol>
