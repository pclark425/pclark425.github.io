                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured Relational Schema Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally represented as structured relational schemas, where concepts are encoded as interconnected sets of roles and relations, abstracted from sensory input. These schemas are flexibly instantiated in working memory and can be composed, nested, and generalized, supporting systematicity and productivity in cognition. The format is symbolic at the functional level, but the instantiation of symbols is context-sensitive and dynamically constructed.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Humans can represent and reason about abstract relations (e.g., 'X is taller than Y') independent of specific instances. </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Brain imaging will show activation of prefrontal and parietal regions during relational reasoning across diverse domains.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially training individuals on highly abstract relational schemas will transfer to improved reasoning in unrelated domains.</li>
                <li>Schema-based interventions could remediate relational reasoning deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders.</li>
                <li>Direct neural stimulation of schema-relevant regions will enhance compositional generalization.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals cannot generalize relational concepts to novel instances, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If brain lesions to schema-relevant areas do not impair relational reasoning, the theory is unsupported.</li>
                <li>If non-relational, unstructured representations suffice for complex reasoning, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify the mechanism for instantiating or updating schemas in real time. </li>
    <li>The neural implementation of relational schemas is not addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory synthesizes and generalizes existing schema/relational models to a universal format for conceptual knowledge.</p>
