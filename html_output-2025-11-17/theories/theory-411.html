                <p><strong>Name:</strong> The Semantic Distance-Feasibility Relationship Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the fundamental trade-off between novelty and feasibility in automatically generated research hypotheses, including quantification methods and optimization strategies across different research domains and problem types, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The relationship between semantic distance (novelty) and feasibility in hypothesis generation follows a characteristic inverted-U or threshold pattern rather than a simple linear relationship. Hypotheses at very low semantic distance (highly similar to existing work) are highly feasible but minimally novel. Hypotheses at moderate semantic distance represent optimal combinations of novelty and feasibility, recombining validated concepts in new ways. Hypotheses at very high semantic distance are highly novel but often infeasible due to lack of connecting knowledge, methods, or validation pathways. The optimal semantic distance varies by domain, research context, and the specific distance metric used. Multi-hop semantic paths (connecting distant concepts through intermediate concepts) can make high-distance connections more feasible than direct connections. The relationship can be quantified using embedding-based metrics (cosine similarity), graph-theoretic measures (path length, betweenness), taxonomic distance, or human expert judgments, though different metrics may give different predictions.</p>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Systems that explicitly optimize for moderate semantic distance (e.g., 0.4-0.6 cosine similarity in embedding space) will produce more impactful hypotheses than systems optimizing for maximum distance.</li>
                <li>Providing users with explicit control over semantic distance parameters will improve satisfaction and perceived utility of hypothesis generation systems.</li>
                <li>Multi-hop semantic paths (2-3 intermediate concepts) will be rated as more feasible by domain experts than direct connections between highly distant concepts.</li>
                <li>Domain-specific calibration of optimal semantic distance thresholds will improve hypothesis quality by 10-20% compared to domain-agnostic thresholds.</li>
                <li>Combining multiple distance metrics (embedding, graph, taxonomic) in an ensemble will provide better novelty-feasibility prediction than single metrics alone.</li>
                <li>Iterative refinement that gradually increases semantic distance will produce more feasible high-novelty hypotheses than single-step generation.</li>
                <li>In mature research domains, the optimal semantic distance will be lower (0.3-0.5) than in emerging domains (0.5-0.7).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether the inverted-U relationship is universal across all domains or whether some domains (e.g., highly theoretical fields) exhibit different patterns such as monotonic relationships.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal semantic distance changes systematically and predictably as a research field evolves and matures over decades.</li>
                <li>Whether there exist discrete 'zones' of semantic distance with qualitatively different feasibility characteristics, or whether the relationship is continuous and smooth.</li>
                <li>Whether semantic distance in embedding space corresponds linearly to cognitive distance in human expert judgment, or whether there are systematic biases.</li>
                <li>Whether the relationship between distance and feasibility is causal (distance causes infeasibility) or merely correlational (both are caused by underlying knowledge structure).</li>
                <li>Whether different types of semantic distance (conceptual, methodological, domain) have different relationships with feasibility.</li>
                <li>Whether the optimal distance for paradigm-shifting discoveries differs fundamentally from the optimal distance for incremental advances.</li>
                <li>Whether temporal dynamics (how quickly a field evolves) affect the optimal semantic distance more than static domain characteristics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that semantic distance has no systematic relationship with feasibility across multiple domains would challenge the core theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that maximum semantic distance consistently produces the most impactful hypotheses would challenge the inverted-U hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Showing that all distance metrics (embedding, graph, taxonomic) produce identical predictions would question the importance of metric choice and multi-metric approaches.</li>
                <li>Finding that optimal distance does not vary by domain or research context would challenge the domain-dependence hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that humans cannot perceive or utilize semantic distance information in their judgment would question its practical utility.</li>
                <li>Finding that multi-hop paths are no more feasible than direct connections would challenge the path-structure hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Showing that iterative refinement does not enable higher semantic distances would challenge the refinement hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that paradigm shifts occur at the same semantic distances as incremental work would challenge the special-case predictions.</li>
            </ol>
