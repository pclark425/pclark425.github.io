                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Multidimensional Calibration Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is not static, but dynamically calibrated over time as evaluators, contexts, and societal priorities shift. The weights and even the set of evaluative dimensions themselves are subject to change, and the evaluation process must adapt to maintain alignment with evolving scientific, ethical, and societal standards.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a major societal event (e.g., data privacy scandal) occurs, the weighting of ethical dimensions in evaluation frameworks will increase.</li>
                <li>If LLM-generated theories are evaluated in different domains (e.g., medicine vs. physics), the set and weighting of dimensions will differ, leading to different overall scores for the same theory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a new, disruptive technology emerges, previously minor dimensions (e.g., explainability) may become dominant in evaluation.</li>
                <li>If global consensus on evaluation standards is attempted, the process will reveal significant variation in dimension selection and weighting across cultures.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If evaluation frameworks remain static over long periods despite major contextual changes, the theory's claim of dynamic calibration is challenged.</li>
                <li>If the same set of dimensions and weights are used universally across all domains and times, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address how to resolve conflicts when different contexts or times demand incompatible dimension sets. </li>

            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
