                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2195</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional Alignment Theory of LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is best understood as a process of multidimensional alignment, where each theory is assessed along several independent axes (such as empirical adequacy, conceptual coherence, methodological transparency, and epistemic novelty). The overall evaluation emerges from the joint consideration of these axes, rather than from a single scalar metric, allowing for nuanced judgments that reflect the complex nature of scientific theory assessment.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM-generated theories that are strong on all major axes will be more likely to be accepted by interdisciplinary panels.</li>
                <li>Theories weak on any single major axis will face greater scrutiny or rejection, even if strong on others.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Introducing new axes (e.g., societal impact) may shift which theories are accepted.</li>
                <li>Some theories may achieve consensus despite low scores on certain axes if evaluators weight axes differently.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If theories weak on multiple axes are routinely accepted, the multidimensional alignment law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If consensus forms around theories with poor alignment, the alignment-consensus law is falsified.</li>
            </ol>

    <li>Cases where external factors (e.g., political, economic) override multidimensional evaluation. </li>
