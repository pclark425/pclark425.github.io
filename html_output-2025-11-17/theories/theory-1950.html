                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt-Driven Law Hypothesis Testing in LLMs</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can be systematically prompted to generate, test, and refine candidate qualitative laws by leveraging targeted prompts that simulate the scientific method. By iteratively presenting the LLM with hypotheses, counterexamples, and evidence from the corpus, the model can be guided to converge on robust, evidence-backed qualitative laws.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Prompt engineering has been shown to guide LLMs in hypothesis generation and evaluation. </li>
    <li>Chain-of-thought and self-consistency prompting improve LLM reasoning and law-like output. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to critique, revise, and improve their own outputs when presented with counterexamples or contradictory evidence. </li>
    <li>Iterative prompting strategies have been used to improve factual accuracy and reasoning depth in LLMs. </li>
    <li>LLMs can synthesize information from multiple sources when guided by structured prompts. </li>
</ol>            <h4>Existing Law Comparison</h4>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The law adapts and extends known prompting and self-refinement techniques to a new, structured context of scientific law distillation, which is not the primary focus of prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Prompt engineering and chain-of-thought prompting are established in LLM research, and LLMs have been shown to improve outputs with iterative feedback.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The systematic use of these prompting techniques specifically for scientific law hypothesis testing and refinement, simulating the scientific method, is new.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Iterative prompting with counterexamples will lead LLMs to generate more accurate and robust qualitative laws than single-pass extraction.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to reject or revise candidate laws when presented with contradictory evidence via prompts.</li>
                <li>Prompt-driven refinement will outperform naive extraction in domains with rich, well-structured evidence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to autonomously propose novel scientific laws when prompted with open-ended hypothesis testing tasks.</li>
                <li>Prompt-driven law refinement may reveal emergent reasoning capabilities not present in standard LLM outputs.</li>
                <li>The process may enable LLMs to generalize laws across domains if prompted with cross-domain evidence.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to revise candidate laws in response to counterexamples, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If prompt-driven law refinement does not improve law accuracy over naive extraction, the theory's assumptions are questioned.</li>
                <li>If LLMs hallucinate or reinforce incorrect laws despite iterative prompting, the theory's mechanism is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The limits of LLM reasoning and memory in handling complex, multi-step law refinement are not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The impact of prompt design and corpus quality on the reliability of law refinement is not fully explained. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The theory extends known prompting and self-refinement techniques to a new, impactful application in scientific law distillation.</p>
