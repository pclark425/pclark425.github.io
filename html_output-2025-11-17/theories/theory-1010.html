                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Adaptive Memory Compression and Expansion Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by adaptively compressing and expanding their memory representations based on task demands. Compression allows efficient storage and retrieval of relevant information, while expansion enables detailed recall when necessary. The agent dynamically adjusts the granularity of memory traces, balancing resource constraints with the need for context-rich reasoning.</p>
