                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Topology-Driven Selective Vulnerability Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the selective vulnerability of visual cortical neurons to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position within the cortical network topology, specifically their participation in hub-like, integrative, or highly central motifs. Neurons that serve as network hubs or bridges for information flow are more likely to accumulate pathology due to increased exposure to trans-synaptic protein transfer, while peripheral or non-central neurons are more resistant.</p>

                <li>Disrupting hub connectivity will reduce the spread of amyloid-β and tau pathology.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Artificially increasing the centrality of a resistant neuron population will increase its vulnerability.</li>
                <li>Altering network topology via optogenetic or genetic methods will change the pattern of vulnerability.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that peripheral neurons are equally vulnerable as network hubs would challenge the theory.</li>
