                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on extensive chemical, biological, and application-specific corpora, can map natural language descriptions of desired chemical properties or applications to the generation of novel chemical structures and plausible synthetic routes, effectively bridging the gap between application-driven design and practical synthesis.</p>
