                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1546</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Positive-Energy Warp Bubble Feasibility Principle (Metric Engineering via Quantum Vacuum Modulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the quantum vacuum can be modulated at macroscopic scales using electromagnetic field configurations and advanced materials, enabling the controlled generation of positive-energy regions that induce spacetime curvature sufficient for FTL travel. The approach leverages the interplay between quantum field effects and general relativity, suggesting that practical FTL propulsion is achievable by engineering the vacuum state itself.</p>
