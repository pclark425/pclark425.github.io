                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1602</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Domain Representation Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the accuracy of LLMs as scientific simulators is determined by the degree of alignment between the internal representations learned by the LLM and the formal, conceptual, and procedural structures of the target scientific subdomain. When the LLM's representations closely mirror the subdomain's ontology, logic, and procedural knowledge, simulation accuracy is high. Misalignment—due to gaps in training data, lack of exposure to domain-specific reasoning, or representational mismatches—leads to systematic errors, especially in subdomains with highly formalized or symbolic knowledge.</p>
