                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Syntax/Error Reporting as a Bottleneck in LLM Scientific Code Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the primary limiting factor in the accuracy of LLMs as scientific code simulators is the quality and specificity of syntax and error reporting mechanisms. It posits that even highly capable LLMs are constrained by the informativeness of the feedback they receive, and that improvements in error reporting can yield disproportionate gains in code accuracy, especially in complex or specialized scientific domains.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The amplification effect in LLM code simulators, especially in complex domains, is a new formalization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Targeted feedback is known to improve learning outcomes.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The assertion that such feedback yields disproportionate gains for LLMs in scientific code simulation is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs perform equally well with and without augmented error messages, the amplification law would be falsified.</li>
