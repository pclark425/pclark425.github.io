                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Evaluator-Process Coupling Theory: Information Flow Law for LLM-Generated Scientific Theories</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This general theory asserts that the effectiveness of LLM-generated scientific theories is governed by the bidirectional flow of information between the evaluator and the LLM. The theory posits that both the quantity and quality of information exchanged (including feedback, clarifications, and constraints) directly influence the epistemic robustness and creativity of the resulting theories, and that bottlenecks or asymmetries in this information flow can limit scientific discovery.</p>
