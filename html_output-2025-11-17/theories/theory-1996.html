                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM Law Refinement through Cross-Abstract Contradiction Resolution</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine and distill biomedical gene–disease association laws by identifying, reconciling, and resolving contradictions across multiple abstracts. Through this process, LLMs converge on robust, consensus-based laws that are resilient to noise, outliers, and conflicting evidence, thus improving the reliability of extracted association laws.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>LLMs will be able to flag abstracts that are outliers or contain spurious associations during the refinement process.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to resolve contradictions involving subtle, context-dependent associations (e.g., gene–disease associations modulated by environmental factors) through iterative refinement.</li>
                <li>LLMs could potentially identify and formalize exceptions or conditional laws (e.g., gene–disease associations that only hold in specific populations) through contradiction resolution.</li>
                <li>LLMs may develop the ability to quantify the degree of consensus or uncertainty in extracted laws.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to improve the reliability of association laws through iterative contradiction resolution, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot converge on consensus laws in the presence of conflicting evidence, the robust law convergence law would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs reinforce spurious associations rather than resolving contradictions, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where contradictions are due to errors or biases in the underlying literature, not resolvable by LLMs. </li>
    <li>Situations where the volume of conflicting evidence is so high that no clear consensus can be reached. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
