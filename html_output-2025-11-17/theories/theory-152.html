                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Discrete Tokenization Advantage for Transformer World Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about what constitutes an optimal world model for AI systems, incorporating fidelity, interpretability, computational efficiency, and task-specific utility, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> For transformer-based world models, discrete tokenization of observations (via VQ-VAE, VQGAN, or similar vector quantization methods) provides multiple systematic advantages over continuous representations: (1) reduces sequence length enabling longer context windows due to O(n²) attention complexity, (2) provides natural categorical distributions for autoregressive modeling with well-defined sampling procedures, (3) enables better sample quality and multimodal prediction through discrete sampling, (4) reduces computational cost quadratically with compression factor, and (5) provides explicit enumeration of plausible futures useful for planning under uncertainty. The optimal token count balances reconstruction fidelity (more tokens = better reconstruction, measured in PSNR/MSE) with computational efficiency (fewer tokens = faster inference and training). For Atari-scale images (64x64), empirical evidence suggests 4-16 tokens per frame is optimal, with the specific choice depending on task complexity and visual discrimination requirements. The theory extends beyond vision to other modalities where discrete representations can compress sequential data.</p>
