                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models perform arithmetic by manipulating symbolic representations of numbers and operations within their contextual embedding space, using attention mechanisms to simulate stepwise computation, but are limited by context window size, tokenization, and representational ambiguity.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will make more errors on arithmetic problems that require tracking many intermediate steps or long sequences.</li>

                <li>LLMs with larger context windows will outperform those with smaller windows on multi-step arithmetic.</li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are given external memory or retrieval-augmented mechanisms, their arithmetic performance may improve beyond current context window limitations.</li>
                <li>If tokenization is changed to represent entire numbers as single tokens, the pattern of arithmetic errors may shift.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs can solve arbitrarily long arithmetic problems without context window issues, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If attention maps do not show focus on relevant tokens during arithmetic, the theory would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can perform accurate arithmetic on long sequences using chain-of-thought prompting, suggesting partial mitigation of context window limitations. </li>
