                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must explicitly account for the context in which the theory is generated and intended to be applied, including domain specificity, data provenance, and intended use. The robustness of an LLM-generated theory is determined not only by its internal and empirical properties, but also by its adaptability and reliability across varying contexts and under different evaluation regimes.</p>
