                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multi-Modal Evidence Integration Theory for LLM Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs can distill more comprehensive and accurate scientific theories by integrating evidence from multiple modalities (text, tables, figures, code, etc.) within scholarly papers. By aligning and cross-referencing findings across modalities, LLMs can resolve ambiguities, validate claims, and synthesize richer theory statements than by text alone.</p>
