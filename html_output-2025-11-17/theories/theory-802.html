                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Layered and Dynamic Memory Architecture Theory for LLM Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that optimal task-solving in LLM agents emerges from a layered memory architecture, where distinct memory types (episodic, semantic, procedural, and working memory) are dynamically allocated and updated based on task demands, agent experience, and environmental feedback. The architecture enables both rapid adaptation to new information and efficient retrieval of relevant past knowledge, with dynamic routing mechanisms that prioritize, compress, or discard memories according to utility and recency.</p>
