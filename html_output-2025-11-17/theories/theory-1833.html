                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Priors Aggregation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by aggregating and synthesizing latent scientific priors embedded in their training data, which consists of the collective published and informal knowledge, beliefs, and expectations of the scientific community. This aggregation enables LLMs to approximate the community's implicit probability distribution over possible discoveries, provided the relevant priors are sufficiently represented in the data.</p>

                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates do not change after retraining on new data reflecting updated priors, the theory would be called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>LLMs' ability to extrapolate beyond priors present in the data (e.g., true creativity or abduction) is not explained. </li>
    <li>The impact of model architecture and fine-tuning on the extraction and aggregation of priors is not addressed. </li>
