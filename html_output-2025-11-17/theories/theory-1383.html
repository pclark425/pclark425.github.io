                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1383</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that generate-then-reflect cycles in language models act as an internal alignment mechanism, where the model's outputs are iteratively adjusted to better conform to implicit or explicit task objectives, norms, or factual constraints. The reflection phase serves as a self-supervised feedback loop, allowing the model to align its answers with higher-level goals or standards, even in the absence of external correction.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>Tasks with well-defined norms or standards will benefit more from reflection cycles than open-ended tasks.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Reflection cycles may lead to excessive conformity, suppressing creative or novel answers.</li>
                <li>If implicit norms in the training data are biased or incorrect, reflection may reinforce these biases.</li>
                <li>The effect of reflection cycles on tasks with conflicting or ambiguous norms is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If reflection cycles do not increase alignment with task objectives or reduce output variance, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If outputs diverge or become less canonical with more reflection, the convergence law is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where reflection cycles introduce new errors or hallucinations, rather than improving alignment. </li>
