                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Semantic Fidelity-Compression Tradeoff Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the ideal representation for converting graphs into text for language model training is determined by a tradeoff between semantic fidelity (the preservation of graph structure and meaning) and representational compression (the efficiency and compactness of the text). The optimal point on this tradeoff curve depends on the downstream task, the language model's context window, and the complexity of the input graph.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>

            <ol>
