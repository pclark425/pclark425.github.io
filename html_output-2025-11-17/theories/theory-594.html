                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Structured and Interpretable Memory Representations Enable Efficient Planning, Exploration, and Error Recovery in LLM Agents for Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLM agents that employ structured, interpretable memory representations (e.g., knowledge graphs, belief states, skill libraries, subgoal stacks, or episodic trajectory stores) achieve more efficient planning, exploration, and error recovery in text games than agents relying solely on unstructured or raw text memory. Structured memory enables agents to reason about entities, affordances, and world state, avoid redundant or invalid actions, transfer knowledge between tasks, and perform backtracking or failure recovery. The effectiveness of structured memory depends on the alignment between memory schema and task structure, as well as the integration of memory with planning and retrieval mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>An LLM agent equipped with a structured knowledge graph or belief state will outperform an agent with only raw text memory in a new, partially observable, combinatorial text game.</li>
                <li>If a structured memory agent is deployed in a task requiring backtracking (e.g., puzzle or search), it will recover from errors and dead-ends more efficiently than an agent without such memory.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If structured memory is combined with learned schema adaptation (e.g., dynamic knowledge graph construction), agents may generalize to novel domains or tasks with unseen entities or relations.</li>
                <li>In multi-agent settings, sharing structured memory (e.g., belief states or knowledge graphs) may enable emergent cooperation or deception strategies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If an agent with only unstructured or raw text memory matches or exceeds the performance of a structured memory agent in planning, exploration, or error recovery, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If structured memory consistently leads to overfitting, brittleness, or degraded performance in diverse or open-ended tasks, the theory would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some tasks (e.g., those with highly dynamic or unstructured environments) may not align well with fixed memory schemas, limiting the benefit of structured memory. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4914.html#e4914.1" class="evidence-link">[e4914.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4914.html#e4914.3" class="evidence-link">[e4914.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4914.html#e4914.6" class="evidence-link">[e4914.6]</a> </li>
    <li>Naive or poorly aligned structured memory (e.g., irrelevant or noisy knowledge graphs) can mislead exploration or planning. <a href="../results/extraction-result-4886.html#e4886.1" class="evidence-link">[e4886.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-4673.html#e4673.2" class="evidence-link">[e4673.2]</a> </li>
