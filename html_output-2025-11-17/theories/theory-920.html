                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic Memory for LLM Text Game Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents achieve optimal performance in text games by organizing memory hierarchically, with episodic segments corresponding to major game events (e.g., entering new areas, completing subgoals) and sub-episodes for finer-grained actions. This structure enables efficient retrieval, abstraction, and generalization, allowing agents to reason over both high-level progress and detailed interactions.</p>
