                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when prompted with explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and provided with relevant domain knowledge, can not only detect anomalies in lists of data but also classify the type of anomaly (e.g., point, contextual, collective) and provide interpretable rationales for their decisions. The theory further asserts that this approach enhances both the accuracy and transparency of anomaly detection compared to black-box or zero-shot LLM usage.</p>
