                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Plasma-Engineered Soliton Superluminal Transport</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that by engineering a plasma medium and applying precisely tuned electromagnetic fields, it is possible to generate and sustain positive-energy solitons—localized, non-dispersive wave packets—that can transport macroscopic payloads at effective superluminal (faster-than-light) velocities. The soliton acts as a self-stabilizing, energy-carrying structure that manipulates the local spacetime metric within the plasma, allowing the payload to traverse distances at apparent FTL speeds without violating local causality or requiring exotic negative energy.</p>
