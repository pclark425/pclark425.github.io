                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Retrieval-Augmented LLM Distillation Theory (Generalized Error Correction Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that iterative retrieval-augmented LLMs can not only distill qualitative laws from large scholarly corpora, but also self-correct errors and biases in candidate laws by leveraging cycles of retrieval, critique, and evidence-based revision. The process is hypothesized to converge toward more accurate and less biased scientific laws, even in the presence of noisy or conflicting input data.</p>

    <li>Exposure to diverse and even conflicting evidence can, through repeated synthesis and critique, lead to more robust generalizations. </li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If iterative retrieval-augmented LLMs fail to reduce error or bias in distilled laws over multiple cycles, the theory would be challenged.</li>
