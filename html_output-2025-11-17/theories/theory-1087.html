                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Abstraction of Spatial Constraints in Neural Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models solve puzzle games involving spatial knowledge, like Sudoku.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models trained on spatial puzzles develop hierarchical internal representations, where local constraints (e.g., cell-level rules) are abstracted into higher-level global rules (e.g., row, column, and box uniqueness in Sudoku). This hierarchical abstraction enables efficient reasoning, error correction, and transfer to new spatial tasks with similar hierarchical structure.</p>
