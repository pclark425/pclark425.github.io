                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Law Refinement through LLM-Guided Cross-Document Quantitative Reasoning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine candidate quantitative laws by performing cross-document reasoning, comparing, reconciling, and updating hypotheses based on evidence distributed across many papers. Through cycles of hypothesis generation, testing, and revision, LLMs can converge on robust, generalizable quantitative laws that best explain the aggregated data.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>When presented with conflicting evidence, LLMs will revise or reject candidate laws until a consistent, robust law is found.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover new, more general quantitative laws that subsume previously known laws through iterative refinement.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify subtle exceptions or boundary conditions to quantitative laws that are not apparent in any single paper.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not improve law accuracy or generalizability with iterative refinement, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot resolve conflicts in evidence across documents, the theory's mechanism would be undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of biased or systematically flawed input papers on the convergence process is not fully addressed. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
