                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Tokenization Constraint Theory of LM Arithmetic</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The ability of language models to perform arithmetic is fundamentally constrained by the tokenization scheme and the representational granularity of numbers. When numbers are tokenized into subword or character-level units, the model's ability to generalize arithmetic operations is limited by its capacity to learn and manipulate these representations, leading to systematic errors for large or rare numbers.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>A hybrid tokenization scheme (mixing subword and character-level) may enable better arithmetic generalization without sacrificing language fluency.</li>
                <li>There may exist a tokenization scheme that enables near-perfect arithmetic in LMs without explicit algorithmic modules.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LMs with coarse-grained tokenization perform as well as character-level models on large-number arithmetic, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If tokenization changes do not affect arithmetic error rates, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LMs with subword tokenization can perform well on arithmetic after fine-tuning, suggesting other factors can compensate for tokenization limitations. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
