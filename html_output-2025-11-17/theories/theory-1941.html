                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1941</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Boundary Salience and Output Validity Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the salience and explicitness of prompt boundaries (such as section headers, delimiters, or formatting cues) are primary determinants of LLM output validity. When boundaries are clear and salient, LLMs are more likely to produce valid, well-structured outputs. Conversely, when boundaries are weak or implicit, the risk of output collapse (e.g., blending of sections, loss of structure, or semantic drift) increases. The theory further posits that boundary salience interacts with model scale and training data diversity.</p>
