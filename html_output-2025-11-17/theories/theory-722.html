                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-722</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Circuit Augmentation Theory of Arithmetic Fine-Tuning</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models perform arithmetic by developing and augmenting specialized latent circuits during pretraining and fine-tuning. Fine-tuning on arithmetic tasks leads to the selective augmentation and specialization of these circuits, enabling the model to generalize to new arithmetic operations and formats. The process is governed by the interplay between pre-existing distributed representations and the model's capacity to allocate new subspaces for arithmetic reasoning.</p>
