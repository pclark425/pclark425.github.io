                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Reflective Error Correction and Internalization Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models, through repeated generate-then-reflect cycles, not only correct surface-level errors but also internalize patterns of self-correction, leading to emergent meta-learning. Over time, the model's internal representations become biased toward answer patterns that are robust to self-critique, effectively 'learning to learn' from its own outputs and reflections.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a language model is repeatedly exposed to generate-then-reflect cycles on a specific task type, its initial answers on new but similar tasks will contain fewer errors.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If a model is trained with adversarial reflection steps, it may internalize defensive answer patterns, potentially reducing flexibility or creativity.</li>
                <li>If reflection is performed with external feedback (e.g., human-in-the-loop), internalization may be faster or more robust.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If repeated generate-then-reflect cycles do not reduce the number of errors in future initial answers, the internalization law is falsified.</li>
                <li>If models do not show improved zero-shot performance on similar tasks after repeated self-reflection, the theory is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where internalization leads to overfitting to specific reflection patterns, reducing generalization. </li>
