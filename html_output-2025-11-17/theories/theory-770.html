                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Algorithmic Reasoning via Chain-of-Thought and Program Synthesis in Large Language Models</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) develop emergent algorithmic reasoning capabilities for arithmetic by leveraging chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and implicit program synthesis. Through exposure to vast textual data and in-context demonstrations, LLMs learn to decompose arithmetic problems into stepwise, interpretable procedures, effectively synthesizing and executing latent programs that generalize beyond memorized examples.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may develop the ability to synthesize entirely novel algorithms for arithmetic operations (e.g., new base systems) from minimal examples.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs at large scale fail to outperform smaller models on arithmetic reasoning, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If chain-of-thought prompting does not improve generalization or stepwise decomposition, the theory's mechanism is weakened.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs may still fail on arithmetic tasks due to tokenization artifacts or lack of relevant training data. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain failures on adversarial or ambiguous arithmetic prompts. </li>
