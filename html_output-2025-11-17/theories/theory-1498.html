                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Precision-Weighted Arbitration for Conceptual Format Selection (General Theory)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that conceptual knowledge is organized hierarchically across representational formats, with arbitration occurring at multiple levels (e.g., feature, concept, schema). At each level, the brain computes the precision of available formats and selects or blends them according to a hierarchical, context-sensitive arbitration process. This allows for flexible, task-dependent conceptual access and generalization.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When the reliability of a representational format is manipulated at a specific hierarchical level (e.g., feature vs. schema), participants will shift format use at that level but not necessarily at others.</li>
                <li>Neuroimaging will reveal level-specific shifts in activation between regions associated with different formats as a function of context and precision.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Training to increase the precision of a format at a lower level (e.g., feature) will propagate to higher-level conceptual processing.</li>
                <li>Disorders affecting arbitration at one hierarchical level (e.g., feature integration) will produce selective deficits in conceptual access.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If format selection does not vary by hierarchical level, the theory is falsified.</li>
                <li>If manipulating precision at one level does not affect format use at that level, the theory is undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how arbitration signals are communicated across hierarchical levels. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> closely-related-to-existing</p>
