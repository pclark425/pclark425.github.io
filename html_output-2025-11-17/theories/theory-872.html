                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language model agents achieve optimal task performance by organizing memory into a hierarchy of abstraction levels, where high-level summaries and low-level details are dynamically linked. The agent navigates this hierarchy based on task demands, retrieving coarse summaries for broad context and drilling down to fine-grained details as needed. This structure enables efficient retrieval, reduces cognitive overload, and supports both generalization and precise recall.</p>
