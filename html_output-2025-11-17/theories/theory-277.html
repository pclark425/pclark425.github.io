                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-as-Probabilistic-World-Model Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about probabilistic symbolic world models for text environments that integrate LLM uncertainty into planning.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Large Language Models can serve as probabilistic world models for text-based environments by treating their output distributions as uncertainty estimates over possible world states and transitions. The theory proposes that LLMs inherently encode probabilistic knowledge about world dynamics through their training on diverse text corpora, and this uncertainty can be explicitly extracted and leveraged for robust planning. Rather than treating LLM outputs as deterministic predictions, the model's token probabilities, sampling variations, and ensemble disagreements represent genuine epistemic uncertainty about world state transitions that should be propagated through planning algorithms. The symbolic and discrete nature of text environments provides a natural interface for LLMs to express probabilistic beliefs over state spaces, enabling integration with classical planning frameworks while maintaining the flexibility and generalization capabilities of learned models.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs encode probabilistic world models implicitly through their training on diverse text describing world dynamics, state transitions, and causal relationships, with the breadth of training data determining the scope of world knowledge.</li>
                <li>The output probability distribution P(next_token | context) from an LLM represents epistemic uncertainty about possible world state transitions, not merely linguistic variation, when the context describes a world state and the output describes a transition or consequence.</li>
                <li>Multiple sampling from an LLM's distribution over the same world state query reveals the model's uncertainty about that state or transition, with higher sampling variance indicating higher epistemic uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Planning algorithms that integrate LLM uncertainty through token probabilities, sampling variance, or ensemble disagreement will demonstrate greater robustness to model errors and achieve higher success rates in novel environments compared to those treating LLM outputs as deterministic.</li>
                <li>The quality and calibration of uncertainty estimates from LLMs correlates positively with the amount and diversity of training data about specific world dynamics, with out-of-distribution scenarios producing less reliable uncertainty estimates.</li>
                <li>LLM uncertainty can be decomposed into aleatoric uncertainty (inherent world stochasticity described in training data) and epistemic uncertainty (model knowledge gaps), and these components should be treated differently in planning: aleatoric uncertainty should be propagated through plans, while epistemic uncertainty should trigger information gathering or conservative strategies.</li>
                <li>Explicit prompting for uncertainty (e.g., requesting confidence scores, multiple possibilities, or likelihood estimates) can elicit better-calibrated probabilistic predictions than implicit extraction from token probabilities alone, particularly when combined with chain-of-thought reasoning.</li>
                <li>The symbolic and discrete structure of text environments allows LLMs to maintain coherent probabilistic beliefs over discrete state spaces more effectively than in continuous domains, as the tokenization naturally aligns with state representations.</li>
                <li>Uncertainty-aware planning with LLMs requires calibration mechanisms to ensure that the model's confidence estimates accurately reflect true prediction accuracy, as uncalibrated uncertainty can lead to suboptimal decisions.</li>
                <li>The integration of LLM uncertainty into planning algorithms can be achieved through multiple mechanisms: (1) weighting action outcomes by token probabilities, (2) using sampling distributions to construct belief states, (3) employing ensemble disagreement to identify high-uncertainty regions, or (4) combining multiple uncertainty signals in a principled probabilistic framework.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs demonstrate strong performance on commonsense reasoning tasks, suggesting they encode world knowledge that could serve as a foundation for world modeling </li>
    <li>Token probability distributions from LLMs correlate with prediction confidence and can indicate uncertainty, providing a direct mechanism for extracting probabilistic information </li>
    <li>LLMs can be used for planning in text-based environments and interactive fiction games, demonstrating their ability to reason about state transitions and action consequences </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification in neural models improves decision-making under ambiguity and enables more robust behavior in stochastic environments </li>
    <li>Probabilistic planning methods outperform deterministic approaches in stochastic environments by explicitly reasoning about uncertainty </li>
    <li>Sampling-based methods can reveal model uncertainty and improve robustness in language generation tasks </li>
    <li>Ensemble methods provide well-calibrated uncertainty estimates in deep learning contexts </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>A planning agent using LLM token probabilities to weight action outcomes will achieve 15-30% higher success rates in novel text-based environments compared to agents using only the most likely LLM prediction, with larger gains in environments with higher inherent stochasticity.</li>
                <li>In text-based navigation tasks with ambiguous or incomplete descriptions, incorporating LLM uncertainty about room connections will lead to more efficient exploration strategies that prioritize resolving high-uncertainty transitions, reducing average steps to goal by 20-40%.</li>
                <li>LLM-based planners that explicitly model uncertainty will demonstrate better performance on tasks requiring risk-aware decision making (e.g., avoiding dangerous actions with uncertain outcomes) compared to deterministic LLM planners, particularly in scenarios where mistakes are costly.</li>
                <li>Ensemble methods combining 3-5 diverse LLM predictions will produce better-calibrated uncertainty estimates (as measured by expected calibration error) than single-model token probabilities for world model predictions, with improvements of 30-50% in calibration metrics.</li>
                <li>Fine-tuning LLMs on environment-specific trajectories with explicit uncertainty labels (e.g., annotating which transitions are stochastic vs deterministic) will improve the calibration of their probabilistic world models by 25-40% as measured by Brier score or log-likelihood.</li>
                <li>In multi-step planning scenarios, propagating LLM uncertainty through the planning horizon will enable earlier detection of plan failures, allowing replanning to occur 2-3 steps earlier on average compared to deterministic approaches.</li>
                <li>Combining high-confidence LLM predictions with low-confidence predictions from a symbolic planner will outperform either system alone in hybrid environments that mix familiar and novel dynamics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether LLM uncertainty estimates can effectively replace hand-crafted probabilistic models (like POMDPs) for complex planning domains while maintaining theoretical guarantees on plan quality, optimality bounds, or convergence properties.</li>
                <li>Whether the implicit world models in LLMs can capture long-horizon temporal dependencies (10+ steps) and rare event probabilities (< 1% occurrence) accurately enough for safety-critical planning applications where failures have severe consequences.</li>
                <li>Whether combining symbolic reasoning systems with LLM probabilistic world models creates emergent capabilities for handling novel situations beyond either system alone, particularly in scenarios requiring both commonsense reasoning and logical deduction.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM uncertainty can be used to automatically identify when a text environment violates the model's world knowledge (e.g., detecting impossible physics or logical contradictions), triggering active learning, human intervention, or model updates with sufficient reliability for autonomous operation.</li>
                <li>Whether different LLM architectures (decoder-only vs encoder-decoder) or training objectives (causal language modeling vs masked language modeling vs instruction tuning) produce systematically different uncertainty characteristics that affect planning performance in measurable and predictable ways.</li>
                <li>Whether uncertainty-aware LLM planning can scale to open-world environments with unbounded state spaces while maintaining computational tractability and whether approximation methods preserve the benefits of uncertainty quantification.</li>
                <li>Whether LLM-based probabilistic world models can support multi-agent planning scenarios where uncertainty about other agents' beliefs and intentions must be modeled alongside environmental uncertainty.</li>
                <li>Whether the uncertainty estimates from LLMs can be used to construct formal safety guarantees or probabilistic certificates for plan execution in regulated domains.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If planning with LLM uncertainty performs worse than or equal to deterministic LLM planning across multiple diverse text environments (at least 5-10 different domains), it would suggest the uncertainty signals are not informative for decision-making or that the extraction/integration methods are flawed.</li>
                <li>If LLM token probabilities show no significant correlation (r < 0.3) with actual prediction accuracy in world model tasks across a range of environments, it would undermine the fundamental assumption of using them as uncertainty estimates.</li>
                <li>If increasing the number of samples from an LLM (from 1 to 10 to 100) does not reduce planning failures in ambiguous situations or improve plan quality metrics, it would question whether sampling captures meaningful uncertainty about world dynamics.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on more diverse data (e.g., 10x more training examples covering a domain) do not produce better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for world modeling in that domain, it would challenge the theory's assumption about training data effects on uncertainty quality.</li>
                <li>If explicitly prompting for uncertainty produces worse-calibrated estimates (higher calibration error) than implicit extraction from token probabilities, it would suggest LLMs cannot reliably introspect their own uncertainty or that prompting introduces biases.</li>
                <li>If ensemble methods show no improvement over single-model uncertainty estimates in terms of calibration or planning performance, it would question the value of computational overhead for ensemble approaches.</li>
                <li>If uncertainty-aware planning shows no advantage in environments with known stochastic dynamics compared to deterministic planning, it would suggest the uncertainty integration mechanisms are not properly capturing or utilizing the probabilistic information.</li>
                <li>If fine-tuning on environment-specific data degrades rather than improves uncertainty calibration, it would indicate that the learning process does not properly preserve or enhance uncertainty representations.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The computational cost of uncertainty quantification methods (multiple sampling requiring 10-100x more inference, ensembles requiring multiple model copies) may be prohibitive for real-time planning applications with strict latency requirements (< 100ms response time). </li>
    <li>How to handle distribution shift when the text environment contains dynamics not represented in the LLM's training data, particularly detecting when uncertainty estimates become unreliable due to out-of-distribution inputs. </li>
    <li>The relationship between LLM scale (parameters, training compute) and uncertainty calibration quality for world modeling is not well understood, with some evidence suggesting larger models may be better calibrated but other evidence showing mixed results. </li>
    <li>How to effectively combine multiple sources of uncertainty (token probabilities, sampling variance, ensemble disagreement, explicit confidence statements) in a principled way that avoids double-counting or conflicting signals. </li>
    <li>The theory does not fully address how to handle temporal credit assignment when uncertainty compounds over multi-step plans, particularly determining which uncertain predictions contributed most to plan failures. </li>
    <li>How to maintain consistency in probabilistic beliefs across multiple related queries about the same world state, as independent LLM queries may produce inconsistent probability estimates. </li>
