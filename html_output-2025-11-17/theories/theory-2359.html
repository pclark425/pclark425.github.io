                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2359</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Network Disintegration Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of large-scale brain network disintegration, triggered by the progressive breakdown of synaptic connectivity and network hubs due to molecular insults (amyloid, tau, inflammation, vascular dysfunction). The disease process accelerates when critical network nodes (hubs) are lost, leading to a cascade of functional disconnection and cognitive decline. Detection should focus on identifying early network-level changes, especially in hub regions, using advanced neuroimaging and electrophysiological methods.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with early hub loss do not develop AD, or if AD occurs without network disintegration, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If network-based detection does not improve prediction over molecular biomarkers, the theory is weakened.</li>
                <li>If interventions preserving hub connectivity do not slow decline, the cascade model is called into question.</li>
