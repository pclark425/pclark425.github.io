                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative LLM-Reviewer Feedback Law Refinement Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill qualitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs can iteratively refine and validate extracted reviewer feedback laws by engaging in cycles of hypothesis generation, testing against new peer review data, and updating the law set. The process mirrors scientific discovery, where LLMs act as both synthesizers and critics, using new data to confirm, refute, or adjust previously distilled laws, leading to increasingly robust and generalizable principles.</p>
