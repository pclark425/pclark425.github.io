                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can accurately measure the probability of future scientific discoveries by simulating the process of consensus formation among virtual agents (i.e., the authors and viewpoints embedded in the training data). Through their generative process, LLMs effectively perform a weighted aggregation of these virtual agents' beliefs, allowing them to forecast the likelihood of discoveries as an emergent property of simulated scientific discourse.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may outperform individual experts in forecasting discoveries by aggregating simulated consensus.</li>
                <li>LLMs may identify emergent consensus on discoveries before it is explicit in the literature.</li>
                <li>Simulated agent-based deliberation within LLMs may reveal hidden biases or groupthink in scientific fields.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates do not improve with simulated debate or multi-agent prompting, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs trained on highly homogeneous data produce less accurate forecasts, this would support the theory; if not, it would challenge it.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot explain their probability estimates in terms of simulated arguments, the theory would be called into question.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The impact of non-scientific or low-quality sources on the simulated consensus is not addressed. </li>
    <li>The role of model size and architecture in the fidelity of simulated agent consensus is not explained. </li>
