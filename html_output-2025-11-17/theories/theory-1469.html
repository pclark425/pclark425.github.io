                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Contextual Modulation of the Modal–Amodal Continuum</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the position of a concept's representation along the modal–amodal continuum is not fixed, but is dynamically modulated by context, including task instructions, recent experience, and individual differences. The brain can shift the representational format of a concept in real time, optimizing for efficiency, generalization, or specificity as needed.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If context manipulations do not change the neural or behavioral format of conceptual representations, the theory would be falsified.</li>
