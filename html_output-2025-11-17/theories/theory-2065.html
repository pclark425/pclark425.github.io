                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Augmented Scientific Law Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can serve as semantic intermediaries between unstructured scholarly text and formalized quantitative law discovery. By leveraging their ability to parse, summarize, and abstract scientific literature, LLMs can identify candidate variables, relationships, and data representations, which can then be systematically mapped to mathematical forms and tested against empirical data. This process enables scalable, automated distillation of quantitative laws from vast corpora of scientific papers.</p>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to extract key variables or relationships from a representative sample of scientific papers, the theory would be challenged.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The impact of LLM hallucinations or misinterpretations on the quality of extracted variables and relationships is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for the need for domain-specific validation of LLM outputs. </li>
