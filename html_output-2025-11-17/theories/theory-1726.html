                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Representation Space Deviation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can be used for detecting anomalies in lists of data.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models encode elements of lists into high-dimensional representation spaces. Anomalies are detected as elements whose representations deviate significantly from the manifold or cluster formed by typical elements, as measured by distance metrics or density estimation in the embedding space.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the embedding space is highly entangled or non-linear, some anomalies may not be separable by distance or density metrics.</li>
                <li>If adversarial examples are crafted to mimic the embedding distribution of typical elements, they may evade detection.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If elements with distant embeddings are not perceived as anomalous by humans, the theory's assumptions about embedding space may be flawed.</li>
                <li>If typical elements are scattered in embedding space and do not form a coherent cluster, the theory's mechanism fails.</li>
