                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory of Neuronal Resistance (General Formulation 2: Dynamic Homeostatic Buffering)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the resistance of certain visual cortex neuronal populations to Aβ and tau pathology is determined by their intrinsic capacity for dynamic homeostatic buffering, which is a function of the cohesiveness and adaptability of their molecular signaling networks. Neurons with tightly integrated, feedback-rich pathways can rapidly sense and compensate for proteotoxic stress, maintaining homeostasis and preventing aggregation, while those with less cohesive or rigid networks are less able to buffer against pathological insults.</p>
