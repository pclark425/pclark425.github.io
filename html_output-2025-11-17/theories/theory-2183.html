                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Human-AI Co-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories is most robust when conducted through an iterative, interactive process involving both human experts and AI systems. The process leverages the complementary strengths of humans (domain expertise, intuition, ethical judgment) and AI (scalability, pattern recognition, consistency), and incorporates feedback loops to refine both the evaluation criteria and the theories themselves.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Studies in human-AI collaboration show improved outcomes in complex decision-making tasks, such as medical diagnosis, scientific discovery, and financial forecasting. </li>
    <li>AI can identify patterns and inconsistencies at scale, while humans provide domain-specific judgment, intuition, and ethical oversight. </li>
    <li>Human-AI teams have been shown to outperform either alone in tasks requiring both creativity and systematic analysis. </li>
    <li>In scientific peer review, diverse perspectives (analogous to human-AI diversity) reduce groupthink and increase error detection. </li>
