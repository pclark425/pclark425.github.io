                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1566</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Quantum Vacuum Engineering for Realistic FTL Propulsion</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how faster-than-light (FTL) spacecraft travel could be viable today using realistic scenarios and budgets.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that by manipulating the quantum vacuum—specifically, by engineering local vacuum energy densities and stress profiles using advanced materials, Casimir-like structures, or strong electromagnetic fields—it is possible to create the positive-energy conditions required for FTL-supporting warp bubbles. The approach leverages the flexibility of quantum field theory in curved spacetime and the demonstrated ability to modify vacuum energy in laboratory settings. The theory predicts that with current or near-future technology, small-scale, positive-energy warp bubble effects can be realized, providing a foundation for scalable FTL propulsion.</p>
