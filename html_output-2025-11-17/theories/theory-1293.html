                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of ideal representations for converting graphs into text for language model training.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the ideal graph-to-text representation for language model training is one that maximally preserves the compositional and disentangled nature of the original graph, such that subgraphs, motifs, and node/edge types are represented in a way that allows the language model to learn and generalize over reusable graph components.</p>
