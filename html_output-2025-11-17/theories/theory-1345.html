                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Skill Transfer Theory of LLM Self-Reflection</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the meta-skills acquired by LLMs through iterative self-reflection—such as error detection, task decomposition, and adaptive revision—are transferable across domains and tasks. As LLMs engage in generate-then-reflect cycles, they develop abstract strategies that can be applied to novel problems, enabling rapid adaptation and improved performance even in unfamiliar contexts.</p>
