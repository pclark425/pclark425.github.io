                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can accurately estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by implicitly aggregating prior knowledge, explicit evidence, and community expectations in a Bayesian-like manner, as encoded in their training data. This aggregation enables LLMs to synthesize distributed signals about the likelihood of discoveries, even when such probabilities are not explicitly stated.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs have demonstrated the ability to synthesize information from diverse sources and provide probabilistic judgments that align with expert consensus in various domains. </li>
    <li>Bayesian inference is a normative model for updating beliefs in light of evidence, and LLMs' outputs often reflect similar updating when prompted with new information. </li>
    <li>LLMs can be prompted to provide probability estimates for future events, and their estimates often reflect the distribution of beliefs present in their training data. </li>
    <li>Empirical studies show LLMs can match or exceed human forecasters in some scientific prediction tasks, suggesting effective aggregation of distributed priors. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While Bayesian inference is a well-established framework, the idea that LLMs perform implicit Bayesian aggregation at scale for scientific forecasting is not established in the literature.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> LLMs are known to aggregate information from their training data and can be prompted to provide probabilistic estimates.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit analogy to Bayesian aggregation and the claim that LLMs perform implicit Bayesian updating over distributed priors and evidence is novel.</p>
