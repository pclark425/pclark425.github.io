                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Modularization and Reasoning Depth Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the ability of language models to perform strict logical reasoning depends on the emergence of a hierarchical modular structure, where modules at different levels specialize in increasingly abstract or complex logical operations. The depth and granularity of this modular hierarchy determine the maximum complexity of logical inference the model can perform, and the theory predicts that deeper hierarchies enable more sophisticated forms of reasoning (e.g., multi-step inference, nested quantification).</p>
