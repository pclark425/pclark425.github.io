                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1434</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Meta-Reasoning and Self-Evaluation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that language models engage in a form of meta-reasoning during self-reflection, wherein the model evaluates its own reasoning process, identifies weaknesses, and applies higher-order strategies to improve future outputs. This meta-cognitive process enables the model to not only correct specific errors but also to adapt its reasoning style, leading to more robust and generalizable improvements.</p>
