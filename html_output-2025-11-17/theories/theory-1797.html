                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Retrieval-Augmented Probabilistic Reasoning Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) equipped with retrieval mechanisms that access up-to-date, domain-specific scientific corpora can generate accurate probability estimates for future scientific discoveries by integrating retrieved evidence with their internal knowledge. The theory asserts that the probabilistic reasoning of LLMs is fundamentally enhanced by the dynamic, context-aware retrieval of external information, allowing for adaptive, evidence-based forecasting that reflects both historical trends and emergent signals in the scientific landscape.</p>
