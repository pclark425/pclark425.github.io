                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of what LLM-as-a-judge style evaluations lose compared to human evaluations, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLM judges can achieve human-level or superior agreement on subsets of evaluation tasks when allowed to abstain or filter by self-reported certainty. By thresholding on high-confidence predictions, LLM judges focus on cases where their internal representations are most reliable, leading to higher accuracy and alignment with human judgments. However, this comes at the cost of reduced coverage, as many ambiguous or low-signal cases are left unscored. The theory posits that certainty-filtered LLM judging is a practical method for high-precision evaluation, but cannot fully replace human evaluation for comprehensive coverage.</p>

    <li>High-confidence subset accuracy ~80%+ for GPT-4 and Command R+; on high-certainty samples, LLM judges match or exceed third-person human performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-3852.html#e3852.1" class="evidence-link">[e3852.1]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-3852.html#e3852.2" class="evidence-link">[e3852.2]</a> </li>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a certainty threshold is applied to LLM judge outputs in a new evaluation task, the accuracy on the retained (high-certainty) subset will increase, but the number of scored samples will decrease.</li>
                <li>If richer, more informative features (e.g., persona attributes) are provided, the number of high-certainty, high-accuracy LLM judgments will increase.</li>
                <li>If weaker LLMs are used, certainty filtering will not yield the same accuracy gains as with stronger models.</li>
                <li>If certainty filtering is applied to a new domain (e.g., personalization in a different language), coverage will depend on the informativeness of the input features.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If certainty-filtered LLM judging is applied to highly subjective or creative tasks (e.g., poetry, story generation), it is unknown whether high-certainty subsets will still align with human judgments.</li>
                <li>If certainty estimation is adversarially attacked (e.g., by generating outputs that induce overconfident but incorrect LLM judgments), it is unknown whether the reliability of the high-certainty subset will persist.</li>
                <li>If certainty filtering is combined with panel-based or ensemble LLM judging, it is unknown whether both coverage and accuracy can be improved simultaneously.</li>
                <li>If certainty filtering is used in safety-critical domains (e.g., toxicity or factuality), it is unknown whether abstention will avoid critical errors or simply reduce coverage to impractical levels.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If certainty filtering does not improve LLM judge accuracy on the high-certainty subset, this would challenge the certainty-filtered reliability law.</li>
                <li>If increasing the certainty threshold does not decrease coverage, this would challenge the coverage-accuracy tradeoff law.</li>
                <li>If certainty-filtered LLM judgments are less accurate than human annotators on the high-certainty subset, this would challenge the theory.</li>
                <li>If weaker models (e.g., GPT-3.5) show improved accuracy under certainty filtering, this would challenge the Certainty Filtering Failure Law.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cases where LLM judges outperform humans on factual error detection without certainty filtering (e.g., top LLMs on factual-error perturbation tasks). <a href="../results/extraction-result-3863.html#e3863.1" class="evidence-link">[e3863.1]</a> </li>
    <li>LLM judges' performance on tasks where abstention is not possible or not meaningful (e.g., forced-choice settings). <a href="../results/extraction-result-3852.html#e3852.0" class="evidence-link">[e3852.0]</a> </li>
