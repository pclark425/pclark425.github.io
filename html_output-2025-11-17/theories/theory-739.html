                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Latent Algorithm and Surface Pattern Competition Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLMs possess a hierarchy of latent algorithmic routines for arithmetic, which compete with surface pattern-matching mechanisms during inference. The outcome of this competition determines whether the model executes correct arithmetic or falls back on superficial, potentially erroneous, outputs.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Evidence for this Law</h4>
<ol>
    <li>LLMs are more error-prone on arithmetic queries with ambiguous or novel formats, often producing plausible but incorrect answers. </li>
    <li>Surface-level errors are more frequent when queries deviate from training patterns. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The error patterns are known, but the competitive mechanism is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Surface-level errors in ambiguous or novel queries are documented.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit competition and fallback mechanism is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If arithmetic queries are made more ambiguous, LLMs will increasingly default to surface pattern-matching, increasing error rates.</li>
                <li>Providing explicit cues for algorithmic reasoning (e.g., CoT prompts) will increase the likelihood of correct hierarchical routine activation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs are trained with adversarial ambiguous arithmetic queries, it is unknown whether they will develop new algorithmic routines or simply shift error patterns.</li>
                <li>If LLMs are given meta-cognitive prompts to 'choose the best strategy', the effect on the competition between algorithmic and surface routines is unknown.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs do not show increased error on ambiguous arithmetic queries, the theory's competition mechanism would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs never default to surface pattern-matching, the fallback mechanism would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Some LLMs can generalize to novel arithmetic formats without increased error, which is not fully explained by the theory. </li>
