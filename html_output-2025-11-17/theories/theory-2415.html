                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Intrinsic Molecular Resilience and Pathway Cohesiveness Theory (General Formulation 2: Network Homeostasis Perspective)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the selective vulnerability of visual cortex neurons to Aβ and tau pathology is governed by their capacity to maintain network homeostasis under proteotoxic stress. Neurons with robust, redundant, and dynamically adaptable molecular networks (including chaperones, autophagy, and synaptic maintenance) can buffer against pathological insults, while those with rigid or poorly connected networks are prone to collapse, leading to selective degeneration.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Pharmacological or genetic interventions that increase network redundancy will confer resistance to Aβ and tau pathology in human neurons.</li>
                <li>Network rigidity may be reversible in early stages, and restoring redundancy could halt or reverse pathology.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If neurons with high network redundancy are not more resistant to pathology, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If increasing network rigidity does not increase vulnerability, the theory would be called into question.</li>
