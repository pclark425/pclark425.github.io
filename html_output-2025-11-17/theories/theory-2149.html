                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can distill high-level scientific theories from vast corpora of scholarly papers by identifying recurring conceptual patterns, causal relationships, and explanatory frameworks, even when these are not explicitly stated in any single paper. The process is emergent, relying on the LLM's ability to generalize across diverse textual evidence and synthesize new, coherent theoretical frameworks.</p>
