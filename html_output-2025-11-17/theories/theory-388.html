                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Proxy Architecture and Correction Effectiveness Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about the evaluation and validation of incremental versus transformational scientific discoveries in automated systems.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that proxy-to-ground-truth gaps in evaluating scientific discoveries are primarily determined by proxy architecture and information availability rather than inherent limitations of automated evaluation. Proxy performance follows a clear hierarchy: (1) Traditional absolute proxies (raw citation counts, absolute semantic density, standard peer review) show large gaps with severe cross-domain degradation (AUROC drops from 0.75-0.85 to 0.36-0.40, representing 40-50 percentage point degradation); (2) Relative proxies (Relative Neighbor Density, percentile-based metrics) show minimal gaps with stable cross-domain performance (AUROC 0.795-0.820 across domains, <5% degradation); (3) Information-augmented proxies (LLMs with external literature retrieval, structured multi-stage analysis) show intermediate performance (AUROC 0.6-0.8 depending on domain and information quality). Correction mechanisms show mechanism-specific effectiveness: meta-learning with adaptive bias-aware alignment and entropy weighting reduces prediction error by up to 92% (MSE from 0.1191 to 0.0093); structured extraction with literature retrieval improves alignment by 20-40 percentage points (86.5% reasoning alignment vs 65.1% human-human baseline); relative normalization maintains stable cross-domain performance where absolute metrics fail. The effectiveness of correction depends on: (1) matching the mechanism to the specific failure mode, (2) quality and coverage of external information, (3) sophistication of normalization or meta-learning, and (4) within-domain vs cross-domain application. This theory suggests proxy-truth gaps are engineering challenges that can be largely solved through appropriate architectural choices rather than fundamental limitations.</p>

            <p><strong>Change Log:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created new theory focused specifically on proxy architecture and correction mechanisms, separated from the general theory about traditional proxy failures to better capture the distinct mechanisms and evidence.</li>
                <li>Established quantitative proxy performance hierarchy with specific metrics: relative proxies (<5% cross-domain degradation, AUROC 0.795-0.820), information-augmented proxies (20-40 percentage point improvement), traditional absolute proxies (40-50 percentage point cross-domain degradation).</li>
                <li>Added specific quantitative predictions for correction mechanism effectiveness: relative normalization (30-50 percentage point cross-domain improvement), information augmentation (20-40 percentage point alignment improvement), meta-learning (60-90% error reduction, specifically 92% for DI prediction).</li>
                <li>Incorporated evidence that proxy-truth gaps can be largely eliminated through appropriate architectural choices (AUROC 0.80-0.85 achievable), contradicting the original theory's claim of inherent 70-90% undervaluation.</li>

                <li>Included cross-domain performance as a critical discriminating test for proxy architecture quality, with quantitative thresholds (AUROC >0.75 for good architectures, <0.50 for poor architectures).</li>
                <li>Added predictions about ensemble approaches combining multiple correction mechanisms with expected additive benefits (10-20 percentage points).</li>

                <li>Added unknown predictions about generalization to AI-generated discoveries, limits of automated evaluation (potential ceiling around AUROC 0.85-0.95), and information saturation effects.</li>
                <li>Specified that the theory addresses an engineering challenge rather than an inherent limitation of automated evaluation, with practical implications for system design.</li>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Proxy performance follows a clear architecture-based hierarchy: relative proxies show minimal cross-domain degradation (<5% AUROC drop), information-augmented proxies show intermediate performance (20-40 percentage point improvement over baselines), and traditional absolute proxies show severe degradation (40-50 percentage point AUROC drop cross-domain).</li>
                <li>Relative normalization (computing novelty as percentile rank among neighbors rather than absolute density) eliminates domain-specific bias and maintains stable cross-domain performance (AUROC 0.795-0.820 vs 0.36-0.40 for absolute metrics).</li>
                <li>Information augmentation (providing external literature, structured extraction, multi-stage analysis) improves proxy performance by 20-40 percentage points in alignment metrics, with effectiveness depending on information quality, coverage, and domain match to system knowledge.</li>
                <li>Meta-learning approaches with adaptive bias-aware alignment, entropy weighting for rare samples, and secondary learning on high-error cases reduce prediction error by up to 92% for disruption index prediction (MSE from 0.1191 to 0.0093).</li>
                <li>Correction mechanism effectiveness is mechanism-specific and depends on matching the correction to the failure mode: relative normalization corrects density-sensitivity; information augmentation corrects knowledge gaps; meta-learning corrects systematic prediction biases.</li>
                <li>Cross-domain application is a critical test distinguishing proxy architectures: absolute metrics degrade severely (40-50 percentage point AUROC drop) while relative metrics maintain performance (AUROC 0.795-0.820 across domains).</li>
                <li>Task framing substantially affects proxy performance: open-ended framing improves comparable rates by 20-60 percentage points compared to guided framing for the same underlying work.</li>
                <li>Structured multi-stage analysis (landscape mapping + delta analysis + evidence synthesis) produces higher rates of deep analyses (52.1% vs 11.5% human baseline) and eliminates surface-level analyses (0% vs 22.3% human baseline).</li>
                <li>LLM-based evaluation without external information performs near-random (AUROC approximately 0.5), but with retrieved literature achieves AUROC approximately 0.8 in computer science and approximately 0.6 in biomedicine, demonstrating information-dependence.</li>
                <li>The proxy-truth gap is primarily an information and architecture problem: well-designed proxies with appropriate normalization and information access achieve near-parity with ground truth (AUROC 0.80-0.85) rather than showing inherent 70-90% undervaluation.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>

    <li>Absolute Local Density shows severe cross-domain degradation (AUROC drop from approximately 0.85 to approximately 0.36-0.40, representing 40-50 percentage point drop), demonstrating that absolute metrics are sensitive to corpus-specific characteristics. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2134.html#e2134.1" class="evidence-link">[e2134.1]</a> </li>
    <li>Open-ended tasks show substantially improved evaluator ratings compared to guided tasks (comparable rates increasing from 15.79-78.95% to 40-100%), demonstrating that task framing and information structure affect proxy performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2131.html#e2131.3" class="evidence-link">[e2131.3]</a> </li>

    <li>Alternative novelty metrics including atypical combinations, Z-scores for journal pairings, and innovation indices are proposed as corrections to traditional proxies, with theoretical support for improved performance. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2127.html#e2127.3" class="evidence-link">[e2127.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2133.html#e2133.5" class="evidence-link">[e2133.5]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2126.html#e2126.1" class="evidence-link">[e2126.1]</a> </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Applying relative normalization (percentile-based metrics) to any absolute proxy will reduce cross-domain performance degradation by 30-50 percentage points compared to the absolute version.</li>
                <li>Providing LLM-based evaluation systems with retrieved external literature will improve novelty detection AUROC by 20-40 percentage points compared to LLM-only evaluation, with larger improvements in domains where the LLM has less internal knowledge (e.g., biomedicine vs computer science).</li>
                <li>Combining relative normalization with information augmentation will achieve stable cross-domain performance (AUROC >0.75) across diverse scientific fields, outperforming either mechanism alone by 10-20 percentage points.</li>
                <li>Meta-learning approaches that explicitly model proxy-truth relationships and use entropy weighting for rare transformational examples will reduce prediction error by 60-90% compared to standard supervised learning baselines.</li>
                <li>Structured multi-stage analysis (landscape mapping + delta analysis + evidence synthesis) will improve novelty assessment alignment with human ground truth by 15-25 percentage points compared to single-stage analysis.</li>
                <li>Proxies achieving high within-domain performance (AUROC >0.85) using absolute metrics will show severe cross-domain degradation (AUROC <0.50), while relative proxies will maintain performance (AUROC >0.75) across the same domain boundaries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether ensemble approaches combining relative normalization, information augmentation, and meta-learning can achieve near-perfect proxy-truth alignment (AUROC >0.95) across all domains and transformation degrees, or whether there are fundamental limits around 0.85 AUROC even with optimal architecture.</li>
                <li>Whether correction mechanisms effective for current scientific literature will generalize to AI-generated scientific discoveries, which may have fundamentally different novelty distributions, citation patterns, and impact trajectories.</li>
                <li>Whether providing more extensive external information (full-text papers, complete citation networks, experimental data, code repositories) beyond abstracts and top-10 retrieved papers would yield further substantial improvements (>10 percentage points) or whether current information augmentation approaches are near saturation.</li>
                <li>Whether relative normalization approaches will maintain effectiveness as scientific fields evolve and new paradigms emerge, or whether they will require periodic recalibration to new conceptual landscapes and citation patterns.</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid systems using relative proxies for initial screening, information-augmented LLMs for detailed assessment, and meta-learning for final prediction can achieve both efficiency and accuracy superior to human expert evaluation across all transformation degrees, or whether human judgment remains essential for highly transformational edge cases.</li>
                <li>Whether the success of relative normalization in novelty detection will generalize to other scientific evaluation tasks (quality assessment, reproducibility prediction, translational potential estimation, ethical risk assessment) or is specific to novelty detection due to its particular characteristics.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If relative normalization does not reduce cross-domain degradation by >20 percentage points compared to absolute metrics, the theory's core claim about architecture-dependence would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If information augmentation (providing external literature) does not improve LLM-based evaluation performance by >10 percentage points, the theory's claim about information-dependence would be weakened.</li>
                <li>If meta-learning approaches with entropy weighting and secondary learning do not outperform standard supervised learning by >30% error reduction, the theory's claims about correction mechanism effectiveness would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If combining multiple correction mechanisms (relative normalization + information augmentation) shows no additive benefit (improvement <5 percentage points) over the best single mechanism, the theory's predictions about mechanism complementarity would be invalidated.</li>
                <li>If well-designed proxies with relative normalization and information augmentation still show large gaps (>40% undervaluation or AUROC <0.60) for highly transformational work across multiple domains, the theory's claim that gaps are primarily an engineering problem would be falsified.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not fully explain why some evaluator-domain combinations show anomalous performance patterns that don't fit the architecture hierarchy (e.g., specific LLM-domain pairs showing unexpected degradation or success). <a href="../results/extraction-result-2131.html#e2131.3" class="evidence-link">[e2131.3]</a> </li>
    <li>The optimal amount, type, and retrieval strategy for external information in information augmentation is not specified, including whether there are diminishing returns, saturation effects, or optimal information diversity. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2134.html#e2134.3" class="evidence-link">[e2134.3]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2130.html#e2130.0" class="evidence-link">[e2130.0]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how correction mechanisms should be adapted for different types of transformation (theoretical vs methodological vs empirical) or whether mechanism effectiveness varies by transformation type. </li>
    <li>The computational costs, scalability trade-offs, and practical implementation constraints of different correction mechanisms are not incorporated into the theory. </li>
    <li>The theory does not explain why some persistent conceptual gaps in embedding space are preferentially filled by newer versus older work (4 of 11 persistent holes showed higher mixup for newer documents), suggesting additional factors beyond training distribution. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2128.html#e2128.1" class="evidence-link">[e2128.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The interaction effects between presentation quality and different correction mechanisms are not fully characterized—whether information augmentation or relative normalization are more or less sensitive to presentation effects. <a href="../results/extraction-result-2131.html#e2131.2" class="evidence-link">[e2131.2]</a> <a href="../results/extraction-result-2130.html#e2130.1" class="evidence-link">[e2130.1]</a> </li>
    <li>The theory does not address whether correction mechanism effectiveness varies systematically with the degree of transformation or whether effectiveness is uniform across incremental to highly transformational work. </li>
