                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-2360</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Integrated Multifactorial Cascade Theory of Alzheimer's Disease</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) arises from the convergence of multiple interacting biological cascades—genetic susceptibility, metabolic dysfunction, vascular compromise, proteostatic failure, and neuroinflammation. These factors interact nonlinearly, with feedback loops amplifying pathology. Early detection is possible by identifying convergent biomarker signatures across these domains, rather than relying on a single pathological hallmark.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Interventions targeting multiple domains simultaneously (e.g., metabolic, vascular, and anti-inflammatory) will have synergistic effects in delaying or preventing AD.</li>
                <li>Novel feedback-disrupting therapies (e.g., targeting the interaction between neuroinflammation and proteostasis) will be more effective than monotherapies.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If individuals with high-risk profiles across all domains do not develop AD at higher rates, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If single-modality biomarkers (e.g., amyloid PET alone) outperform integrated panels, the detection law is called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>Rare monogenic forms of AD may not require multifactorial convergence. </li>
