                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hierarchical Episodic Memory Theory for LLM Agents in Text Games</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how LLM agents for text games can best use memory to solve text game tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that LLM agents can best solve text game tasks by constructing and maintaining a hierarchical episodic memory, where experiences are stored at multiple levels of abstraction (from fine-grained actions to high-level episodes). This enables efficient retrieval, generalization, and planning, allowing agents to flexibly adapt to both short-term and long-term dependencies in text games.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The principle is known, but its operationalization for LLM text game agents is new.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Context-sensitive memory retrieval is known in cognitive science and some AI systems.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The law's explicit application to LLM agents in text games, with dynamic abstraction-level selection, is novel.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLM agents with hierarchical episodic memory will outperform those with flat memory on tasks requiring both short-term and long-term planning.</li>
                <li>Agents will be able to generalize strategies across similar episodes by retrieving high-level summaries.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hierarchical memory may enable transfer learning between structurally different games if high-level abstractions are similar.</li>
                <li>Too many abstraction levels may introduce retrieval overhead, potentially reducing performance in fast-paced games.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If hierarchical memory does not improve performance over flat memory in long-horizon or complex games, the theory is challenged.</li>
                <li>If agents fail to retrieve relevant information at the correct abstraction level, the theory's assumptions are undermined.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify how to optimally determine the number or granularity of abstraction levels for different games. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
