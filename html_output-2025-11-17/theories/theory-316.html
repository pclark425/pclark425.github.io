                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prior Knowledge Integration via Language Models Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> specific</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how adaptive experimental design works for AI agents operating in unknown environments.. Please focus on creating new theories that have not been proposed before in the literature.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that AI agents can leverage language models as repositories of prior knowledge to guide adaptive experimental design in unknown environments through a multi-stage integration process. The theory posits that LMs encode diverse forms of prior knowledge (causal relationships, procedural strategies, domain constraints, and heuristics) that can be extracted and integrated with empirical observations to accelerate learning. The effectiveness of this integration depends on three key factors: (1) the semantic and structural similarity between the target environment and the LM's training distribution, (2) the agent's ability to dynamically calibrate trust in LM-derived priors based on empirical validation, and (3) the method of knowledge extraction and representation. The theory predicts that optimal performance requires a hybrid approach where LM priors provide initial hypothesis space constraints and exploration strategies, which are then refined through a Bayesian-like updating process as environment-specific data accumulates. Critically, the agent must maintain uncertainty estimates over both the LM's knowledge quality and the environment's true dynamics, adjusting the relative weighting through an adaptive trust mechanism that responds to prediction errors and consistency checks.</p>

            <h2>Theory (Details)</h2>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The utility of LM-derived priors for experimental design U_LM(t) at time t follows a decay function: U_LM(t) = α(S) · β(t) · P_LM, where α(S) is a similarity-dependent scaling factor, β(t) is a time-decay function representing the increasing value of empirical data, and P_LM is the base prior quality from the LM.</li>
                <li>There exists a critical similarity threshold S_crit such that for S < S_crit, LM priors provide negligible or negative utility, while for S > S_crit, utility increases monotonically with similarity.</li>
                <li>The optimal weighting w*(t) between LM priors and empirical observations should follow a Bayesian updating rule: w*(t) = f(S, σ_LM(t), σ_emp(t), n(t)), where σ_LM is the estimated uncertainty in LM knowledge, σ_emp is the uncertainty in empirical estimates, and n(t) is the number of observations collected.</li>
                <li>Agents can estimate their position on the semantic similarity gradient by computing the correlation ρ between LM predictions and early empirical observations: S_est = g(ρ, n_early), where n_early is a small number of initial experiments.</li>
                <li>The rate of learning R in the environment is enhanced by LM priors according to: R_with_LM = R_baseline + k · α(S) · (1 - β(t)), where k is a constant and the enhancement diminishes as empirical data accumulates.</li>
                <li>Different types of prior knowledge (causal, procedural, constraint-based) should be weighted differently based on their verifiability: causal priors require more empirical validation than constraint-based priors.</li>
                <li>The agent should maintain separate uncertainty estimates for different aspects of LM knowledge (e.g., domain facts vs. experimental strategies) and update them independently based on empirical feedback.</li>
                <li>In environments with partial similarity to training data, the agent should decompose the environment into components and apply LM priors selectively to high-similarity components while relying on exploration for low-similarity components.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Supporting Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Language models have been shown to encode substantial world knowledge including causal relationships, physical intuitions, and procedural knowledge that can be extracted through appropriate prompting. </li>
    <li>Transfer learning research demonstrates that pre-trained models can accelerate learning in new domains, with effectiveness depending on domain similarity and adaptation strategies. </li>
    <li>Bayesian approaches to integrating prior knowledge with empirical data provide a principled framework for balancing pre-existing beliefs with new observations. </li>
    <li>Active learning and experimental design benefit from informative priors that constrain the hypothesis space and guide exploration toward informative experiments. </li>
    <li>Semantic similarity metrics computed from language model embeddings provide quantifiable measures of domain relatedness. </li>
    <li>Language models show performance degradation on out-of-distribution tasks, indicating the importance of distribution matching for reliable knowledge transfer. </li>
    <li>Prompt engineering and in-context learning enable flexible extraction of different types of knowledge from language models without fine-tuning. </li>
    <li>Uncertainty quantification in language models is crucial for reliable decision-making, though current methods remain imperfect. </li>
</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a suite of experimental design tasks with varying similarity to common domains (e.g., standard physics simulations vs. modified physics with altered constants), performance gains from LM priors will show a strong positive correlation (r > 0.7) with semantic similarity scores computed from environment descriptions.</li>
                <li>Agents that implement dynamic trust calibration based on early empirical validation (first 5-10% of experiments) will achieve 20-40% faster convergence to optimal experimental strategies compared to agents with fixed prior weights.</li>
                <li>The variance in experimental outcomes will be 30-50% lower in high-similarity environments when using LM priors, as the priors effectively constrain the hypothesis space and reduce random exploration.</li>
                <li>Agents using LM priors will show a characteristic learning curve with rapid initial progress (when priors are most valuable) followed by a transition point where empirical learning dominates, with the transition occurring earlier in low-similarity environments.</li>
                <li>Prompt engineering that explicitly requests uncertainty estimates alongside predictions will improve agent performance by 15-25% compared to prompts that only request point predictions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exist 'semantic similarity traps' where environments appear highly similar to known domains (S > 0.8) but have fundamentally different causal structures, causing LM priors to be maximally misleading and actually slow learning compared to uninformed exploration, is unknown but would have critical safety implications.</li>
                <li>The shape of the similarity-utility function (linear, logarithmic, sigmoid, power-law, etc.) and whether it varies systematically across different types of experimental design tasks (e.g., parameter optimization vs. causal discovery vs. policy learning) could reveal fundamental constraints on knowledge transfer.</li>
                <li>Whether agents can learn to recognize low-similarity environments before conducting many experiments (n < 10), or whether substantial empirical data (n > 100) is required for reliable similarity estimation, has major implications for efficiency and safety in resource-constrained or high-stakes scenarios.</li>
                <li>Whether combining priors from multiple LMs with different training distributions can provide robustness against individual model biases and extend the effective range of high-quality prior knowledge is unclear but could be transformative for practical applications.</li>
                <li>The extent to which LM priors can accelerate discovery of genuinely novel phenomena (those absent from training data) through analogical reasoning or compositional generalization remains unknown and would test the limits of prior knowledge integration.</li>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal 'prior strength' parameter that balances exploration and exploitation across diverse environments, or whether this must be learned separately for each environment class, would determine the generality of LM-guided experimental design systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If performance gains from LM priors show no significant correlation (|r| < 0.3) with semantic similarity measures across a diverse set of 50+ environments spanning multiple domains, this would invalidate the similarity-dependence premise of the theory.</li>
                <li>If agents cannot reliably estimate semantic similarity from early observations (requiring n > 50% of total experiments for accurate estimation), making the adaptive trust mechanism impractical for real-world applications, this would severely limit the theory's applicability.</li>
                <li>If the similarity-utility relationship is highly non-monotonic or chaotic (e.g., showing multiple local optima or discontinuities), making it unpredictable across environments, this would challenge the theory's core predictive power.</li>
                <li>If LM priors consistently harm performance (negative utility) even in high-similarity environments (S > 0.9) due to subtle distributional shifts or overconfidence, this would suggest fundamental limitations in using LMs for experimental design.</li>
                <li>If the optimal weighting between LM priors and empirical data does not follow a predictable decay function but instead requires complex, environment-specific tuning, this would undermine the theory's claim of providing a general integration framework.</li>
                <li>If different prompt formulations for the same environment yield LM priors with contradictory predictions and no systematic way to resolve conflicts, this would indicate that LM knowledge extraction is too unreliable for principled integration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not specify which semantic similarity metric (cosine similarity of embeddings, edit distance, domain-specific metrics) is most appropriate for experimental design contexts, and different metrics may yield substantially different predictions and performance. </li>
    <li>How to handle multi-modal environments where some aspects are highly similar to training data and others are completely novel is not fully addressed, particularly the question of whether to apply priors globally or selectively. </li>
    <li>The computational costs of continuously querying LMs, computing similarity metrics, and updating trust parameters are not accounted for, which could be prohibitive in resource-constrained settings. </li>
    <li>The theory does not address how to handle temporal dynamics where the environment itself changes over time, potentially moving in and out of the LM's knowledge distribution. </li>
    <li>How to integrate conflicting priors from different parts of the LM or from multiple LMs with different training distributions is not specified. </li>
    <li>The role of prompt engineering quality and its interaction with similarity is not fully theorized—poor prompts might fail to extract useful priors even in high-similarity environments. </li>
    <li>The theory does not account for adversarial or deceptive environments that might be designed to exploit LM biases or common misconceptions encoded in training data. </li>
