                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dynamic Weighting Theory of Multidimensional Alignment in LLM-Generated Scientific Theory Evaluation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the relative importance (weight) of each alignment axis (empirical adequacy, conceptual coherence, methodological transparency, epistemic novelty) in evaluating LLM-generated scientific theories is not fixed, but dynamically determined by the context, domain, and intended use of the theory. The theory further posits that optimal evaluation requires adaptive weighting schemes that can be learned or tuned based on feedback from domain experts and empirical outcomes.</p>
