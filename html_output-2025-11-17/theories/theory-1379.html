                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Model Capability Threshold Theory of Self-Reflection Efficacy: Meta-Representation Law</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the efficacy of self-reflection in language models is governed by the model's ability to form meta-representations of its own outputs and reasoning processes. A threshold exists where the model can not only generate answers, but also represent, critique, and revise its own reasoning. Below this threshold, self-reflection is superficial or ineffective.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Models that can explain their own reasoning (e.g., via chain-of-thought) show greater self-reflection efficacy. </li>
    <li>Ablation studies show that removing reasoning or explanation ability reduces self-reflection gains. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Meta-cognition is studied, but the threshold law for self-reflection is a novel formalization.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Meta-cognition and explanation ability are known to correlate with model performance.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit threshold law linking meta-representation ability to self-reflection efficacy.</p>
