                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Conceptual Mapping Theory of LLM Theory Distillation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill theories from large numbers of scholarly papers, given a specific topic or query.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLMs distill scientific theories by constructing and traversing high-dimensional latent conceptual maps of the scientific literature, where concepts, relationships, and evidence are embedded. The LLM identifies clusters, bridges, and gaps in this conceptual space, enabling it to synthesize new theory statements that connect disparate findings, resolve ambiguities, and highlight underexplored areas.</p>

            <ol>

                <li>If LLM-generated conceptual maps do not correspond to expert-validated conceptual structures, the latent mapping law is challenged.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot synthesize theory statements that integrate evidence from disparate sources, the theory's predictive power is undermined.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The impact of incomplete or biased training data on the accuracy of conceptual maps is not fully addressed. </li>
    <li>The ability of LLMs to handle non-textual or multimodal scientific evidence in conceptual mapping is not modeled. </li>
