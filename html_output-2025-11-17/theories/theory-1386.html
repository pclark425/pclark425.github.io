                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Iterative Self-Optimization through Reflective Feedback</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform self-reflection and improve their answer quality through multiple iterations of generate-then-reflect.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that language models improve answer quality through a process of iterative self-optimization, where each reflection phase acts as a feedback loop that identifies and corrects errors, ambiguities, or omissions in the initial output. The model leverages its own generated outputs as new context, enabling a form of self-supervised learning and dynamic adjustment of internal representations, even without external supervision.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>In tasks with highly subjective or open-ended answers, iterative reflection may lead to convergence on a single mode, reducing diversity.</li>
                <li>Excessive reflection iterations may cause overfitting to self-generated errors, degrading answer quality.</li>
