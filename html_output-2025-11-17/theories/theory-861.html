                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that LLM agents optimize task performance by adaptively allocating computational and memory resources across hybrid memory systems (context, retrieval, external tools) in response to real-time estimates of task complexity, uncertainty, and expected utility, thereby maximizing efficiency and accuracy.</p>
