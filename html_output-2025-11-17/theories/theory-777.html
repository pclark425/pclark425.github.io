                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Implicit Algorithmic Approximation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models perform arithmetic.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Language models approximate arithmetic by implicitly learning algorithmic procedures through their parameterization and training. Rather than memorizing all possible arithmetic facts, LMs develop distributed representations that encode partial, noisy versions of arithmetic algorithms (e.g., digit-wise addition, carry propagation). The fidelity of these approximations depends on model size, training data, and architectural inductive biases.</p>
