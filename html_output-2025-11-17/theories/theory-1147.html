                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language models can best perform strict logical reasoning.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory extends the decomposition-composition law to settings where language models interact with external tools, memory, or other agents. It posits that LMs can achieve strict logical reasoning on problems exceeding their native capacity by decomposing tasks, delegating subproblems to external resources or agents, and iteratively composing the results, thus effectively expanding their reasoning depth and breadth.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If LMs with access to external memory or tools do not outperform those without on deep logical problems, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If iterative delegation does not improve performance on decomposable logical problems, the law would be falsified.</li>
                <li>If multi-agent collaboration leads to worse performance than single-agent reasoning, the theory would be called into question.</li>

<ol>
    <li>The cost and reliability of external resources and agents are not addressed by the theory. </li>
