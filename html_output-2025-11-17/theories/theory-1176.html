                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Conditional Chemical Synthesis Theory (General: Iterative Human-LLM Co-Design Loop)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that the most effective LLM-driven chemical synthesis occurs through an iterative, conditional co-design loop between human experts and LLMs. The LLM generates candidate molecules and synthetic routes based on user-specified constraints, while human experts (or automated evaluators) provide feedback, corrections, or additional constraints. This feedback is incorporated by the LLM in subsequent iterations, enabling rapid convergence toward optimal, application-specific chemical solutions.</p>
