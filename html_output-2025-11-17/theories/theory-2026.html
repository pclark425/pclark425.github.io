                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Bilevel LLM-Simulation Theory of Quantitative Law Distillation (Generalization-Driven Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory asserts that the bilevel LLM simulation framework is particularly effective at distilling quantitative laws that maximize generalizability across scientific domains. The first level identifies and encodes domain-specific variables and relationships, while the second level abstracts and tests candidate quantitative laws for cross-domain applicability. The system preferentially selects laws that demonstrate high predictive power and transferability, thus enabling the discovery of universal or near-universal scientific principles.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>

                <li>Bilevel LLM simulations may identify previously unrecognized analogies between fields (e.g., between thermodynamics and information theory) via law distillation.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If the system fails to produce any cross-domain laws, or if its laws do not generalize, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If domain-specific laws consistently outperform cross-domain laws in predictive accuracy, the theory's selection mechanism is called into question.</li>

    <li>The effect of domain imbalance or lack of representation in the input corpus on law generalizability is not fully addressed. </li>
