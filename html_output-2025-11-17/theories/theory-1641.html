                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1641</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Simulation Fidelity Boundary Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the achievable fidelity of LLM-based scientific simulation is fundamentally bounded by the interplay of model scale, alignment, and prompt/context design, with each factor exhibiting threshold effects and non-linear interactions. The theory asserts that for each scientific subdomain, there exists a critical threshold for each factor, below which simulation fidelity drops precipitously, and above which further improvements yield diminishing returns.</p>
