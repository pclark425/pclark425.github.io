                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Memory Consolidation and Recall-Frequency Law for Personalized Dialogue Agents</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how language model agents can best use memory to solve tasks.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the effectiveness of language model agents in task-solving is governed by a dynamic interplay between memory consolidation (the process of integrating and abstracting past experiences) and recall frequency (how often relevant memories are retrieved). The optimal balance is determined by the agent's need for personalization, task complexity, and the temporal distribution of relevant experiences. Agents that adaptively consolidate and recall memories based on these factors will outperform those with static or naive memory strategies.</p>
