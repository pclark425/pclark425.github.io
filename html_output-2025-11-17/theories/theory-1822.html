                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Latent Scientific Trajectory Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can estimate the probability of future scientific discoveries by modeling latent trajectories of scientific progress, as inferred from patterns of publication, citation, and discourse evolution in their training data. The model implicitly learns the dynamics of idea propagation, maturation, and breakthrough, allowing it to extrapolate the likelihood of specific discoveries based on the inferred trajectory stage.</p>
