                <p><strong>ID:</strong> theory-1806</p>
                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Epistemic Compression and Extrapolation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> LLMs can measure the probability of future scientific discoveries by compressing the epistemic state of a field—summarizing its current knowledge, open questions, and research trajectories—and extrapolating likely next steps. By modeling the structure of scientific argumentation, gaps in knowledge, and the historical pace of progress, LLMs can estimate the likelihood of specific discoveries based on how 'ripe' a field is for breakthrough, even in the absence of explicit signals.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs will assign higher probabilities to discoveries in fields with well-defined open questions and recent rapid progress.</li>
                <li>LLMs will be able to identify 'ripe' areas for discovery even in the absence of strong bibliometric signals.</li>
                <li>LLMs will outperform simple trend extrapolation models in forecasting discoveries in fields with clear epistemic structure.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may identify latent knowledge gaps that lead to unexpected discoveries.</li>
                <li>LLMs could forecast paradigm shifts by detecting epistemic saturation or crisis points.</li>
                <li>LLMs may be able to predict the emergence of entirely new subfields based on epistemic compression.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs cannot identify knowledge gaps or open questions, the theory is undermined.</li>
                <li>If LLMs' probability estimates do not correlate with actual discovery rates in 'ripe' fields, the theory is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs fail to outperform random or naive baselines in forecasting discoveries based on epistemic state, the theory is weakened.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Fields with poorly defined epistemic structure or highly interdisciplinary boundaries may not be amenable to compression. </li>
    <li>Breakthroughs driven by technological advances rather than epistemic gaps may not be forecastable by this method. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
            <p><strong>Likely Classification:</strong> somewhat-related-to-existing</p>
