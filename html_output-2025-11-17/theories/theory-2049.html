                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can be used to distill quantitative laws from large numbers of scholarly input papers.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) can synthesize quantitative laws from large corpora of scholarly papers by leveraging their ability to semantically align diverse textual descriptions, extract mathematical relationships, and generalize across heterogeneous sources, thus enabling the emergence of new, robust scientific laws that may not be explicitly stated in any single paper.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may discover entirely new quantitative relationships not previously recognized by the scientific community.</li>
                <li>LLMs could identify latent variables or hidden confounders by analyzing patterns across many studies.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs fail to synthesize consistent laws from heterogeneous sources, the theory is undermined.</li>

            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not address the risk of LLMs propagating systematic biases present in the literature. </li>
    <li>The impact of non-English or poorly digitized papers on synthesis quality is not considered. </li>
