                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Circuit Topology-Driven Propagation Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of why certain neuronal populations within the visual cortex are selectively vulnerable or resistant to amyloid-β plaques and tau protein tangles in dementia.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Selective vulnerability or resistance of visual cortical neuronal populations to amyloid-β and tau pathology is determined by their position and connectivity within local and global circuit topology. Neurons that are highly interconnected, serve as network hubs, or are positioned along major propagation pathways are more exposed to toxic protein spread and network dysfunction, making them vulnerable. Neurons with sparse connectivity or peripheral positions are less exposed and more resistant.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>If highly connected hub neurons are not more vulnerable than peripheral neurons, the theory is challenged.</li>
