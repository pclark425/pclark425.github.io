                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Selective Forecasting and Uncertainty Hedging Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can accurately measure the probability or likelihood of specific future real-world scientific discoveries.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs) forecast the probability of future scientific discoveries by selectively integrating signals from the scientific literature, social context, and historical precedent, while simultaneously hedging against epistemic uncertainty by modulating their confidence based on the diversity, recency, and consensus of available evidence. The theory asserts that LLMs do not simply extrapolate trends, but actively weigh and filter information to optimize the calibration of their probabilistic forecasts.</p>
