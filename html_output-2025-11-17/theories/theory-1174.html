                <p><strong>Name:</strong> LLM-Driven Conditional Chemical Synthesis Theory (General: Language-to-Molecule Mapping)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that large language models (LLMs), when trained on extensive chemical, synthetic, and application-specific corpora, can learn a conditional mapping from textual or structured prompts (describing desired properties, constraints, or applications) to valid, novel chemical structures and plausible synthetic routes. The LLM acts as a conditional generative model, leveraging latent representations of chemical knowledge to propose molecules and synthesis plans tailored to user-specified requirements.</p>

            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs consistently fail to generate valid or novel molecules when given new application constraints, the theory's conditional generative mapping law is called into question.</li>
                <li>If LLMs cannot integrate application-specific requirements into their outputs (i.e., generated molecules do not match the prompt), the latent knowledge integration law is challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The theory does not explain cases where LLMs hallucinate chemically invalid or synthetically infeasible molecules. </li>
