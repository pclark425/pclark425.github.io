                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Action-Space Alignment Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about when and how pretraining on text worlds transfers to 3D embodied tasks, including mappings between high-level action semantics and low-level perception and predicted sample complexity gains, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> Successful transfer from text-world pretraining to 3D embodied tasks requires explicit alignment between the action representations in pretraining and the action space of the embodied environment. This alignment can occur through multiple mechanisms: (1) direct token mapping where language tokens represent discretized actions (e.g., RT-2's action tokenization), (2) hierarchical decomposition where high-level language actions are mapped to low-level motor primitives through learned or programmatic interfaces (e.g., IGOR's subtask decomposition, OPEx's skill library), (3) reward/goal specification where language defines objectives rather than actions (e.g., MineCLIP's reward function), or (4) code-as-policy where language models generate executable programs that invoke action primitives (e.g., Voyager). The degree of action-space mismatch—measured by semantic distance, temporal granularity, and structural compatibility—is a primary determinant of transfer difficulty. Larger mismatches require either more embodied data, sophisticated bridging mechanisms (e.g., inverse dynamics models, skill libraries), or indirect specification through goals. The effectiveness of different alignment strategies depends on task characteristics: discrete semantic tasks favor direct mapping, continuous control tasks require hierarchical decomposition or goal-based approaches, and long-horizon tasks benefit from compositional action representations.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Transfer difficulty increases with the semantic and structural distance between pretrained action representations and embodied action spaces, measured by vocabulary overlap, temporal granularity, and abstraction level</li>
                <li>Direct token-level action mapping (e.g., discretized motor commands as text tokens) enables end-to-end transfer but requires action vocabularies compatible with language model tokenization and sufficient action-labeled data</li>
                <li>Hierarchical decomposition (language→skills→primitives) reduces action-space mismatch by introducing intermediate representations that bridge semantic and motor levels, with effectiveness proportional to the quality of the decomposition</li>
                <li>Indirect action specification through goals/rewards enables transfer without explicit action mapping but requires separate mechanisms (e.g., RL, planning) to achieve specified objectives and may have higher sample complexity</li>
                <li>Co-training or co-finetuning on both language and embodied action data is more effective than sequential pretraining→finetuning for learning action mappings, as shown by RT-2's ~2x improvement over finetuning-only approaches</li>
                <li>Action-space alignment quality is a stronger predictor of transfer success than the scale of language pretraining when misalignment is severe (e.g., continuous control with language-only pretraining)</li>
                <li>The optimal action representation depends on task characteristics: discrete semantic tasks favor direct token mapping, continuous control requires hierarchical decomposition or inverse dynamics, and long-horizon tasks benefit from compositional representations</li>
                <li>Action preconditions and effects learned during pretraining facilitate transfer when they align with embodied environment dynamics</li>
                <li>Temporal action sequences (not just individual actions) must be aligned for effective transfer to sequential decision-making tasks</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Language models pretrained on action-rich text (e.g., game walkthroughs, instruction manuals with explicit action verbs) should show 20-50% better transfer to embodied tasks than models pretrained on descriptive text, measured by sample efficiency to reach equivalent performance</li>
                <li>Introducing intermediate action representations (e.g., skill libraries, macro-actions) during pretraining should improve transfer by 30-60% compared to direct low-level action prediction, particularly for long-horizon tasks</li>
                <li>Action tokenization schemes that preserve semantic similarity (e.g., similar actions have similar token representations through learned embeddings) should transfer 15-30% better than arbitrary tokenization schemes</li>
                <li>Multi-level action hierarchies learned during pretraining should enable better compositional generalization to novel action sequences, with 40-70% higher success on unseen combinations compared to flat action representations</li>
                <li>Pretraining with action prediction objectives (like PREVALENT's AP) should improve downstream task performance by 10-20% compared to language-only pretraining, even when actions differ between pretraining and target tasks</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether learning action mappings through self-supervised objectives (e.g., predicting action effects from state transitions) during pretraining would be more effective than supervised action prediction, and by what margin</li>
                <li>Whether action-space alignment can be learned purely from observation (e.g., watching videos without action labels) without explicit action labels, and how this compares to supervised approaches in terms of sample efficiency and final performance</li>
                <li>Whether there exists an optimal level of action abstraction for transfer that balances semantic interpretability and motor precision, and whether this optimum varies systematically with task type</li>
                <li>Whether action representations learned from text can ever fully capture the continuous, high-dimensional nature of real-world motor control, or if there is a fundamental ceiling on performance</li>
                <li>Whether code-as-action representations (like Voyager) can scale to continuous control domains with appropriate API design, or if they are fundamentally limited to discrete action spaces</li>
                <li>Whether multi-modal action representations (combining language, code, and continuous vectors) would outperform single-modality approaches, and under what conditions</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Demonstrating successful transfer to embodied tasks using language models with completely misaligned action spaces (e.g., text describing visual scenes used to control a robot) without any bridging mechanism would challenge the necessity of action-space alignment</li>
                <li>Showing that random action mappings perform as well as semantically-meaningful mappings (within 5-10% performance) would challenge the importance of semantic alignment in action spaces</li>
                <li>Finding that increasing action-space alignment does not improve transfer performance (or improves it by less than 5%) across multiple task types would challenge the centrality of this factor</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that end-to-end learning from pixels to actions consistently outperforms hierarchical language-mediated approaches across all task types (including long-horizon tasks) would challenge the utility of language-based action decomposition</li>
                <li>Showing that language models without any action-related pretraining transfer as well as action-aware models would challenge the importance of action representations in pretraining</li>
                <li>Finding that direct action prediction during pretraining hurts rather than helps downstream transfer would challenge the value of action-aware pretraining</li>
            </ol>
