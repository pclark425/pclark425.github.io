                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Emergent Alignment of LLM-Generated Molecules with Application-Specific Constraints</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how large language models (LLMs) can synthesize novel chemicals for specific applications.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that large language models (LLMs), when trained on extensive chemical and application data, develop latent representations that encode both chemical structure and application-relevant features. When prompted, the LLM's generative process aligns the output molecules with the implicit or explicit constraints of the application, even when these constraints are not directly encoded in the training data. This alignment is an emergent property of the LLM's training and architecture, and can be modulated by prompt engineering or fine-tuning.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>LLMs may be able to align generated molecules with highly complex, multi-modal application constraints (e.g., 'molecule that is both a dye and a corrosion inhibitor') without explicit training.</li>
                <li>Prompt-driven alignment may enable LLMs to generate molecules for applications with no prior examples in the training data.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If prompt modifications do not lead to measurable changes in the application-relevant properties of generated molecules, the theory would be challenged.</li>
                <li>If latent space analysis does not reveal clustering by application features, the latent encoding law would be invalidated.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>

    <li>The theory does not address the synthetic accessibility or practical feasibility of the generated molecules. </li>
