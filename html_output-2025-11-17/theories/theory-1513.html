                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Functional Stable Coactivation Criterion for Concept Individuation (FSCCCI) – General Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the representational format of conceptual knowledge in brains at a functional (not neural) level.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that conceptual knowledge in brains is functionally individuated by the stable coactivation of distributed representational elements. A concept is defined as a set of features or sub-concepts whose coactivation pattern is reliably and selectively re-instantiated across contexts, tasks, and modalities. The stability and selectivity of this coactivation, rather than the specific neural substrate, is the functional criterion for individuating concepts. This theory provides a functional-level account, abstracting away from neural implementation, and predicts that concepts are best identified by their reproducible, context-invariant coactivation signatures.</p>

    <li>Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) in fMRI shows that distributed patterns corresponding to concepts are reliably reinstated across different tasks and modalities. </li>
    <li>Neuropsychological evidence indicates that damage to distributed feature representations can selectively impair conceptual knowledge. </li>
    <li>Cross-modal priming studies show that the same conceptual representation can be accessed via different sensory modalities, indicating a stable underlying coactivation pattern. </li>
    <li>Semantic dementia patients lose concepts in a graded fashion, consistent with the disruption of stable coactivation patterns rather than loss of single features. </li>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While related to distributed and connectionist models, this law formalizes a functional, context-invariant coactivation criterion for concept individuation, which is not explicitly present in prior work.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> The idea that concepts are distributed and can be identified by patterns of activation is present in connectionist and distributed semantic theories.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> The explicit criterion that stable, context-invariant coactivation is the functional basis for concept individuation, regardless of neural substrate, is novel.</p>

            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> This law is inspired by functionalist philosophy but operationalizes it in the context of conceptual representation via stable coactivation, which is a novel synthesis.</p>            <p><strong>What Already Exists:</strong> Functionalism in philosophy of mind posits that mental states are individuated by their functional roles, not their physical substrate.</p>            <p><strong>What is Novel:</strong> This law applies functional individuation specifically to the stable coactivation criterion for concepts, providing a concrete operationalization.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a novel concept is learned, a new stable coactivation pattern will emerge that is reliably reinstated across different tasks involving that concept.</li>
                <li>If a concept is contextually primed, the same coactivation pattern will be observed regardless of sensory modality (e.g., visual or auditory presentation).</li>
                <li>If a concept is forgotten or degraded, the stability of its coactivation pattern will decrease across contexts.</li>
                <li>Artificial neural networks trained on conceptual tasks will develop stable, distributed activation patterns corresponding to concepts.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a brain region supporting part of a coactivation pattern is lesioned, but the pattern is re-established elsewhere, conceptual knowledge will be preserved.</li>
                <li>Artificial systems trained to mimic human conceptual knowledge will develop stable coactivation patterns functionally equivalent to those in human brains, even if implemented differently.</li>
                <li>Highly abstract concepts may show less stable or more context-dependent coactivation patterns, challenging the criterion.</li>
                <li>If a concept is re-encoded using a radically different representational scheme (e.g., in a non-biological substrate), the same functional coactivation pattern will still individuate the concept.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If concepts can be reliably individuated without any stable coactivation pattern, the theory would be called into question.</li>
                <li>If the same coactivation pattern is not reinstated across different contexts for the same concept, the theory would be undermined.</li>
                <li>If neural or computational reorganization leads to loss of conceptual knowledge despite preservation of coactivation patterns, the theory would be challenged.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The role of temporal dynamics (e.g., oscillatory synchrony) in concept individuation is not explicitly addressed. </li>
    <li>The influence of emotional or motivational states on the stability of coactivation patterns is not considered. </li>
</ol>            <h3>Existing Theory Comparison</h3>
