                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Multidimensional, Task-Aligned, and Calibration-Aware Evaluation Theory (General Formulation)</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how to evaluate LLM-generated scientific theories.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the evaluation of LLM-generated scientific theories must be conducted across multiple, distinct dimensions (e.g., factual accuracy, logical coherence, novelty, task alignment, and calibration to uncertainty), and that only by integrating these dimensions in a task-specific and calibration-aware manner can the true scientific value and reliability of LLM outputs be assessed. The theory further asserts that evaluation metrics must be dynamically adapted to the intended scientific use-case, and that explicit modeling of uncertainty and calibration is necessary to avoid over- or under-confidence in LLM-generated scientific claims.</p>

                <li>Calibration-aware evaluation may reveal that some LLMs are better at self-assessing uncertainty in scientific reasoning than previously thought, especially after targeted fine-tuning.</li>

            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a single-dimensional evaluation (e.g., factuality only) produces the same ranking of LLM-generated scientific theories as a multidimensional, task-aligned, and calibration-aware evaluation, the theory's necessity is called into question.</li>
                <li>If calibration-aware evaluation does not improve the identification of reliable scientific theories from LLMs, the theory's claims about calibration are undermined.</li>
