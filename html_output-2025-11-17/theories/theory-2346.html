                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of the causes of Alzheimer's disease and effective detection methods.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory proposes that Alzheimer's disease is fundamentally a disorder of proteostasis, where the failure of protein quality control systems (autophagy, ubiquitin-proteasome, chaperones) leads to the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates (amyloid, tau, TDP-43, etc.). Early detection is possible by measuring proteostatic stress markers in CSF, blood, or via advanced imaging of protein clearance pathways.</p>
