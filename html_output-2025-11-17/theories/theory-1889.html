                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Prompt Format as a High-Dimensional Control Signal Theory</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of how problem presentation format affects LLM performance.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the format of a prompt acts as a high-dimensional control signal that modulates the internal computation pathways of large language models (LLMs), dynamically steering attention, memory retrieval, and reasoning strategies. The prompt's structure, style, and explicitness encode latent instructions that are decoded by the LLM to select among a repertoire of computational subroutines, thereby affecting performance, accuracy, and error modes.</p>

            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If a prompt is encoded in a novel, high-dimensional symbolic format (e.g., using structured markup or embeddings), the LLM may activate entirely new computation pathways, potentially enabling new capabilities.</li>
                <li>If prompt format is adversarially optimized, it may be possible to induce specific, targeted error modes or biases in LLM outputs.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>If LLMs show identical internal activations and outputs regardless of prompt format, this would falsify the theory.</li>
                <li>If changing prompt format does not alter error modes or performance on any task, the theory would be called into question.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Unaccounted for Evidence</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The effect of prompt format on LLMs trained with extensive instruction tuning may be less pronounced or more complex. </li>
