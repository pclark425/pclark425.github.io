                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory about hybrid declarative-imperative reasoning systems and their emergent properties, based on the following results.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> The granularity of integration between declarative and imperative components follows a multi-dimensional trade-off: finer-grained integration (e.g., neuron-level, loss-level, or joint message-passing) enables better mutual constraint satisfaction and can achieve higher performance on reasoning-heavy tasks, but increases training complexity, computational cost, and risks losing interpretability; coarser-grained integration (e.g., modular pipelines, API-level) maintains interpretability and modularity but may limit performance gains unless compensated by sophisticated training strategies (e.g., spectral regularization, two-phase training, adapter methods). The optimal granularity depends on task complexity, task structure (compositional vs. perceptual), available training data, computational constraints, and interpretability requirements. Importantly, training methodology can partially decouple integration granularity from performance, allowing some modular systems to achieve competitive or superior performance through careful design.</p>

            <h3>Theory Statements</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finer-grained integration (neuron-level, loss-level, joint message-passing) enables better performance through mutual constraint satisfaction and joint optimization, but increases training complexity, computational cost, and may reduce interpretability unless carefully designed (e.g., LNN's explicit neuron-to-formula mapping).</li>
                <li>Coarser-grained integration (modular pipelines, API-level) maintains interpretability and modularity but limits the degree of mutual adaptation between components, though this can be partially compensated by sophisticated training strategies (spectral regularization, two-phase training, adapter methods).</li>
                <li>The optimal integration granularity is task-dependent: perception-heavy tasks may benefit from coarser integration with strong perception modules, while reasoning-heavy tasks requiring mutual constraint satisfaction benefit from finer integration.</li>
                <li>End-to-end differentiability through symbolic components is difficult to achieve without approximation or relaxation, creating a fundamental trade-off between symbolic exactness and trainability, though some approaches (VSAIT, PrAE) achieve differentiable symbolic operations.</li>
                <li>Systems with intermediate granularity (e.g., attention-based injection, graph-level fusion, loss-level integration) often achieve good balance between performance and interpretability, avoiding extremes of both tight coupling and complete modularity.</li>
                <li>Training methodology (spectral regularization, two-phase training, adapter-based fine-tuning) can partially decouple integration granularity from performance, allowing modular systems to achieve competitive results.</li>
                <li>The granularity-performance relationship is modulated by model scale: very large models (e.g., 100B+ parameter LLMs) can achieve strong performance even with very coarse integration (e.g., text-based prompting).</li>
                <li>Computational efficiency considerations often favor coarser integration, as fine-grained integration can create runtime bottlenecks (e.g., NVSA's symbolic stage consuming 92% of runtime).</li>

</ol>            <h3>New Predictions (Likely outcome)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Hybrid systems with adjustable integration granularity (coarse during early training for stability, fine during later training for performance) will achieve better performance-interpretability trade-offs than fixed-granularity systems.</li>
                <li>For tasks requiring strict logical guarantees, coarse-grained integration with symbolic verification will outperform fine-grained approximations that sacrifice exactness for differentiability.</li>
                <li>Multi-level integration (coarse for high-level reasoning, fine for low-level perception) will outperform single-level integration on complex hierarchical tasks that require both robust perception and structured reasoning.</li>
                <li>Modular systems trained with spectral regularization or similar complexity-control methods will achieve performance closer to fine-grained systems while maintaining interpretability advantages.</li>
                <li>Adapter-based integration methods (like LoRA) will provide a sweet spot for many tasks, enabling fine-grained parameter updates while maintaining modular architecture.</li>
                <li>For tasks with strong compositional structure, modular integration with explicit intermediate representations will show better OOD generalization than end-to-end fine-grained integration.</li>
                <li>As model scale increases, the performance gap between coarse and fine-grained integration will decrease, with very large models achieving strong performance even with API-level integration.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>New Predictions (Unknown outcome/high-entropy)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Whether there exists a 'sweet spot' integration granularity that achieves near-optimal performance across diverse task types without task-specific tuning, or whether optimal granularity is fundamentally task-dependent.</li>
                <li>Whether advances in differentiable programming and symbolic operation approximation can eliminate the trade-off between symbolic exactness and end-to-end trainability, enabling fine-grained integration without sacrificing logical guarantees.</li>
                <li>Whether very large-scale hybrid systems (e.g., 1T+ parameters) can maintain interpretability advantages of coarse-grained integration while achieving performance of fine-grained integration through emergent reasoning capabilities.</li>
                <li>Whether meta-learning approaches can automatically discover optimal integration granularity for new tasks, potentially learning to adjust granularity dynamically during training or inference.</li>
                <li>Whether quantum computing or neuromorphic hardware could change the computational cost trade-offs, making fine-grained integration more practical at scale.</li>
                <li>Whether there are fundamental limits to how much training methodology can compensate for coarse integration, or whether sufficiently sophisticated training can always close the performance gap.</li>
                <li>Whether hybrid systems with multiple integration granularities operating in parallel (ensemble of coarse and fine-grained integrations) would outperform single-granularity systems.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Negative Experiments</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finding that fine-grained integration consistently maintains interpretability as well as coarse-grained integration across diverse tasks would challenge the interpretability trade-off aspect of the theory.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that coarse-grained integration can achieve equivalent performance to fine-grained integration through better component design alone (without sophisticated training strategies) would question the necessity of tight coupling.</li>
                <li>Showing that integration granularity has no systematic effect on performance across diverse tasks (i.e., performance is determined entirely by component quality) would invalidate the core trade-off principle.</li>
                <li>Finding that computational cost does not increase with integration granularity (e.g., through efficient implementation techniques) would challenge the computational trade-off aspect.</li>
                <li>Demonstrating that training methodology cannot compensate for coarse integration (i.e., spectral regularization, two-phase training provide no benefit) would challenge the theory's nuance about training strategies.</li>
                <li>Finding that very large models do not reduce the performance gap between coarse and fine integration would challenge the scale-dependent predictions.</li>
                <li>Showing that modular systems never achieve better OOD generalization than fine-grained systems would challenge the compositional generalization predictions.</li>
