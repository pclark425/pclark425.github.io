                <p><strong>Name:</strong> Theory of Prompt-Task Alignment as a Limiting Factor in LLM Scientific Simulation</p>
                <p><strong>Type:</strong> general</p>
                <p><strong>Theory Query:</strong> Build a theory of factors affecting the accuracy of using large language models (LLMs) as text-based simulators for specific scientific subdomains.</p>
                <p><strong>Description:</strong> This theory posits that the degree of alignment between the structure of prompts (including demonstrations) and the underlying structure of the scientific task is a primary determinant of LLM simulation accuracy. When the prompt structure closely mirrors the cognitive and procedural structure of the scientific subdomain, LLMs are more likely to produce accurate and reliable simulations. Misalignment, such as mismatched abstraction levels, omitted steps, or inappropriate task framing, systematically reduces simulation fidelity.</p>
